    ANALYSIS OF THE INFLUENCE OF LAND GOVERNANCE ON JOB CREATION
                  IN MINDANAO (MIN-LGAF AND JOBS)1


1.0 Introduction and Overview
The World Bank is preparing a Mindanao Jobs Report (MJR) that aims to better understand the
jobs challenge and identify recommendations on how to create more and better jobs in the
region.2 The MJR represents the regional analysis of the Philippine Development Report (PDR)
Creating More and Better Jobs3 which identified key constraints and recommended an agenda
for sustaining inclusive growth and addressing the jobs challenge.

The PDR acknowledged that among the factors that hindered the creation of more and better
jobs - weaknesses in land governance play a key role. Central to this is insecure property
rights which have undermined incentives to private investments and, combined with low public
investment, has reduced agricultural productivity and increased food prices. This is one of the
root causes which slowed the structural transformation process in the agriculture sector which
in turn prevented it from contributing to creative job destruction – that is unleashing excess
labor from the rural sector to better paying and more productive jobs in the urban centers.

The large extent of untitled lands that are devoted to residential uses also stymies land market
activity, and prevents the claimant from fully accessing formal credit for property development,
or acts as disincentives to invest in making the land more productive.

The reactive nature of land use planning and zoning , results in the proliferation of informal
settlement enclaves, uncontrolled spatial development, and undue pressure on public
investments and public provision of services.

On property valuation and taxation, the need to rationalize the property tax system and
outdated schedule of market values at LGUs have been identified as constraining the generation
of much needed revenues to fuel inclusive growth; and attain more equitable tax burden.

In terms of promoting investments, the overly bureaucratic and centralized procedures in
the country’s land administration system create a weak collateral system thereby limiting
access to finance.

The weak system of securing long-term property rights on land (through such forms as
ownership, lease, patents, or other usufruct rights) affects the country’s ability to attract foreign
direct investments, limits opportunities for investors to access finance.

Most of the above issues have been expounded through the Land Governance Assessment
Framework (LGAF) which was carried out in 2013.4 In responding to the needs of the MJR, a
more focused assessment of land governance issues in Mindanao was carried out utilizing the
LGAF process and methodology.

For purposes of this study, the following definitions were adopted:


1 For a summary version, please refer to the Synthesis Report of this study.
2 In the context of this report, and the Min-LGAF Jobs Study, jobs mean what people do to make a living. It can be
wage work or self-employment. It can be formal or informal work. Good jobs are those that raise living standards and
productivity, and improve social cohesion. Jobs are the most important manifestation of inclusive growth. (Concept
Note – MJR).

Governance – “the manner in which public officials and institutions acquire and exercise the
authority to shape public policy and provide public goods and services.” 5

Land governance – “includes the ways property rights to land (for groups and individuals) are
defined and can be exchanged and transformed; the way in which public oversight over land
use, land management, and taxation is exercised; the type of land that is state owned; the way
such land is managed, acquired, and disposed of; the nature and quality of land ownership
information available to the public and the ease with which it can be accessed or modified; and
the way in which disputes are resolved and conflict is managed.”6

1.2      Objectives and Scope of the Min LGAF Jobs Study

The study “Analysis of Influence of Land Governance and Employment Creation in Mindanao”
(herein referred to as Min-LGAF and Jobs) aims to contribute to the analytical work that was
carried out under the MJR through a more focused assessment of land governance in Mindanao.
The take off point was the Philippines LGAF Report7 mainly to set the policy and institutional
climate, while working with Mindanao data, to assess the various indicators. As expected, the
assessment differed between Mindanao and the Philippines in some indicators due to the
unique socio economic and cultural framework prevailing in the region; as well as the historical
and political context of land administration and management therein. It should also be noted
that the indicators have been revised following the completion of the Philippines LGAF, and
were therefore assessed accordingly.

The study was guided by the following hypotheses:

Land investments create jobs. Investments flow when lands are free of encumbrances, where
tenure rights are recognized and enforced, land market transactions are open and transparent,
disputes are fairly and quickly settled, and land management and administration is efficient and
effective. Moreover, good land governance creates a policy environment that stimulates economic
activities among local investors and rights holders - for them to access credit and invest in business
undertakings that generate jobs.

The revised LGAF covers nine modules, 27 dimensions and 117 indicators (Table 1).

The assessment covered the following:

Land Rights Recognition – examined the policies and practice in recognition of a continuum of
rights held by individuals; as well as the extent to which these are respected and enforced. It
also looked at individual and group rights to land and natural resources.

Rights to Forest and Common Lands & Rural Land Use Regulations - assessed the process of
legalization and codification of rights and ownership to forestlands and other resources,
including customary rights to forest and common lands. It also assessed the extent to which
land use and management regulations in rural areas (including zoning and land use planning
mechanisms) are justified and transparent.

Urban Land Use, Planning and Development - examined restrictions on land rights and whether
these are conditional on adherence to unrealistic standards. It also looked at transparency in
land use and management regulations - whether these provide significant benefits to society,
and not just for specific groups. It also looked at the efficiency of land use planning in major
cities; the speed and predictability of enforcement of restricted land uses, and whether
development permits are granted promptly and predictably. Finally, it reviewed the tenure
regularization scheme in urban areas.

Management of Public Land - assessed the extent to which public landholdings are justified and
transparently inventoried and managed; whether expropriation procedures are applied in the
public interest through clear, transparent, and fair processes involving the compensation of all
those who lose rights; and justification and time efficiency of acquisition processes: that is,
whether the state expropriates land only for overall public interest and the extent to which this
is done efficiently.

Transfers of Large Tracts of Land to Investors – reviewed whether transfer of public land to
private use follows a clear, transparent and competitive process and whether payments are
collected and audited. It also looked at private investment strategy and whether policies and
regulations are in place and applied to unambiguously and publicly identify land that can be
made available to investors, in agreement with land rights holders. Other indicators measure
the effectiveness, consistency and transparency of policy implementation, as well as whether
contracts are made public, easily accessible, and monitoring and enforcement of agreements.

Public Provision of Land Information – determined whether land information systems provide
sufficient, relevant, and up- to-date data on land ownership to the general public and
accessibility, affordability, and sustainability of land administration services.



                                                                                               3
Land Valuation and Taxation - investigated the transparency of valuations for tax and
compensation purposes, and whether these are applied uniformly, updated regularly and
publicly accessible. It also looked at efficiency in collection of land and property taxes.

Dispute Resolution and Conflict Management – assessed whether responsibility for conflict
management at different levels is clearly assigned, in line with actual practice, relevant bodies
are competent in applicable legal matters, and decisions can be appealed against. It also
measured the proportion of land affected by pending conflicts and trends over the years.

This study did not assess the dimensions associated with the institutional and legal framework
since national laws and policies are the same between the Philippines and Mindanao.
Nonetheless, a discussion was made of the implications of these to land governance in
Mindanao. The assessment of legal and institutional framework – covers: (i) clarity of mandates
and practice; and (ii) equity and non-discrimination in the decision making process that draws
inputs from all concerned. With respect to the first indicator, the assessment determines
whether institutional mandates concerning regulation and management of the land sector are
clearly defined, duplication of responsibilities is avoided and information is shared as needed.
On the other hand, the second indicator examines whether the legal framework is non-
discriminatory and that institutions to enforce property rights are equally accessible to all.

1.3     LGAF Process

The Min-LGAF and Jobs Study followed the process of the LGAF which involved:
    Review of indicators, dimensions and definitions
    Preparation of Tenure Typology, Institutional Mapping, and Expert Investigations
    Panel Workshops
    Preparation of Panel Aide Memoire and Draft Report

Review of LGAF Definition of Terms, Indicators and Dimensions, and Data Sources

Based on the review by the Study Team, explanatory notes on some LGAF definition of terms
were made, particularly in the context of Philippine laws and statutes.

The review of LGAF indicators enabled the identification of dimensions that are important for
the analytical work required for the MJR. The possible sources of data for all the indicators and
dimensions were likewise determined.

Preparation of Tenure Typology, Institutional Mapping and Expert Investigations

The team set out to review the tenure typology that was prepared for the Philippines LGAF and
updated it to suit the Mindanao situation. Alongside with this, an assessment of the legal
framework for land tenure in the Philippines was made, and assessed against implementation in
Mindanao. The report was made available to the World Bank team who participated in the panel
workshops to serve as background paper for the Mindanao LGAF.

Investigation of indicators and dimensions were allocated among the team members as shown
in Table 2.

Administrative data were collected from the agencies, websites, and other official sources. To
the extent that no data are available, these were supplemented by interviews and meetings to
discuss the various topics. Particularly useful was the briefing for DAR Undersecretary, who
provided the much needed updated data on status of CARP implementation in Mindanao. The
team also did a lot of research on literature and related studies, to reinforce the assessments of
various dimensions.

The Expert investigations produced background papers for each Module and suggested scores
for each dimension, supported with analysis. These were distributed to the panels and used as
reference during the Workshops.

Panel Workshops

Four panels were constituted to present the preliminary analysis, subject these to validation
and additional inputs by independent Experts, government representatives and practitioners.
These reviews were organized in early December 2015, centered around related themes.

Panel members include representatives from government agencies, private sector, professional
organizations, local government, NGOs, and indigenous peoples. The presence of Secretary Gil
de los Reyes of DAR in Panels 1 and 2 provided for a more insightful discussion of the issues,
current initiatives to address these, and the possible solutions.

During the workshop, the World Bank presented the context of the MJR and the evolving
storyline, both for the agrarian and urbanizing Mindanao. The Min – LGAF and Jobs Study was
also discussed, in terms of how the study will deepen the analysis of the land governance
dimension of the MJR.

Experts presented backgrounders on the Modules and the associated issues, after which the
relevant indicators and dimensions were discussed. The active participation of members
enabled excellent discourse on the dimensions being reviewed, where they first considered the

Preparation of Panel Aide Memoire and Draft Report, Validation Workshops

The Panel Workshops were documented in Aide Memoire and submitted to the World Bank. A
Synthesis Report was prepared in January and presented at a session in Manila, together with
the results of other background studies on MJR. A validation workshop was held in Davao and
Cagayan de Oro in March, and the results presented again in July 2016 with MINDA officials and
staff.

The main findings were incorporated in the MJR, where the Team provided inputs and
comments to the main report.

2.0 Historical and socio political context of land in
    Mindanao
Land governance is of particular interest to Mindanao because it is perceived as a driver in
unlocking its economic potential that has constrained not only the island’s development but also
that of national progress.

Mindanao is endowed with rich natural resources of vast plains in varying altitudes having
fertile soils and relatively free from typhoons. Thus, its economic contribution has been mostly
in agriculture and agribusiness, becoming a world exporter of a number of agricultural
products.

These abundant resources, however, have not been maximized due to overlapping and
competing land claims, weak governance and low institutional capacities. These challenges have
also contributed to high incidence of poverty in these areas. For the period 2006-2012, five of
the country’s 10 poorest provinces were in Mindanao, with Lanao de Sur having the highest
poverty incidence at 67.3%.9

In the formulation of Mindanao 2020 - the peace and development framework of the Mindanao
Development Authority (MinDA), management of land, environment and natural resources is
one of the key guiding principles identified in moving the island forward. But the task ahead on
land governance is not simply an administrative or a management problem. These land issues,
often resulting in conflicts and violence, trace their roots to social injustices in the colonial past.
Improving land governance, therefore, will have to be grasped from a historical and broader
socio-cultural perspective.

2.1      Brief Settlement History of Mindanao

Mindanao was the destination of migrant Filipinos from Luzon and the Visayas in the last
century starting in the early 1900s and picking up after World War II. This movement of people
is partly explained by the abundance of unoccupied and unutilized land until the late 1800s as
the Muslim community successfully resisted Spanish domination of Mindanao. The island
remained isolated from the Spanish control after more than 300 years of occupation.10

This situation, however, changed when the Philippines was ceded to the Americans under the
Treaty of Paris in 1898. The Americans were able to neutralize the resistance and contained the
rebellions. “By I9I6, the Moros had been disarmed, the threat of attack had been greatly
reduced, and during the following year, the United States military forces were withdrawn
leaving the administration of the Island in the hands of the local civil authorities” 11.

Though not fully subdued, it ushered a relatively peaceful environment. With a more democratic
governance system supported by Christian Filipinos, Mindanao was unlocked to local settlers as
well as foreign investors12.

The extent of migration can be observed in the increase in population density from 1900 to
2000 (Table 4). In 1898, Mindanao was reported to have a population of 500,000 and a

10 As an indication of this resistance, friar lands distributed in Mindanao was limited to only 41.1 hectares out of the
total of 10,000 hectares distributed for the entire country (from DENR Consolidated Land Sector Report, December
31, 2014).

2.2       Facilitating Factors

The ever-increasing land settlement in Mindanao is an outcome of numerous factors. It is partly
political as the Philippine Government wanted to defuse the rebellion in the north triggered by
farmers’ clamor for greater and more equitable access to land resources. Partly, it is economic
as the utilization of rich land and natural resources provided business and substantial returns
given the demand for food and agricultural products.

Institution of New Land Laws and Systems

Anchored on the Regalian doctrine where all lands are declared to be the property of the state,
the Americans introduced the Torrens System of land registration. One of the first acts along
this direction was the enactment by the US Congress for the Philippine Commission of the Public
Lands Act of 1903, “an act prescribing rules and regulations governing the homesteading, selling,
and leasing of portions of the public domain of the Philippine islands including issuance of patents
without compensation to certain native settlers”. This act, together with the succeeding laws,
provided the legal framework for the extensive land occupation in Mindanao.

The Public Lands Act of 1903 did not only streamline homesteading but facilitated the entry of
investors by allowing them to “lease any tract of unoccupied, unreserved, non mineral
agricultural public lands . . . not exceeding one thousand and twenty-four hectares .”

The limit of 1,024 hectares was imposed by the US Congress and “was a compound of altruism
and the desires of beet and cane sugar interests in the United States to forestall Philippine
competition. The limit on size of holdings precluded the development of large plantations on
Mindanao and, quite probably, served to hold the population growth of the Island to levels well
below what they might have been otherwise”15.

Land Settlement Programs

Though settlers would have to contend with sporadic rebellions and continuing resistance of
Muslim communities, Mindanao’s abundant resources easily attracted migrants. Starting in the

1940s, the Philippine Commission instituted resettlement policies and programs to facilitate the
movement of migrants from Luzon and the Visayas.

In line with this, a number of resettlement agencies were established starting with the National
Land Settlement Administration (NLSA) that operated from 1939 to 1950. Though temporarily
suspended during World War II (WWII), it was able to resettle 8,300 families. The Land
Settlement and Development Corporation (LASEDECO) that resettled 1,500 families followed
NLSA. Then finally, the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA)
covered around 250,000 hectares involving some 69,000 individuals. It established six
settlement areas located at Tubod (Lanao del Norte), Wao (Lanao del Sur), Maramag
(Bukidnon), Santo Tomas (Davao) and at Carmen and Tulunan (Cotabato)16.

Between the 1948 and I960 census enumerations, “the population of Mindanao grew from less
than three million to slightly more than five million persons, giving the island a rate of
population increase more than double the national average”.17

Moreover, voluntary migration from the Visayas followed. Migrants from the Visayan area came
mainly from Cebu, followed by Bohol, Leyte and Iloilo. The magnitude and the long historical
contact between the Visayas and Mindanao may explain why Cebuano is the established mother
tongue in many of the provinces in Mindanao.

By 2000, Christian Filipinos constituted over 70% of the population in Mindanao. The Muslims
constituted 19.9% while the indigenous communities 8.2%. Muslims have been confined to
ARMM where they comprise 89.1% of the population.

Entry of Agribusiness Corporations

A few years after the enactment of the Public Land Act of 1903, abaca (Manila hemp)
corporations started operations in Davao province with Japanese capital. “By I935, 16,000
Japanese lived in Davao province and Japanese corporations controlled an estimated I41,000
acres of abaca land. Several coconut plantations were established on the periphery of the Island

and, in 1926, the Philippine Packing Corporation (Del Monte) established a pineapple plantation
on leased land in Bukidnon.”18

The second half of the century marked the entry of more agribusiness corporations to Mindanao
partly assisted by the government. The National Development Company (NDC), a state-owned
company via Commonwealth Act 182 mandated to function as the government's investment
arm, leased out to Philippine Packing Corporation 8,195 hectares of land in Bukidnon for
pineapple production19. Over the years, NDC continued its agricultural engagement and did the
same for Dole Philippines for banana plantation and NDC Guthrie for oil palm.

Today, it is reported that “agricultural plantations, mostly owned by transnational corporations
(TNCs) and primarily geared to export markets, occupy almost 500,000 hectares, or 12% of
Mindanao’s agricultural land. They produce rubber, cavendish bananas, pineapple, palm oil,
cacao, and sugarcane”.20

2.3      Land Governance Issues and Challenges

As in the situation in the entire country, land governance in Mindanao is plagued with a
multitude of issues including problematic titling, fraudulent transactions, unregistered informal
transactions, boundary disputes, competing claims, overlapping agency jurisdictions and slow
resolution of land disputes. These will be discussed in more detail in the subsequent reports,
but a brief description of these issues is presented here.

What makes land governance more complex and intricate in Mindanao is the long history of
colonization and domination that have resulted in unjust land appropriation and dislocation of
original occupants without clear and just resolutions. The problem is political that has to be
resolved politically. Mindanawons,21 in general, have this feeling of discontent of being
neglected by what they call the “Imperial Manila”.

On top of this is the current increasing commercial pressures on land brought about by big
agricultural and mining investments that have displaced or deprived farmers and indigenous
communities of their subsistence and livelihood.

Overlapping Laws, Agency Jurisdictions and Weak Institutional Capacities

Land governance issues in the country specifically of competing claims, overlapping
jurisdictions of land agencies and inadequacy in implementing rules and regulations are
reflected in the local situation. A policy review on land governance conducted by the Regional
Land Use Committee of the Regional Development Council in Northern Mindanao (Region 10)
highlights these concerns: absence of precision mapping and cadastral surveys, lack of common
base map, issuance of mother certificate of land ownership agreement (CLOAs) over
timberlands, forest reserves and pasture areas and creation of LGUs within timberlands or
protected areas.

It also identified various issues related to the enactment of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act
(IPRA, RA 8371) such as overlapping jurisdictions, conflicting registration of titles, and approval
of boundary surveys.

Customary Rights Overlapping with Legal Rights

At the core of these problems is the continuing claim of the Muslims and the indigenous
communities for self-determination to practice their own system of governance including that of
governing land and other resources. They have held to their own traditional system and
practice of customary rights.

Though there are indications among the Muslims that this is changing as may be gleaned from
the recent Comprehensive Agreement for Bangsamoro (CAB), there are unmet demands for
reparations for lands taken away from them either forcefully or by some legal maneuverings
that they do not recognize in the first place.

Increasing Commercial Pressures on Land

The growing investments in agriculture have intensified competition for lands. Though the
entry of corporations had been recorded in the early years of the last century, these investments
are increasing with the greater demand for food and the liberalization of the economy.
Unfortunately, these investments are replete with stories of forced evictions, displacement of
communities and deprivation of livelihood of local residents.

Similarly, mining investments are growing as indicated by the long list of mining applications.
Many of these mining operations, unfortunately, overlap with the ancestral domain of
indigenous communities and government policies over these resources have inherent
contradictions. As reported in MinDA 2020, “provisions of IPRA and the Philippine Mining Act of
1995 disagree with respect to the mandated processes and the authority over resource permits
and land use development.”22

3.0 Overview of Land Tenure and Land Allocation in
    Mindanao
Recognition of and respect for existing rights to land, natural resources and property improves
tenure security. Both legal frameworks and informal tenure systems can provide tenure
security depending on the strength of and adherence to tenure systems and related
institutions.23

The 1987 Philippine Constitution declared that all lands of the public domain belong to the State
(Art. 7, Sec. 2). State ownership is premised on the Regalian Doctrine (jura regalia), the legal
concept employed by the Spanish Crown in claiming exclusive dominion over the Philippine
archipelago upon conquest in 1521. Under this doctrine, title to all lands became vested in the
Crown, and private ownership was acquired only through royal grants or decrees. This was
continued during United States (US) colonization, the Philippine Commonwealth period under
the 1935 Constitution, and subsequently reiterated in the 1973 and 1987 Constitutions. The
Constitution classified the public domain into agricultural, forest or timber, mineral lands or
national parks (Art. 7, Sec. 3). Of these, only public agricultural lands may be alienated (i.e.,
subject of private ownership) and further classified by law according to use (Art. 7, Sec. 3).

The Civil Code of the Philippines (Republic Act 386) provides the general controlling guidelines
on property ownership including guidelines governing the leases and rentals of urban and rural
lands.

On November 6, 1902, the Philippine Commission enacted Act 496 known as the Land
Registration Act that established the Torren’s System of Registration in the Philippines. The
Cadastral Act (Act 2259) was enacted on February 11, 1913 and provided for compulsory
registration of land titles with private ownership. The enactment of the Public Land Act of
1936, otherwise known as Commonwealth Act 141 provided measures by which public
agricultural lands can be disposed or alienated through homestead, free patent (by
prescription), sale or leases.

The 1988 Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) broadened the scope of rural land
reform by including private and public agricultural lands regardless of crops and tenure
arrangements, and providing for support services to agrarian reform beneficiaries. DAR’s
Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) operation was primarily in the acquisition
and redistribution of private agricultural lands.         However, through Joint DAR-DENR
Memorandum Circular 14 and 19 in 1997, the agency also acquired jurisdiction over public A&D
agricultural lands that are in excess of the allowed retention limits. For lands with tenants but
not covered by CARP, DAR’s leasehold operation provides opportunity for formalizing land
owner – tenant relationships through a leasehold contract.

Customary ownership rights over ancestral lands are recognized in the Constitution and
Indigenous Peoples’ Rights Act (IPRA) – RA 8371.

While forest lands cannot be alienated or disposed, Presidential Decree 705 or the Revised
Forestry Code of the Philippines (and subsequent administrative issuances) provide for a
regime of recognition and formalization of occupation and use in public forest through a variety
of instruments such as Certificate of Stewardship Contract (CSC), Community Based Forest
Management Agreements (CBFMA), Industrial Forest Management Agreement (IFMA),
Socialized IFMA (SIFMA). The National Integrated Areas Protected Systems (NIPAS) Act on the
other hand, provide for the recognition of tenure of protected area occupants through Protected

Area Community Based Resource Management Agreements (PACBARMA). Tenure holders are
given long term access rights to forest lands, its resources and protected area resources usually
for 25 years, renewable for another 25 years.

The table below indicates that the current legal infrastructure provides for recognition of rights
of both urban and rural population, either through customary or statutory tenure regime.

         immediate farm household in consideration of which the former agrees to share the harvest with the latter or to pay a price
         certain or ascertainable, whether in produce or in money, or both.” (RA 1199 [1954], sec. 3)


The distinction between A&D and non A&D is important because only the former can be
privately owned and titled. Figure 1 shows the modes of disposition and use of lands of the
public domain. Table 9 on the other hand, presents the summary accounting of lands, the
agencies involved in disposition and management, and the policies that govern these.

The entire island of Mindanao encompasses some 10.2 Million hectares, roughly 34% of the
country’s total land area. The proportion of alienable and disposable (A&D) lands is smaller at
only 4.1 Million hectares, while its forestlands comprise 6.06 Million hectares, or with a ratio of
roughly 40:60. In the Philippines, the proportion of A&D to forestlands is 47:53. There remains
some 414,913 hectares of unclassified public forest in Mindanao, which is about 55% of the
entire country’s record. These lands have to undergo further survey and validation to
determine if these need to be released as A&D or should be retained as part of the forestlands.

Figure 2 presents the land classification map in Mindanao.

Region XII has the largest area of unclassified forestlands (218,000 hectares) followed by ARMM
with 94,673 hectares. The top provinces with the biggest areas of unclassified forestlands are
listed below. Altogether, these provinces account for 86.2% of all unclassified lands in
Mindanao, or 47.4% of all such lands in the country.

3.1     Forestlands

Forestlands are part of the public domain where the DENR has main management
responsibility. In Mindanao, classified forests constitute almost 60% of the total land area,
which makes land and resource utilization a challenge in promoting investments and inclusive
economic growth. Resource use rights are administered through a system of granting long-term
tenure rights to corporations, organized communities and upland households, and long-term
leases for industrial forest management, as well as growing of other commercial crops such as
rubber and oil palm.

The accounting of forestlands (Table 11) revealed that in the Philippines, 3.38 million hectares
are essentially under open access conditions, meaning there are no designated forest manager
or entity/organization tasked to ensure sustainable management of forestlands. This is quite
huge, constituting about 11.2% of the nation’s land area.

The vast extent of the Mindanao region’s forest area and resources are evident in the following:
    Almost 700,000 hectares of forestlands are covered by industrial forest management
       agreements, mainly by corporations. This figure represents 65% of the total area
       covered under IFMA in the Philippines;
    One quarter of all remaining forestland grazing agreements are in Mindanao;
    More than 800,000 hectares of forestlands are managed under community based forest
       management agreements, making this program an essential component of poverty
       reduction, sustainable forest management and economic growth. These areas constitute
       50% of forestlands covered by CBFMAs in the country.
    More than 700,000 hectares of forestlands are not covered by any form of tenure
       instrument (see notes)
    There remains more than 400,000 hectares of unclassified public forests in Mindanao.
       Immediate attention to complete the delineation of final forest line is essential to
       determine the appropriate management regime for these lands.

Although forestlands cannot be alienated, the weak management and protection by DENR has
resulted in the de facto conversion of forest areas into agricultural uses, as well as the expansion
of settlements, barangay centers and local governments in the uplands. There are no
comprehensive estimates of the population occupying the forest lands, national parks and other
portions of the public domain. In 2000, it was estimated that some 20 Million Filipinos,
representing about 26% of the country’s population, live in the uplands 26. In the 1980s, a more
comprehensive study was undertaken which estimated that about one third of the population
live in the uplands.27

3.2    Terrestrial Protected Areas or National Parks

Mindanao is rich in biodiversity, harboring a wide array of ecosystems that are
important habitats of globally important species. The region is the site of the following
identified biodiversity corridors:
    • Eastern Mindanao
    • Central Mindanao
    • Kitanglad-Ligawasan
    • Malindang
    • Zamboanga Peninsula

Thus, there are 62 protected areas that have been established in Mindanao, covering a
total of 1.425 Million hectares. These represent about 26% of the country’s established
protected areas. Considering the wide distribution of key biodiversity areas (KBAs) in
Mindanao that have not yet been established as PAs, it is reasonable to expect this
number and area to increase.

Protected areas established through the NIPAS are off limits to mining, except if they
have secured prior rights before PA establishment. PAs are also not to be alienated, as
part of the public domain or protected estate. Communities however, who have been
occupying portions of protected areas are given long term tenurial instruments called
PCBARMA provided they meet the criteria of number of years of stay prior to PA
establishment.

Protected areas can also support socio economic activities or investments, as magnets of
ecotourism. Designated zones within protected areas can be used for development
purposes provided these are consistent with the PA management plan. Users are given
special use agreements in protected areas (SAPA) to undertake selected activities within

PAs, provided certain fees are paid, as approved by the Protected Area Management
Board (PAMB).

By virtue of their locations, many PAs also overlap with ancestral domain claims or
CADTs of indigenous peoples. A Joint DENR-NCIP Memorandum Circular has been
issued recognizing IP rights within protected areas. Moreover, the recent approach to
recognize indigenous community conserved areas (ICCAs) within IP domains has
addressed the long- standing tensions between IPs and PA establishment.

The DENR, through the National Mapping and Resources Information Authority
(NAMRIA), is conducting delineation and mapping of all PA boundaries in order to
clearly identify the PAs on the map, and serve as tool for appropriate management and
zoning. Boundaries of PAs that have been established through legislation under the
National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS – Republic Act 7586) can be
demarcated on the ground. In the Philippines, there are only thirteen such legislated
PAs, five of which are in Mindanao. These are: Mt. Malindang National Park; Mt.
Kitanglad National Park; Mimbilisan Protected Landscape; Mt. Apo Natural Park; and Mt.
Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary34.

3.3     Mineral lands

More than half of the estimated mineral wealth of the Philippines is found in Mindanao,
where almost 50% of gold and 65% of nickel reserves of the country are located. 35

The manner of mineral exploration and development is done through the issuance of
mineral production sharing agreements (MPSAs), Financial or Technical Assistance
Agreements (FTAAs), and Exploration Permits (EPs) issued by the DENR Mines and
Geosciences Bureau (MGB). Small-scale mining operations are also widely practiced,
though the LGUs are given the authority to issue permits through the Provincial Mining
Regulatory Board (PMRC).

In 2014, the Mindanao region has 117 mining tenements, which is 30% of the country’s
total. Figure 4 shows the distribution of mining tenements in Mindanao.

Region 13 hosts the most number and covers almost half the area under MPSAs in
Mindanao. In Dinagat islands for example, there are 19 MPSAs, mostly located in
identified mining reservation. Both Surigao del Sur and Surigao del Norte have twelve
approved MPSAs each. This is consistent with the findings that the eastern seaboard is
particularly rich in mineral resources.

Conflicts in resource use have erupted in mining areas, particularly between indigenous
peoples, local governments and mining companies. Failure to properly secure Free Prior
and Informed Consent (FPIC) from IP communities have always been cited as an issue,
and/or lack of clarity as to the real IP leaders who should be consulted and give their
consent. In other areas, LGUs have issued local Ordinances declaring mining
moratorium. Moreover, conflicts with biodiversity conservation objectives have been
raised as serious concerns, in light of the overlaps between KBAs or biodiversity rich
areas and presence of rich mining deposits. These have caused instability in the mining
industry and placed current and potential investments at risk.

Executive Order 79 has been issued to resolve these concerns, whereby among others,
protected areas have been declared as no go zones for mining. However, this does not
take into account potential new PAs such as biodiversity rich Dinagat islands which is
now practically covered by approved MPSAs.

The government likewise implemented policy reforms in the mining sector through EO
79. Among the key features of the enhanced policy include:

      Performance review of existing mining operations and cleansing of non-moving
       mining rights holders;
      Freeze in granting of mineral agreements pending new legislation on revenue
       sharing;
      Grant of mining rights thru competitive public bidding;
      Declaring abandoned ores and tailings as assets of the State for bidding;
      Development of downstream industries for the mineral sector;
      Constituting the Cabinet-level Mining Industry Coordinating Council;
      Rationalizing small-scale mining activities;
      Addressing conflicts between Local Ordinances and national laws;
      Creating a One Stop Shop for all mining applications;
      Joining the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative;
      Creation of a decentralized database for the mining industry;
      Creation of an integrated map system for mining;
      Creation of an anti-illegal mining Task Force; and
      Use of Programmatic Environmental Impact Assessment in mining.

3.4    Ancestral Domains

The recognition of customary rights by indigenous peoples communities (IPs) is
strongly protected by the Constitution and more specifically through the Indigenous
Peoples Rights Act (IPRA). The National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) has
undertaken a program of survey, mapping and registration of ancestral domains with
the aim of issuing a certificate of ancestral domain title (CADT). Since the program
started in 2002, a total of 159 CADTs have been approved and registered covering 4.392
million hectares involving 921,918 IP population. When combined with 257 certificates
of ancestral land titles (CALTs), covering some 17,293 hectares; these represent about
56% of the total area occupied by some 12-15 million IPs in the Philippines. More
detailed discussion on this is presented in section 4 – Module 1.

4.0 Assessment of Land Governance in Mindanao
This section presents the results of assessment of LGAF indicators for each Module, as validated
by the panels. While the legal and institutional framework that prevail essentially follow
national statutes, the nuances of implementation in Mindanao are noted in the assessments.

4.1      Land Rights Recognition
Assessment of Indicators

       Indicators Assessed:

       LGI 1.1 Recognition of a continuum of rights: the law recognizes a range of
       rights held by individuals (including secondary rights of tenants.
       sharecroppers, women etc.)

       LGI 1.2 Respect for and enforcement of rights



LGI - 1.1 Recognition of a continuum of rights

1.1.1 a - There are laws that legally recognize a range of individual rural land rights, the
strength of which depends on the classification of the land. Occupants of A&D lands enjoy
full ownership rights while those occupying public lands are given only usufructuary and
possessory rights. - D

Legal recognition of individual rural land ownership rights is possible only once government
has released portions of the public domain as A&D. These are then disposed of through various
modes as depicted in Figure 1. The main law that governs individual rural land rights
recognition of ownership is CA 141 that mandates three agencies to perform titling functions
(Table 16).

However, the application of national laws which are based on the Regalian Doctrine had a
negative impact in the Bangsamoro region as these replaced traditional and long held notion of
land rights recognition and concept of ownership, thus leading to conflicts.

Moreover, the fact that three different agencies (DENR, LRA and DAR) issue titles on agricultural
lands without strong coordination and common map projection has increased the risk that
double titles can be issued on the same property. Both DENR and LRA reviews and approves
subdivision surveys to create new parcel records without sharing of map systems further
increases the risk. There are no estimates of the extent of the problem, but it is common
knowledge that there are overlaps in the issuance of multiple titles on the same land.

For people occupying non-alienable and disposable lands, there is no systematic recognition of
their land rights. In the public forests for example, the granting of individual certificate of
stewardship contracts (CSCs) under the Integrated Social Forestry (ISF) Program is more of a
strategy for forest management rather than recognition of individual land rights. Most of the
CSCs that have been issued by DENR 25 years ago are expiring; and now there is an ongoing
review and validation to determine if these are still being used as intended by the original
beneficiaries, and therefore the need to extend validity for another 25 years.

1.1.1 b - In Mindanao, only 50.18% of all rural and urban lands are protected through
formal titles. The rights of a large portion of occupants of forest and other public lands are
not protected in practice. - D

This figure is low, compared to the total Philippines, which has 54% titled parcels, and in Luzon,
which has an estimated 61% titled parcels. With so many parcels outside the formal system, the
constraints to investments and land market remains, particularly in Mindanao.

The Land Tenure Study estimated that there are 4.49 Million parcels in Mindanao, almost half of
which are still untitled.40 These represent 20% of the total estimated untitled parcels in the
Philippines41;

Based on the database generated from this study, the following observations can be drawn:
    Region 13 has the most number and largest proportion of untitled parcels in Mindanao
       (Table 17 and Figures 5 and 6);
    The ARMM region has the least number of parcels, and also with the least proportion of
       untitled parcels;
    ARMM has the highest average parcel size among the six Mindanao regions;
    Compared to national average parcel size of 0.78 hectares per parcel, Mindanao regions
       have overall, larger parcel sizes between 0.80 to 1.6 hectares. (Figure 8).

The above statistics could change once the data from cadastral survey involving documentation
of parcels are analyzed. This could explain why there are fewer parcels and less number of
untitled parcels estimated in ARMM, as the cadastral survey in ARMM has been completed only
in December 2015. The parcel estimates do not distinguish between lands that are devoted to
agricultural, residential and other uses.

40 Philippines-Australia Land Administration and Management Project. September 2004. Land Tenure Status Report
Book 1 – Results. While the report gave some caution in the use of data, it provides so far the best estimates of
titled and untitled parcels in the country. All parcel data were based on tax parcels, as neither DENR nor RoDs/LRA
cannot provide data on the parcels. The calculation of titled parcels is based on estimates of the assessor from land
tax declaration certificates that show land title number. The number of total land parcels is based on an estimate of
the ratio to tax parcels.
41 The Land Tenure Study estimated the number of untitled parcels in the Philippines at 11.18 million.

Combined, these provinces account for almost a million or almost half of untitled parcels in the
entire Mindanao region.

It is important to note that based on DENR estimates, there are 1.1 Million hectares of A&D
lands that need to be titled, comprising of only 45,000 parcels. (Table 19) Region 9 was
estimated to have the most number of parcels yet to be titled. Surprisingly however, the number
of parcel estimates is considerably too small in number compared to the area. It could be that
the areas remaining would be close in both estimates given that residential plots would have
smaller areas, but the number of parcels between the two sources needs to be reconciled.

While there is no complete picture of all registered titles in agricultural areas, the extent of
distribution among farmer households can be inferred from the coverage of Comprehensive
Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). Since the program started, a total of 1.9 Million hectares of
agricultural land have been distributed to an estimated 1 Million beneficiaries. In Mindanao, the
total accomplishment of the CARP land tenure improvement program is shown in Table 20.

One of the major reasons for the failure of titling program is the long period it took the
government to complete cadastral surveys in the country. Cadastral surveys define the
boundaries of LGUs which becomes the basis of their internal revenue allotment (IRA),
determines the parcels and document the claims of those who have been in possession of land.
Since the cadastral survey program was undertaken in 1913 with the enactment of
Commonwealth Act 2259 or the Cadastral Act, only 753 cities/municipalities or 46% of the total
local government units have been cadastrally surveyed or completed until 2009. These cover a
total land area of 13.8 Million hectares.

With the priority given under the Aquino administration to completing the program, all the
cadastral surveys, from political subdivisions to lot surveys, have been completed. In the ARMM
area, the survey was completed only in December 2015. Validations are still on going as of
writing of this report.

While the completion of lot surveys will greatly facilitate titling, it is important to consider the
following:
      Many past survey records have been missing or lost in the files of DENR, thus
        necessitating re surveys or reconstruction from available sources to be useful for titling;
      Many completed surveys were defective, thus not useful for titling activities. Further
        review of completed surveys is necessary to determine which ones are erroneous and
        should therefore be repeated;
      The long lag time between completion of lot surveys and actual adjudication and titling
        has resulted in outdated claimant records. LAMP2 experience bear that in areas covered
        by old surveys, there have been informal transfers, subdivisions and consolidation,
        sometimes death of the original claimant that makes adjudication lengthy, difficult and
        expensive (in the case of parcel requiring subdivisions prior to titling);
      There are large areas covered by judicial proceedings, meaning the survey and title
        claims have been lodged at the Courts (in anticipation of the judicial process of titling)
        and would need a lengthy process of individual parcel application for cancellation with
        the Courts through the Office of Solicitor General before administrative titling can
        proceed. This is the case for some areas within Cagayan de Oro City, for example.

With the issuance of Joint DENR-DILG Memorandum Circular on LGU led titling, many local
governments have entered into Memorandum of Partnership Agreements (MOPA) with the
DENR to fast track the titling process. This follows from the LAMP2 model wherein teams of
DENR-LGU systematic adjudication are created. However, it would require massive effort and
large amounts of resources to address the titling backlog in the country, particularly in
Mindanao.

1.1.2 and 1.1.3 - Customary rights, as well as indigenous rights to land and forests are
legally recognized, but these are only partly protected in practice – between C and D

The IPRA recognizes customary rights, which carries with it rights to land and resources within
the ancestral domains of indigenous peoples.

In Mindanao, it is estimated that there are 1.5 million indigenous peoples (or collectively called
as lumads), or roughly 11.5 % of the country’s total estimated IP population. As of 2014, a total
of 76 CADTs have been issued over 1.98 million hectares of land (Figure 9). Of these, only 13
were registered at the RoD, while an additional 63 CADTs are awaiting registration.

An additional 80 CADTs in Mindanao are on process, representing 1.39 Million hectares. When
combined with the CADTs already issued, the total number of CADTs in Mindanao would reach
156, covering over 3.37 Million hectares of land area. This represents about 33% of the total
area of the entire region, or about half of its forestlands. Figure 9 also shows the potential CADT
areas, or ancestral domains of indigenous peoples groups.

Indigenous peoples can enter into joint venture agreements with third parties for management
and development of portions of their CADTs following their ancestral domain sustainable
development and protection plan (ADSDPP). So far, only a few IP groups have entered into
agreements for these types of activities due to their weaknesses as organizations, and mistrust
of other parties due to histories of exploitation.

Because of the potential scope of CADTs in Mindanao, it is essential to complete the mapping
and recognition of ancestral domains to clearly delineate their coverage and avoid the risks of
creating overlaps with other tenure rights. The implementation of Joint DOJ-DENR-DAR-NCIP
Circular needs to be reviewed as it has been identified as one of the bottlenecks in registration.
Likewise, budget constraints on the part of NCIP have prevented the acceleration of mapping,
delineation and CADT issuance all over the country. Boundary disputes have also been
identified as one of the reasons delaying issuance of CADT.

The procedures for determination of the metes and bounds of ancestral domains as basis for
CADT follow a self delineation process, where NCIP or the IP community engages Geodetic
Engineers or partners with NGOs to conduct survey and mapping. The flaw in this procedure is
that while there are provisions in existing guidelines to share the survey plan with DENR, DAR
and LRA for purposes of common projection; in practice, many CADTs have been issued in areas
where tenure instruments have already been issued by DENR. There are also documented cases
of titles, and certificates of land ownership awards (CLOAs) that have been issued within CADTs.

1.1.4 - Existing legal framework recognizes urban land tenure rights except for informal
settler families who constitute about 13% of the urban population in Mindanao - B

Titling of urban lands for residential, commercial and other purposes through the judicial titling
procedures is possible through the Land Registration Act, Cadastral Act and Property
Registration Act. Other policies which support titling in urban areas is Commonwealth Act 141
which allows titling through Miscellaneous Sales Patents. Republic Act 730 provides for titling
of lands actually used for residential purposes without the requirements of public auction
(direct sale).

The Residential Free Patent Act (RA 10023) relaxed all cumbersome titling procedures in
residential lands that have been classified as public alienable and disposable lands. It essentially
extended the titling instrument which used to apply only to public A&D agricultural lands. The
law reduced from 30 to 10, the number of years of actual possession required before a patent
can be issued. It also removed the five-year restrictions on transfers and mortgage that used to
apply to agricultural Free Patent.

This would be the fastest and economical option to title the remaining untitled residential lands
in Mindanao. The DENR actually has a program to enter into partnership agreement with LGUs
to accelerate titling through the Residential Free Patent option. However, if the lands are
covered by cadastral proceedings (i.e., if there have been earlier applications lodged with the
Courts), then substantial delays are expected, as this would require taking these out of the Court
system before administrative titling can proceed.

However, the rights of urban informal settlers in private and public lands are not recognized by
law. As a form of protection, the Urban Development and Housing Act was enacted in 1992,
which defined the legal framework for urban land reform and housing for informal settlers,
slum dwellers, and other underprivileged. It also disallows summary evictions and demolition

of dwelling units without due process and adequate resettlement. The UDHA also established
clear policy and process through which the rights of ISF can be formalized either through on-
site development or relocation. LGUs were mandated to conduct land inventory, register
informal settlers and allocate land for secure tenure. Under the balanced housing development
provision, developers are required to allocate 20% of their land or value of subdivision projects
to socialized housing.

Mindanao has about 14.7% of the total ISF population as of 2011, or about 221,755 families.
These constitute about 12.7% of the total urban population in Mindanao. About 75% or
165,727 ISF live in danger areas. Region 10 has the most number of ISF among all the Mindanao
regions.

The estimates definitely need to be updated for proper planning and management of programs
in support of formalization.

LGI 1.2     Respect for and enforcement of rights

1.2.1 - Accessible opportunities exist for tenure individualization of group rights. However,
the strength of the law, and effectiveness of implementation varies with the type of group
rights.

In the Philippines, there are opportunities for recognition of group rights that protect the
collective interests of its members. Analysis of this indicator will look at the strength of group
rights recognition, clear definition of boundaries, group membership and decision making
mechanisms to provide incentives for sustainable land and resource management.

There are at least four types of group rights that are recognized:
    Collective group rights by farmers’ organizations/cooperatives under agrarian reform;
    Community group rights over natural resources in public forest lands
    Collective tenure by informal settler families under the Community Mortgage Program
       (CMP)
    Customary group rights by indigenous peoples

In the case of customary group rights of indigenous peoples, there are no opportunities for
individualization of CADT. Rather, individual of family based CALTs are issued following
evidence of individual claims.




                                                                                                       39
The law provides opportunities for those holding collective CLOAs under CARP to individualize
their land rights. However, implementation issues have made it difficult to do so - C

Under the CARP, collective CLOAs are given by government to farmers
cooperatives/associations, who passed the criteria as agrarian reform beneficiaries (mainly
landless and resident of the land, barangay or municipality where the landholding is located).
Where no such cooperative or association exists at the time of coverage and acquisition, its
formation shall be encouraged, preferably with assistance from NGOs. As of 2012, collective
CLOAs have been issued over 2.126 Million hectares in the Philippines. These lands are used for
productive agriculture either by the farmer cooperative members themselves or through long-
term lease agreements with large corporations.

About 43% of the total collective CLOAs issued in the Philippines are in Mindanao. Out of
914,453 hectares of collective CLOAs, more than half (52%) have been subdivided by DAR
(477,096 hectares). It is also important to note that 91% of all collective CLOAs issued are in the
name of farmer groups which are not organized, thus raising questions about the group’s ability
to manage the land collectively, the affairs of the organization, and negotiations with private
investors.

The bulk of collective CLOAs issuance happened in the early 90s in an effort to accelerate CARP
implementation. A number of issues have surfaced as a result of such moves such as the
following:
      Some LGUs reported that lands covered by collective CLOAs have low rates of payment
        of RPTs, as there is no clear assigned responsibility;
      A large proportion of collective CLOA holders are not organized farmer associations or
        cooperatives (Table 25), suggesting that they are not quite mature organizations for
        collective land management, or in negotiations with large scale land investors in cases of
        leaseback arrangements; and
      Due to the 10 year deferment of CARP implementation in corporate agricultural lands,
        there were reports that this window of time was used by owners of large estates to
        exclude other farmers who are eligible under the program; thus resulting in cases of
        exclusion and inclusion44 (Table 26).

who were either disposed or excluded from the land transfer process during the deferment
period of CARP implementation in large corporate farms. These comprise farmers, farm
workers, seasonal workers, contractual workers and retrenched farm workers. Accordingly,
only 2,118 (11.89%) have acquired land under CARP; and the volume of land acquired
represents only 5.2% of total claimed area.46

DAR recognizes the cases of exclusion and inclusion cases, and has tasked its field offices to
document and validate these through interviews and review of records. Under CARPER (RA
9700), issuance of individual CLOA has since been the general rule.

During the panel review, additional concerns on collective CLOAs were shared by DAR47:
    In some cases, not all beneficiaries are named in the CLOA, instead only the name of the
       association is reflected in the document thus raising serious issues during re
       negotiations of contracts with the commercial investor; and when some members decide
       to individualize their certificates. Some high profile cases of these have featured in
       DAR’s exclusion and inclusion process in segregating the group of beneficiaries who
       decided to opt out of an existing contract.
    While there are clear procedures that have been issued by DAR for the individualization
       of collective CLOAs (DAR DAO No. 3, series of 1993); a more serious concern is the
       subdivision of CLOAs where the beneficiaries are not listed in the title. This would entail
       more rigorous background investigation and validation of individual beneficiary
       members; and will pose a challenge in ensuring that both the investors and CLOA
       holders mutually benefit from their partnership. A Department Order was issued by
       DAR in June 2016 (Administrative Order 3, series of 2016); which seeks to stabilize
       ownership and tenureship of agrarian reform beneficiaries with CLOAs.
    A more important concern is the screening process that went into the collective CLOA
       issuance. DAR reported that they have been encountering problems with identifying the
       beneficiary members, and cases where the names listed are found out to be not
       qualified.
    Other investigations revealed that areas awarded to CLOAs are not eligible in the first
       place. There have been many reports of CLOAs encroaching in protected areas,
       timberlands, and ancestral domains; causing a lot of conflict. The Joint DENR-DAR-DOJ-
       NCIP Administrative Order was meant to prevent future overlaps in tenure issuance and
       not to correct mistakes done in the past.
    Issues arise with collective CLOAs named after the cooperatives or associations. In a
       sense, cooperatives are business institutions prior to award. However, such collective
       ownership does not reflect the decisions of the individual members who are co owners.

Collective tenure of communities occupying forestlands are recognized. However, there are no
opportunities for individualization of resource use rights - D

Community Based Forest Management Agreements (CBFMAs) represent the instrument issued
by DENR for collective management of portions of the country’s productive forest estate. These
tenurial instruments have a duration of 25 years, renewable for another 25 years. Recipients of
CBFMAs are required to prepare Community Resource Management Frameworks (CRMFs)
which is the basis for ascertaining the level of resource utilization. Individual CRMFs would also
specify the allocation of lands for specific uses (agriculture, agroforestry, forest production) as
well as for protection purposes. In the Philippines, there were 1,184 CBFMAs covering 1.615
Million hectares involving 191,352 households or 1,884 peoples organizations, as of 2013. In

46 Ibid, pp. 13. DAR explained that the MFDC bases its conclusion on the labor dispute during this period. The CARP
law puts a premium on being a regular worker at the time of end of deferment (1998). New workers were brought in
to replace those who were retrenched.

If managed well, there is huge potential for CBFMAs to stimulate employment through linkages
with markets and value adding through wood processing. In a stocktaking exercise carried out
in 2011, it was noted that lack of private sector participation, limited monitoring and evaluation,
and unstable resource use policies by DENR have undermined the potential of CBFM as a
strategy for reducing poverty and creating employment.49 In particular, there is no strong policy
anchor for CBFM such that over several administrations, government has changed the terms of
resource use rights given to communities, thus resulting in sub optimal use of this tenure
instrument.

There is no global target or estimates of forest communities who should be awarded group
rights through CBFMA. This poses a concern on the adequacy of current coverage vis a vis the
need for recognition of resource use rights of people already occupying forestlands.

Individualization of collective tenure by informal settler families (ISF) under the Community
Mortgage Program (CMP) is possible only after the loan has been fully paid, which takes about 30
years - C

In the urban areas, the rights of ISF are recognized through the CMP, a program under the UDHA
(Republic Act 7279). Under the law, underprivileged families with no secure tenure to their land
and housing may avail of the program through a loan from the Socialized Housing and Finance
Corporation (SHFC). Households must belong to a registered community association to be
eligible for financing under the program. The title then that is issued is named after the
association, with provision for individualization once the mortgage payment has been

completed. This process usually takes 30 years, during which time some members have
informally transferred their rights to other people; and/or disagreements have taken place
within the community organization that makes full repayment impossible.

The loan is contingent upon identifying the land, which is used as collateral. There are a number
of issues that have beset the formalization of landless urban poor families 50:

First, ISF have been having difficulty finding available land for their housing in the face of
refusal of private property owners to sell the land currently occupied by ISF, the high cost of
land in major cities, and the absence of a deliberate program to make land available for in city
resettlement and on site development of ISF.

Second, loan processing has proved difficult because of the legal requirements that have to be
complied with by the applicants. Most of these pertain to land issues such as agreements with
property owners, existence of liens, encumbrances on the property, missing back titles,
extrajudicial settlement and special power of attorney documents, land owners are dissolved
corporations, and technical problems such as location in hazard prone areas. At SHFC, these
represent 47% of actual cases pending, involving some 9,295 households and involving a total
loan amount of Php 680 Million.

Third, key shelter agencies such as the National Housing Authority (NHA), encounter technical
problems with survey of proclaimed areas for ISF, as well as the existence of many problematic
proclamations that make it almost impossible for NHA to dispose the property for socialized
housing. These include, proclamations in hazard zones, issuance by Department of Public Works
and Highways (DPWH) of eviction notices despite the completion of the housing project by NHA,
among others.

Underlying the above issues is the disjointed land records, lack of coordination among agencies,
which make it difficult to ascertain the true ownership of properties, and properly conduct
complete staff work prior to issuance of proclamations. Combined, these have affected the pace
by which the government has responded to the growing landlessness among the urban poor.
Based on broad estimates used by the NHA made in coordination with local governments, the
number of ISF are about 1.5 Million, or about 15% of the Philippines’ total urban population.
Based on the National Informal Settler Upgrading Strategy, this estimate still pales in
comparison to the numbers indicated by global studies which report that about 30% to 60% of
the urban population in the developing world live in informal settlements. 51

1.2.2 and 1.2.3 - A large proportion of individual land in Mindanao (17% of total area) have
not been formally recorded and mapped - C 52

In Mindanao, the area in ARMM that is still not completely cadastrally surveyed is 1.7 million
hectares, or 17.32% of the Mindanao total land area. Moreover, there are 414,973 hectares of
unclassified forestlands which represent 4% of its land area. The classification of these lands
have to be done with finality in order to determine if these can be released as public A&D or
retained as part of the public forest.

reportedly been completed, but still subject to validation. This dimension would then have a rating of A.


                                                                                                                44
The DENR has targeted the completion of all cadastral surveys in the Philippines before the end
of the Aquino administration, but this needs to happen for parcel surveys as well.

1.2.4 and 1.2.5 - The number of informal land sales and lease transactions is high and some
are unambiguously identified on a routine basis - C

During the panel discussions, the members reported that high transfer taxes and estate taxes
encourage informality in land transactions. Members shared their personal knowledge of
people evading estate taxes by not registering properties. Most cases of informal land sales are
witnessed by local officials who attest to the transfer.

In Bangsamoro area, a documentation of informal land markets revealed that this practice
thrive because they enable easy entry and exit for farmers and other rural producers who want
to access land for crop production. Despite the uncertainty that could provoke violent conflict,
these markets persist due to the fragmented nature of land governance in Mindanao – brought
about by the shortcomings among national land agencies, and the costliness of the formal land
market.53

The case study further noted that: “… while transactions are vulnerable to misinterpretation and
contestation… these informal agreements has shown remarkable effectiveness in transforming idle
land into productive farms, and local strongmen have been relatively efficient in enforcing the
terms of informal contracts.” (Gulane, 2014)

In contrast, “formal land markets in Muslim Mindanao where pervasive rent seeking and legal
contestation cripples farmers’ ability to engage in production. Worse, studies have shown how
these formal land arrangements have actually become sources of violence, especially when they
impinge on the informal arrangements concluded at the community level”. (Gulane, 2014)

In a related observation, the informal land market is seen as the coping solution to the
fragmented land governance in the Bangsamoro where “sales, mortgage of land are unrecorded
officially and publicly, and are done on a “gentleman’s agreement” or by an unregistered
document. Usually, a strongman mediates and witnesses the sale/transfer/loan, and the whole
situation is tinder to conflict flaring up when there is defection from the agreement by either party,
or the strongman himself takes interest in the transaction.” 54

In terms of informal land leases, the panels opined that existing legal restrictions are routinely
neglected in Mindanao. The DAR cited that leases on CARP lands are supposed to be approved
by the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC). However, only one lease has so far been
approved by the PARC. There are also other instances where not all members of the
cooperative would give consent to lease; but if they accept payment, it would be presumed that
consent is given. These are gray areas in lease of collective CLOAs to private sector investors.

Existing laws do not discriminate the issuance of titles/patents/CLOAs in the name of women
landowners, or jointly with spouses. However, gender data is not recorded in the registry.

Because of this, the panel believed that women’s property rights are recorded, except that
because the information is not captured, there is no way to monitor this.

In a study on gender and property rights, it was found that one of the weaknesses of recording
of women’s rights to land and resources is “the lack of data fields on sex, civil status, and date of
birth of applicants and holders of land tenure instruments in many LAM forms (e.g., the Residential
Free Patent Application Form, Farmer Beneficiary Application Form or CARP Form 1, Tax
Declaration Form, Real Property Field Appraisal and Assessment Sheet, etc.) as well as the lack of
information on the sex of registrants and holders of certificates of land titles in the judicial forms
and in the land registration system and database of the LRA.”55

Summary and Recommendations

Based on the above information and analysis of indicators, the following points can be said
about rights recognition in Mindanao:
    There exists national policies and laws for recognition of both individual and group
        rights in the rural areas. These afford recognition of long term possession, and provides
        for affordable processes for securing rights.
    However, these very same laws were responsible for the dispossession of the Moros, as
        these replaced existing traditional and long held notions of ownership; thus leading to
        conflict.
    The presence of multiple agencies issuing first time titles on agricultural land, coupled
        with lack of unified survey projection system and limited coordination, has resulted in
        overlapping titles on the same properties.
    There remains a large proportion of untitled parcels in Mindanao (50% of total number
        of A&D parcels); made worse by the long delay in the completion of cadastral surveys in
        ARMM. In addition to completing the survey, it is essential to locate missing records,
        repeat erroneous surveys to make them useful for titling.
    Collective CLOAs comprise about 1 Million hectares, of which 378,424 hectares were
        issued to farmer groups, and still not subdivided. Subdividing these and/or organizing
        the farmers to develop their capacities would be essential to ensure they have the
        wherewital to manage their farms by themselves or negotiate more equitable
        arrangements with large scale investors.
    The IPRA provides solid policy for recognition of customary rights, but its
        implementation has to be accelerated to protect their rights, and enable them to
        negotiate more equitable terms with potential investors. Development of their
        capacities, formulation of ADSDPPs, and better implementation of FPIC process would
        be required for IP communities to be better engaged with private sector and other
        partners to develop their ancestral domains.
    Almost 50% of CBFMAs are in Mindanao, covering about 800,000 hectares of
        forestlands. These have the potential to generate employment, reduce poverty and
        stimulate rural economy. However, the unpredictable policies in recent years has
        stymied the ability of these lands to meet these objectives.
    There is no law which recognizes long term possession of under privileged families in
        the urban areas. The process for formalization is tedious and is constrained among
        others, by finding available land that is affordable to majority of ISF.

In order to properly harness these potentials, the following key challenges should be given
attention:
     Accelerate titling of lands, alongside with evaluation of old surveys, completion of
        remaining areas in ARMM through simultaneous survey and adjudication, and
        completion of validation of cadastral surveys;

      Improve value adding in forestry, through support to production and bulk marketing of
       products from CBFMAs and IFMAs;
      Expand tenure coverage to include forest lands under open access conditions;
      Strengthen capacities of IP organizations to enable better returns from management of
       their ancestral domains, and respect for their rights in the utilization of mineral
       resources on IP lands;
      Complete the mapping and registration of remaining ancestral domain claims in
       Mindanao;
      Improve monitoring and safeguards in mining operations, and promote value added
       through implementation of reforms initiated under EO 79;
      Strengthen management of PAs to deliver ecosystem services, improve investments in
       ecotourism to generate more jobs;
      Address overlaps in the issuance of titles, CLOAs, tenure instruments, long- term leases
       and agreements on public lands through greater harmonization of procedures and
       quality assurance of surveys, mapping and documentation.

           LGI 2.2 Effectiveness and equity of rural land use regulations



LGI 2.1    Rights to forest and common lands

2.1.1 - Forests are clearly identified, but responsibility for land use is not well defined – C

Except for ARMM, the DENR has reportedly completed the delineation and ground demarcation
of final forest boundary. Validation is on going, to support the filing of the Bill to legislate the
final forest line. This process entailed coordination with local officials and communities, in
order to demonstrate the location of boundary markers. Ordinary citizens however, cannot
easily distinguish the forest boundary on the ground, particularly in cases where the identified
forestland has no or very minimal forest cover.

By law, the responsibility for forestland use rests with DENR, through regulation of activities of
various users. The agency issues various tenurial instruments to different groups but this does
not cover the entire forestlands, leaving a large portion essentially under “open access”
conditions. In Mindanao, the extent of “open access” forestlands reached 700,000 hectares.
Proper mapping of these tenurial instruments is essential to determine the overlaps in terms of
CBFMAs, CLOAs, IFMAs, protected areas, titled lands, and strategies developed to clarify rights
and management responsibilities.

Recently, the enhanced land use planning guidelines of HLURB prescribed guidelines for
integrated planning of forestlands with the town center section of the local government
territory. DENR has also promoted the preparation of forestland use plans (FLUPs) as a way of
allocating open access areas as subject of co management agreements with LGUs. However, this
practice has stopped as the DENR unilaterally suspended the implementation of the DENR-DILG
memorandum Circular on Co Management.



                                                                                                  48
Thus, while FLUP is now considered embedded in the CLUPs of LGUs, management
responsibility still rests with the DENR; thus leaving the LGUs with very marginal roles in forest
management.

2.1.2 - Common lands are clearly identified, responsibility for land use is clearly identified,
but implementation is ambiguous – B

Common lands refer to those under ancestral domain claims and awarded community based
forest management agreements (CBFMAs). In the case of the latter, these are commonly
managed lands, while in the case of the former, these are traditional or customary lands.

The NCIP and IP communities have identified criteria for the delineation of the extent of
ancestral domains. In Mindanao, not all ancestral domains have been clearly delineated and
issued CADTs, thus causing uncertainty in the rights of other forest occupants who might be
occupying portions of the claimed domains of indigenous peoples. Moreover, existing CADTs
have overlapped with other forest and natural resource use rights issued by DENR, due to lack
of a common reference map and coordination in delineation.

Thus, while responsibility for management of common lands rest with identified IP
communities in ancestral domains, the slow pace of CADT delineation and issuance, the lack of
coordination in issuance of forest rights and mapping have affected the security of rights of
other occupants or holders of long term leases in forest lands.

This issue of overlaps of claims, tenurial instruments and titles with CADTs was refuted by NCIP.
It was argued that CADTs are Torrens titles, and therefore, there could be no overlapping rights
on the same land. In cases when this happens, the NCIP explained that other tenurial
instruments and prior rights are respected if these were issued before the CADT was issued.
This would entail the tenure holder seeking FPIC from the IP community. What happens is that
the IP community or the CADT holder, allows the tenure to expire, after which it is no longer
given FPIC to renew.

Future overlaps are expected to be minimized with the approval of the Joint DOJ-DENR-DAR-
NCIP Administrative Order that prescribes that the CADT survey be shared with DENR, DAR and
LRA for projection to determine if there are no overlaps with other rights or claims. These
agencies then issue Certificates of No Overlap for the CADT processing to proceed. Titled
properties within the proposed CADT are supposed to be culled out before the CADT can be
registered. However, because of the preponderance of overlaps, the process is stopped if the
agency cannot issue the Certificate. This is one of the reasons why there has been a slow down
of CADT registration in the recent years.

RoD is of the view that CADTs are not Torrens titles under the law, but a special kind of title.
With the issuance of the JAO, the RoDs have stopped registering CADTs and CALTs in the
meantime; as there is no book yet for the registration of these kinds of titles.

2.1.3 - Rural group rights are formally recognized, but effectiveness of enforcement varies
depending on the type of land, the policies that govern recognition, the agency responsible
for implementation, and the group which are the targets of those rights

Except for indigenous groups, other groups are organized for purposes of or as a condition for
granting of tenure, rather than recognizing legitimate and already existing organized groups.
This is the general case for CLOAs and CBFMs. However, in some instances, there are legitimate
organizations or groups that are already in existence before the granting of CLOAs and CBFMs.




                                                                                               49
The tenure of indigenous groups is formally recognized and clear regulations regarding groups’
internal organization and legal representation exist and can be enforced - A

There is very strong recognition of group rights of indigenous peoples communities under the
IPRA. During the process of CADT award, efforts are made to ensure that the organization
represent the indigenous political structure (IPS) in order to avoid cases where the peoples’
organizations (POs) that were formed following the CADT are different from the traditional
governance mechanisms. There have been experiences where the PO that was set up and
registered formally with government have different structures and decision making authorities
with the traditional system. This has created problems in the past in terms of representation
with outside parties, and created rifts among members of the IP community.

IP groups can gain legal representation by registration as peoples’ organizations with either the
LGU, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), or with Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC). This becomes essential only to establish themselves as juridical entities in
order to enter into agreements with other parties.

Collective Group Rights by Farmers Cooperatives/Associations under Agrarian Reform

In CARP covered areas, the tenure of most groups is formally recognized and clear regulations
regarding groups’ internal organization and legal representation exist and can be enforced.
However, most collective tenure are given to non organized groups with unclear membership. - A

Under the CARP, collective CLOAs are given by the government to farmers
cooperatives/associations, who passed the criteria as agrarian reform beneficiaries. Where no
such cooperative or association exists at the time of coverage and acquisition, its formation shall
be encouraged, preferably with assistance from NGOs. As of 2012, collective CLOAs have been
issued over 2.126 Million hectares in the Philippines. In Mindanao, some 900,000 hectares are
placed under collective CLOAs. Most of these lands are used for productive agriculture either by
the farmer cooperative members themselves or through long-term lease agreements with large
corporations.

As discussed above, there have been issues with the eligibility of members who were awarded
CLOAs, signaling deficiencies in the original determination of beneficiaries. These are being
investigated, through a process that has been initiated by DAR.

Members need not be organized as farmers’ organizations or cooperatives to obtain a CLOA. In
Mindanao, 91% of collective CLOAs were issued to farmer groups who were not organized. This
has posed issues with representation, organizational capacity, and ability to manage and
negotiate with investors.

Community Group Rights over Natural Resources in Public Forest Lands

The tenure of most groups in public forestlands is not formally recognized but groups can gain
legal representation under other laws (e.g., corporate laws). The legal organization of such groups
however, does not guarantee secure tenure. - B

In public forestlands, the CBFMAs are used as tenure instruments to recognize the rights of
communities to natural resources. These have a duration of 25 years, renewable for another 25
years. Recipients of CBFMAs are required to prepare Community Resource Management
Frameworks (CRMFs) that is the basis for ascertaining the level of resource utilization. As of
2013, there were 726 CBFMAs covering 815,587 hectares involving 112,068 households in
Mindanao. Individual CRMFs would specify the allocation of lands for specific uses (agriculture,
agroforestry, forest production) as well as for protection purposes.


                                                                                                50
CBFMAs are awarded to peoples’ organizations (POs) or cooperatives duly recognized by
appropriate authorities. In case the community is not yet organized or registered, then the
CBFMA is put on hold. Recently, the DENR has been examining the recipients of CBFMAs
wherein it was found out that there are those whose members are not from the community.
Cases like these are recommended for cancellation.

2.1.4 - Users’ rights to key natural resources are legally recognized but only some are
effectively protected in practice or enforcement is difficult and takes a long time - B

In public alienable and disposable lands, foreshore areas and in public forestlands, multiple use
zones in protected areas - disposition of use rights is through issuance of long term leases,
community and individual tenure instruments. However, because there is no complete
inventory and mapping of occupants in forestlands, it is not clear how much proportion of these
communities have secure users rights.

Moreover, for those with users’ rights, there are overlaps of tenure instruments with CADTs,
CLOAs, thus making it difficult to enforce and protect the given rights. This is compounded by
weak monitoring and enforcement, thus violations and informality is rampant.

2.1.5 - Multiple rights over common lands and natural resources on these lands can legally
co exist only if there is FPIC granted by the indigenous peoples group and/or Joint Venture
agreement with another party – B

In ancestral domain lands, it is legally possible for other parties to have rights over portions of
their lands provided there is FPIC given by the community. This is usually made through joint
venture agreements, or informally by mere permission given by the community to other parties
such as forest communities to gain access to portions of land and resources within their domain.

In some CADTs in Davao, IP communities have forged Memorandum of Agreements (MOAs)
with individuals and/or corporate groups to develop and manage portions of their domain such
as for resorts, private rest houses, and other uses.

2.1.6 - It is not legally possible for multiple rights over the same plot of land and its
resources (e.g., trees) to co exist - D

Despite the above, there are cases where long-term leaseholders assign their rights to other
parties through sub leasing, in which case, these are considered subsequent rights that are
derived from the main rights holders. The granting of resource use rights over portions of the
public domain is made on the premise that the rights holder has the financial and technical
capacity to manage the land and its resources.

In the case of CBFMA however, entering into Joint Venture with investors is allowed in order to
fill in the capital needs for area development. Even IP communities can enter into JV
agreements with investors to develop portions of their CADTs in accordance with their
ADSDPPs, provided there is FPIC.

2.1.7 - Co existence of land and mining rights is possible by law, and respected in practice
but mechanisms to resolve disputes are often inadequate - B

According to the Constitution, all sub surface resources (minerals) belong to the State. Thus, the
State grants mining permits (exploration, MPSAs, FTAAs) over mineral rich lands where surface
rights have been allocated to either IP communities, forest communities, and other groups or
individuals, even in private lands. While there are provisions for royalties to the land surface


                                                                                                51
owner, this has caused a lot of conflicts that proved difficult to resolve. In Mindanao, opposition
to mining, whose rights have been issued by DENR, have resulted in violence particularly in
areas occupied by IPs who are opposed to mining.

Moreover, many LGUs have issued local laws specifying mining moratorium over areas where
the national government has issued mining rights, causing confusion, and difficulties in
enforcement of sub surface rights.

2.1.8 - The law provides opportunities for those holding group land under customary,
group, or collective tenures to record and map land rights if they so desire. Procedures are
affordable, and include basic safeguards against abuse. – B

The following describes the process for the recording and mapping, review and recognition of
group tenure.

On CADTs of indigenous peoples

                           Steps/Process                                    Responsible/Comments

  1. Petition for delineation. This is the start of the process of      By the NCIP, with the consent of
  delineating a specific perimeter of the ancestral domain.             ICC/IP concerned or by the
                                                                        majority of members of the
                                                                        ICCs/IPs

  2. Delineation proper. This involves official delineation of          Ancestral Domains Office of the
  ancestral domain including census of all community members.           NCIP

                                                                        Due to lack of funds at the NCIP,
                                                                        NGOs and other donors get
                                                                        involved in the delineation,
                                                                        mapping and preparation of
                                                                        documentation report as basis for
                                                                        submission to NCIP En banc to
                                                                        issue the CADT.

  3. Preparation of maps. This is done on the basis of such             Ancestral Domains Office of the
  investigation and the findings of fact based thereon. This            NCIP
  involves the preparation a perimeter map, complete with
  technical descriptions, and a description of the natural features
  and landmarks embraced therein.

  4. Report of investigation and other documents. A complete            Ancestral Domains Office of the
  copy of the preliminary census and a report of investigation,         NCIP
  shall also be prepared.

  5. Notice and publication. A copy of each document, including         NCIP field offices
  a translation in the native language of the ICCs/IPs concerned
  shall be posted in a prominent place therein for at least 15 days.
  A copy of the document shall also be posted at the local,
  provincial and regional offices of the NCIP, and shall be
  published in a newspaper of general circulation once a week for
  2 consecutive weeks to allow other claimants to file opposition
  thereto within 15 days from date of such publication. In areas
  where no such newspaper exists, broadcasting in a radio station
  will be a valid substitute. Mere posting shall be deemed sufficient



                                                                                                           52
  if both newspaper and radio station are not available.

  6. Endorsement to NCIP. Within 15 days from publication, and            Ancestral Domains Office of the
  of the inspection process, the Ancestral Domains Office shall           NCIP
  prepare a report to the NCIP endorsing a favorable action upon a
  claim that is deemed to have sufficient proof. However, if the
  proof is deemed insufficient, the Ancestral Domains Office shall
  require the submission of additional evidence. The Ancestral
  Domains Office shall reject any claim that is deemed patently
  false or fraudulent after inspection and verification.

  7. Issuance of Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title (CADT) .           NCIP EN Banc
  ICCs/IPs whose ancestral domains have been officially
  delineated and determined by the NCIP shall be issued a CADT in
  the name of the community concerned, containing a list of all
  those identified in the census.

  8. Registration of CADTs. The NCIP shall register issued                The registration of CADTs at the
  certificates of ancestral domain titles and certificates of ancestral   RoD has been affected by the
  lands titles before the Register of Deeds in the place where the        issuance of Joint DENR-DAR-DOJ-
  property is situated.                                                   NCIP Administrative Order that
                                                                          require the resolution of
                                                                          overlapping claims such as private
                                                                          titles, and other interests on the
                                                                          land.


This is a very costly process, funded by the government through NCIP, although NGOs and
donors also provide funding support to fast track the issuance of CADTs. Estimates from NGOs
place the cost at between Php 500,000 to Php 2.5 Million, depending on the extent of the area,
the conflicts that exist, and capacity of the IP communities to participate. Recently, there has
been severe limitation on the part of NCIP to fund ancestral domain delineation and mapping;
which was the main reason for delays in issuance of CADT. Other factors include boundary
conflicts with adjacent IP communities, delays in approval or completion of surveys, and/or
conflicts in claims with other rights issued on public lands.

Community Group Rights on Natural Resources in Public Forest Lands
The DENR field offices maintain an inventory of all CBFMAs issued, along with other attribute
data and information on CRMF, etc. These are not linked to the property registry at RoD.

The process for securing a CBFMA is as follows:

                                  Table 30. Steps in Issuance of CBFMAs
                               Steps/Process                                       Responsible

    Identification of CBFMP areas. Conflicting claims are also              Jointly by the DENR and
    processed at this stage                                                 LGU in consultation with
                                                                            local communities

    Application by the community/participants. Local                        Potential community
    communities, represented by existing organizations, or at least         participants
    ten (10) residents, or their Barangay Councils, may apply in
    writing to the concerned CENRO for participation in CBFMP.




                                                                                                            53
                              Steps/Process                                        Responsible

    Community appraisal and PO formation. The CENRO, in                     CENRO of DENR
    collaboration with duly designated representatives of the
    concerned LGUs, shall cause the conduct of an initial community
    appraisal.

    Application for CBFMA. Once registered, the PO may apply for a          Applicants/community
    CBFMA by filing an application to the concerned CENRO.                  organization

    Formulation of Community Resource Management                            Community organization
    Framework (CRMF). The CRMF shall indicate, among others, the            or People’s Organization
    community’s and the PO’s mission, vision and objectives; a
    summary of situation analysis

    Formulation of Resource Use Plan (RUPs). A management and               Community organization
    utilization plan for each resource, e.g., timber, rattan resins,        or People’s Organization
    covering a specific area of the CBFMA and time period shall be
    prepared.

    Annual Work Plan. The operationalization of the CRMF and the            Community organization
    RUP shall be embodied in an Annual Work Plan that shall indicate        or People’s Organization
    among other things, the specific targets for the year for utilization
    (based on the RUPs); resource development and protection
    (agroforestry, tree plantations, assisted natural regeneration,
    protection activities, etc.); organizational strengthening (training,
    other skills development) and enterprise development.

    Interim Resource Use Permit. One of the outputs during                  DENR
    community appraisal is to identify existing forest-based
    livelihood systems that may be enhanced to augment income. The
    community shall be granted an interim user’s permit that shall
    terminate upon the acceptance of the resource use plans.


The cost to secure CBFMA is shouldered by the DENR. This is almost free on the part of the
applicants.

On Collective CLOAs in agrarian reform lands
These are registered at the country’s RoDs, which maintain a separate book of CARP titles. As of
September 2015, there are 74,680 collective CLOAs issued by DAR in Mindanao, covering
914,453 hectares. The process for registration of collective CLOAs is as follows:

                                    Table 31. Steps in CLOA Issuance

                                              Steps/Process

    If private lands:
         1. DAR will issue a Notice of Coverage
         2. Land Bank will compensate the owner
         3. RoD will issue a title under the name of the Republic of the Philippines
         4. CLOA will be registered under the name of the group
    If public lands:
         1.   The area will be surveyed by a Licensed Geodetic Engineer through DAR
         2.   DENR will review and approve the survey plan
         3.   CLOAs will be registered


                                                                                                       54
The cost of securing a collective CLOA is shouldered by the DAR, as part of the agrarian reform
program implementation.

In many instances, collective CLOAs were issued within public lands, and in some cases, to
beneficiaries who are not eligible to receive CLOAs.

2.1.9 – About 40-70% of the area under communal and/or indigenous land has boundaries
demarcated and surveyed and associated claims recorded

Indigenous lands/CADTs – B
Only 58.75% of CADTs have been issued out of the total claims in process. These CADTs have
been mapped and delineated, but not ground demarcated. This does not include the other
claims that have not been documented yet.

The NCIP Region XII claims that in Mindanao, there are about 9.7 million hectares of land that
are subject to IP claims. This is 97% of the total land area of the region. Out of these, the NCIP
reported the following:
     24% have approved CADTs;
     17% have CADTs being processed;
     40% are identified for CADTs.

CBFMAs – Between C and D
There is no ground demarcation of boundaries; only map delineation. It is not known how much
of the forest population would need recognition of communal rights, and therefore target of
CBFM issuance as there is no complete inventory of population and community groups within
forest lands. In the case of CBFM, the instrument is not really a claim to a right in forestlands,
but an award from the DENR for rights to use and manage portions of forestlands.

CLOAs – A
These are all surveyed and ground demarcated, as basic requirement for issuance of CLOA.

LGI 2.2    Effectiveness and equity of rural land use regulations

2.2.1 - Regulations regarding restrictions on rural land use and transferability effectively
serve public purpose but enforcement is weak and difficult. (between B and C)

There are a number of regulations that restrict rural land use and transferability.

The CARP law prohibits conversion of CARP awarded lands to non-agricultural uses unless
clearance is given, and has passed the 10-year restriction period after issuance. The aim is to
ensure the beneficiary benefits from the agricultural land that was awarded. In many cases
however, this is violated in practice by virtue of spot zoning adopted by LGUs. The 10-year
restriction is also being violated through informal sales even if the prescription period has not
passed, and in cases where there are still outstanding amortizations. The drivers are increasing
demand for land to be developed, expanding urbanization in the fringes of city and town centers
and vibrant land market activity.

Forestlands, once classified, have restrictions on ownership, and land use that prohibit their use
for short term agricultural cropping and expansion of settlements. However, because of weak
enforcement, there have been massive encroachment and de facto cultivation of forestlands for
agriculture. Again, this is driven by demand for more areas for agriculture, limited land and
weak property rights in the rural areas which drive people and communities to inhabit and




                                                                                               55
cultivate forestlands. There are no census of population and settlements, and there is no clear
long-term strategy on occupation of forestlands.

Protected areas provide restrictions on use depending on the PA management zoning. However,
due to weak enforcement and management, there has been conversion of some portions of PAs,
particularly those along its boundaries, into agriculture.

Land use within ancestral domains should be consistent with its ADSDPPs, but because of
overlaps with other tenure instruments and weak recognition of IP rights, portions of CADTs
are being encroached upon and converted to other uses incompatible with ADSDPPs.

Thus, while most of the restrictions are justified for equity and public purposes, weak capacities
and the multiplicity of agencies issuing tenurial instruments and recognizing rights diminish the
effectiveness of such restrictions. Realities also suggest that such restriction should be revisited
to allow flexibility to acknowledge the dynamics of land development process, and respond to
market demand.

2.2.2 - Rural lands, that has had a change in land use (classification) assignment in the past
3 years has changed to its destined use (e.g., forest, pasture, wetlands, national parks, etc.)
– between B and C

In the Philippines and in Mindanao, the change is not in terms of use, but in terms of
classification (e.g., from forest to protected area) with concomitant changes in allowable land
uses.

In some cases, changes to destined use are delayed due to speculation (i.e., mineral
reservations), and/or lack of funds and capacity to manage the area based on new designated
classification (e.g., protected area).

Nonetheless, changes in land classification are made in a phased manner, such that it is always a
rule of thumb that lands are already being actually used de facto before the official land
classification takes effect. For example, except for some, large portions of key biodiversity areas
are actually being managed administratively as protected areas through local Ordinances and
Presidential Proclamations before these are legislated by Congress as part of the protected area
estate. The same holds true for ancestral domains – these are informally recognized as claims by
indigenous peoples before a confirmation is made with finality after surveys, documentation
and registration of CADTs.

2.2.3 - Processes for rezoning are public and clear with effective mechanisms in place to
safeguard existing rights and compensation in case of loss in areas where land use is to be
restricted

A - Establishment of protected areas follows a 12 step participatory process that involves the
public, LGUs, and culminates in the legislation of a law. Once established, prior rights are
recognized.

B - Delineation and demarcation of forestlands undergoes a process of ground validation to
assess actual status and consult with local communities. However, there is no recognition of
prior rights. Because there are many CLOAs that have been issued inside forestlands, there are
discussions currently on going between DENR and DAR on how the CLOAs can be respected
through some alternative tenure instrument.




                                                                                                 56
A - Delineation and demarcation of ancestral domains follows a self-delineation process by the
IP community. The IPRA specifies that during delineation, existing titles and rights are
documented and respected.

However, recognition of prior rights has not been very effective thus resulting in conflicts and
confusion on the rights holders. In the case of ancestral domains, the registration of CADTs has
been put on hold in view of the need to extract titled properties and CLOAs that were issued
inadvertently by the agencies.

2.2.4 - For protected rural land use (forest, pastures, wetlands, national parks etc.) plans do
not correspond to actual use in about 30-50% of the cases - C

It is widely acknowledged that many portions of the public forests, protected areas, wetlands
are used for purposes that are in contravention with regulations on these lands. In Mindanao,
forestlands constitute 6 million hectares. However, only 23% of Mindanao has forest cover,
signaling massive conversion of the forestlands to other uses such as agriculture, and
settlements. Assuming these forests are in forestlands, only about 38% of forestlands are
covered with forests.

Wetlands such as Agusan Marsh and Ligawasan Marsh have also been subject to conversion.
Supposed to be protected to perform vital ecological functions, the absence of protection
measures in Ligawasan Marsh and the ineffectiveness of protection in Agusan Marsh have led to
agricultural development activities thus compromising the value of these important peatland
forests.

Protected areas have also suffered from conversion to other uses. In Mt Apo and Mt Kitanglad
for example, satellite maps on land cover and land use change analysis made by the USAID
Project entitled Biodiversity and Watersheds Improved for Economic Resilience (BWISER)
indicate portions of protected areas that have been converted to agriculture and other uses.

A study on 60 protected areas in the Philippines, 15 of which are from Mindanao concluded that
due to very limited budget, low capacities for implementation, and limited resources, the
following threats have been identified thus, resulting in weak management effectiveness of the
country’s protected area system 56:
      Increasing conversion of PAs for agriculture and other uses;
      Increasing encroachments, settlements and establishments;
      Unregulated tourism;
      Illegal extraction; and
      Lack of buy-ins and political interventions that are affecting land allocation and resource
        uses within PAs.

Summary and Recommendations

The assessment of dimensions made under this Module indicate that while restrictions on rural
land use were designed to meet public policy objectives, weaknesses in enforcement, lack of
resources and capacities of implementing agents mainly: DENR, DAR and NCIP have brought
about de facto situations which weakens the resource use rights of forestland occupants,
holders of common lands, and ancestral lands of indigenous peoples.

                                                                                                    57
Because forestlands constitute more than 60% of Mindanao’s land resources, and ancestral
domains cover more than 50% of the region’s forestlands, it is important that the systems and
procedures that are supposed to protect these rights be strengthened. Otherwise, rights holders
will not reap the benefits from improved productivity that secure tenure brings, and that
investments from outside parties will continue to be exposed to unnecessary risks. Otherwise,
these large tracts of land will be taken out of the production chain, or worse, the occupants
thereto will not be able to access the resources required to develop and protect these lands.

For forestlands, proper delineation of production and protection forests need to be made; at the
same time, undertake a systematic rights recognition of occupants to formalize their possessory
and resource use rights to forest resources. These need to be properly mapped, registered, and
conflicts/overlaps resolved.

In the case of ancestral domains, it is essential to accelerate the mapping, issuance and
registration of CADTs, and assist IP communities to develop quality ADSDPPs, as basis for
management of their domains.

Finally, adequate support should be given to the protection of national parks, reserves,
watershed reservations, conservation areas so that they can fulfill the public purpose for which
they were established. This would require completion of mapping and demarcation,
strengthening enforcement capacities, and development and implementation of quality
management and business plans for protected areas. This should be complemented by a
program to finalize the identification and establishment or protected areas in suitable sites to
avoid future conflicts in land use and management. This will remove uncertainties on the
eligibility of certain lands for productive use, and create a suitable investment for development
of eligible portions of the remaining public lands, forestlands and ancestral domains.

              requirements


LGI 3.1     Restrictions on rights: land rights are not conditional on adherence to
            unrealistic standards

3.1.1 - There are a series of regulations on urban land ownership/transfer that effectively
serve public purpose and that are enforced. – A



                                                                                                 58
In terms of titling, the Residential Free Patent specified limits to the number and size of parcels
that can be availed depending on the LGU class, in order to satisfy equity objectives. These are
as follows:
     for highly urbanized cities = not more than 200 sq. m.
     for other cities = not to exceed 500 sq. m.
     for first and second class municipalities = not exceeding 750 sq. m.
     for all other municipalities = not to exceed 1000 sq. m.

If the claims exceed these sizes, other modes of titling should be taken, which are more
expensive and takes more time to complete.

Each applicant is entitled only to one parcel under the law. Patents issued under this law have
no restrictions on transfers and mortgage.

To be eligible for residential free patent, the property must be located in areas zoned as
residential in the LGU CLUPs. However, it is common for local governments to issue a certificate
that the land is used as residential in cases where this condition is not met, and/or the CLUP is
not yet updated. The reasoning is, the issuance of title is primordial to improve tenure security
and improve urban land market activity. Thus, while the restrictions on lot ownership size
serves equity objectives, the tolerance for deviations from these standards effectively render
them not useful.

Davao city is engaged in residential titling through RA 10023, but based on demand. The CPDO
supports titling through the issuance of Certification that the lots are within residential zones
per the approved land use plan. Other cities, such as Cagayan de Oro, also has an earlier
initiative, but is not currently active. Other LGUs in Bukidnon have continuing Memorandum of
Agreements with DENR, following the completion of LAMP2, to undertake titling in their
respective municipalities and cities.

3.1.2 - There are restrictions on urban land use along identified riverbanks and easements
to reduce risks to natural disasters, but these are not effectively enforced. B

Civil Code, Water Code, National Building Code, and the Revised Forestry Code specified
restrictions on development along waterways and easements to meet environmental objectives,
and reduce exposure and damage from natural disasters. In 2014, the DENR, DILG, DOST and
DPWH issued a joint Circular defining the hazard areas in Yolanda affected areas. While there is
no official definition yet of danger zones, the Joint Circular can be used as starting point for the
development of clear guidelines for urban planning.

However, as in many urban centers in the Philippines, these restrictions are not fully enforced.
In fact in Mindanao cities, 74.7 % of ISF are in danger zones. The triggers are increasing
population in the urban areas due to poverty and landlessness in the rural areas, the high cost of
urban land, and lack of integrated urban land use planning and development.

Prohibition on settlements along danger zones has been a challenge for most LGUs. Even in
Metro Manila, there is an estimated 104,000 families living in river easements that is now the
subject of a Php 50 Billion Fund to resettle to safer grounds. This follows after the great flood
“Ondoy”. In Cagayan de Oro City, the local government has also embarked on a massive
program to relocate ISF along riverbanks and delta following the devastation from typhoon
“Sendong” in 2011.




                                                                                                 59
Central to the strategy to address this, along with the uncontrolled growth of informal
settlement communities is the development of an effective land use and inclusive urbanization
plan that allows for efficient use of space and identify lands for in city formalization of tenure
for ISF.

LGI 3.2 Transparency of land use restrictions: changes in land use and
        management regulations are made in a transparent fashion and provide
        significant benefits for society in general rather than just for specific
        groups

3.2.1 - Urban expansion and accelerated infrastructure development in Mindanao is
constrained by land rights issues among those affected. Existing policies for dealing with
land rights by those affected conform with international standards if these involve national
infrastructure projects only - C

In recent years, there has been a surge in infrastructure investment in Mindanao, in an effort to
correct the imbalance in investments for many years. Thus, for 2015, Mindanao has been
allocated the biggest allocation in the DPWH Php 300 billion budget. The allocation for
Mindanao is Php 63 Billion (US$ 1.45 Billion) or 30% of the agency’s total budget for
infrastructure program. Of these, Php 5.17 Billion will be allocated to ARMM. Under the WB
PRDP, the Mindanao region is also expected to receive P5.1 billion for 113 sub-projects.

NEDA reported however, that there have been delays in implementation of major infrastructure
projects in Mindanao due to road right of way problems. Among those facing road right of way
problems are road projects in Davao city, and in the provinces of Compostela Valley, Davao del
Sur and Davao del Norte. The problem on road right of way has also bogged down projects in
General Santos City.

Because of the absence of resettlement policy in the Philippines, it is expected that the way land
rights will be dealt with will be in accordance with RA 8974 in the case of expropriations
involving national infrastructure projects. This law has clear policies for compensation using
market rates, but not for income losses. For projects funded by the LGUs, the law that applies is
PD 1533 and EO 1035 that uses the assessed values as basis for valuation.

For unregistered properties, there is no legislation that provides for compensation. This is only
possible in the case of foreign assisted projects where resettlement action plans (RAPs) are
prepared, as basis for compensation. It is therefore essential that in order to speed up
infrastructure development, the recognition of rights be fast tracked, and ownership issues
clarified.

3.2.2 - Public input is sought in preparing and amending land use plans and the public
responses are used by the official body responsible for finalizing the new plans. The process
for doing this is in accordance with government guidelines but the report is not publicly
accessible. - B

Opportunities for engaging the public in the CLUP process are in the following stages:
    Formulation of the city Vision, Mission and Objectives
    Analysis of Existing Situation/Profiling
    Determination of Preferred Urban Form
    Land use allocation
    Development of zoning ordinance

While there are no publicly available reports (on the websites) on public consultations on the


                                                                                               60
CLUPs of major cities in Mindanao, the assistance of HLURB, NEDA, and other development
organizations in the formulation of their CLUPs ensure that the processes of soliciting public
input were followed.

In the case of Davao city for example, the CLUP formulation process in 2011 had more than 100
public consultations that were documented and submitted to HLURB. These however, are not
published in the City website, and therefore may be available only upon request.

3.2.3 - Approved requests for change in urban land use are swiftly followed by development
on these parcels of land – Not assessed

Based on the Philippines LGAF report, monitoring land use change based on their assigned use
is not yet widely practiced in the Philippines. Thus, it is very difficult to determine the rate of
change; and whether land use changes are in accordance with the plan or in spite of the plan.
Few isolated attempts at analyzing land use change as an integral part of the CLUP planning
process were undertaken in Dagupan City, Puerto Princesa City, and Quezon City, with varying
results and utility for CLUP updating.

It can be assumed that the speed of land use change is directly related to the rate of
urbanization. In Davao city, it is expected that there will be no change in land use for the next
five years, based on the City Resolution that approved the current CLUP.

LGI 3.3 Efficiency in the urban land use planning process: land use plans are
        current, implemented, do not drive people into informality, and cope
        with urban growth

3.3.1 - There is a policy for low cost housing and services but implementation has major
gaps so that the number of those with inadequate shelter actually increases - C

The national policy for low cost housing and services is provided in the Urban Development and
Housing Act (UDHA or RA 7279). However, there is an acknowledged shortfall in the provision
of housing and services to a large part of the country’s urban population, due to certain
inefficiencies, absence of long term ISF formalization program, difficulty in finding land,
affordability issues and institutional weaknesses. The national government, through Congress,
has initiated a process for progressively and comprehensively addressing these issues that will
culminate in a Housing and Urban Development Summit, planned in March 2016.

As of September 2015, the NHA has delivered a total of 48,547 housing units in Mindanao,
catering to low income and under privileged sections of the population.

While the government has an active housing program, it is acknowledged that this is not enough
in terms of scope and coverage to outpace the demand for formal housing units by the ISF. In
2011, the ISF in Mindanao is estimated at 221,755 or 14.7% of the total urban population. Of
these, about 75% or 165,727 families live in danger areas. Region 10 has the most number of
ISF among all the Mindanao regions (see Table 26).

3.3.2 - In Davao City, urban spatial expansion is guided effectively by an updated CLUP that
is consistent with the Mindanao Framework Plan - A

Davao is a rapidly urbanizing city in Mindanao, with urbanization rates increasing from 45% in
1970 to 79% in 2010. The MINDA 2020 provides the regional framework plan which cascades
into regional and provincial physical framework plans. LGUs refer to these in the preparation of
their own CLUPs that are now DRR and CCA sensitive.



                                                                                                61
Davao city has a current CLUP which is valid for 2013-2022.

LGI 3.4 Speed and predictability of enforcement of restricted land uses:
        development permits are granted promptly and based on reasonable
        requirements

3.4.1 - In major Mindanao cities, requirements to obtain a building permit57 are technically
justified, affordable, and complied with – A

Based on the World Bank Cost of Doing Business Study58, Mindanao cities rank high among the
other cities in terms of number of procedures to obtain a building permit. Three cities belong to
the top 5 of cities with the best construction permitting process (Davao, General Santos and
Zamboanga); with Davao as number 1.

A number of requirements have been identified as constraining the procedures for building
permit issuance:

During pre-construction, the entrepreneur has to obtain preparatory documents—such as the
certified true copy of the land title and of the tax declaration of real property, the barangay
clearance, the lot plan with the site map from the geodetic engineer, the locational clearance, the
building permit and ancillary permits, and the fire safety evaluation clearance. Except for Davao,
the following cities in Mindanao – Cagayan de Oro, Zamboanga, and General Santos
(together with other cities) have more procedural requirements during pre-construction than in
any other phase.

Some issues regarding building permit forms have yet to be clearly decided. Under the 2004
Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of the National Building Code, a building permit
application form must be notarized. However, because of a pending case in the Court of Appeals
questioning the legality of the 2004 rules, the Department of Public Works and Highways issued
a memorandum circular ordering the Office of the Building Official not to use the new forms
until the matter is resolved by the high court. Nevertheless, Zamboanga and General Santos
use the new forms, and thus require notarization.

3.4.2 - A construction permit for a commercial dwelling in key Mindanao cities can be
obtained within three to four months, which is faster than the national average.

The four major cities in Mindanao, which are being monitored by the WB in its Cost of Doing
Business report, all posted lower than national average time to obtain a commercial building
permit.

The most efficient is Davao City, which is ranked number 1 with only 27 procedures, while
General Santos City is ranked number 3, with 29 procedures.

During the panel workshops, Davao City officials reported that their Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP) is to release or act on all requests within 72 hours, or 3 working days.

These records show that there are serious efforts of Mindanao LGUs to increase
competitiveness and attract investments.

3.5.1 - The requirements for formalizing housing in Mindanao cities are clear, but these are
not straight-forward nor affordable, thus many applicants from informal areas are
managing to satisfy the requirements – between B and C

The national policy in the UDHA specified various options for formalizing housing for ISF. The
law identified the role of local governments in the implementation of socialized housing
programs, but the distinction with those of national government is not very clear.

The options are:
    Community initiated housing and on site development through savings mobilization and
       partnership with various organizations;
    LGU supported initiatives, using their own resources, in partnership with private sector
       through joint venture arrangements, Public Private sector Partnerships (PPPs), and
       other modes;
    National government supported initiatives – either from NHA, or through loans from the
       Socialized Housing Finance Corporation (SHFC) via the CMP or the high density housing
       program;
    Balanced housing development, through compliance of subdivision developers with
       provision of 20% of cost or area of their main subdivision projects to socialized housing
       projects.

The main vehicle has been through the Community Mortgage Program (CMP) of the SHFC, as the
main source of low cost finance to construct housing, purchase land, and/or develop the sites
where the ISF are located. However, access to financing has been beset with land related cases
which hinder the effective and timely disbursement of loans for ISF. The NHA administered
programs on the other hand, are also facing issues such as problematic Proclamations, and
delays in the issuance of Special Patent for government properties. Peoples’ Organization
representatives to the Housing and Urban Development Summit meetings have expressed their
lament over the difficulty and complexity of formalization, even in areas that have been
proclaimed by government for resettlement housing for ISF.

Mindanao cities have initiated efforts to address the housing backlog, particularly for ISF. 59
However, the estimated cumulative housing need for Mindanao is still high at 303,113 units as
of 2011.60

Davao City has a Shelter Code that guides its Local Shelter Board. This document however, has
not been formalized. The Board identifies on-site and off-site settlements, approves funding for
land purchase and guides the implementation of socialized housing projects. The Local Housing
Board also interacts with key national government housing agencies to collaborate on
implementation of housing projects. It has set up a 100 M fund for its Local CMP. Already, it has
identified 40 hectares of abandoned export processing zone as settlement site; and is active in
utilization of 20% balanced housing development.61 The city has tagged its ISF, and prospective
relocation sites selected.

Cagayan de Oro has an updated City Shelter Plan for 2014-2022. It estimated that it would need
700 hectares to formalize its ISF. In the aftermath of typhoon “Sendong”, the city has actively
implemented a resettlement program for displaced ISF, particularly those who were displaced
from their originally occupied riverbanks, easements and delta.

Zamboanga City has active resettlement plan for displaced families. This became acute after the
siege from Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) groups which destroyed houses of
thousands of families. Most of the displaced are still residing in temporary evacuation units for
lack of resettlement sites, particularly those who have no secure tenure in the urban city.

In majority of municipalities in the country, the shelter plan is simply a template and not
implemented either in the local budgetary provision or in line-up of proposed projects. Shelter
planning exercises are currently undertaken by HUDCC through its national and regional office.
Compliance with zoning areas for socialized housing purposes are reviewed to determine lands
classified for this purpose are accessible to public transport and suitable for development.

As in most urban centers in the Philippines, there remains unmet demand for decent and safe
housing for ISF in Mindanao.

Summary and Recommendations

As cities in Mindanao transition from agrarian to urban, land use planning and policies
will become even more important to ensure a sustainable city. Effective planning can help
manage urban growth, allocate land to its best use, contribute to food security, manage
migration, reduce informal settlement, minimize land dispute, control negative externalities
(e.g., congestion, pollution, crime), and raise revenues equitably and efficiently.

However, land use planning and zoning in the Philippines, including some Mindanao
cities, tend to be reactive. Overall, there is a rising concern that cities in the Philippines are not
fully functional places to live. Public investments in infrastructure and regulations on land use
for housing, commerce, and industry are spatially uncoordinated which reduces the connections
between workers and jobs, and residents and amenities, and adds to sprawl and related costs
from congestion and pollution. These result in the proliferation of informal settlement enclaves,
uncontrolled spatial development, and undue pressure on public investments and public
provision of services. Thus, Mindanao cities are experiencing increasing share of informality. In
2011, there were 221,755 informal settler families (ISF), which constitute about 15% of its
urban population. Restrictions on use and development on danger zones have left unchecked,
such that 75% of its informal settlers live in danger zones. While there have been housing
formalization programs, these are still not enough to fill the estimated 303,000 accumulated
housing demand as of 2011; which represent about 25% of the country’s total demand.
Moreover, urban expansion and infrastructure development in Mindanao is constrained to land
rights issues.

Cognizant of the negative consequences of the failure to plan land use, such as those in Manila
and Cebu, which are experiencing congestion, major Mindanao cities like Zamboanga is
proactively updating its comprehensive land use plans (CLUPS). For instance, Cagayan de Oro
City and Davao City updated in 2013 and 2014, respectively.

As magnets of investments, Mindanao’s major cities have also fared better compared to most
cities in the Philippines in terms of streamlining processes to register properties, and number of
days to issue a construction permit.

For Mindanao cities to be movers of growth in the region, it must address the issues of informal


                                                                                                   65
settlements, and implementation of land use regulations based on CLUPs. These cities must also
sustain the initiatives to improve efficiencies in service provision to ease doing business. In
addition to the key cities, such good practices should radiate to the other secondary cities in the
region.

4.4    Public Land Management
Assessment of Indicators

            Indicators Assessed:

            LGI 4.1 - Identification of public land and clear management

            LGI 4.2 - Justification and time efficiency of acquisition processes; the state
            acquires land for public interest only and this is done efficiently

            LGI 4.3 - Transparency and fairness of acquisition procedures: acquisition
            procedures are clear and transparent and fair compensation is paid
            expeditiously




LGI 4.1 - Identification of public land and clear management

4.1.1 - Public land ownership is justified by provision of public goods but management
responsibility is often at the wrong level of government. - C

The Constitution clearly stipulated that forestlands, mineral lands, and national parks shall form
part of the public domain and shall not be alienated.

PD 705 defines the major criteria for forestlands as those lands with 18% slope and over,
with minor exceptions such as if titles have been issued previously, or occupied continuously for
at least 30 years. The NAMRIA has completed the classification of public forests, and has
delineated the locations of the forest boundary. Proposals for Congress are being prepared to
legislate these boundaries, in accordance with the law. To date, there remain 755,009 hectares
of public forests that have not been classified as to whether these should remain as forestlands
or released as A&D lands. About 55% (414,913 hectares) of these remaining unclassified public
forests are in Mindanao; mainly in Region 12 and ARMM. Until a decision on these lands is
made, the forestlands in Mindanao are placed at 6,066,160 hectares. The location of forestlands
and A&D lands in Mindanao is presented in Figure 1.

The DENR, through its Forest Management Bureau and regional offices, is entrusted to manage
the forestlands. The agency disposes this function by granting resource use and tenure rights to
upland families, communities, and corporations to manage portions of identified production
forests. It has also established watershed reservations, and created multi-sectoral watershed
management councils and river basin management councils for more integrated approaches to
ecosystem management. The DENR also enters into co management agreements with LGUs and
supports them in the preparation of forestland use plans (FLUPs) to ensure integration of forest
management planning into the LGU. Recently however, the DENR suspended the co
management agreements with LGUs.

The identification of national parks or protected areas is guided by the NIPAS law of 1992
(RA 7586), which defines protected areas as “identified portions of land and water set aside by



                                                                                                66
reason of their unique physical and biological significance, managed to enhance biological
diversity and protected against destructive human exploitation”. The Philippines is one of the
17 megadiverse countries in the world which host 70-80% of the earth’s biodiversity. The
country’s richness is manifest by the extent of the key biodiversity areas that have been
identified to host globally threatened species, and as centers of endemism (Figure 10).

The DENR, through the Biodiversity Management Bureau and regional offices, is responsible for
the management of the protected area system. For each protected area, a multisectoral PA
Management Board (PAMB) is established to coordinate management of PAs with local
governments, other agencies and sectors. It also partners with local governments, indigenous
peoples, and private sector to recognize and support the designation of critical habitats, local
conservation areas, and indigenous community conserved areas (ICCAs).

Following the constitution, all mineral resources belong to the state. Managed mainly by
DENR through the Mines and Geosciences Bureau and its regional offices, the government
identifies mineral reservations and administers the issuance of exploration permits, mineral
production sharing agreements and financial and technical assistance agreements in the
utilization of mineral resources.

In addition to the above, the President issues Proclamations to assign responsibilities to other
agencies and instrumentalities, portions of public lands. In Mindanao, these total almost half a
million hectares (444,777 hectares).

management capacity.

There is room for greater involvement of local governments, and indigenous peoples in public
land management.

4.1.2 - In Mindanao, there is no complete recording of publicly held land. Only between 30%
and 60% of public land is clearly identified on the ground and on maps. C

The NAMRIA has completed the delineation and demarcation of forestland boundaries, except
ARMM. Moreover, more than 1.5 M hectares of tenured areas are not demarcated on the ground.
There are maps with the DENR, but these are not delineated on the ground. There are efforts
however, to undertake an integrated GIS mapping of all these rights awarded on forestlands.

Protected areas have also been delineated on the map. Only those with legislations however, are
to be demarcated on the ground. The absence of well-defined boundaries of PAs have also
caused confusion on their actual extent and coverage, thus resulting in occupation and
conversion of some parts to other uses. This causes problems on the part of the park managers
and staff in enforcement of PA laws.

In many instances, the lack of ground delineation of all these tenure instruments on forest lands
have been the reason for overlaps, conversion, occupation by others; thus creating conflicts on
the ground, and weak enforcement of use rights. This is compounded by the absence of common
projection maps on titles, rights, issued by other agencies or some agencies within the DENR
(CADTs by NCIP, Cadastral surveys by LMS within protected areas, etc.)

4.1.3 - Information on public land is not accessible to the public. - D

Most cadastral maps are not available to the public, thus affecting ability by LGUs to properly
plan and guide the DENR in its titling activities. There are inventories of tenure instruments and
agreements issued over portions of the forestlands, but maps are not readily available and not
in digital form. This is made worse by the multiplicity of agencies involved in public land
management.

The absence of these information has made it difficult for private sector to identify available
lands for investments.

4.1.4 - There is ambiguity in the assignment of management responsibility and capability
for different types of public land thus equity and efficiency are often not attained in practice
–C

Management of public lands are clearly assigned mainly to DENR (forests, mineral and
protected areas). NCIP and DAR to some extent, have management responsibilities in the
disposition of portions of public lands.

There is huge ambiguity however, in the disposition of alienable and disposable public lands,
which create a lot of confusion and generate conflicts.

The lack of integrated approach within DENR has resulted in conflicting issuances of leases and
concessions (MPSAs in KBAs) in areas with high conservation value, even if not yet declared
PAs.

Other agencies, such as NCIP and BMB-DENR have limited resources that greatly affect their
effectiveness in supporting ancestral domain delineation and management of PAs respectively.




                                                                                               72
4.1.5 - There are significant constraints in the financial and/or human resources capacity
which affect their performance of land management responsibilities - C

There has been significant infusion of resources to National Greening Program (NGP, Php 35
Billion over 6 years) to restore forest cover; and to the cadastral program to complete the
remaining un surveyed municipalities (Php 4.5 Billion). The NGP has supported quite a good
number of upland communities in improving their incomes. However, not much resources were
given to securing resource use rights of remaining upland communities.

There has been limited allocation to the management of PAs that has severely impacted on the
protection and investments in putting up of required facilities. Traditionally, PA management
receive less than 5% of DENR allocation.

NCIP is severely understaffed with very limited budget such that over the last 3 years, very few
CADTs were processed. There are also severe funding constraints in operating budgets which
impact on their ability to support IP communities, facilitating FPIC, and provide other services
to IP communities.

4.1.6 - Key information for public land allocations (the locality and area of the land
allocations, the parties involved and the financial terms of the allocation) is recorded or
partially recorded but it is not publicly accessible. – C

Only Region 10 makes available on its website, the list of long term leases and agreements it has
issued on forestlands. However, the financial terms are not published in the website.

The MGB lists on its website, all permits and MPSAs, and FTAAs it has issued, including locations
and duration of operations. The financial terms are not published in the website.

For purposes of transparency and accountability, it is important that these information be made
available so that the public can also participate in monitoring of performance of leaseholders.
These information are also essential for investors looking for land and for those who would be
interested in joint venture arrangements with those who already have tenure instruments.

NOTE: For indicators 4.2 and 4.3, the Phil LGAF was not able to access data from DPWH
and PRA, thus the assessment was not complete. The following were based on the Phil
LGF results.

LGI 4.2 - Justification and time efficiency of acquisition processes; the state
           acquires land for public interest only and this is done efficiently

4.2.1 - Laws provide that expropriation be used solely for public interests, but there is no
monitoring of transfers of expropriated lands - A

In the Philippines, expropriation of private property is solely for public use and interests. In the
absence of data however, on transfers of all expropriated land in the country, it is difficult to
determine whether portions of these were transferred to private interests. Data on
expropriation are scattered among many agencies, and there is very little monitoring on the
extent of expropriated land, the amount of compensation, promptness of compensation, and use
of expropriated land. These data are also not publicly accessible.

Some reporting and monitoring mechanisms need to be in place to keep track of this function of
government. LGUs are also authorized to expropriate by virtue of the LGC, and have done so, for
purposes of establishing low cost housing projects, or settlement projects for informal settlers.



                                                                                                 73
A few isolated cases have been reported about LGUs transferring expropriated land for
commercial purposes, but these need to be more fully documented. The extent to which
portions of these have been transferred for private use is still undetermined.

4.2.2 - There are delays in the transfer of expropriated properties to their destined use - C

Speed of use of expropriated land is affected by delays owing to project approvals, negotiations,
release of budgets, payments, particularly for foreign assisted projects. Thus, the panel opined
that it is safe to say that less than 50% of expropriated land have been transferred to their
destined use in the last three years. This does not augur well for good governance.

4.2.3 - The threat of land acquisition lead to pre-emptive action by private parties - B

Under the CARP, and under the agreement between DAR and LRA, all parcels subject to
coverage have been isolated, and marked. This is to prevent further transaction on the property
while the acquisition process is on going. DAR clearance is required if there are applications for
subdivision of the subject properties or transfers of ownership. DAR has also published the list
of parcels affected by CARP coverage, called its Notice of Coverage. There is also a list of
landholdings without notice of coverage.

However, there are anecdotal reports of properties covered by notices that have been
successfully transacted at the RoD. These are few, but needs to be carefully monitored in order
to determine the extent of the practice, and obtain remedies.

LGI 4.3 - Transparency and fairness of acquisition procedures: acquisition
          procedures are clear and transparent and fair compensation is paid
          expeditiously

4.3.1 - There is inconsistency in the values used to compensate expropriated properties - C

Only national infrastructure projects have clear policies for expropriation and compensation
using market rates (RA 8974). There is currently no policy to provide compensation for income
losses. In the case of national infrastructure projects, the BIR zonal value is used as basis for
valuation despite the fact that there are other standards cited in said law for valuing land. For
other projects, the policies that apply are PD 1533 and EO 1035 which uses the values declared
by the owner/administrator or as determined by the Assessor pursuant to the Real Property
Tax Code, whichever is lower, as basis for compensation. These values are way below market
rates, in some cases undervalued by as much as 1000%; due to the outdated LGUs’ schedule of
market values; and because SMVs are not based on market prices. These amounts will not
enable the affected property owner to find replacement property of equal value.

For unregistered properties, there is no legislation that provide for compensation. In the case of
foreign assisted projects where resettlement action plans (RAPs) are prepared, these types of
compensation are recommended. The types and estimates of compensation therefore, very
depending on the policy of the donor institution on RAPs. The lack of legislation has also
affected consistency in implementation. There were even cases where DPWH ROW agents
encounter difficulties due to disallowances by the Commission on Audit.

4.3.2 - Where people lose rights as a result of land use change outside the acquisition
process, compensation is not paid. - D

Establishment of protected areas recognizes prior rights, but only for those which are duly
recognized (e.g., titles, mining permits). For informal occupants of protected areas, they are not
displaced nor compensated, but given long-term tenurial instruments.


                                                                                                74
4.3.3 - Only national infrastructure projects pay prompt compensation for expropriated
properties - C

There are varying provisions in existing laws with regard to the promptness of compensation.
Most favored are expropriated properties of national infrastructure projects, wherein based on
RA 8974, 100% payment should be made immediately to the owners. Payment is based on the
value of the property based on the current relevant zonal valuation of the Bureau of Internal
Revenue (BIR). Payment shall also include the replacement cost of improvements and/or
structures upon filing of the complaint and after due notice.

For projects other than national infrastructure and those projects of the LGUs, property owners
are not compensated promptly. In the case of the former, PD 1533 and EO 1035 provide that the
government can immediately take possession, control, and disposition of the property upon
payment of 10% of the assessed value of the property based on the tax declaration of the owner.
In the case of projects of LGUs, the applicable law is RA 7160 that allows the LGUs to take
possession of the property upon payment of 15% of the value of the property based on the tax
declaration.

4.3.4 - Independent avenues to lodge a complaint against acquisition exist but there are
access restrictions (i.e. only accessible by mid-income and wealthy) – B

There is no national resettlement policy that embodies, aside from proper and prompt
compensation and entitlements, grievance redress and sustainable livelihood restoration and
improvement program. This policy should apply uniformly to all types of government projects,
regardless of the funding source, and the level of who executes it. Such grievance redress system
should also be accessible and affordable to poor property owners affected by expropriation.
This is made worse by RA 8975 which prohibits the lower courts to issue temporary restraining
orders (TRO), preliminary injunctions, or preliminary mandatory injunctions on national
government infrastructure projects. While DPWH has a Land Acquisition, Resettlement,
Rehabilitation and Indigenous Peoples Policy (LARRIP); it is not founded on legislation, but an
Administrative Order issued by the agency. Hence, it has no legislative basis, and therefore,
subject to audit interpretations anytime. There is a National Resettlement Implementation Plan
(NRIP) which was produced in 2003 through WB support; but this needs updating.

The property owner, as part of its constitutional rights may lodge an appeal trough the proper
courts, or even the President of the Republic, but as described below, by virtue of Section 11 of
Rule 67, said appeal cannot cause any delay on the right of the IA to enter and secure the
property for public use or purpose.

R. A. 8975, states that:
“No court, except the Supreme Court, shall issue any temporary restraining order, preliminary
injunction or preliminary mandatory injunction against the government, or any of its subdivisions,
officials or any person or entity, whether public or private acting under the government direction,
to restrain, prohibit or compel the following acts:
(a) Acquisition, clearance and development of the right-of-way and/or site or location of any
national government project;
(b) Bidding or awarding of contract/ project of the national government as defined under Sec. 2
hereof;
(c) Commencement prosecution, execution, implementation, operation of any such contract or
project;
(d) Termination or rescission of any such contract/project; and
(e) The undertaking or authorization of any other lawful activity necessary for such
contract/project.


                                                                                                75
This prohibition shall apply in all cases, disputes or controversies instituted by a private party,
including but not limited to cases filed by bidders or those claiming to have rights through such
bidders involving such contract/project. This prohibition shall not apply when the matter is of
extreme urgency involving a constitutional issue, such that unless a temporary restraining order is
issued, grave injustice and irreparable injury will arise. The applicant shall file a bond, in an
amount to be fixed by the court, which bond shall accrue in favor of the government if the court
should finally decide that the applicant was not entitled to the relief sought.

If after due hearing the court finds that the award of the contract is null and void, the court may, if
appropriate under the circumstances, award the contract to the qualified and winning bidder or
order a rebidding of the same, without prejudice to any liability that the guilty party may incur
under existing laws.”

Summary and Recommendations

In Mindanao, 60% of the total land area is kept public in order to fulfill aim of providing public
goods. However, weak institutional capacities have left many of these lands heavily encroached
upon and not fulfilling their purposes. Only 34% of the region’s forestlands (or 2 million
hectares) are still covered with forests, while only half a million hectares of closed canopy
forests remain. The lack of delineation between production and protection forests, and the
incomplete recording of publicly held lands also make it difficult to attract investments in these
vast tracts of lands.

There are also nine agencies involved in public land management namely: DENR (including its
Lands Management Bureau, Forest Management Bureau, Mines and Geosciences Bureau, and
the Biodiversity Management Bureau), DAR, BFAR, NCIP, and LRA/RoD. The fact that each of
these agencies have their own mandates, are governed by different sets of policies without
specific areas of jurisdiction and no clear boundary of operation has made management of
public lands a very complex undertaking.

In order to unleash the potential of these lands, it is important that a common spatial
framework be adopted by all agencies; make all public land information readily accessible; and
strengthen budget and resource provision for agencies such as NCIP and DENR to complete the
mapping and confirmation of rights to IP communities and public land occupants.

             5.1 Transfer of public land to private use follows a clear, transparent, and
             competitive process and payments are collected and audited (with the

5.1    Transfer of public land to private use follows a clear, transparent, and
       competitive process and payments are collected and audited (with the
       exception of transfers to improve equity such as land distribution and land
       for social housing).

5.1.1 - The share of public land disposed of in the past 3 years through sale or lease through
public auction or open tender process is between 50% and 70% - C

Per DENR DAO 42, series of 1991, and DENR DAO 59, series of 2004, all portions of public
forestlands are to be disposed of through IFMA and Forest Land Agreements (Flag) through
competitive bidding.

While there are no data available to support estimates of the number of public land leases which
went through public auction, it is widely acknowledged that the award of long term leases is
based on applications made by potential investors requiring large tracts of land; thus the
opportunity for bidding is limited.

Expired pasture lands/grazing lands for re-applications within ancestral domain require FPIC
and clearance from NCIP; in Region 10, 49 percent expired pasture lands and for re-applications
needs NCIP clearance and FPIC.

5.1.2 - Between 50% and 70% of the total agreed payments are collected from private
parties on the lease of public lands – C

5.1.3 - Public land is rarely or never leased (divested) at market prices, in order to attract
investments on forest development - D

There are no available information on collection of payments for leases of public lands. For
fishpond lease agreements, rentals are not collected on time. BFAR Region 10 records show
that total receivables from fishpond holders amounted to Php 20.4 Million until 2014.

On the other hand, the report of DENR – 10 License, Patent and Deed Division (as of Jan 2015)
states that existing pasture land leases/permittees have “satisfactorily complied with terms and
conditions of the lease agreement”.

Moreover, lease rentals are very cheap so that it is more expensive to collect that the cost of
potential collection. These are part of incentives given by government to encourage
investments in sustainable forest management and production.

For industrial forest management agreements, the rental is as follows 62:
  No rental during the first five (5) years from date of the issuance of the agreement
  From the sixth year to the tenth year, the annual rental shall be fifty (P0.50) centavos per
   hectare
  Thereafter, the annual rental shall be one peso (P1.00) per hectare.

Guided by equity objectives, leasing out of public forestlands through CBFMAs is exempted from
rental payments.63 The incentives include: (i) exemption from paying rent for use of CBFMA

5.1.4 - Mechanisms to allow the public to capture benefits from changing land use are
rarely used and applied in a discretionary manner – C

The assessment made in the Philippines LGAF is presented here, since the same policies apply
to Mindanao.

The Philippines rates poorly in this dimension. The implementation of relevant policies to
enable public capture of benefits arising from changes in permitted land use has largely been
ignored; thereby resulting in some members of society unduly benefitting from these. At best,
such benefits are captured in changes in property tax assessment, but because the LGU schedule
of market values is way below the true market values and almost always out of date, this does
not materialize. Full implementation of this law will also prevent those with vested interest to
unduly influence the location of major public infrastructure projects for their benefit. In a
similar way, compensation for expropriated properties or those affected by ROW or other
government projects are not compensated fairly.

There are at least three beneficiaries from whom benefits of public works investments should
be captured for the public: the general consumers; the direct users of the facility; and the
landowners within the immediate vicinity of the public improvement project. The mechanisms
of capture are the consumption tax, user fees and charges, and the special benefit assessment,
respectively. The first two are in active use in the Philippines; the third mechanism, though
authorized by existing laws, is hardly applied at all.

The law on special benefit assessment or betterment levy has been in existence for nearly three-
quarters of a century. It first appeared in the Assessment Law (Commonwealth Act 470) dated
June 16, 1939. The same provision was carried over in two other subsequent laws. The special
assessment provision was contained in Sections 47-55 of the Real Property Tax Code
(Presidential Decree 464) of 1974, then it appeared again as Sections 240-245 of the 1991 Local
Government Code (Republic Act 7160. So far there are no records of its application in any part
of the country. While some countries, notably Colombia, Mexico, and some states of the United
States of America, finance substantial portions of their public works projects through this tax,
the Philippines has not even tried to tap this veritable gold mine.

A variation of the betterment levy is however observed to be rampant in the Philippines. This
refers to the practice of landowners donating a portion of their land for use as a site for public
institutions such as a school, a health center, a barangay hall, and the like, in obvious
anticipation of windfalls in the form of business opportunities to be generated by the
government project in the immediate vicinity as well as in terms of increases in the value of the
remaining portion of their property. In such a transaction, the government does not find it
necessary to capture for the public the land value increment because it did not have to pay
compensation to the land owner in the first place. The Filipino localism for this practice is
“quits”. The Americans have an equivalent practice which they aptly call “wipeouts for
windfalls”.

The only mechanism for public capture of the benefits of changed land use from landowners is
the real property tax. But the benefits are not captured in real time due to the fact that land
value assessment is not done systematically and regularly. The very wide discrepancy between
the LGU schedule of market values and the current market values can hardly make up for the

63 Section 2 of DENR ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER NO. 96-29; Rules and Regulations for the Implementation of
Executive Order 263, Otherwise Known as the Community-Based Forest Management Strategy (CBFMS)


                                                                                                 78
difference in terms of public capture of benefits through property taxes.

It is therefore about time that the government should enforce the existing provisions of sections
240-245 of RA 7160 or the Local Government Code, pertaining to special assessment. The BLGF
can assist in developing specific guidelines and appropriate training for LGU Assessors on these.

5.1.5 - Policy to improve equity in asset access and use by the poor and marginalized groups
is in place but is not enforced - C

The CBFM Program, the issuance of CSCs, Tree Farms, and CADTs are mechanisms by which the
poor and marginalized have equal access to public land as assets of production.

Similarly, portions of public lands, such as those held by the National Development Corporation,
have been distributed to farm workers through the CARP. Since the program started, a total of
1.063 Million hectares of public lands have been distributed in Mindanao.

However, the benefits that poor communities are supposed to enjoy are threatened by
inefficiencies due to overlaps in mandates among agencies, and weaknesses in implementation.
Investors had difficulties in identifying land and the rightful landholders, due to property rights
that are unclear (in the case of individual beneficiaries of collective CLOAs); imperfect (in the
case of untitled lands); or questionable (in the case of CLOAs issued in lands that do not meet the
criteria; CBFMs that are in conflict with ancestral domain lands). These situations compromise
the intent of the law.

On collective CLOAs, DAR proposed that the poor be allowed to improve access on 2 conditions:
1) be with other poor (form a group) and 2) group to propose to use land based on the options
allowed by the government. However, this would require investments in capital, strengthening
of the organization, which are not currently in place among the beneficiary groups of CLOAs.

5.2    Private investment strategy

5.2.1 – A policy to identify land that can be made available to investor exists, based on ad
hoc assessment of land potential and limited consultation with communities and is applied
in more than 90% of identified cases – C

Within public forestlands, there is a policy to clearly identify land that can be made available to
investors through the IFMA (DENR DAO 92, series of 1991). This is based on assessment of land
potential, community consultation, and consultation with LGUs. However, this is not
systematically being done. There is no active program that provides information on the location
of land where investments can be made. Investors are finding out that even in areas offered by
DENR as being available, these are occupied by communities, are covered with conflicts, and
some have existing tenure instruments. Investors would have to allocate resources and
negotiate with the occupants before any meaningful area development planning can take place.
(see Box 1).




                                                                                                79
           Box 1. A Case of Large Scale Investment in Forestlands (Davao del Norte)

          The case is about an investment by San Miguel Corporation and Kouk group of Malaysia to
 develop large tracts of denuded and degraded forestlands in Davao del Norte for food production
 under a Joint Venture Agreement. This was part of the government’s food security program. In all,
 the venture covered the Davao del Norte Municipalities of Kapalong with 3,246 hectares; San
 Isidro- 5,860 hectares; Talaingod- 7,860 hectares; and New Corella- 1,552 hectares; for a total
 Project Area of 18,495 consisting of four (4) separate parcels of forest lands. The Project Area will
 be developed for the production oil palm / forest trees, cassava, and other appropriate crops under
 the framework of DENR’s Upland Agroforestry Program and its implementing guidelines pursuant
 to DENR Administrative Order No. 2005-25. The Memorandum of Agreement was signed in 2008.

          The formulation of the agroforestry development plan involved more detailed
 investigation of the area, where it was found out that although without secure tenure, most of the
 forestlands are under de facto management by local claimants/communities. Most of these areas
 are actively being cultivated by local farmers (under various forms of claims). Some areas even
 have land titles already (CLOA), and are supposed to have been set aside as land grants for specific
 purpose (i.e. Land Grant for the Girl Scouts of the Philippines). But not all areas are optimally used
 or cultivated. The situation called for adoption of suitable institutional arrangements and
 resolution of land tenure issues, including benefit sharing.

Investments in ancestral domains are supposedly secured through FPIC, and negotiations with
CADT holders. Unifruti in Mt. Kitanglad, Bukidnon may be cited as a good practice.
Unfortunately, this is not happening in other similar initiatives. In other cases, IP communities
are leasing out portions of their domain to private individuals and small corporations to
generate income, but prove mutually beneficial.

Areas identified for mining overlap with other rights and have caused conflicts with LGUs, IP
communities and other local communities. Although FPIC is required in areas within ancestral
domains, MGB, with minimal consultations, identified mineral reservations. This has created
confusion and conflicts. Under EO79, no go zones for mining have been identified.

During the panel discussions, private sector representatives lamented the lack of an active
program to provide sufficient support to encourage investments involving large tracts of land.
In CARP covered areas, the alternative is to engage with collective CLOA holders, but many of
them are not organized. To quote the comments of private sector representatives to the panel
workshop: “Even if land is found, the main issue is the clarity of rights – who do we enter into
contract to”?

5.2.2 - Process is in place but many investments go ahead that are either not according to
the policy or despite unfavorable outcomes - C

For mining investments, the law explicitly prohibits mining in old growth forests, national
parks, and other areas considered protected. Likewise, no ancestral lands shall be opened for
mining operations without the prior consent of the ICC concerned (section 16, Mining Act).
There are however, complaints about how this is implemented in practice.

Section 17 of the Mining Act also specified royalty payments for Indigenous Cultural
Communities. - In the event of an agreement with an indigenous cultural community pursuant to
the preceding section, the royalty payment, upon utilization of the minerals shall be agreed upon
by the parties. The said royalty shall form part of a trust fund for the socioeconomic well being of
the indigenous cultural community.


                                                                                                          80
For some large-scale investments in areas covered by collective CLOAs under the AVAs;
investments proceed even with uneven distribution of benefits to beneficiaries. For example:
the former NDC owned areas in Agusan del Sur, which is under long term lease with Guthrie
Corporation, the rental is only P635 per hectare per year, plus P3,000 economic benefits per
year and employment in the company. These agreements were executed before the DAR was
able to issue guidelines on the distribution of such lands; and the manner of granting collective
CLOAs. There are efforts now to negotiate the terms, and facilitate the identification of families
covered in the collective CLOAs.

In the case of leaseback arrangements facilitated through AVA, there are many complaints from
the communities: unfair benefit, land displacement, labor issues, environment. Policies are there
but in practice favors better the investors.

5.2.3 - Institutions involved in transferring land to investors are clearly identified but lack
either capacity or incentives in ensuring socially beneficial outcomes or their decisions are
not always implemented. C

There are two agencies taking the lead in promoting investments in Mindanao: Board of
Investments (BOI) and the Mindanao Development Authority (MinDA).

BOI provides incentives (i.e. tax holidays, tax exemptions, employment of foreign nationals, etc.)
and low cost of doing business (i.e. low labor wages compared to US) among other incentives. It
also offers a Business One-Stop Shop Action Center (BOSSAC) that facilitates transactions. For
agri-business, it targets areas: “those undeveloped alienable and disposable lands, ancestral
domains and CARP lands”.

MinDA promotes Investment Corridors in Mindanao identifying areas along development
clusters such as Food Basket Cluster and Food, Agribusiness, Industry and Logistics Cluster.

Other agencies administering land, including LGUs, assist in the process. But there is really no
such thing as “transferring” land. Usually, the arrangement is for long-term leases and
concessions given out by agencies to investors. There is a need for BOI and MinDA to coordinate
more with these agencies.

More importantly, the DENR is in charge of approving long-term leases, and identifying portions
of the forestlands that could be made available for investors. However, they are not fully
equipped, there is no such inventory of lands that could be made available, the information is
not widely promoted, and that occupants in these areas do not have tenure or have their rights
recognized which make it difficult for investors to negotiate.

5.2.4 - Public bodies transferring land to investors do not share information and coordinate
to minimize and resolve overlaps (including sub-soil). D

The Joint NCIP-DOJ-DENR-DAR Administrative Order is supposed to further avoid overlaps in
the issuance of titles/claims. However, this has essentially frozen further registration of CADTs,
as the overlaps or conflicts that were discovered in the process have not been resolved.

It is common knowledge that in many places in Mindanao, there are overlaps between CADTs,
CLOA, CBFM, and mining areas awarded for exploration, and even in national parks. These are
to be addressed on a case-to-case basis and there is no policy yet to resolve overlaps in areas
affected before the issuance of the JAO.




                                                                                               81
Coordination among land administering agencies is weak. For instance, while Bukidnon has the
highest classified fishponds, no FLA permits were issued by DA-BFAR. Similarly, FLA permits
are issued in regions where DENR has no classified fishponds.

At the regional level (Region X), the Regional Land Use Committee of the Regional Development
Council/NEDA is tasked to resolve these issues but after years of discussions and debates
nothing substantial has been accomplished. These agencies have their own respective mandates
and jurisdictions as legislated by Congress and are not willing to arrive at useful and
implementable compromises.

5.2.5 - Monitoring of compliance is limited or only part of the results are accessible to the
public – C

Monitoring of compliance is partly carried out but remedial action is not carried out.

Lease rentals are not collected on time. Based on the records of BFAR-10, the total receivables
from fishponds leaseholders amounted to PhP 20.4 million until 2014. On the other hand, the
report of DENR-X License, Patent, Deed Division (as of Jan 2015) states that existing pasture
land leasees/permittees have “satisfactorily complied with terms and conditions of lease
agreement”. And yet, reports abound on permits and licenses issued for a specific purpose
differ from the actual use of the land.

Minimal staff, huge coverage and resource constraints undermine quality of program
implementation.

5.2.6 - Safeguards to reduce the risk of negative effects from large-scale land-related
investments (EIA, SIA, etc.) are partly in line with global best practice and are applied only
in an ad-hoc manner. – Between C and D

The Philippine Environmental Policy prescribes guidelines for EIA and compliance with
environmental standards. Under DAR AO9, conditions for approval of any agribusiness venture
agreements include social safeguards and environmental considerations in the use of
agricultural technology.

Implementation of these policies, however, is to some extent discretionary. Compliance
mechanisms are generally weak. This is associated with the fact that compliance monitoring is
financed by the investor, which can become self - serving. The same arrangement holds true in
securing FPIC. There have been reported cases of development projects proceeding without
FPIC, or with FPIC but have been improperly secured – either by not following the process, or
from IP leaders who do not represent the community. These have caused confusion and conflict
among the community members and between the community and investors.

On mining – there are safeguards defined in policy, but again, monitoring is weak. There have
been frequent complaints by LGUs and indigenous peoples of violations and environmental
damages; but these do not seem sufficient to stop or suspend their operations.

5.2.7 - Resettlement policy exists, but is only in part of the cases applied. - C

All large-scale agricultural investments are not supposed to result in resettlement or
displacement. This is not encouraged, nor made a condition for approval.

However, developers/investors are required in their cost-benefit plan to provide relocations for
affected communities. For example, STEAG has a relocation site but is insufficient.



                                                                                                82
There have been cases where in the process of asserting rights to land, which are subject to
conflicts with other rights (mining, CADT, IFMA), IP communities have been displaced.

5.3     Policy implementation is effective, consistent and transparent and involves
       local stakeholders

5.3.1 - Investors' business plans (application materials) require some evidence of technical
viability, community consultation, and availability of resources but this is insufficient to
effectively identify project risk ex ante – C

On the part of DTI, business plans are not required for investment clearance. The role of DTI is
to facilitate dialogues with affected farmers.

On the part of the Chamber, there needs to be an entity to whom the business plans should be
explained, aside from the community. Having an honest broker such as an NGO should be in
place in order to properly translate the proposed terms and conditions of contracts in a way
that the community will fully understand.

For leaseback arrangements under agribusiness venture arrangements (AVA) of collective
CLOAs, technical viability, community consultations and availability of resources are not
required. CLOA holders negotiate freely with investors, in which case, all members in the CLOA
should be able to give their consent to the investment proposal. The same holds true for
negotiations with IP communities, but in their case, the FPIC is required.

The experience of some agrarian reform beneficiaries (ARBs) who are recipients of collective
CLOAs in AVAs through the lease arrangements might be useful at this point. In the case of two
ARB groups in Impasug-ong in Bukidnon; farmers settled for very low rental rates (Php 12,000
per hectare per year) for fear of losing land due to accumulated unpaid amortizations. The
farmers found themselves not having enough to sustain their daily requirements, but were
satisfied by the prospect of keeping their land. Other cooperatives are more fortunate, since
they were able to negotiate better terms in the end experiencing improved socio economic
status.64

In this case, the key is the ability of the ARBs to fully understand the terms of the agreement,
and capacity to negotiate the terms. It does not help though, if the ARB is in “distress” (e.g.,
under threat of being in default in loan repayment).

Another example is the experience of the coop which entered into an agreement with NDC
owned property with Guthrie Malaysia where farmers were paid only Php 635 per hectare per
year for a 19 year contract. While there are other benefits such as profit share, etc., the farmers
attest that they do not fully understand these terms. The coop has since delisted their Officers
for mismanagement and on the charge that they fully sided with the corporation. 65

Other ARB groups are more fortunate, who experienced improved incomes and socio economic
benefits after the plantation became fully owned and managed by the coop. In addition to

having a more mature and functioning organization, other success factors include the sheer
commitment of the members to manage the plantation instead of engaging into leaseback
agreements, the fair terms offered by the company, support of an NGO, and having former
company officers and managers as ARB members contrary to DAR guidelines. The latter was
instrumental in bringing the organization onto a financially viable path, and introducing sound
management principles in the affairs of the coop66.

For investments in public lands and development of natural resources such as IFMAs and
agroforestry lease agreements, indicative management plans, proof of financial capacity are
required.

5.3.2 - The review process for investment application related documents is not uniform and
stable over time; in most cases approval is received after more than 9 months from date of
submission – Between B and C

There are existing guidelines for investors on doing business in the country. BOI provide
guidelines and cost of doing business in the country, (from business registration, investing in
PEZA, information on rates of transport, wages, freights, etc.), see
http://investphilippines.gov.ph/. DTI explained during the panels that applications are
processed with various agencies (example: DENR for EIA), and then reviewed and approved by
BOI if covered by incentives. The Chamber however complained that processing time is a
moving target, and that there are new requirements all the time. In this regard, the
establishment of One Stop Shop (OSS) was recommended.

Aside from business registration, investing on public lands (forest lands) follows DENR
guidelines. For example, in IFMA, investor must apply, pay application fee ranging from 12k -
25k (for 500-has up to 20K-has) at the CENRO, submit plan to secure ECC, validated by PENRO
and submitted to RED for recommendation to Central Office. Central Office approves or dis-
approves application (DENR –AO 97-04).

Also, if investment happens to be within CADT areas, investors undergo FPIC process as
mandated by NCIP, aside from the processes of DENR.

                                Figure 11. Procedures for Investing in Forestlands

In a 2004 study by University of the Philippines Los Banos (UPLB) on regulatory procedures for
forest management agreements, the following key findings related to application requirements
were identified67:
     Different application fees for various forest management agreements;
     Additional documents required by the different levels of the hierarchy due to differing
        interpretations of policy statements, in turn leading to delays in processing and
        approval. This happens despite the DAOs that have been issued that specified the
        requirements for each.
     Difficulty in securing LGU endorsement thereby causing delays in the processing of
        applications.
     There are too many levels of authority involved in the processing of applications for
        various types of forest management agreements at the DENR, thereby causing delays
        and raising transaction costs on the part of applicants. Sometimes it takes more than a
        year before forest management agreements are fully processed. Several respondents
        claimed they spent large amounts in transactions with various levels of the DENR
        hierarchy for their documents to move from one level to another before these were
        finally approved.
     Too centralized approval/issuance of various forest management agreements.

The study recommended streamlining and harmonization of procedures among the various
forest management agreements to improve transparency, accountability and participatory
decision making.

5.3.3 - Those holding rights to land with potential for investment have clearly defined rights
and incentives to properly negotiate but opportunities to obtain relevant information and
assistance at reasonable cost are limited. – C

In public lands, many of the occupants have no secure rights to land, and therefore they do not
have the incentives and rights to negotiate with investors. In the case of ancestral domains, IP
communities in areas where CADTs have not been issued have weakened negotiating rights
with potential investors.

Cases documented on contract negotiations reveal that while right holders negotiate freely,
their capacity in appreciating the intricacies of the provisions of the contract, especially for
long-term contracts, may be insufficient. There are a number of cases where right holders
realize the terms are unfavorable and opt to end or amend the contracts.

For growership contracts and leaseback agreements on CARP lands, some CLOA holders change
their minds after a few years. Recommendations include shortening the contract period from
15-20 years in the case of contract growing to 5-10 years and for leaseback arrangement from
30 years to 15 years renewable every five years. (refer to discussion above, as cited in footnotes
59-62).

For investments or joint ventures between IP communities and investors, IP communities
negotiate freely, but more often they do not have full access to relevant information. In many
cases, IP communities have been wary of representations made by investors unless there is
assistance from NGOs, or trusted officers from government agencies.

The DTI reported during the panels that there is disclosure by investors, but these are not made
fully. Moreover, based on the value chain studies commissioned by WB for the MJR, a common
problem is that farmers are not fully aware of the terms of the agreement, and that companies
do not want to fully disclose.

The two central issues here are the following:

First, while rights holders have defined rights, the poor performance of agencies confirming
these rights has placed in question, the clarity of these rights. Issues of inclusion and exclusion
among ARBs in collective CLOAs, the overlaps in issuance of tenurial instruments, and questions
on the eligibility of beneficiaries have placed some doubts on whether the investor is
negotiating with the proper rights holder.

Second, even if rights holders negotiate freely, the effectiveness of negotiations being equitably
beneficial to both parties depends very much on the capacity of the rights holders to understand
and assess the terms of agreement presented to them. Thus, it has become common for ARBs
and IP communities for example, to request for review or amendment of existing agreements. In
CARP covered areas, DAR personnel provide technical assistance to ARBs during the negotiation
process, even if they are not party to the agreement. However, in some cases, their participation
is not welcome either by the community or the investor partner.

This situation does not only contribute to creating conflict within the community, but also adds
to the risks and transaction costs of the investors.

There needs to be some standards that both the government and private sector can adhere to in
terms of the minimum set of information that should be made available to the rights holders in
order for negotiations to be seen as transparent and accountable.

5.3.4 - The majority of contractual arrangements do not include information on benefit
sharing – D

For AVA, the negotiations usually take place between the company and the coop Board, and


                                                                                                86
therefore the rest of the members are not always fully aware of the terms of agreement. The
presence of benefit sharing clauses depends very much on the willingness of the company to
include these provisions in the agreement. The agreements also vary widely across companies,
even if operating in the same area.

Farmers engaged in long-term contracts find themselves locked in for very low land rental rates
for a very long time, without provision for increases. In some cases, the price of banana is fixed
for a few years. Companies are also not willing to share the buying price of coffee and cacao.
Some companies would even recover from CLOA holders, the cost of road within the plantation
even if these are supposed to be public goods.

In a report on the series of focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted on AVAs in Region XI
participated by various stakeholders including ARBs, investors and government agencies for
growership, benefit sharing was discussed but some information were withheld. In lease, and
leaseback contracts, discussions focused on land rental but investors’ income and liabilities
were not disclosed. For growership, investors did not share the prices of products, citing
fluctuations in world prices and changes in foreign exchange rates.

When conflicts arise, who should intervene? Some cases have been brought to PARC but PARC
does not have the capacity to determine what is fair (e.g. price or amortization). This is a policy
gap that needs to be addressed.

5.4 Contracts involving public land are public, easily accessible, with agreements
    monitored and enforced

5.4.1 - Comprehensive and consolidated information on spatial extent and duration of
concessions/leases is not readily available to government or different departments rely on
different sources of information. D

Across all agencies, there is no single point where the spatial extent, location and duration of
concessions/leases can be publicly accessed. Different agencies maintain their own databases
and maps, but even then, not all information are available and not all agencies consistently
publish these information.

For mining rights, this information is available at the MGB website. For forest tenure rights in
public forestlands, only Region 10 has this information listed in the DENR regional office
website. In both cases however, maps are not available.

Not all government agencies disclose this information. Data on ancestral lands (CADT/CALT)
are not readily available in NCIP.

NEDA would have some information collected in their database but these are not easily
accessible. Data from some regional offices are also not updated.

The absence of such integrated information has contributed to the issuance of multiple rights
over the same land. This has created uncertainty both on the property rights of the occupant of
the land, and the investments of the concession holder.

In the same UPLB study (footnote 66), this has caused problems in the processing of
applications for industrial forest management agreements (See Box 2).




                                                                                                87
      Box 2. Issues in Processing of Industrial Forest Management Agreements (IFMA)

     “Conflicting land uses, claims and tenurial instruments issued due to insufficient,
     conflicting, outdated, and inaccessible maps, information and database

     A common problem discovered by the DENR and its clients in many regions involves
     overlapping tenurial instruments, conflicting land uses and claims over a certain
     area, after a certain instrument has already been awarded. This problem is closely
     related to the previous issue whereby the DENR was unable to undertake the
     identification and approval of areas open for access. The said procedures entailed the
     need to update the Registry on available areas for various instruments.

     The situation is mainly blamed on the lack of reliable maps and a dependable
     information database in many field offices. Couple this with the inadequate
     coordination among the different DENR action officers in the various regional,
     provincial and community offices, divisions, sections, and even programs, and the
     overlap of tenurial instruments and conflicts in land uses over an area result. Although
     DENR is mandated to establish and maintain an updated registry, maps of forestland
     uses and a census of people living in public forestlands, these are often outdated
     and unreliable, or may sometimes not be readily accessible, if they exist at all.

     Another common problem revolves around the conflict arising from ancestral domain
     claims over areas for which tenurial instruments have already been issued. A number of
     IFMA, SIFMA and TLA holders (intending to convert to IFMA) reported that their
     instruments were issued long before some IPs, or people claiming to be IPs, filed their
     claims on portions of the IFMA/SIFMA or TLA areas concerned.

     Lack of Forest Land Use Plans in the DENR regional offices

     In most cases, the DENR people do not really know how much land (and where
     these are located) has already been allotted for different instruments and is
     available for open access. This situation is blamed on the lack of forestland use plans in
     many regions, as DENR-DILG JMC 98-01 has not yet been properly implemented. DENR-
     DILG JMC 2003-01 was recently issued to reiterate the implementation of the said policy
     issuance.”

5.4.2 - There is little third-party monitoring of investors' compliance with safeguards and
mechanisms and contractual provisions to quickly and effectively ensure adherence are
difficult to access for affected communities. Mechanisms to reach arbitration are difficult to
access for third parties. - C

In general, there is minimal third-party monitoring of investors’ compliance with safeguards.

For AVAs, the DAR is able to monitor only if these are registered. However, there are only 13
stock distribution options, so most collective CLOAs with agreements are not being
systematically monitored. Strengthening monitoring of AVAs has consistently been a
recommendation of the DAR studies.

While not considered third party, DENR is tasked to monitor compliance to environmental
safeguards and other terms of the forest management agreement. However, based on the UPLB
study, this is not being effectively done due to lack of capacities (Box 3). This could have been

timber in natural forests, the task of monitoring and enforcement has increased.


                   Box 3. DENR Monitoring of Forest Management Agreements

      “Inadequate monitoring by DENR of the FMA holders' implementation of ECC
      conditionalities and their compliance with other laws, rules and regulations

      The implementation of ECC conditionalities has been given little emphasis ever since the
      Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Law was implemented. Many forest
      management agreement holders do not have any problem with this as the DENR does
      only a little monitoring to begin with. Personnel of the EMB regional offices admitted
      that they have very few personnel and limited resources to closely monitor the activities
      of thousands of IEE and ECC holders. EMB regional and field personnel can barely cope
      with the processing of large numbers of applications for IEE/ECC/CNC from various
      sectors, not just forestry, leaving them with less time for monitoring activities.

      Also, there is weak monitoring of the holders’ compliance with conditionalities of forest
      management agreements and other rules and regulations. DENR field officers blame
      their inability to regularly and properly monitor the FMA holders’ compliance on DENR’s
      inadequate resources, i.e., limited personnel and low travel allowances, etc. “

Summary and Recommendations

This Module – Transfer of Large Tracts of Land to Investors – is so central to investments and
job creation, and yet, Mindanao fared poorly in the ratings of dimensions. Underlying causes
include weak capacities of agencies, lack of coordination, incomplete agency maps, records and
data that are independent from other agencies.

In order to unlock the constraints to mobilization of large tracts of land for agriculture and
investments, a number of actions are emerging. In crafting these recommendations, it must be
recognized that many of these lands are occupied, or at the very least, there are claimants to
these lands, both formal and informal. Interventions would have to include an overall field
assessment, physical framework planning and should be responsive to the needs of the
occupants.

Conduct an inventory of public lands under long-term lease agreements to determine their current
status. A serious audit of actual uses is necessary to establish whether the lands are still being
used for the purpose for which the lease was granted. This is to prevent land banking or
speculation, and allow the land to be developed by investors who have the capacity to do so.
Priority should be given to the existing TLA, FLGMA, and fishpond lease agreements. The same
should hold true for mining areas covered by exploration permits but for which there have been
no exploration activities going on.

Design and implement administrative recourse to addressing current conflicts and overlaps in land
and resource use rights. It is essential that solutions be given to the current dilemma faced in the
enforcement of use rights that result from the work of different agencies. For example, in the
absence of legislation confirming the final forest line, it would be prudent to carve out areas that


                                                                                                           89
have already been awarded titles by other agencies, following the idea of DAR. In the same way,
on the ground negotiations can be made to resolve some of the technical conflicts in resource
use, and entitlements of beneficiaries under collective CLOAs. Most of these issues would
require dedicated work. The idea of creating task forces for high profile and important cases
should be looked at.

DENR to identify and delineate production and protection forests. This is important to determine
the parts of the public forests that would be suitable for production purposes, and avoid the
awarding of production leases to areas to be set aside for watershed protection, protected areas,
wildlife reserves, and similar uses. Once the production areas are established, set these up into
management blocks and put up for competitive bidding. There have been plans by the DENR to
develop investment portfolios in production forest areas and set up one-stop shops to
encourage joint venture and facilitate inflow of investments to manage these well. This can be
done with BOI-DTI.

NAMRIA or land classification teams to fast track the classification of some 400,000 hectares of
unclassified public forests. A decision has to be made whether to release these as A&D, or retain
these areas as part of the public domain. Only after this process has been completed will it be
possible to determine the land tenure rights that can be issued to occupants of these lands.

Develop a physical framework plan for Mindanao. This should specify the land use allocations for
various purposes, taking into account the long term needs of the region, assessment of its
comparative advantage, its land potential, and the current constraints. The Mindanao 2020 can
be used as starting point, but the plan needs to have identification over the long-term use of
lands to be established as protected areas, mining areas, production forests, agricultural
development areas, and expansion of major cities. This should be informed through a
participatory process, with key Experts undertaking a land constraints and demand study. In
the absence of the National Land Use Act, this plan should serve as the Mindanao long-term land
use and management framework that should guide spatial development in the region.

Strengthen IP communities; develop ADSDPPs. CADTs represent large blocks of land, which if
harnessed, can contribute to making suitable lands for investments. The key is to ensure there
are genuine ADSDPPs that are prepared, to guide the location of investment opportunities.
Properly prepared ADSDPPs, supported with community 3D maps, should be able to delineate
conservation areas such as sacred grounds, burial sites, traditional hunting areas, and areas
which the IP communities want to develop to support their socio economic development. The
stigma associated with the entry of investments in IP lands can be erased if there is genuine
partnership that is built on trust, respect and recognition of each other’s potential. Alongside
with this, the strengthening of IP organizations and adherence to proper FPIC processes will be
important inputs in ensuring that IP communities are able to negotiate for fair and equitable
sharing of proceeds from investments.

Address the issues of inclusion and exclusion of CLOA members involved in agreements with large
corporations, or beneficiaries of large agricultural estates. The 10-year delay in the
implementation of CARP in large agricultural lands has paved the way for exclusion of what
others think should be appropriate beneficiaries of CARP. This has deprived other agricultural
workers, of the benefit that should have accrued to them under the program. Considering the
amount of time that has lapsed and the effect this have on the operations of these companies, it
is urgent that more innovative ways be tested to fast track the resolution of these. This could
prove more challenging than the distribution program itself, as this would entail going back to
the records, doing validations, and dialogues. NGOs, lawyers, and community development
workers can be recruited to undertake these research and documentation, to aid in speedy
resolution.

Support collective CLOA members to negotiate fair terms of agreement with large corporations.
Leaseback arrangements have provided opportunities to achieve economies of scale in large
operations, and infuse capital in agricultural development to achieve the full potential of the
land. However, there have been documented cases of unfair terms entered into by CLOA
holders, that usually result in decisions to pre terminate agreements and/or re negotiate. For
areas affected by these, a team of Facilitators can be assigned to help the community and the
corporation sort out the differences. In the future, it might help if existing packages of
assistance, standards, and code of conduct can be reviewed to make sure similar issues are
avoided in the future.

LGI 6.1    Mechanism for recognition of rights

6.1.1 - There is no process for formal recognition of land possession by the poor occupying
private lands, government lands, and public forestlands – D

In the Philippines, existing laws do not allow formalization of informal occupation of private
lands, government lands, and public forestlands, leading to contnuing growth in informality. In
the urban areas, private land occupation can only be formalized if the owner is willing to sell the
property. In the case of government lands in urban areas, formal recognition of possession is
only feasible if done under a Presidential Proclamation which awards the land to the occupants.
This is not always feasible, and would depend on the outcome of investigation, primarily to
determine of government has no future use of the land. Moreover, Proclamations can take a long
time, and in many instances, the lack of careful study has brought about issues of claims and
counterclaims which make it impossible to implement the Proclamation.

In the case of public forestlands, the granting of CSCs and CBFMAs, are not designed primarily to
formalize possession or to secure the rights of occupants, although the latter emerges as
secondary benefits. Thus, not all occupants are given CSCs and CBFMAs. There is no census of
forestland occupants who shall be given such tenure instruments. The basis of providing tenure
is to enable sustainable forest management, rather than to confirm possession of the occupant.

in a Joint affidavit of two disinterested person or adjacent property owners can be executed to
support the application68.

The DAR process for identification of agrarian reform beneficiaries is also not fully dependent
on documentary form of evidences.

In the award of PACBARMA in protected areas, proof of occupation through extent of
cultivation, among others are used as basis for establishing rights to the tenure instrument. In
the same manner, the award of CBFMA, ISF and other individual and community tenure
instruments in the forestlands use non-documentary forms of evidence. More weight is given to
actual occupation.

In the recognition of ancestral lands, proof of claims include the testimony of elders or
community under oath, and other documents directly or indirectly attesting to the possession or
occupation of the area since time immemorial by such ICCs/IPs in the concept of owners. Any
one (1) of the following authentic documents is recognized:
     Written accounts of the ICCs/IPs customs and traditions;
     Written accounts of the ICCs/IPs political structure and institution;
     Pictures showing long term occupation such as those of old improvements, burial
        grounds, sacred places and old villages;
     Historical accounts, including pacts and agreements concerning boundaries entered into
        by the ICCs/IPs concerned with other ICCs/IPs;
     Survey plans and sketch maps;
     Anthropological data;
     Genealogical surveys;
     Pictures and descriptive histories of traditional communal forests and hunting grounds;
     Pictures and descriptive histories of traditional landmarks such as mountains, rivers,
        creeks, ridges, hills, terraces and the like; and
     Write-ups of names and places derived from the native dialect of the community.

6.1.3 - Legislation exists to formally recognize long-term, unchallenged possession in public
lands - A

There is strong recognition of long-term unchallenged possession under Philippine laws.
However, all these apply only to public lands. Adverse possession of private lands is not
recognized under Philippine laws. What is duly recognized however, is the long held right of the
private property owner.

Commonwealth Act 141 recognizes 30 years possession either by himself or through his/her
predecessors in interest, portions of public agricultural lands subject to disposition.

The Civil Code on the other hand, recognizes 10 years possession in good faith, and 30 years
possession in bad faith.

The most recent legislation, that of Republic Act 10023 or the Residential Free Patent Law,
recognizes continuous possession of 10 years to support a claim.

In the case of ancestral lands, occupation since time immemorial is recognized under the
Constitution, and the IPRA.

Among all the titling options, the administrative process (Free Patent, for both agricultural and
residential) is more widely used since it is more streamlined and entails the least amount of
fees; in both cases not exceeding 0.5% of the property value. Titles issued under agricultural
free patent mode however, carry a five year restriction on transfers and mortgage. The
relevance of such restriction should be reviewed in light of the requirement of 30 and 10 years
possession under the CA 141 and RA 10023.

For residential properties, the Free Patent has limited application to areas not exceeding 200 sq.
m in highly urbanized cities and those that are zoned residential in the land use plans of LGUs




                                                                                               94
and actually used as residential. Properties outside of these will have to be titled either through
Miscellaneous Sales or Judicial titling.

Miscellaneous Sales Patent requires the claimant to repurchase the property by paying a certain
proportion of the assessed value. This mode of titling therefore is more costly on the part of the
claimant; estimated to be less than 2% of the market value; which is still considered second to
best by LGAF standards. Properties acquired through MSP carry the same restrictions on sale
and mortgage as in Free Patent issued titles.

While judicial titles do not carry with them any restriction upon issuance; it is the most
expensive mode of first time registration; exceeding 25% of the market value of the property.
This is due to the payments that need to be made to lawyers. RDs, Local Assessors and DENR
Land Officers and Clerk of Courts estimate the cost to be not lower than P 150,000 per parcel.

Experience from LAMP1 confirm that administrative titling, mainly through the Free Patent
mode, can be completed in two months in agricultural areas; and about much faster in
residential areas (based on REGALA experience). Likewise, the testing of titling procedures
undertaken in LAMP1 attest that the judicial titling mode is very complex and takes a long time
to complete. In the case of parcels in Leyte, two years was not enough to complete the entire
process of judicial titling, as this require the Office of the Solicitor General to file the cases, and
several appearances in courts.

For other types of urban lands such as commercial and industrial lands, the policies for
appraisal and processes need to be reviewed to facilitate titling.

Through LAMP systematic adjudication process, the costs of first time titling has been brought
down to minimum to encourage more claimants to formalize their ownership.

However, the RoD has started to add computerization fees and other charges after it has
computerized its records, thus bringing up the total cost for first time registration.

LGI 6.2    Completeness of the Registry

6.2.1 - The cost of registering property in major cities in Mindanao is between 2% and 6%
of property value. This is slightly higher than the average cost for the rest of the
Philippines.

Based on the WB Study on Cost of Doing Business (2011), Mindanao cities fare a bit lower when
it comes to the cost of transferring commercial properties (Table 37). The costs however, does
not account for capital gains tax, which is computed at 6% of property value (sale, zonal or
assessed value, whichever is the highest). Incorporating these costs would make the transfer
costs very high compared with international best practice.

The number of procedures also varies very widely among the four Mindanao cities rated by the
WB Cost of Doing Business Study. Among the steps, it took the most time to secure the
Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) from BIR, which took between two to three weeks.
Registration with the RoD took the longest time in Cagayan de Oro (60 days) which explains
why it took the most number of days to register a property in the city (Table 38).

During the panel discussions, it was reported that the BIR issues new policies with each new
Director. In Davao City, it now takes more than a month to issue CAR. This is due to a new
requirement wherein the client has to secure the old CAR from RoD which is accessed through
its archives, to show evidence that prior CARs were issued.

On the other hand, registration of transfers and original titles are now taking much more time
with the computerization. During the panel workshops, it was reported that new titles
submitted for registration in 2012, are only being distributed in 2015. This is because of the
new requirement by the LRA to submit all titles at the Central Office for projection in their
unified map before these are registered. DAR also reported that their titles take more than two
years to be registered by the RoD, despite the budget that they provide for encoding, and
payment for IT fee.

6.2.2 - Between 50% and 70% of records for privately held land recorded in the registry are
readily identifiable in maps (spatial records) – C

The Philippines has only one register of all land records. However, there are various agencies
involved in surveying, mapping and recording and approval of cadastre; and therefore,
information relating to surveys and cadastral and municipal maps are spread across these
organizations.

The Land Management Bureau and its regional offices in the DENR are responsible for cadastral
survey of all alienable and disposable lands that are subject to original titling. Review and
approval of survey plans are also the responsibility of the LMB and DENR regional offices.

The LRA was also vested authority to review and approve survey plans. It maintains its own
cadastral index maps based on the survey plans it reviews and approves; and this information
are not shared with the DENR. Furthermore, there are differences in the projection of the index
maps maintained by the LRA and DENR.

There is no complete inventory or index map showing the location of the various records and
plans, customers are required to visit all three locations in order to build a complete picture
over the area. The information in respect to patents is also stored in these three locations.

All titles registered at the different Register of Deeds Offices nationwide are supposed to be
supported by an approved survey. Therefore all titles in the Registry should be reflected in the
cadastre. However, the RoD’s do not usually hold copies of these cadastral maps. Maps are also
not used in the operations of the registries. Cadastral maps are held by DENR and mostly are
not updated to reflect subsequent transactions such as subdivision or consolidation even if the
surveys for these transactions are also being approved by the agency. A lot of records, including
maps have been either lost or destroyed due to fires, natural calamities and the last war (World
War II). Many of these lost or destroyed records have never been reconstructed/reconstituted.
The inventory of land records were never taken seriously by the agencies that holds the records
such that it is impossible to assess the actual number of records that still exist and those that
have been lost or destroyed.




                                                                                              97
In order to address these gaps, the LARES –LTCP is conducting a map projection of all titled
properties in its records in an effort to slowly build a complete picture of all registered titles.
This is being done by digitizing title information, building up the cadastre parcel by parcel using
the technical descriptions found in the title. Without links to the cadastral maps however, there
is a high likelihood that the RoD/LRA maps which were derived from technical description on
the titles, are not accurate and will contain errors, overlaps.

6.2.3 - Relevant private encumbrances are recorded but this is not done in a consistent and
reliable manner, and the cost of accessing them is too high (between B and C)

Recording of private encumbrances are on voluntary or on-demand process, thus informal
transactions are not recorded. The computerization cost has also made registration of
encumbrances quite costly than before.

The following are the private encumbrances recorded on the title:
 Registration and release of mortgages
 Court or judicial orders
 Long-term leases
 Sale of portion or partial transfer
 Conditional sale
 Option to purchase or promise to sell
 Sale subject to redemption or repurchase/redemption of properties sold
 Surety and bonds
 Powers of attorney, letters of administration, appointment of guardian, resolution   or revocation –
 Levy
 Adverse claims
 Lis pendens
 Extra-judicial settlement
 Right or ways
 Rent contract
 Attachments
 Building and improvements

6.2.4 - All relevant public restrictions or charges are recorded – A

Public restrictions include easements, prohibition on transfers, sales or mortgages for
agricultural Free Patent, etc. In some cases, unpaid cadastral costs are also annotated on the
titles.

In the case of areas affected by CARP, DAR has recently flagged the titles of properties covered
by issuing Notice of Coverage and annotating these properties. This freezes the transactions on
these properties, without proper clearances.

Where no fee is specified, registration/annotation of encumbrances will require payment of
registration fee which uses a schedule (from a low of PhP 21 to a high of PhP 8,796) based on
the assessed value of the land or the amount in consideration whichever is higher, plus issuance
and certification fee and IT service fee (PhP 344.93/deed, instrument or entry).

6.2.5 - Copies or extracts of documents recording rights in property can generally be
obtained within 1 week of request - B

The computerization of records at LRA/RoD has made it possible to access information quite
easily. The LRA has this facility where anybody can access records from anywhere in the
Philippines. In Mindanao, all its RoDs are “live” meaning these are already computerized.


                                                                                                     98
In addition, the LRA/RoD has established links with banks, PAGIBIG; enabling on line linkage in
accessing copes of titles and making queries on titled properties.

6.2.6 - The records in the registry can only be searched by title number only - C

The Land Titling Computerization Project (LTCP) of the LRA has made possible any search by
owners name or title easier, faster and more accessible with the launch of the A2A (Anywhere to
Anywhere Service) and PVS (Parcel Verification Service). In a computerized Registry (on-line to
the LTCP) the primary key for searching the registry is the title number. The cadastral lot
number can also be used to search the registry. The facility to search using property holders
was however recently deactivated such that the RoD now have to revert to the manual search of
the title if only the title holders name is known or given.

If searches have to be done manually, the easiest way is if the title number is known. Titles
searches can also be done using the cadastral lot number or name of the titleholder but this will
take more time to do.

The inability to search the registry by name of owner has made it difficult to take stock of
properties held by persons. This was the case in some recent high profile investigations,
wherein it took the RoD some time before the titles of the person were retrieved; only to find
out that because the Registry does not retire old titles, some of the properties have been
transferred to other persons.

6.2.7 Copies or extracts of documents recording rights in property can be obtained by
anyone who pays the necessary formal fee, if any - A

Titles and other documents in the different Registries are considered public document and by
operation can be accessed by anyone. The searching of the records of the RODs is permitted by
Property Registration Decree 1529. Section 56 therein provides:

       “All records and papers relative to registered land in the office of the Register of Deeds
       shall be open to the public in the same manner as court records, subject to such
       reasonable regulations as the Register of Deeds, under the direction of the
       Commissioner of Land Registration (now administrator of LRA), may prescribe.”

The LTCP has made it more accessible to the public such that anywhere there is an on-line RoD,
anybody can search for pertinent title information. An interested person in Manila can go to any
of the on-line Registry anywhere in Manila to secure copies of titles or title information for lands
located anywhere as long as the RoD in the location of interest is also already on-line. Access to
the information or copies of the title documents do require payment of fees, including the IT
service fee. Securing a certified or true copy for 1 title for example can cost PhP 401.30.

LGI 6.3     Reliability: Registry information is updated and sufficient to make
            meaningful inferences on ownership

6.3.1 - Information in public registries are not linked with other types of land information;
which compromise integrity of rights, and increase transaction cost – D

Relevant land information in the Philippines: tax records, survey plans, and title records are
produced and kept by various agencies with no provision for linkage.

Title information is always linked to subdivision plans. However, because both DENR and LRA
reviews and approve subdivision plans, subsequent transactions on the parcel are not captured
in the projection map of DENR when this happens.

The weak link however, is between title information (and subsequent transactions thereof) and
tax records at the LGUs. This results in outdated tax maps at the LGUs.

The function of the RoDs is simply to register the deed, without the benefit of cross checks with
other related land information. This is where conflicts, overlaps, double titles could occur. The
fact that there is no shared consolidated cadastral maps (CCMs) between DENR and LRA/RoD
aggravates the situation.

In other cases, such as DAR issued CLOAs, the absence of mapped information on the location of
such titles result in overlaps or conflicts with other lands.

As a result of these uncertainties, the banks, financing institutions, investors and other land
buyers have to exert extra effort to trace back the title information to make sure this is
legitimate and linked to an approved subdivision plan. For large properties, or multiple
properties that require consolidation, this task can add up to the budget of the interested party.


                                                                                                100
Many professionals earn their living by providing this service. For the poor informal settlers for
example, determining the veracity of records of the property they are interested in buying could
be a significant drain on their budget.

6.3.2 - Less than 50% of the ownership information (for both agricultural and non
agricultural lands) in the registry/cadaster is up-to-date and reflects ground reality - D

First, the fact that 49% of all parcels in Mindanao are untitled reflects the extent of
incompleteness of the cadaster. The distribution of these untitled parcels however, between
agricultural and non-agricultural areas is difficult to establish.

This also means that the registry does not capture this information on ownership rights, which
have not been confirmed through titles. The longer the titling is delayed, the more outdated the
records become since there are informal transactions happening on these unregistered
properties.

Second, many of the land surveys have been approved years ago and that while land claims have
changed since then, these are not captured in the cadastral maps held by DENR. Moreover,
because the cadastral survey recently been completed for ARMM and not yet fully validated,
these parcels are not yet documented in the DENR records.

Third, LGU records, which are considered to reflect the closest to the reality on the ground; are
also incomplete. This is because majority of the LGUs are not conducting tax mapping and/or
updating tax maps as a regular function.

Another reason is that there is poor sharing of information among the LGU Assessors, LRA and
DENR. In many instances isolated surveys approved by DENR and LRA (subdivision and
consolidation) are not shared with the local assessor’s offices. There are several instances
where surveys approved by the DENR Regional Offices are not even furnished to the field
offices. It has been the experience under the LAMP 2 Innovation Support Fund and the
ADBJFPR-REGALA Project that CENROs do not have a complete copy of the cadastral maps and
other survey records. The CENROs are also not regularly furnished copies of subdivision plans
(if furnished at all). The active maps within the DENR and LRA are its projection maps but these
maps are treated as closely guarded secrets and never shared with other agencies. The current
move to capture all the land records through the computerized Land Administration and
Management System (LAMS) should be able to facilitate sharing of digital copies of records
across the DENR hierarchy, and more importantly with local governments.

Another reason is that a large portion of property owners does not register their transactions
due to a number of factors. A few RoD and LGU Assessors interviewed in the course of
Philippines LGAF estimate that between 10-20% of such transactions are not registered. The
reasons given were:
     High cost of capital gains tax
     High costs of surveys and lengthy process of survey approval
     Requirement for tax clearance from the Assessors’ office which can entail higher
        expense particularly if the owner is in default in payments

In a study under LAMP269 to determine the extent to which subsequent transactions have
occurred on titles and Certificates of Land Ownership Award (CLOAs) issued, and how these
transactions are captured in the RoD, the following were the key findings:

69  LAMP2. Study on Registration of Subsequent Land Transactions. June 2010. The study was undertaken in
Leyte, Bohol and Bukidnon. The study covered titles that were released during the period 1996-2000; meaning the
titles have passed the restriction period and are eligible for subsequent transactions.


                                                                                                          101
      84% of all titles issued were still in the names of original owners as registered with the
       RoD; 16% of parcels have new lot owners;
      More than half of those reportedly under new owners have unregistered transactions.

Major reasons given for not registering subsequent transactions include the high cost of
transfers; lack of familiarity with the process; too many requirements; lack of knowledge of the
need to register; presence of red tape or fixers; high cost of back taxes that need to be paid; and
no knowledge on where to register.

When respondents were asked about suggestions on how to improve the registration system;
the following were given.
     create awareness on the importance of land registration through information and
         education campaign;
     adopt a simplified registration system with less requirements;
     reduce registration fees; and
     establish One Stop Shop for lands services

Among the 38 percent of respondents who encountered problems and difficulties in the
registration process, the following feedback were given:
     processing at RoD is time consuming and slow;
     the OSS/RoD is located far from their residences;
     presence of red tapes/fixers;
     too many requirements, some of which are difficult to produce;
     expensive due to high costs of transport and other expenses in following up titles;
     it takes too long for the relocation survey to be done;
     cadastral survey is very slow and expensive, surveyors not readily available, and
        surveys are not done properly;
     subdivision of mother titles is very expensive;
     it is difficult to locate the boundaries of their properties;
     processing at DENR is very long and high expenses for payment of taxes.

For those involved in the CMP, participants have found it difficult to secure reliable records
from the registry thus delaying the process for acquisition. The inconsistent records held by
various agencies – LMB, LRA and Assessors Office further fueled the business of syndicates to
benefit from the poor state of records. A number of case studies and documentations have
revealed that this situation has contributed to the slow pace of formalization in the urban areas;
and in the titling program of the government.

This situation has affected the credibility of the registry and cadastre; and the reliability of
records kept therein. Such state affects the time and cost required to start investments, and
property development, since verification and payments for such services would have to be
required. A classic case was the well-publicized hearing of the Supreme Court Justice
impeachment trial; where the LRA records yielded so many properties of the Justice registered
under his name; only to find out that most of these have been subsequent transferred.

LGI: 6.4 Cost-effectiveness and sustainability: land administration services are
provided in cost-effective ways that are sustainable in the long term

6.4.1 - The total fees collected by the Registry are less than 50% of the total registry
operating cost - D

The LRA, through its RoD, is one of the government’s top earning agencies. Its income exceeds
its operating costs by more than fourfold. Data gathered from the DBM’s website showed that



                                                                                               102
for 2015; its appropriation is Php 902 Million; while its income for the first six months of 2014
is already Php 2.559 Billion. In 2013, its total income reached 5.485 Billion.

Given the Philippines’ “one fund policy”, all earnings are remitted to the Bureau of Treasury and
the agency cannot retain any of its earnings. The agency is always dependent on what the
national government will appropriate for its operation. If the agency can be allowed to retain a
higher percentage of its surplus then this can allow the agency to undertake much needed
projects that can further improve its capacity to perform its mandate.

In addition, the BOO Project through the LTCP is supposed to provide the investment
requirements of the agency in the computerization of its records, and should be financially
sustainable.

However, based on the panel reviews, it was reported that while the fees charged for services
are high, most of these are for IT fees. For example, the fee for verification of a converted title is
Php 253.45. Only 4.7% or Php 12.00 of this amount will be remitted to LRA, while the rest will
accrue to the trust fund of LARES/LTCP. The RoD also shared that they have very minimal
funds for operating costs even for the provision of simple supplies as pens, papers, etc. Their
staff are also very limited, such that many of them have to perform multi tasks. There have been
no increases of their budget for many years, which impact heavily on the staff.

6.4.2 - Investment in human and physical resources is sufficient to maintain high service
standards but does not allow for proactively responding to future needs and new
developments in the sector. B

There were three major initiatives in the recent years to improve land administration services:

Computerization of RoDs – B
    Title records were scanned, thus enabling easier access to records. However, the
     downside is, the cost of accessing records and registration of titles and encumbrances
     has gone up in order to pay for the IT fee. Moreover, there have been reports of delays in
     the issuance of titles by as much as 2-3 years in the case of Davao city, due to the need to
     bring the records to LRA QC to undertake the projection. In fact, the titles that are being
     released as of the time of the panel workshops in December date back to those lodged in
     2012. There were also reports from DAR that their CLOAs have been delayed by almost
     a year.

Completion of cadastral surveys - B
    This should complete the documentation of all parcels, however, the parcel surveys in
      ARMM has recently been completed. Overall, there was massive investment in the last 6
      years to accelerate implementation of this program.

Computerization of DENR records - B
    DENR is set to implement a 6-year program to computerize its survey records, lot data
     computation sheets and other land records. This should translate into provision of more
     accurate information and better service to the public. This so called Land Administration
     and Management System (LAMS) should however, address defective and missing
     records in DENR.

Adoption of LGU led Titling – B
    The DENR has approved the guidelines for LGU led titling following its experience from
      the LAMP. It has tasked its field offices to link with LGUs to ink Memorandum of
      Partnership Agreements (MOPAs) to facilitate titling of remaining untitled parcels. It
      would take dedicated resources and time to complete titling over a short period. A few


                                                                                                  103
       LGUs in Mindanao has embarked on this activity, but the development of an LGU specific
       Land Tenure Improvement Plan (LTIP) based on a careful assessment of land tenure
       issues and profile is essential to develop a more responsive and cost effective strategy.
       For example, areas with missing records have to reconstitute or re survey their lands,
       sections of the LGU covered with cadastral proceedings have to cancel these from the
       Courts to proceed with administrative titling, etc.

What is missing is acceleration of titling coverage to formally register all the remaining untitled
parcels in Mindanao. This would require the combined efforts of both national and local
governments.

LGI: 6.5    Fees are determined transparently to cover the cost of service
            provision

6.5.1 - A clear rationale and schedule of fees for different services is publicly accessible and
receipts are issued for all transactions – A

6.5.2 - Effective mechanisms to detect and deal with illegal staff behavior also exist in all
registry offices and all cases are promptly dealt with - A

6.5.3 - There are published service standards (including dealing with deal with illegal staff
behavior), the registry actively monitors its performance against these standards – A

All fees to be paid at the Registry for transactions are publicly available. The computerization of
all processes has also reduced opportunities for informal payments. Finally, the Civil Service
Commission has high standards for performance of employees that need to be complied with.


Summary and Recommendations

Mindanao’s scores in the dimensions under this Module on Land Information are lower than
those for the Philippines. While the policies and institutional framework remain the same, the
impact on Mindanao is much greater where:
     There is no process for formal recognition of land possession by the poor occupying
        private lands, government lands, and public forestlands;
     Cadastral surveys are recently completed;
     Title registration takes about two years due to the need for LRA to capture the
        information;
     Despite the high computerization fees, operational budgets for Registries are so limited
        such that it constraints the effective dispatch of services;
     Registry records are out of date by an estimated 50% due to a number of reasons,
        among these the lack of unified land information system among agencies;
     The cost and time to register properties is higher than the average cost and time for the
        rest of the Philippines due to the long time it takes to register, and secure certificate
        authorizing registration;
     A large percentage of records cannot be readily identifiable in maps; and
     Information in public registries are not linked with other types of land information,
        thereby compromising integrity of rights, and increase transaction costs.

At the root of these issues are redundancies in the functions of agencies, development of
information systems that are independent of each other, and lack of mechanisms for data
sharing and unified map projection which depicts all rights on the land. The outcome is higher
cost and longer period for the public to complete their transactions, with very little


                                                                                               104
improvement in services. The outdated and inaccurate records in the registry also breed
opportunities for the production of duplicate and spurious records, which places investments at
great risk. These are not good for investments, efficient functioning of the land market, and
generation of jobs.

In order to address the above, the following recommendations are made:

LGUs to develop an integrated land information system through community participation;
contingent on accessing data from LRA

A number of LGUs have successfully established such system, called the unified land
information system (ULIS), which integrates and validates the records of RoD, DENR and LGU
for the same parcel. This system removes redundancies, updates the record with the most
recent transaction on ownership, and improves accuracy of lot areas by linking with the
approved subdivision surveys from either DENR or LRA. The result is a complete picture of all
parcels in an LGU, and a more accurate basis for land tenure improvement and real property tax
collection. Once established, the system can be used to better detect RPT delinquencies, parcel
based land use planning, creation of property values map, updating of schedule of market
values, and other applications.

For this to be realized, it is essential to secure the full cooperation of the RoD in accessing data
from its records; and access to DENR’s cadastral records and other information such as the lot
data computation sheets, patent records, and relevant data. To access RoD records, the LGUs can
invoke the provisions of section 209 of the Local Government Code which mandates RoDs to
provide local governments, abstract of its registries on an annual basis. Very few RoDs have
complied with this provision, but it is worth discussing with the local Registries.

In support of the above, the DENR should undertake a program to inventory its records, restore
missing records, and correct erroneous surveys. The ongoing computerization of DENR records
through the Land Administration and Management System (LAMS) could facilitate this process.

Develop mechanisms for data sharing and common map projection of all parcels for subdivision
surveys and titles issued by agencies; common data standards (DENR, LRA/RoD, LGUs)

The spirit of Joint DENR-DAR-DOJ-NCIP Administrative Order; is to cross reference with
agencies approving the surveys before issuance of any title or instrument, particularly in
problematic areas. However, this needs to level up to include the actual establishment of a
unified projection system, and a continuing program for maintenance and updating,
development of common data standards, and commitment to share records. This is easier said
than done. Many attempts have been made to do this, but have been unsuccessful. A strong
political commitment at the highest level is essential to make this happen. In addition, a higher
directive such as an Executive Order mandating the agencies to set up this system could jump
start the process.

BIR to reconsider bringing down CGT levels to encourage more formality in transactions, make
registration of transfers more affordable

The high CGT costs in the country, considered one of the highest based on international
standards, acts as a key constraint for the formalization of property transactions. A study has
been made on the impacts of reducing CGT levels on the level of national revenues, by
simulating the corresponding increases in registration of formal transactions. While it has been
demonstrated that decreases in CGT can be counterbalanced with increases in revenues from
transaction fees, there was not enough political support to push for this. A rethinking of this



                                                                                                105
   strategy is in order, through updating of the study, and discussions with the government’s fiscal
   managers.

   Improve coverage of registry to include long-term leases in public lands, and other interests on
   the land

   More complete registries should capture all interests on the land, including long term leases and
   tenure instruments in public lands. This should improve detection of overlaps, and improve
   security or protection for lease holders. Such registration could also boost the bankability of
   instruments on public lands, and could trigger credit provision from financial institutions. This
   in turn can stimulate land development and generate jobs.

   For this to happen, it is essential that the DENR conduct an inventory of all long term leases, as
   well as the parcels of public lands that are still open, and where there are occupants whose
   rights remain to be recognized. These should smoothen the flow of investments and capital.

   4.7        Land Valuation and Taxation
   Assessment of Indicators


                 Indicators Assessed:

                 LGI 7.1 - Transparency of valuations: valuations are based on clear
                 principles, applied uniformly, updated regularly, and publicly accessible.

                 LGI 7.2 - Collection efficiency: land and property taxes are collected and
                 yield from doing so exceeds collection cost


LGI 7.1 - Transparency of valuations: valuations are based on clear principles,
applied uniformly, updated regularly, and publicly accessible.

7.1.1 - Property assessment for tax purposes are not based on market prices and valuation
rolls are not updated regularly - D

The Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991 clearly prescribed that assessment of properties subject
to taxation should be based on market prices.70 Section 201 of the Code provides that “all real
property, whether taxable or exempt, shall be appraised at the current and fair market value
prevailing in the locality where the property is situated.” Section 219 of the Code further provides
that “LGUs shall undertake a general revision of real property assessments within two years after
the effectivity of the Code and every three years thereafter.”

There is however, wide disparity between what the law says and practice. Three factors basically
influence the wide gap between the recorded values and the market prices:
    (i) the use of and reliance on the understated values submitted by property owners as basis of
          valuation;
    (ii) outdated methodology for determining schedule of market values (SMVs) and
    (iii) very poor record of local government units (LGUs) in regular revision of their SMVs thus
          rendering the recorded values outdated and obsolete.



   70   The LGC, or Republic Act No. 7160 was approved on October 10, 1991 and became effective January 1, 1992.


                                                                                                                   106
                     Box 4. Status of Updating of SMV by Provinces
                                  (as of June 11, 2014)
            62 out of 80 provinces (78%) have outdated SMV as of 2014
            50 provinces are already overdue for general revision of property
             assessments and classification
            30 provinces are compliant in conducting a general revision once every
             three years
            12 of the compliant provinces did not use updated SMV according to
             base valuation year
            13 years – the longest a province has not revised (Bukidnon)
            5 in every 8 of provinces have property taxes contributing only less
             than 5% to their annual regular income

     Source: www.iskor.blgf.ov.ph


Out of the 25 provinces which have the longest record of not updating their SMVs, 9 are
from Mindanao:
    Lamitan City (ARMM) = 23 years (values as of 1992; since the Local Government Code
       was signed)
    Bukidnon and Lanao del Sur = 13 years (values as of 2002)
    Misamis Oriental and Surigao del Sur = 9 years (values as of 2006)
    Saranggani and Basilan = 8 years (values as of 2007)
    Sultan Kudarat and Misamis Occidental = 7 years (values as of 2008)
    Sulu = 6 years (values as of 2005)

Out of the 25 cities which have the longest record of outdated SMVs, 4 are from
Mindanao:
    Valencia City = 23 years (values as of 1992)
    General Santos City = 21 years (values as of 1994)
    Oroquieta City = 19 years (values as of 1996)
    Kidapawan City = 18 years (values as of 1997)

Five other cities have not updated their SMVs for more than 7 years:
    Cagayan de Oro and San Salvador cities = 9 years (values as of 2006)
    Butuan City = 7 years (values as of 2008)
    Davao and Isabela cities = 8 years (values as of 2007)

Like many LGUs, the lack of political will undermines the efforts of City and Provincial Assessors
in undertaking regular revision of values. In the Philippines, it is still a long way to go before
Chief Executives fully appreciate the difference between the technical function of valuation and
the political process of taxation. In addition to this, it is also essential for the BLGF to provide
technical assistance to Assessors in implementing the procedures specified in the Mass
Appraisal Guidebook (MAG) and the Manual for Real Property Assessment and Appraisal
Operations (MRPAAO). Currently, there are only five cities in the Philippines which have been
certified by BLGF as compliant with these procedures. These are: Legazpi City, Bayawan City,
Alaminos City, Tayabas City, and San Carlos City.

7.1.2 - Valuation rolls are publicly accessible - A

The zonal values used by the BIR for the whole country are uploaded to its website and anyone
may access this information by going online. In the case of the local governments, the BLGF has


                                                                                                107
likewise uploaded to its website the SMVs used by LGUs. Anyone can download from the
website the scanned copy of the SMV as well as the ordinance that authorized it. The SMVs are
also available in hard copies at the Assessor’s office and anyone who may want to get
information about the market values for a particular place or location can go to the Assessor and
request for it. Technically, the SMVs are public records that should be accessible to everyone.

LGI: 7.2 Collection efficiency: land and property taxes are collected and yield
from doing so exceeds collection cost

7.2.1 - There are limited exemptions to the payment of land/property taxes, and the
exemptions that exist are clearly based on equity or efficiency grounds but are not applied
in a transparent and consistent manner - B

The LGC effectively repealed all RPT exemptions previously given under special laws. It limited
the number of properties that will enjoy tax exemption. Section 234 enumerates them as
follows:
    1. Real property owned by the Republic of the Philippines or any of its political
       subdivisions except when the beneficial use thereof has been granted, for consideration
       or otherwise, to a taxable person.
    2. All charitable institutions, churches, parsonages or convents appurtenant thereto
       including mosques, non-profit or religious cemeteries and all lands, buildings and
       improvements which are actually, directly and exclusively used for religious, charitable
       or educational purposes.
    3. All machineries and equipment that are actually, directly and exclusively used by local
       water districts and government-owned or controlled corporations engaged in the supply
       and distribution of water and/or generation and transmission of electric power,
    4. All real property owned by duly registered cooperatives as provided under RA No. 6938
       (the Cooperatives Law).
    5. Machinery and equipment exclusively used for pollution control and environmental
       protection.

The exemptions provided in the LGC are clearly based, in addition to equity and constitutional
grounds, on national development policy and social considerations.

In some cases, however, LGUs have enacted local Ordinances that provide incentives to
investors by way of imposing exemptions or deferment of RPT payments. The extent to which
this is happening in Mindanao cities and provinces would need more detailed research in the
respective Assessors Offices.

7.2.2 - A large proportion of property tax payers are not listed on the tax roll - C

Section 205 of the LGC prescribes that Provincial or City Assessors shall maintain an assessment
roll listing all real property, whether taxable or exempt, located within the territorial
jurisdiction of the LGU. Real property shall be listed, valued and assessed in the name of the
owner or administrator, or anyone having legal interest in the property.

However, Assessors are not able to accomplish this list fully and accurately because of their
strong dependence on the property owners reporting to them the details of their properties and
very often, the property owners do not report to, or provide accurate reports to the Assessor.
This is particularly true of buildings and improvements and machineries. Only when the
Assessor and/or his staff go on ocular inspections do they discover new buildings and
improvements and it is not unusual for these buildings/improvements to have been existing for




                                                                                             108
several years before they are discovered by the Assessor and listed in the assessment roll. The
same is true for machineries.

Under the LGC, there are several government officials and private persons who are required to
furnish the Assessor certain information but fail to do so. This includes the following:

    Registrar of Deeds to prepare and submit to the provincial city and municipal assessor an
     abstract of his registry “which shall include brief but sufficient description of the real
     properties entered therein, their present owners, and the date of their most recent
     transfer or alienation accompanied by copies of corresponding deeds of sale, donation or
     partition or other forms of alienation.”
    Any public official or employee who issues to any person “a permit for the construction,
     addition, repair, or renovation of a building, or permanent improvement on land, or a
     certificate of registration for any machinery, including machines, mechanical machines
     contrivances, and apparatus attached or affixed on land or to another real property, shall
     transmit within 30 days of its issuance, a copy of such permits or certificates, to the
     assessor of the province, city or municipality where the property is situated.”
    All geodetic engineers, public or private, are required to furnish free of charge “to the
     assessor of the province, city or municipality where the land is located with a white or
     blue print copy of each of all approved original or subdivision plans or maps executed by
     them within 30 days from receipt of such plans from the Lands Management Bureau, the
     Land Registration Authority of the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board, as the case
     may be.”

With the above legal provisions, notwithstanding, the Assessor is usually not provided on a
regular basis by the persons concerned, the information that are supposed to be transmitted to
the Office. One of the reasons for this is lack of sanctions for non-compliance.

In the case of lands, the ones that are not usually listed in the assessment roll are those covered
by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) that have already been transferred to
the beneficiaries. Since the implementation of the CARP involves several agencies/institutions,
the procedures are somewhat complicated such that information is not always given or received
on time by the concerned party. Thus, the non-listing of the CARP beneficiaries who are now
the new owners of the land, in the assessment roll.

7.2.3 - Major cities in Mindanao outperform other LGUs in the Philippines on the average in
terms of RPT collection efficiency. However, provinces fare poorly. Between A and B

The average RPT collection efficiency for all LGUs in the Philippines is only 59%. However,
major cities in Mindanao have higher collection levels (Table 40).

In most LGUs, the statement of collectibles and collections are not accurate because parcel
records and tax maps, which are the bases of assessments and collections are not accurate and
incomplete.

Collection efficiency not only impact the ability of local governments to raise finances to support
implementation of programs, but it also directly affect the budget for the Special Education
Fund (SEF), which receives almost 50% of collections. An analysis of the reasons for low
collections and development of action plan to improve performance is essential.

Summary and Recommendations

Taxes from land and real property constitute one of the most stable base of revenues for local
government units. They are fixed, and easy to detect. Revenues from RPTs are fully devolved,
which should provide incentives for local governments to make good in the performance of this
mandated responsibility. However, current practices have undermined the ability of local
governments to utilize RPTs as a major revenue source. Outdated SMVs, incomplete valuation
rolls, inaccurate tax maps, too much discretion in the granting of exemptions are practices that
are common to most Philippine LGUs. In Mindanao, while cities performed better in RPT
collections, provinces and municipalities have not. The contributory factors and corresponding
recommendations are the following:

Lack of sanctions for failure to update SMVs. Although a mandated function, LGUs still equate
tax increases with SMV updating, and is therefore a politically incorrect action to do,
particularly in periods nearing elections. However, valuation is a technical function that
captures the values of properties at market rates, while taxation is the political part of the
equation which sets the assessment levels and taxation based on the values. Thus, while it is
true that updating the values to current market levels would increase the base upon which taxes
shall be paid, the LGUs still has the power to adjust the assessment rates to reduce the tax
impact, and to ensure the application is more equitable across various segments of property
owners. Moreover, the longer the LGUs delay the updating of SMVs, the stronger the impact this
would have on the taxpayers with the next revision.

In addition to the DoF’s name and shame campaign and the proposal to centralize the valuation
function to a national agency as espoused in the draft National Valuation Act, there should be
some form of incentives to encourage LGUs to undertake regular updating. These could be
included in the revised Seal of Good Local Governance (SGLG), or other suitable mechanisms.
The BLGF should also actively support local governments in developing their capacities for
valuation – using the MAG and MRPAAO. This would require a massive and focused effort such
that the LGUs are assisted through a learning by doing approach.

Inadequate access by LGU Assessors to updated transactions data from the RoDs, and failure of
LGUs to conduct regular tax mapping exercises. These render the tax maps and assessment
records incomplete, and not accurately capturing the developments that have taken place in
their localities.




                                                                                               111
Other administrative remedies, such as improving capacities to increase collection efficiency
have not been fully utilized by local governments. These include: (i) computerization of tax
records to update and cleanse the system (ii) conducting regular field inspections on properties;
(iii) re adjustments on assessments resulting from field inspections; (iv) monitoring of
delinquencies; and (v) applying the administrative and judicial recourse in the collection of
delinquent payments. The latter includes the conduct of public auction, and issuances of
delinquency notices to erring taxpayers.

Some of the recommendations from the earlier sections are relevant to this (establishment of
unified land information system, and development of implementing rules of section 209 of the
Local Government Code regarding provision of RoDs of annual abstracts of registries to LGUs).
In addition, there needs to be a continuing capacity development program for LGU Assessors
and Treasurers to ensure these practices are more widely applied. LGUs should also be audited
for their compliance with these mandated practices in property valuation and RPT collection
efforts.

Too much dependence on the internal revenue allotment (IRA). National government transfers
are entitlements of local governments to whatever earnings in total revenues. This pose as
disincentives to LGUs to make an effort to increase local revenues, since there is a steady flow of
funding transfers from the national government. However, the longer the LGUs delay action on
increasing revenues from local taxes such as the RPTs, the longer it will take for LGUs to be
dependent on the IRAs. Improving local capacities to update values and collect taxes takes some
time, and the benefits should also gradually set in.

The ability of LGUs to generate locally generated incomes should also play an important part of
the equation for the IRA. Together with other reform initiatives to amend the Local Government
Code, the effect the IRA has on revenue generation efforts should be considered.

4.8      Dispute Resolution

Land disputes in Mindanao is convoluted as they cover not only administrative and
management discords but include conflicts that trace their origins to unresolved social
injustices of its colonial past. There are also disputes, as in the case of rido71, that usually end up
in violence as part of the traditional practice of resolving conflicts. Resolution of land disputes,
therefore, in Mindanao has to be addressed at various levels using different approaches. The
Land Conflict Report prepared through another WB study discusses in more detail the nature,
extent, and resolution mechanisms in the Bangsamoro region.

This section focuses on tackling administrative and management issues such as land
registration, boundary disputes, ownership problems, access, and mortgage that have
implications on tenure and property rights. Because of the extent of public land and the number
of agencies involved in provision of tenure security, conflicts resulting from interplay of policies
and execution of various mandates are also discussed. Resolving these disputes would have
significant impact on enhancing productivity and, consequently, in generating jobs.

As in the entire country, the mechanisms and processes of settling these types of disputes may
be categorized into two: judicial and administrative. Unique to Mindanao, however, is the
presence of Sharia Courts, a special judicial body in the Autonomous Region of Muslim
Mindanao, created to settle disputes among Muslim respondents. There are also informal

[hostility] between families and kinship groups” over power, disputed land or other causes. Ridos can potentially
intensify into small-scaled wars that persist for generations.


                                                                                                                    112
mediation and reconciliation bodies that have been established to handle complaints including
that of land disputes.

Judicial Courts

Land disputes may be filed at the Office of the Executive Clerk of Court who then determines or
raffle the case to the appropriate sala. The Municipal Trial Court (MTC) handles land cases that
involve title to, or possession of, real property, or any interest therein where the assessed value
of the property or interest therein does not exceed twenty thousand pesos (P20,000.00)
exclusive of interest, damages of whatever kind, attorney's fees, litigation expenses and costs 72.
For cases beyond this amount, they are lodged at the Regional Trial Court (RTC). Judgments
rendered by MTC Judge may also be appealed at the RTC.

All judgments at the RTC can be appealed at the Court of Appeals (CA). And similarly, CA
decisions may be petitioned to the Supreme Court where final judgments are rendered.

At the MTC/RTC levels, the length of time for the resolution of cases are influenced by
availability of counsels and logistical nuances such as court calendars but land dispute cases in
general take 2 to 5 years to resolve. For CA and SC, decisions will take much longer. Fortunately,
around 90% these cases are resolved in the court of first instance.

The judicial cost of the cases depends on (1) the amount of the claims, and (2) the assessed
value of the land in dispute. This excludes out of court expenses such as attorney’s fees and
litigation expenses which many farmers find prohibitive.

Alternative Dispute Resolution

In the interest of lightening court dockets in the formal Judicial Courts, complainants are highly
encouraged to settle disputes amicably. Courts even require, as a pre-condition for filing a
complaint, a certification from the Pangkat Secretary that mediation or conciliation has been
conducted but no settlement has been reached (Sec. 412, RA 7160).

There are 12 mechanisms for ADR that are currently in place in the country: the Barangay
Justice System(BJS), a private agency and 10 administrative agencies73. For land disputes, the
often used mechanisms are the BJS and the DAR’s Adjudication Board (DARAB) and Agrarian
Law Implementation (ALI). There is also the Commission on the Settlement of land Problems
(COSLAP). It is an agency under the Department of Justice that is mandated to settle all types of
dispute involving land, whether urban or rural, but has not been so active recently 74.

Administrative Mechanisms

Government agencies handling land matters are bestowed with quasi-judicial powers to settle
land disputes as mandated by law. Though their jurisdictions are limited to their specific
mandates, they can receive complaints, ascertain and verify circumstances, establish legislative
and legal basis and decide on the case.

The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), for example, has the “primary jurisdiction to
determine and adjudicate all agrarian disputes or matters except those pertaining to the

determination of just compensation and resolution of criminal offenses arising from the
implementation of agrarian laws”75.

DAR has also established mechanisms in implementing its quasi-judicial functions. Under the
Office of the Secretary is DARAB and this set up cascades down to regional and provincial
Offices (DAR Executive Order No. 129-A, 1987).

The Department has formulated its own procedures that are not bounded so much with
technical rules as in the formal courts. The cost of filing complains is also not prohibitive. The
complainant pays only a filing fee of Ph750 plus a legal research fee of Ph20. Moreover, the
pauper litigant is exempted from the payment of the filing fees (DARAB Rules of Procedures,
2003, Rule XXIII, Sec. 2)76.

Similar mechanisms and procedures are being carried out by the DENR and the NCIP in their
own primary jurisdictions as mandated by law.

Philippine Mediation Center (PMC)

Pursuant to Supreme Court “en banc” Resolution A.M. No. 01-10-5-SC-PHILJA, dated October 16,
2001, and in line with the objectives of the Action Program for Judicial Reforms (APJR) to
decongest court dockets, among others, the Court prescribed guidelines in institutionalizing and
implementing the mediation program in the Philippines. The same resolution designated the
Philippine Judicial Academy as the component unit of the Supreme Court for Court-Annexed
Mediation and other Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Mechanisms, and established the
Philippine Mediation Center (PMC).

Mediation is a process of settling disputes with the assistance of an acceptable, impartial and
neutral third party called a mediator. The mediator helps parties identify issues and develop
proposals to resolve their disputes. Once the parties have arrived at a mutually acceptable
arrangement, the agreement becomes the basis for the court’s decision on the case.

This form of mediation is also known as court-annexed mediation since the case has already
been filed in court.

Katarungang Pambarangay

The Katarungang Pambarangay or the Barangay Justice System (BJS) is an alternative dispute
mechanism established under RA 7160 or the Local Government Code. It is an alternative,
community-based mechanism for dispute resolution of conflicts between members of the same
community77.

It covers all types of cases, including land disputes, but with some exemptions. It cannot handle,
for example, offenses punishable by imprisonment exceeding one (1) year or a fine exceeding
P5,000.00, where one party is the government or any subdivision or instrumentality thereof of,
or where the dispute involves real properties located in different cities or municipalities (RA
7160).

BJS is not totally new and it is inherent in the Filipino culture of settling disputes peacefully 78. In
fact, in barangays where majority of the inhabitants are members of indigenous cultural
communities, local systems of settling disputes through their councils of datus or elders are
recognized without prejudice to the applicable provisions of the IPRA (Sec. 399, RA 7160).

For agrarian disputes, the Barangay Agrarian Reform Committee (BARC) is mandated to
mediate/conciliate under Section 47 and 53 of R.A. No. 6657 or the Comprehensive Agrarian
Reform Program (CARP).

Customary Laws and Practices

The cultural, social and ethnic dimensions of conflict resolutions especially among the
indigenous peoples and cultural communities (lumads) even in this modern times are still very
much widely practiced and observed. Customary practice has the advantage of understanding
better the conflicts because the lumads’ speak their own language and they respect the
authority of their tribal leaders. Disputes are most likely to be resolved because they put high
primacy on preserving harmony and peace in their communities.

The use of customary laws and processes is anchored on Section 65 of IPRA law (RA 8371) on
the primacy of customary laws and practices which states that when disputes involve ICC’s/IP’s,
customary laws and practices shall be used to resolve the conflict .

The Talaandig Tribe in Miarayon, Talakag, Bukidnon usually has a designated and recognized “
Palahusay” who acts as the reconcilator among the tribal groups. The Palahusay can be a tribal
chieftain, a tribal leader, or an elder who has the qualities of being wise, honest and can render
fair judgement. If the conflict is related to land, the Palahusay will first conduct his own
research on the history of the land contested and other information related to the case.
Evidences are needed.

In cases where conflicts are not resolved by traditional system, the contending parties can
bring the conflict to the Regional Hearing Officer of the NCIP provided “that no such disputes
shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have exhausted all remedies and a Certification
shall be issued by the Council of Elders that the disputes has not been resolved” (Section 66 of
IPRA).

Disputes Arising from Implementation of Various Laws

Implementation of various laws results in overlaps in conferring property rights and resource
use rights in public domain. This can be attributed to a number of interrelated factors, such as:
        Absence of rigorous mapping of individual rights and integrated data set and
           projection map which depicts all rights to property and resources;
        Weak implementation of various laws, or differences in interpretation of laws;
        Preponderance of numerous laws and agencies giving rights to land and resources
           with limited coordination among them; and
        Human factors such as errors in survey and projection, procedural lapses, and lack of
           due diligence in investigation of potential overlaps.

These result in confusion as to which right is valid, puts into question the rights of various
parties over land and resources, thereby affecting the security of instrument that was issued, in
turn creating uncertainties in investments.

A few cases will serve to illustrate the above points.

Issuance of Collective CLOAs in non A&D lands

"Groups of Farmer Beneficiaries" is a category of unorganized farmers who are in the same
collective CLOA. In many instances, collective CLOAs issued to unorganized ARBs were awarded in
non-private agricultural landholdings, such as the big CLOAs issued in lands covered by
Proclamation 2282 (KKK lands). Collective CLOAs were issued mainly to facilitate reporting of LAD
Accomplishment. Waiting for the completion of the subdivision survey (subdivision of the big
landholding into individual lots for allocation to the beneficiaries would take a long time. Pending
the conduct of the subdivision survey, DAR already issued collective CLOAs and reported them as
accomplishment. Once accomplished, however, its subdivision became less priority compared to
the coverage of new lands for distribution to the ARBs. As a result, close to one-half of the
Emancipation Patents and Certificates of Land Ownership Award (EPs and CLOAs) that were
issued were in the form of collective CLOAs.79 Many of these big collective CLOAs were issued
during the 90s from 1993 to 1996. Under CARPER (RA 9700), however, issuance of individual
CLOAs was made the general rule. Collective CLOAs can only be issued if four conditions are
satisfied, all of which refer to the greater economic efficiency that would result from collective
ownership of the land.

DAR is at present validating jointly with LRA these collective CLOAs issued since the start of the
program, starting with the big CLOAs, meaning area per CLOA is above 24 hectares. Preliminary
results show that a significant proportion was issued in non-alienable and disposable lands. This
validation of the land classification of the landholdings distributed will be followed by on the
ground validation of the ARBs to determine whether the ARBs listed in the CLOAs possess the
qualifications required of farmer beneficiaries. Should there be adverse findings regarding the land
classification but there are actual ARBs in possession of the land and are actually cultivating them,
DAR will discuss with the DENR whether the lands can be reclassified as alienable and disposable.
If not, whether there are alternative tenurial instruments that can be given to the ARBs in order to
protect their rights. Cancellation of the CLOAs will only be a last step.80

It must be noted that Presidential Proclamation (PP) 2282 essentially released some 1.5 million
of lands as A&D and turned these over to DAR for distribution under CARP. Also noteworthy to
note is that when these lands were identified, there was no projection map to show the exact
locations of these lands. In the process of CLOA issuance, it is the DENR that reviews the location
of the parcels, to ensure that based on land classification maps, these lands are indeed, part of
the A&D lands. Subdivision surveys are also reviewed by the DENR before new parcel records
are created, and CLOAs issued. Based on mapping projections done by the Philippine
Association for Intercultural Development (PAFID), most of these areas identified under PP
2282 are indeed within forest lands, ancestral domains, and other parts of the public domain. 81

Since DAR has no projection maps of all the titles it has issued under CARP, it has entered into a
MOA with LRA to: (i) retrieve the CLOAs issued so that these can be checked with actual
occupants; and (ii) project the locations of these CLOAs to determine whether there are
overlaps and if positive, the extent of overlaps with other tenure rights. Based on these
information, it plans to discuss with DENR how the issue can be resolved.

Tribes and HEDCOR in Davao del Sur; and between Subanons in Siocon, Zamboanga del Norte
and Toronto Ventures, Inc.)82 In both cases, the companies were reportedly able to secure FPICs
from some members of the IP communities whereas the legitimate indigenous leaders and the
rest of the community were solidly against the projects, thus causing unrest and conflict among
the members. Cases like these are common, where the entry of projects cause divisiveness
among the community, in some instances escalating into violence and armed conflicts. These
demonstrate the weakness in the facilitation of securing FPIC, and lack of assertion on the
genuine process of FPIC. Thus, the rights of indigenous peoples are undermined, creating
mistrust and closing the opportunity for open and transparent dialogue on other important
issues.

Long-term leasehold agreements between CLOA holders and corporations engaged in large-scale
plantations

In the course of CARP implementation, properties of the NDC were turned over to DAR. At the
time this happened, the NDC has already entered into contracts with Guthrie Corporation in
Agusan del Sur. The award of CLOA was given to farmer groups who were formerly employees
of the company. At the time the CLOA was issued, the names of beneficiaries were not listed in
the title thus causing uncertainty as to who are excluded and who are included. Now that the
group has split into two with one party opting out of the contract, the challenge is determining
who among the beneficiaries should be part of which group and the entitlement they have
under the program. One party wanted to re negotiate the terms of agreement due to excessively
very low rental fee. There are a number of similar cases like these, which is resulting in
validation, negotiations, and going back to the records when the CLOA was first issued. 83
Situations like these cause uncertainties in the rights given to the CLOA members, and also on

Until Executive Order 79 was issued in July 2012, some local governments, by virtue of the
autonomy vested upon them through the Local Government Code, have issued Ordinances
declaring mining moratorium in their jurisdictions. Thus, this created a stoppage for some time,
as MPSAs and mining explorations have been issued by the central government.

While section12 of EO 79 explicitly stated that local ordinances should be consistent with the
Constitution and national legislation, some LGUs are still asserting their powers and authority
under the LGC, thereby creating an environment of uncertainty and tension in areas affected by
the moratorium.

Overlapping Claims, Tenurial Instruments Titles

It is common knowledge that because different agencies issue multiple tenurial instruments
without a common reference map and shared database, there have been cases of overlaps as
follows:
     CLOAs, Free Patent and CADT on mining areas (e.g., Saguitarius Mines, Inc.);
     Titles (Free Patents) in protected areas;
     CLOAs in timberlands and protected areas;
     Titles (Free Patents) in timberlands.

There are no easy resolutions to these, except to work out suitable administrative mechanisms
to correct the mistakes made in the issuance of land and resource use rights.

Assessment of Indicators


            Indicators Assessed:

            LGI 8.1 Assignment of Responsibility: responsibility for conflict
            management at different levels is clearly assigned, in line with actual
            practice, relevant bodies are competent in applicable legal matters, and
            decisions can be appealed against

            LGI 8.2 The share of land affected by pending conflicts is low and decreasing



LGI 8.1 Assignment of Responsibility: responsibility for conflict management at different
levels is clearly assigned, in line with actual practice, relevant bodies are competent in
applicable legal matters, and decisions can be appealed against

8.1.1 – While there are parallel avenues for dispute resolution and cases cannot be pursued
in parallel through different channels, there is no sharing of information - D

The Rules of Courts provide for a clear assignment of responsibilities for resolving conflicts.
Rule 7, Section 5 requires a certification from the BJS/LP before it accepts cases filed before
higher courts.

Unfortunately, there is no dedicated higher court to handle land cases. They are normally
classified as civil and/or criminal case. As such, these are not easily detectable. Merits and
details of the case are considered privileged information and one has to rely on the accounting
or case index that only contains nature/caption of the case appearing on the complaint or
petition.

8.1.2 - Institutions for providing a first instance of conflict resolution are accessible at the
local level in less than half of communities, and where these are not available informal
institutions do not exist or cannot perform this function in a way that is locally recognized. -
C

Among indigenous groups, there exist traditional conflict resolution mechanisms that are
effective in resolving conflicts within the community. Inter tribal conflicts are resolved through
Council of Elders, or through the facilitation of NCIP or other parties.

For non-indigenous groups, the Barangay Justice System offers the first level of recourse to
conflict resolution.

Civil society and religious institutions may also act as mediators. For agrarian related cases,
there are the DAR Adjudication Board (DARAB) and the ALI.

However, decisions from these may not always be equitable nor are the disputes always
immediately resolved with finality. “There are local resolutions of conflicts that are not binding,
especially with the next generation84”. Regarding the formal institutions, there are still many
people, particularly among the poor, who find these legal processes “alien” or unfamiliar and

                                                                                                    118
due to the cost of filing cases, maintaining legal counsel, insecurities of facing lawyers, among
others. Accordingly, “legal process should be palatable to the lumads and Moro 85”.

8.1.3 - There is a local informal dispute resolution system that makes decisions that are not
always equitable but this system is recognized in the formal judicial or administrative
dispute resolution system - C

The Barangay Justice System is one mechanism whereby informal dispute resolution is
encouraged. Only after there is no agreement will the case be allowed to be elevated to the
Courts.

In addition, there are informal dispute resolution mechanisms in Mindanao particularly among
indigenous groups, but the extent to which these are recognized in formal system shall be
explored.

In Bangsamoro region, the Shari’a law is widely practiced. The Shari’a District Courts (SDCs)
and Shari’a Circuit Courts (SCCs) were created in 1977 through Presidential Decree 1083, and
are also known as the Code of Muslim Personal Laws. These courts have been established to
resolve cases involving Muslims86. However, the Shari’a law is somehow limited only to the
resolution of civil cases, such as, marriages, divorce, custody/guardianship of children,
registration and communal properties87.

In customary system, decisions may not always be equitable and not equal with women, young
people and strangers are disadvantaged. For instance, the Shari’a law allows man to have many
wives but the woman can only have one husband88. This is also true to other customary laws of
indigenous tribes. In property ownership, the husband owns the properties, except for those
properties acquired by the woman before marriage89.

8.1.4 - A process exists to appeal rulings on land cases at high cost and the process takes a
long time/the costs are low but the process takes a long time - C

The Rules of Courts provides a clear mechanism for appeals. Rule 40 provides the process for
appeals from decisions of the Municipal Trial Court. The process for appeals from decisions of
the Regional Trial Courts is contained in Rule 41. Rule 43 provides for the process of petitioning
for review of RTC decision to the Court of Appeals. Rules 44 – 55 lays down the procedures for
appeals at the Court of Appeals. Rule 56 B contains the procedure for appeals in the Supreme
Court.

Based on the Philippines LGAF, the processes for appeal of land dispute rulings entails
high cost and takes a long time to resolve. A review of cases decided by the Supreme Court in
2012 showed that in more than 90% of the cases it took more than 20 years for cases to be
resolved with finality. Even cases first filed with the lower court as far back as 1970 were only
decided by the Supreme Court in 2012.

In Mindanao, at the Municipal and Regional Trial Courts (MTC/RTC) levels, the length of time
for the resolution of cases are influenced by availability of counsels and logistical nuances such
as court calendars but land dispute cases in general take 2 to 5 years to resolve. For CA and SC,

decisions will take much longer. Fortunately, around 90% these cases are resolved in the court
of first instance.

The judicial cost of the cases depends on (1) the amount of the claims, and (2) the assessed
value of the land in dispute. This excludes out of court expenses such as attorney’s fees and
litigation expenses which many farmers find prohibitive.

LGI 8.2 The Share of land affected by pending conflicts is low and decreasing.

8.2.1 - Land disputes in the formal court system are between 10% and 30% of the total
court cases. – B

In a research conducted at the Office of Executive Clerk of Court in Cagayan de Oro90, land
disputes comprise 25.6% of the total number of cases filed. This circumstance is reflected in one
of the branches, the Regional Trial Court Branch 41, having 22.6% land cases of their entire
portfolio.

8.2.2 - A decision in a land related conflict is reached in the first instance court within 2
years or more for 90% of the cases - D

In Mindanao, at the MTC/RTC levels, the length of time for the resolution of cases are
influenced by availability of counsels and logistical nuances such as court calendars but land
dispute cases in general take 2 to 5 years to resolve. For CA and SC, decisions will take much
longer. Fortunately, around 90% these cases, are resolved in the court of first instance.

In the Philippines, it is almost impossible for land related cases to be settled within one year in
the first instance Court anywhere in the Philippines. In the case of Tacloban, Leyte; the
Executive Judge reported that it is common for land cases to take more than 5 years in the
Courts to get resolved. Other RTCs reported too that it is very common to have land cases still
unresolved in the lower courts that are more than 10 years old.

8.2.3 - The share of long-standing conflicts is greater than 20% of the total pending land
dispute court cases. – B

In CDO, 90% of the cases are resolved in the Court of First Instance.

In the Philippines, a review and analysis of all cases decided by the Supreme Court in 2012
revealed that of the total 961 cases decided with finality, 163 involved land dispute cases. Of
these, 159 or 97% took more than 5 years for the lower courts to issue decisions.

It was pointed out, however, that an accurate count may not be obtained if courts are the only
determinant. The land cases being discussed about in the dimension are those cases that involve
inter-departmental conflicts e.g. NCIP’s claims in conflict with DENR but there are also intra-
organizational issues in the RTC that need to be counted.

Two deficiencies are needed to be added in the rating of the indicator:

      Court cases on land disputes. In the RTC, when a case is tracked as a land case, it refers to
       a land registration case.

      Reporting system of courts. The government reporting system refers to service count. For
       instance, when a case is resolved at the RTC, this case is counted but it does not
       necessarily mean it is fully resolved because the case can still go up to the Court of
       Appeals and the Supreme Court, both of which will take on separate and respective
       counts of the cases filed in these levels. In addition, the Supreme Court will not divulge
       information on the pending cases.



Summary and Recommendations

Social injustice as a result of land dispossession in the colonial past either by force or by legal
manipulations may take a while to resolve. No appropriate formal or informal mechanisms yet
exist. These issues will have to be addressed through political negotiations with the consent of
the general public, particularly those of the Mindanawons.

The recent Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro, however, provides the creation of
the Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC) tasked to undertake a study. It is




                                                                                                 121
intended to promote healing and reconciliation of the different communities that have been
affected by the conflict including those marginalized through land dispossession.

Other than these challenges that may be narrowly situated in the ARMM areas in general, land
disputes are fairly contained and that mechanisms for dispute resolution are in place. Rules of
the courts are relatively clear and there are rooms for appeal, if needed.

A more encouraging development is the institutionalization of alternative dispute mechanisms
as a required step before going to the formal courts. Initial figures from the BJS show that from
1980 to 1999, BJS received 147,341 cases per year and roughtly around 87% of these have been
settled through mediation or arbitration. Similarly, DARAB handled 167,525 cases per year
from 1988 to 1999 and settled 92% of these cases. 92

The cost of resolving cases is not prohibitive and are accessible. The difficulty comes when cases
are appealed at higher courts.

Line agencies engaged in land administration and management such as DAR, DENR and NCIP
are vested with quasi-judicial power to mediate and conciliate disputes within their primary
jurisdictions. Unfortunately, overlapping jurisdictions among these agencies are not easily
resolved.

This problem is recognized by these agencies and issued a Joint Memorandum Order No. 01-12
on January 2012 Clarifying, Restating and Interfacing the Respective Jurisdictions, Policies,
Programs and Projects of the DAR, DENR, LRA and the NCIP in Order to Address Jurisdictional and
Operational Issues Between and Among the Agencies.

Unfortunately, they found it difficult to settle among them at the local (provincial and regional)
level as they have to be answerable to their agency managers. They have to follow strictly their
mandate that, in the first place, is the source of the confusion.

It is essential that some administrative remedies be worked out to address the errors and
overlaps in rights recognition, so that these do not escalate into conflicts, and that an
environment of peace and stability among communities and investors is in place.

It is also apparent that while there are not much disputes among private parties, the
administration by various agencies of their mandate to issue titles and tenurial instruments,
coupled with the lack of a unified mapping projection of all rights given has escalated the
overlaps and contributed to uncertainties in the title deeds and/or tenure, including long term
leases on public lands. Some of these overlaps are borne out of errors in projection, inadequate
capacities and diligence in field validation, as well as the incomplete mapping and inventory of
occupants and rights holders on both private A&D and public lands.

There is no complete inventory of such overlaps, and therefore the magnitude of the problem is
not easy to report. However, from all indications, it is safe to say that this is a huge problem in
Mindanao, where title issuance has been very much delayed, where there are large tracts of land
under long term leases, and where collective CLOAs occupy almost a million of land; where
ancestral domains cover more than 3.37 million of land area; and where most of the CARP areas
distributed were in public lands.

In addition to the recommendations mentioned above on having unified projection systems,
harmonizing land records across agencies, development of protocols for information sharing,
the following recommendations are made:

Conduct a comprehensive inventory of conflicting government issued titles and instruments. It
is essential to have a good sense of the magnitude of the problem before any practical program
can be developed. Such an inventory could start with the agencies based on what complaints
have been lodged in their respective offices; and then progressing towards more commonly
known problematic areas. Based on certain typologies, some “standard” solutions can be
developed, working with communities and local government units. It is essential that such
administrative solutions be developed with the participation of rights holders or occupants in
order to formulate practical solutions to the issues. These could then contribute to developing
models for reconciling disputes, and or correcting the errors that have been committed in the
past. Some good examples on how IP communities have managed to resolve overlaps with
CADTs is the experience of some of holders in Davao, wherein long term agreements with IP
communities and private persons have been forged to develop portions of their domain for
commercial and other economic uses. The instrument that the IP communities used can be
further examined and the case more fully reviewed to determine how such an informal system
has worked to the mutual benefit of the parties affected.

Undertake a systematic dispute resolution program. This could be tied up with titling or tenure
security improvement program. The aim is to ensure that any pending land issue is unlocked in
order for the rights holders to freely and fully enjoy the benefits therefrom. This should reduce
investors’ risk, at the same time enable the rights holders to get the most out of his/her
ownership or rights over the property. The plan of DAR to resolve past errors in the issuance of
CLOAs under CARP through negotiations with DENR is one solution that can be applied. Other
areas of conflict would include: CLOAs with CADTs; IFMAs within CBFMAs; unrecognized forest
communities in areas under IFMA, CADTs, etc.




                                                                                             123
5.0 Conclusions and Recommendations
This study was motivated by the question: how does the quality of land governance affect
investments and generation of more and better jobs in Mindanao?

The hypotheses being: land investments create jobs. However, investments flow when lands are
free of encumbrances, where tenure rights are recognized and enforced, land market transactions
are open and transparent, disputes are fairly and quickly settled, and land management and
administration is efficient and effective. Moreover, good land governance creates a policy
environment that stimulates economic activities among local investors and rights holders for them
to share benefits equitably, access credit and invest in business undertakings that generate jobs .

The assessment made through the LGAF process revealed that the state of land governance in
Mindanao is much below international best practice, and worse than the state of the Philippines’
land governance. Mindanao’s performance fared lower in the following indicators:

        Recognition of continuum of rights
        Respect for and enforcement of rights
        Although not assessed as part of the Philippines LGAF, Mindanao’s performance under
         the indicator rights to forests and common lands are still considered second best
         practice;
        Effectiveness and equity in land use regulations
        All the indicators under public land management namely: (i) identification of public
         land and clear management; (ii) justification and time efficiency of acquisition process;
         (iii) transparency and fairness in acquisition process.
        Although not all indicators and dimensions were assessed in the Philippines LGAF on
         transfers of large tracts of land to investors , Mindanao fared less on all dimensions
         and indicators under this Module: (i) transfer of public land to private use through
         clear and competitive process; (ii) private investment strategy; (iii) effective,
         consistent and transparent policy implementation; (iv) and accessibility by the public
         of contracts involving public lands.
        On public provision of land information, both the Philippines and Mindanao scored
         the same except that in Mindanao, its rating is lower in the following dimensions: (i)
         formalization of land possession by the poor; and (ii) financial sustainability of the
         registry; (iii) recording of all relevant private encumbrances; (iv) searcheability of the
         registry; and (v) synchronization of all information in public registries to ensure
         integrity of rights and reduce transaction costs.
        Clear process for property valuation;
        On dispute resolution, Mindanao’s scores are worse in the following dimensions: (i)
         clear assignment of responsibility in conflict resolution; (ii) accessibility to the public
         of conflict resolution mechanisms; (iii) agreements reached through informal dispute
         resolution systems; and (iv) accessibility, affordability and timeliness of processes for
         appealing dispute rulings.

On the other hand, Mindanao performed better in the following dimensions:
        Recording of women’s property rights as accorded by law;
        Restrictions on urban land ownership effectively serves public purpose;
        Land use planning effectively guides urban spatial expansion in Davao city, compared
         to Quezon City – two biggest cities in Mindanao and Davao, respectively;
        In key cities in Mindanao, large cities perform better in real property tax collection
         compared to the Philippines average for all LGUs.

The comparison of Philippines and Mindanao scorecards appear as Annex A.


                                                                                                124
Most of the above performance reflects the inability of the national government to develop
capacities of its field offices, undertake policy and institutional reforms. These play out in
Mindanao in a dramatic way because of the inherent large areas covered, the historical conflicts,
and the unique challenges faced by the region in dealing with socio economic and cultural
issues.

The assessment of land governance in Mindanao highlighted uncertainties of land rights due to
conflicting policies, weak institutions, limited access to land information, ineffective and
inefficient bureaucracy.

Overall, these have constrained the potential of Mindanao to encourage investments and
generate more and better jobs.

Combined, these have created a situation where:

There is a great proportion of land that have insecure rights– about 2.29 million parcels in
public alienable and disposable lands. In public lands, there is an undetermined number of
people and areas where occupants’ rights have not been recognized. This creates disincentives
to invest in productive use of the land, and locks these properties out of the formal land market.
Access to formal credit is also constrained, including under valuation for sale and informal
mortgage.

There is weak recognition of IP rights, and CADTs are not developed to their potential, thus
leaving communities impoverished. These involve a significant area of Mindanao – 3.37 million
hectares.

There is great uncertainty in land rights even for those who have been issued titles,
tenure, and long-term leases because of the manner by which these have been issued,
and the way the records to rights are kept at various agencies.

These result in rights holders not able to protect their rights and investments. For potential
investors, this situation has created an environment where it is difficult to find land to develop,
even with the availability of capital. Where interest is present, the unclear property rights to
land has made negotiations a challenging process, and there is uncertainty as to who the
legitimate rights holders are that the investors should negotiate with. A progressive approach to
unbundle the encumbrances that make these titles and rights insecure should be undertaken.

The potential for forest development to contribute to more and better jobs in Mindanao
remains below optimal due to weak governance in public land management.

An undetermined number of occupants of forestlands, who are not covered by tenure
instruments such as CBFMA, SIFMA, CSCs, do not have secure rights, thus there is no incentive
to engage in long-term investments to improve land productivity. In Mindanao where forestlands
constitute more than 6 million hectares and where about 700,000 hectares are under open access
conditions, bringing these lands to productive use through secure tenure rights is an important
requisite for job creation.

On the part of investors, finding large tracts of public lands for agroforestry development has
been hampered by: overlapping rights, absence of updated information, presence of
undocumented occupants who do not have secure property rights, and bureaucratic
procedures. Identifying the persons with whom negotiations should be made has been a
significant constraint, in view of unclear land rights, and the presence of disputes. As a result,
investors incur additional costs and risks due to these factors.


                                                                                               125
If only there is more efficient and effective determination of land that could be made available
for large scale investments, if the rights of occupants can be recognized to enable them to
benefit from partnerships with commercial interests, and if there is more transparent system
for mapping of all rights in pubic lands, then the potential contribution of developing the
portion of forestlands that could be designated for productive use to generate jobs would be
enormous. This should be coupled with stable policy environment that effectively regulates
utilization and sustainable forest management.

Large areas of land are affected by overlaps and conflicts. Due to administrative
weaknesses and lack of effective coordination among agencies, many titles, rights and tenure
instruments are marred by errors and conflicts thereby diminishing their value, the security
attached to these rights, and potential for investments. It is essential that there be a
comprehensive assessment to determine the magnitude of the problem, and a systematic way of
dealing with these issues with the affected parties that are mutually acceptable, and are within
the administrative recourse of existing laws.

Collective CLOA holders with weak capacities are unable to fully benefit from large commercial
farm operations and economies of scale through the AVAs.

In Mindanao, almost half of the total A&D lands are covered by CARP, essentially locking
these lands out of the land market. About a million hectares are covered by collective CLOAs.
Experience with AVAs have been spotty, with many unorganized and weak ARBs not able to
negotiate fair terms with the investors, thus losing out on the opportunity to benefit from
economies of scale in commercial agricultural development. It is important that a review of the
AVA agreements be made, the guidelines be examined, and a program to strengthen the
capacities of ARB organizations be directed at those with existing agreements. This would
require a facilitated approach so that the inequitable arrangements can be corrected in a way
that benefits both parties. The new AVA Guidelines issued by DAR in June 2016 is a step in the
right direction. Its implementation and impact on improving the welfare of farmer associations
with AVA agreements need to be monitored.

Local governments are not able to fully discharge their responsibilities on land use
planning and regulations, property taxation and valuation to improve service delivery.
The result is increased dependence on the national government, unplanned urban growth, and
increasing informality.

The recommended actions for each of the land governance thematic areas are discussed in more
detail in section 4.0.

To address the above and create more and better jobs in Mindanao, the following summarizes
the recommendations proposed for the short and medium term:

   1. Develop administrative mechanisms to address current conflicts and overlaps in land
      and resource use rights. This could be undertaken through a case by case approach,
      assisted by Facilitators, and procedures for resolution documented.
   2. Develop an inter operable land information system that reflects all the interests on land,
      their status and metes and bounds. This should be supported by a common projection
      systems which reflects all the rights and interests in the parcels, including long term
      leases and interests in public lands and ancestral domains.
   3. Accelerate titling of untitled lands by providing incentives to LGUs to develop and
      implement tenure security improvement programs. In support of this, the LGUs should
      establish their unified land information system to reflect all the parcels, and associated
      information


                                                                                            126
   4. Strengthen capacities of LGUs on property taxation and valuation.
   6. Build on the gains from CARP by developing and implementing a program to address
      second-generation issues, and complete CARP implementation as soon as possible.
   7. Conduct an inventory of public lands under long-term lease agreements to determine
      their current status; properly mark areas that are open for investments.
   8. Complete mapping and recognition of tenure rights in public forestlands and protected
      areas.
   8. Develop a physical framework plan for Mindanao; and
   9. Speed up recognition of IP rights through completion of mapping and registration of
      ADTs; strengthen IP communities and develop ADSDPPs.

In parallel, the above actions should be supported by pursuing the following policy agenda for
the long term:
    • Remove overlaps in the duplication of land administration functions of LRA and DENR;
    • Improve access to land information from RoD/LRA.
    • Unify all title deeds involving Free Patents, CLOAs, CADTs, etc.; create a uniform
        projection map which shows all interests on land, and have all these registered in the
        RoDs;
    • Expand the registry to include long term leases and other interests in public lands;
    • Remove the 5 year restriction on agricultural Free Patents;
    • Remove the approval of property valuation function from local governments and
        establish an independent National Valuation Authority to undertake such responsibility

All the above actions can be encapsulated in an updated Lands Sector Development
Framework which will spell out the key strategies for achieving the above in Mindanao, and the
rest of the Philippines.
