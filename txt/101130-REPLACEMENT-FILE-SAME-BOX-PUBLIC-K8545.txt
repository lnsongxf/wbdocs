viii	                    Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
Foreword

The 21st session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations
Framework Convention (COP21), which takes place in Paris in December
2015, has the ambition of reaching an agreement on climate change that
would limit global warming to less than 2°C above pre-industrial levels.
   For Africa, more than any other region of the world, the outcome of these
climate negotiations is of vital importance. The reason is simple. While Africa
is the region that contributes the least to greenhouse gas emissions, African
countries suffer the most from the impact of climate change. From the Sahel
to the Horn of Africa, to the south of the continent and the small island
nations, African countries are experiencing first-hand the devastating effects
of more extreme weather patterns. In West Africa, for instance, where climate
change scenarios suggest an increase in the frequency and intensity of tidal
waves and storm surge, a potential sea-level rise of one meter would cause the
loss of 18,000 km2 of land, ultimately magnifying the damage to infrastruc-
ture and causing the displacement of populations.
   There is an inextricable link between Africa’s climate and development
agendas. For example, we cannot separate agriculture and food security from
climate change. A 1.5°C to 2°C increase in temperature by the 2030s and
2040s will lead to a 40 to 80 percent reduction in the area of land suitable for
growing maize, millet and sorghum, the main staple foods in Africa. Research
also shows strong evidence linking climate change to human conflicts.
   Unless bold and decisive action is taken, climate variability and change will
jeopardize or reverse Africa’s hard-won development achievements and its
aspirations for further growth and poverty reduction. Increasingly frequent
droughts, floods, and cyclones threaten to drive Africans into poverty and
create inescapable poverty traps. The correlation between climate, economic
growth and poverty is well established, won’t disappear, and will only grow
stronger.
   Adaptation to the effects of climate change is an enormous challenge. The
costs of adaptation are staggering and will only continue to rise. Consider
this: while the needs currently amount to $5–10 billion per year (in order to
adapt to a 2°C warming), they could be as high as $20–50 billion around mid-
century, and close to $100 billion in case of a 4°C warming. Unfortunately, the
volume of climate finance flowing to Africa pales in comparison with the
needs. Current levels of funding for adaptation in Africa amount to at most
$3 billion per year, which is negligible considering the needs.
   Fortunately, there is also some good news. On the issue of climate change,
African leaders are speaking with one voice and transforming challenges into
opportunities. The fact is that the continent is uniquely positioned to build
resilience by betting on renewable sources of energy (plentiful in Africa) to
bring power to its people, schools, health centers and businesses. For African
governments, promoting climate-smart agriculture is also a priority. There
is  a range of agricultural management solutions, which can improve crop

productivity, enhance resilience to climate shocks and reduce carbon
emissions. Delivering this triple win is essential to addressing Africa’s food
­
security agenda.
   To help Africa deliver on its promises, the World Bank has prepared an
Africa Climate Business Plan which will boost the region’s ability to adapt to
the changing climate while reducing greenhouse emissions through a number
of concrete actions. Implementation of the Plan will enhance Africa’s efforts
to strengthen, power and enable resilience.
   The ambition of the Plan is to raise $16 billion in climate finance by 2020,
$5.7 billion of which is from IDA, and the rest from a variety of sources,
including bilateral and multilateral sources, dedicated climate finance sources,
and the private sector. The Africa Climate Business Plan will contribute to the
World Bank Group’s efforts to increase the share of its own financing dedi-
cated to climate action—adaptation and mitigation—by one-third by 2020.
   While this Plan is arguably only a partial contribution to meet Africa’s
financial needs for climate action, it is a meaningful one. The World Bank
Group looks forward to working with African governments, Africa’s develop-
ment partners and the private sector to implement the activities included in
the Plan. By galvanizing climate action, deploying expertise and mobilizing
financing, together we can support Africa in its quest for a greener and more
resilient future.

Overview

Africa’s climate and development agendas are inextricably linked: if unad-
dressed, climate variability and change will jeopardize Africa’s hard-won
development achievements and its aspirations for further growth and poverty
reduction. Climate drivers are involved in most of the shocks that keep or
push African households into poverty. They include natural disasters (such as
loss of assets and disability after floods), health shocks (such as health expen-
ditures and lost labor income as a result of malaria), crop losses (as a result of
drought or crop disease), and food price shocks. It is estimated that floods
affected more than 1 million people in African cities between 1997 and 2008.
   Climate-related factors will make poverty reduction ever more challenging
in the future, for three reasons. First, warming on the order of 1.5°C–1.75°C
above preindustrial levels is virtually unavoidable, as a result of past emissions
of greenhouse gases. This warming (which could well be higher for parts of
Africa) will cause loss of cropland, reduce crop production and fish catches,
worsen undernourishment, and increase the risk of drought.
   Second, as a result of the persisting gap between global pledges for climate
mitigation and the abatement efforts needed to control further climate change,
there is a considerable risk that further warming will materialize. If existing
policies are not scaled up to attain the abatement targets that countries
formulated in the lead-up to the Paris climate summit in December 2015,
­
warming could approach, or even exceed, 3°C above preindustrial times.
   Such an increase would have disastrous consequences for Sub-Saharan
African. Warming in the range of 3°C–4°C above preindustrial temperatures
would result in heat extremes affecting the vast majority of the continent’s
land area, heightened risks of extreme drought (particularly in southern
Africa), sharp increases in the rate of crop failure (up to every other year in
southern Africa), a 20 percent reduction in the yields of major staple crops,
and, by the end of the century, flooding that would affect up to 18 million
people a year.
   Third, regardless of whether warming is contained below 2°C or exceeds
that threshold, Africa will face considerable uncertainty regarding the effects
of warming on local weather patterns and hydrological cycles. For every
scenario for greenhouse gas concentration and associated warming, there is
­
considerable uncertainty about the response of precipitation, run-off, ground-
water recharge, and so forth. This uncertainty creates formidable challenges
for development planning and the design of projects related to water manage-
ment (irrigation, hydropower, water supply, flood control) and climate-­
sensitive infrastructure (for example, roads and bridges).
   Given the threats posed by current climate shocks—and the even greater
challenges linked to future climate change—the gap between needs and
resource flows needed to scale up the continent’s resilience to an increasingly
hostile climate is alarming. Current levels of funding for adaptation in Africa
are estimated to be on the order of $3 billion a year. Based on figures from the

Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development 	                    xi
World Bank and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP),
Africa needs to spend $5–$10 billion a year today to adapt to a 2°C warming,
$20–$50 billion to do so around midcentury, and close to $100 billion if
warming increases by 4°C.
   The Africa Climate Business Plan represents the World Bank’s contribution
to reducing the funding gap, which the Bank will do by deploying technical
expertise, mobilizing financing from various sources, and facilitating the
engagement of stakeholders on climate action.
   The plan’s emphasis is on adaptation, which is consistent with the priorities
expressed by Africa’s Intended Nationally Determined Contributions
(INDCs). Of the 44 INDCs African countries submitted to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as of October 2015,
28 (63 percent) included an estimate of the financing needs for adaptation—a
much higher figure than for the rest of the world (27 percent).
   The plan supports the World Bank Group’s overall goals to end extreme
poverty by 2030 and promote shared prosperity in the developing world.
Recent World Bank analysis (World Bank 2015b) indicates that climate
change could push up to 43 million additional Africans below the poverty line
by 2030—a stark reminder of the vital role enhancing climate resilience plays
in poverty reduction.
   The plan reflects contributions and inputs by a wide variety of partners with
whom the Bank is already collaborating on the ground in an effort to increase
Africa’s resilience to climate variability and change. The initiatives included
reflect dialogue held with African countries by the International Development
Association (IDA), which will leverage as much as possible the support of
other parts of the World Bank Group (e.g., IBRD, IFC and MIGA).
   The plan aims to raise awareness of and accelerate resource mobilization for
priority climate-resilient and low-carbon initiatives in Africa. It focuses on a
dozen or so priority areas, clustered in three groups, where the World Bank,
in collaboration with African governments and a variety of regional and
international partners, expects to help achieve results in the near future. The
plan contributes to meeting the World Bank Group’s corporate objective of
increasing the share of its financing for climate change by one-third (from
21 percent to 28 percent) by 2020.
   The first cluster of the plan (“strengthening resilience”) includes selected
initiatives aimed at boosting the resilience of the continent’s assets. These ini-
tiatives comprise Africa’s natural capital (landscapes, forests, agricultural
land, inland water bodies, and oceans, with a special focus on small island
developing states); physical capital (cities and physical assets in coastal areas,
including roads and other infrastructure); and human and social capital
(including improving social protection against climate shocks for the more
vulnerable and addressing the climate-related drivers of migration, in order
to mitigate the effects of climate shocks on social cohesion).
   The second cluster (“powering resilience”) relates to opportunities for scal-
ing up low-carbon energy sources in Africa. In addition to helping mitigate
climate change, these activities yield considerable resilience benefits. Societies
with adequate access to energy are less vulnerable to climate shocks, because

xii	                 Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
                     when power becomes more accessible, irrigation systems can be activated in
                     times of drought, early warning systems and telecommunication systems can
                     be deployed before and after natural disasters, alternative revenue-generating
                     activities can be undertaken, health services can be provided more easily,
                     study hours can be extended (contributing to better education), and so forth.
                        The third cluster (“enabling resilience”) provides data, information,
                     and  decision-making tools for promoting climate-resilient development
                     across sectors by strengthening the region’s hydro-meteorological systems
                     at the regional and county level and building the capacity to plan and design
                     climate-resilient investments.
                        This plan is a living document that may be updated and expanded in the
                     coming months to cover other areas not addressed in this version, such as
                     health and transport, which the Bank is well positioned to support through
                     sector dialogue and financial and technical assistance.
                        A preliminary assessment by World Bank staff estimates that implementing
                     the Africa Climate Business Plan will require about $16.1 billion in the period
                     2016–2020 (table O.1) to achieve the outcomes described in this document

and exemplified in table O.3. The business plan also defines results that could
be achieved in the longer term (up to 2026), at an estimated cost of about
$21.3 billion. About $5.6 billion of the financing of the plan’s fast-track phase
could come from national and regional IDA programs, $2.2 billion from var-
ious climate finance instruments, $1.9 billion from the rest of the develop-
ment community, and $3.5 billion form the private sector, leaving almost
$2 billion still to be found (table O.2).
  The activities included in the pan are of a “pipeline” nature: they have not
yet been approved by the governing bodies of the relevant financiers (although
in several cases project preparation process is nearing completion). Box O.1
spells out the assumptions used to estimate financing.
  By providing an organizing framework for different World Bank teams and
their partners around a platform of concrete activities that will improve resil-
ience, the Africa Climate Business Plan will help achieve results in the follow-
ing areas:
••     Resource mobilization. Two indicators will assess resource mobilization.
       The first is the share of resources in the total financing plan that are mobi-
       lized at different stages of implementation. The targets are 25 percent of
       funding to be mobilized by June 2017 (end of IDA17), 50 percent by
       December 2018 (midterm of IDA18), and 75 percent by June 2020 (end
       of IDA18). As the plan may also have catalytic effects on other interven-
       tions (in addition to those described in the document), the second indi-
       cator proposed is the share of IDA commitments to Sub-Saharan Africa
       with climate co-benefits, which the World Bank has been monitoring
       since 2011. The target is to increase this share from a baseline of 17 ­percent
       (the average across all sectors for the period FY11–FY15) to 22 percent
       over the period FY16–FY20. The increase would help the World Bank
       Group meet its recent commitment to increase climate finance.
••     Increase in Africa’s resilience to climate variability and change. A wide range
       of outcome indicators is proposed for each of the plan’s components. The
       proposed aggregate target is for at least 75 percent of these indicators to be
       met by June 2023 (end of IDA19). The lower-than-100 percent target reflects
       the fact that the goals of the Africa Climate Business Plan are ambitious.

xiv	                     Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
Box O.1  Assumptions Used in Estimating Sources of Financing
of the Africa Climate Business Plan
Funding of the business plan is based on the following assumptions.

International Development Association (IDA)
Resource mobilization for the fast-track part of the plan spans two IDA cycles: IDA17 (which
ends June 30, 2017) and IDA18 (which will run from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2020). Activities
that would start in the earlier years of the plan would be considered for financing under IDA17;
estimates of financing in the outer years of the plan refer to activities to be considered for sup-
port by IDA18 and are more tentative. The plan is fully consistent with the recently announced
World Bank Group goal to increase the share of financing with climate co-benefits by one-third
by 2020. That increase will be achieved through better integration of climate considerations into
project planning and design. The additional technical work during project preparation needed
to achieve such integration could be co-financed by dedicated resources mobilized by donors
and partners.

Climate Finance
Funding estimates under this rubric comprise various instruments, including the Climate
Investment Funds (in particular the Forest Investment Program [FIP]); the Global Environment
Facility (GEF); the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, including both the readiness and the
carbon finance mechanisms; the Green Climate Fund (GCF); and other initiatives, such as the
Central African Forest Initiative (CAFI). Estimates are based on consultations with staff of
each financing institution (on eligibility, strategic fit, and so forth). Some GCF projects (such
as the hydro-met project) have already been submitted to the GCF Secretariat; others are in
preparation.

Other development finance (bilateral and multilateral institutions)
Figures included in this category are based on technical consultations with the staff of a variety
of financing partners of the World Bank, including the African Development Bank (AfDB),
the West African Development Bank (BOAD), and bilateral partners (including the Agence
Française de Développement [AFD], the Department for International Development [DFID],
the German Agency for International Cooperation [GIZ], and the Nordic Development Fund
[NDF]). These consultations range from preliminary to advanced, but in general there is a rea-
sonable expectation that a substantial portion of the funding identified will materialize.

Private sector
Estimates of private sector financing reflect the potential of projects to generate streams of rev-
enues adequate to remunerate private investors. Private sector participation is expected mainly
in the energy sector and to some extent in agriculture.


                                                                               box continues next page

   Box O.1  Assumptions Used in Estimating Sources of Financing
   of the Africa Climate Business Plan (continued)
   Domestic sources
   Estimates of domestic financing are based on the record of government counterpart financing
   across World Bank projects.

   To be determined
   “To be determined” is an estimate of the residual gap that needs to be filled in order to fully
   finance the projects included in the plan. It is expected that this document will serve as a plat-
   form to help close this gap, by mobilizing additional interest and support from both existing and
   new partners with an interest in promoting climate-resilient low-carbon development in Africa
   (such as China and the Arab funds).




   Two levels of organizational arrangements are proposed for rolling out the
plan. At the external level, to ensure an adequate framework for successful
implementation of the plan, the Bank will continue to systematically inte-
grate climate change considerations into country and sector dialogue, in
accordance with commitments made as part of the IDA17 Replenishment.
This effort includes addressing climate change in Systematic Country
Diagnostics (SCDs) and integrating climate considerations in Country
Partnership Framework (CPFs), which will help identify the instruments
(policy lending, investment lending, technical assistance, programs for
results, guarantees, and so forth) that can best achieve the results envisaged
by the plan and promote synergies with the Bank’s work in the related areas
of jobs and gender.
   To nurture and expand partnerships for implementing the plan, the Bank
will convene working-level meetings with organizations collaborating on spe-
cific components on an as-needed basis. It could also organize high-level con-
ferences with a wide range of stakeholders. The first such meeting could take
place in the early stages of implementation, in order to spur both fundraising
and action on the ground. The second could take place toward the end of the
implementation period (in late 2018, for example). It would be aimed at con-
sidering prospects for extending/scaling up the plan in order to achieve its
longer-term goals.
   Within the Bank, implementation of each of the plan’s components will be
spearheaded by a lead Global Practice (GP), collaborating as needed with
other GPs and the Climate Change Cross-Cutting Solution Area (CCSA).
Senior management in the Africa Region, the GPs, and CCSAs will provide
strategic direction and oversight.

Context and Rationale
Climate change has a very strong effect on poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa,
where millions of people depend on rain-fed agriculture or live in drought-
prone zones in urban areas. Climate variability is already exacting a heavy toll
on development; future change may have catastrophic impacts, as drought,
floods, and storm surges could push millions of people into poverty and pre-
vent millions of others from emerging from it.
   The Africa Climate Business Plan identifies a dozen areas where efforts
could be stepped up to assist African countries in making their development
more climate resilient. The plan is grounded in the World Bank’s overall com-
mitment to support climate-resilient and low-carbon development across the
developing world and its solid engagement in technical and financial assis-
tance to support climate action in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Chapter 1

Africa’s Development and
Climate Agenda
Climate is involved in most of the shocks that keep or push households into
poverty (World Bank 2015b). These shocks include natural disasters (such
as loss of assets and disability after floods); health shocks (such as health
expenditures and lost income as a result of malaria); and crop losses (as a
result of drought or crop disease) and food price shocks. The problem is
particularly apparent in Sub-Saharan Africa, where climate shocks such
as  drought, floods, and storm surges are already ravaging the continent
(map 1.1), pushing people further into poverty or frustrating their efforts
to emerge from it.
  Rainfall variability drives most of Africa’s agricultural production, given
the continent’s very limited irrigation infrastructure. As a result, GDP fluc-
tuates widely (figure 1.1 illustrates the point with respect to Senegal), with
important repercussions on the income of the poor and their ability to
save and build the assets needed to escape poverty.
  Climate-related factors will make poverty reduction ever more challenging
in the future, for three reasons. First, a certain amount of global warming
and  associated climate change is virtually unavoidable. As a result of the
greenhouse gases that have already accumulated in the atmosphere, it appears
very likely that the world is irrevocably headed toward warming of about
1.5°C–1.75°C above preindustrial levels, irrespective of the outcomes of
international negotiations to curb emissions. This global average conceals a
wider range of increases, with several parts of Africa expected to be at the
higher end of the range.
  Even if warming does not exceed 2°C, the following impacts can be expected
in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank 2013a):
••   loss of 40–80 percent of suitable cropping areas for cultivars of maize,
     millet, and sorghum
••   10 percent reduction in per capita crop production, with significant con-
     sequences for food availability and food security
••   15–65 percent increase in levels of undernourishment (depending on
     the subregion), as a result of declines in crop yields and nutritional
     quality
••   increasing drought risk, particularly in southern, central, and western
     Africa, with particularly severe implications for the 40 million people in
     Africa who earning their livings from livestock-based activities (De Haan
     and others 2015)
••   declines in potential fish catches off the coast of West Africa (where fish
     account for as much as half of the animal protein consumed) of as
     much as 50 percent by midcentury.

Second, as a result of the persisting gap between mitigation pledges and the
abatement efforts needed to limit further climate change, there is a consider-

                                                           policies are scaled
The extent of the increase will depend on whether existing ­
up to attain the targets indicated in the Intended Nationally  Determined
Contribution (INDC) submitted up to October 2015 (figure 1.2).1
  Warming approaching 4°C above preindustrial levels would have disas-
trous consequences for Sub-Saharan African, as the Turn Down the Heat
report (World Bank 2013a) documents:
••   Heat extremes would affect 70–80 percent of Africa’s land area in the
     summer months.
••   Southern Africa would be at risk of extreme drought, central Africa
     would be at risk of severe drought, and West Africa would face increased
     drought risk in general.

      increase to one in two years.
••    Yields of major staple crops could fall by 20 percent.
••    Floods could affect up to 18 million people a year by the end of the
      century.
Severe impacts are also likely on infrastructure in coastal zones, as a result of
sea-level rise and weather extremes such as cyclones. Cities are also likely to
be major hotspots of vulnerability (box 1.1).
   Third, regardless of whether warming is contained below 2°C or exceeds
that threshold, considerable uncertainty will exist regarding local weather
patterns and hydrological cycles in Africa. For every scenario of greenhouse
gas concentration and associated warming, there is a considerable uncer-
tainty about the response of precipitation, runoff, groundwater recharge, and
so forth. This uncertainty creates formidable challenges for planning and
designing projects related to water management (irrigation, hydropower,
water supply, flood control) and more generally climate-sensitive infrastruc-
ture (for example, roads and bridges).




     Box 1.1  How are Climate-Related Shocks Affecting African Cities?
     African cities are slated to face disproportional impacts of disaster and climate change. The prob-
     lem will affect a growing number of people, as the urban population of Africa is estimated to rise
     from its current level of 472 million to 659 million by 2025 and 1 billion by 2040.

     The poor will be especially hard hit, for several reasons. They often settle in undesirable parts of
     cities, including hazard-prone areas. Unsanitary living conditions in many settlements increase
     the risk of disease and epidemics. Housing is often informal, raising the risk of eviction or destruc-
     tion of home. Settlements are prone to collapse and fire damage and are more easily destroyed by
     natural disasters.

     Proximity to coasts and rivers leaves cities at high risk from climate change. Heavy rainfall
     upstream is compounded by degraded watersheds and in some cases forced dam releases, result-
     ing in exceptionally high river levels. Unplanned settlements, many in high-risk areas, coupled
     with aging and inadequately maintained drainage infrastructure, particularly in low-lying urban
     areas, exacerbate the situation, leaving millions of people vulnerable to flooding.

     Medium-size cities (cities with populations of 500,000–1 million people) are increasingly grap-
     pling with recurrent disasters. Dakar experiences recurrent flooding; the 2009 floods affected
     almost 360,000 people and caused $100 million in damages and losses. Recurrent floods in
     Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic, cause on average $7 million in damages
     and losses a year. Floods in 2009 left 14,500 people in Bangui—including some 6,000 children—­
     homeless, and  the malaria, diarrhea, and other water-borne diseases that followed the floods
              thousands more.
     affected ­

     By 2025 about 66 new cities will be added to the 81 cities currently in the medium-city range.
     This group of cities needs support to enhance their capacity to manage climate related risks.

                                                     others 2015) (figure 1.3). In wet climate scenarios, business-as-usual infra-

                                                        The priority attached to adaptation is reflected in the INDCs submitted by

    This business plan represents a major contribution by the World Bank to
 reduce Africa’s adaptation gap and meet the needs expressed by Africa in the
 INDCs. It outlines the Bank’s plans for deploying technical expertise, mobi-
 lizing financing from various sources, and facilitating the engagement of
 stakeholders on climate action. The plan was prepared in the lead-up to the
 21st Session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (COP21), in recognition of the fact that
 COP21 offers a key opportunity for harnessing political leadership and finan-
 cial support around the activities included in the plan.
    The plan reflects the contributions and inputs of a wide variety of partners
 with whom the Bank is already collaborating on the ground to increase
 Africa’s resilience to climate variability and change. The initiatives included in
 the plan reflect the dialogue held with African countries by the International
 Development Association (IDA), which will leverage the support of other
 parts of the World Bank Group (the International Bank for Reconstruction
 and Development [IBRD], the International Finance Corporation [IFC], and
 the Multilateral Insurance Guarantee Agency [MIGA]).
    The plan supports the World Bank Group’s overall goals of ending extreme
 poverty by 2030 and promoting shared prosperity and greater equity in the
 developing world. Recent analysis (World Bank 2015b) indicates that ­climate
 change could push as many as 43 million Africans below the poverty line—a
 stark reminder of the vital role of enhancing climate resilience in reducing
 poverty.

Scaling up World Bank
Support to Climate Action in
Africa

Foundation of the Business Plan
The Africa Climate Business Plan is firmly grounded in the World Bank
Group’s overall commitment to support climate-resilient and low-carbon
development across the developing world. Following the adoption in 2008
of the Strategic Framework on Development and Climate Change (SFDCC),
the institution developed a regional strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa,
“Making Development Climate-Resilient” (World Bank 2009). That strat-
egy articulated a vision and key operational priorities for the Bank Group’s
climate-­related work in Sub-Saharan Africa based on four pillars:
••   making adaptation and climate risk management a core component of
     development
••   taking advantage of mitigation opportunities
••   focusing on knowledge and capacity
••   scaling up financing opportunities.
Since 2009 the Bank has made considerable progress in supporting climate
action in Africa. It has mobilized substantial resources for climate action,
building on a solid foundation of analytical work and regional platforms for
cooperation and technical assistance, such as the TerrAfrica and Cooperation
for International Waters in Africa (CIWA) programs (box 2.1).
   An important vehicle for financial support is the suite of windows included
in the Climate Investment Funds (CIFs), which provide resources for climate-​
resilient, low-carbon development in 25 Sub-Saharan African countries
(box  2.2). In Africa the World Bank implements CIF-financed projects in
partnership with the African Development Bank.
   Over the five years for which climate finance tagging of World Bank opera-
tions is available (FY11–FY15), an estimated $7.6 billion of IDA financing in
Africa provided support for activities with climate co-benefits (adaptation,
mitigation, or both). Ninety-five percent of the total was for projects mapped
to the agriculture, energy, environment, social protection, urban develop-
ment, and water sectors. For these sectors, the share of activities with climate
co-benefits to total financing was about 30 percent, well above the corporate
average of 20 percent (figure 2.1).
   Other sectors, such as transport, have not featured as prominently to
date but have an important role to play going forward. Building the

  Box 2.1  Supporting Climate-Resilient Development through
  Regional Partnerships
  The TerrAfrica partnership (kick-started by the Bank and currently housed in the New
  Partnership for Africa’s Development [NEPAD]/Africa Union) has helped prepare and finance
  two umbrella investment programs aimed at improving land management and thereby contrib-
  uting to c­limate  resilience. The first is the $1.25 billion Strategic Investment Program for
  Sustainable Land Management, which includes 36 operations in 26 countries (12 of which are
  Bank financed). This program has expanded sustainable land management practices on an esti-
  mated 250,000 hectares of land. The second is the nearly $2 billion World Bank Group-Global
  Environment Facility Sahel and West Africa Program (SAWAP), in support of the Great Green
  Wall Initiative. It supports implementation of a country-driven vision for integrated natural
  resource management for ­   sustainable and climate-resilient development in 12 countries in West
  Africa and the Sahel.

  The TerrAfrica Leveraging Fund—funded by the European Community, the Netherlands, and
  Norway, to the tune of $23 million—provides seed money to support activities that have the
  potential to leverage wider sustainable land and water management benefits. It helps scale up
  such practices, fills gaps, and provides resources to support integrated approaches. It supports
  targeted activities typically in the $10,000–$350,000 range that existing funding mechanisms are
  not already adequately covering.

  The Cooperation in International Waters in Africa (CIWA) program supports African coun-
  tries as they seek to overcome complex political, financial, technical, and logistical barriers that
  arise in managing and developing international waters for climate-resilient growth. The pro-
  gram balances support for institutional development and information systems with assistance
  that helps riparians advance and improve the quality of investments. Typical institutional sup-
  port goes to developing climate-relevant information and modeling systems, strengthening the
  institutional and legal framework that underpins countries’ ability to cope with change, and
  facilitating ­citizen engagement and stakeholder access to climate-relevant information. Typical
  investment activities supported by the program include providing support for facilitating
  agreement among countries support and preparing regionally relevant investments in climate
  ­
  resilience, informing and sharing good practice on climate-resilient infrastructure implemen-
  tation, and advancing resource mobilization for technically sound projects. The CIWA pro-
  gram supports the integrated watershed management projects in the Niger, Zambezi, and Lake
  Chad basins that are described in the business plan.




  Box 2.2  Climate Investment Funds (CIF) Support to Sub-Saharan
  Africa: Selected Examples
  The Climate Investment Funds (CIF) help 72 developing countries pilot low-emissions and climate-­
  resilient development. Its four components—the Clean Technology Fund (CFP), the Forest Investment
  Program (FIP), the Pilot Program Climate Resilience (PPCR), and the Scaling up Renewable Energy
  Program (SREP)—are supporting 33 programs in 25 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Box 2.2  Climate Investment Funds (CIF) Support to Sub-Saharan
Africa: Selected Examples (continued)
The PPCR is currently supporting three Sub-Saharan Africa countries (Mozambique, Niger,
and Zambia), and programs for support for six more countries are in the pipeline. Mozambique
is receiving $102 million in investment funding from the PPCR to strengthen its climate resil-
ience, with complementary assistance on the policy side being delivered through a programmatic
Development Policy Lending series implemented by the World Bank. Areas of support include
infrastructure upgrades, better resource management, enhanced climate services, and the devel-
opment of local and national capacities for climate-resilient planning and action. The package
of financing includes support for addressing climate risks to the road infrastructure, including
through development of climate-resilient national roads standards to achieve transformative
impact at the national level.

With $63 million of PPCR support, the government of Niger is helping 38 rural communes
prepare or revise their local development plans and annual budgets in ways that better integrate
­
climate-sensitive initiatives. The participatory and locally led process involves all stakeholders in
the communes. The government is planning to scale up this experience to other communes. The
PPCR is also supporting an advisory services project that promotes the use of affordable, efficient
irrigation equipment by smallholder farmers. It aims to provide evidence of the benefits from
commercial, sustainable irrigation systems, which are needed to encourage private sector interest
to scale up and increase the impacts of the program.

In Zambia the PPCR supported the establishment of the Interim National Climate Change
Secretariat under the Ministry of Finance as a dedicated unit overseeing implementation of
key climate change initiatives. With the Ministry of Finance at the helm, Zambia mainstreamed
climate resilience measures into its Sixth National Development Plan. Strong political buy-in for
the PPCR leveraged a tripling of the national budget allocation for PPCR-specific investments
in FY15. National budgetary allocations are slated to increase progressively to set the secretariat
on a path to sustainability once PPCR funding is exhausted, in 2019.

The SREP program is supporting off-grid electrification efforts through the deployment of mini-
grid systems in Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Liberia, Tanzania, and possibly other African countries as
they prepare SREP investment plans. The vastness of many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, cou-
pled with low population densities, makes access to electricity through grid expansion extremely
challenging and expensive. Mini-grid rural electrification schemes are one of the best options for
bringing modern energy services to a large proportion of the population for a long time. Most
SREP-supported mini-grid projects focus on hybridizing existing diesel mini-grids with renew-
able energy, mostly solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies.

The SREP program is also actively engaged in geothermal energy. It is providing $126.5 ­million to
Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania to support 710 MW in new capacity, including the first large-scale
projects in Ethiopia and Tanzania. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is implementing
an advisory project supported by $2.3 million of SREP funds in Tanzania to establish an enabling
environment for the country’s geothermal development that is c      ­onducive  to private ­  sector
                                                                                       ­ eveloping
investment. The drafting and/or revising of geothermal laws is a crucial first step in d
Tanzania’s untapped geothermal potential, which is estimated to exceed 650 MW.

Structure of the Business Plan
This business plan identifies about a dozen priority areas in which the World
Bank and its partners could focus in the coming years to ramp up support to
Africa’s climate agenda. The areas—selected on the basis of country and
regional dialogue and an assessment of opportunities that could generate
results in a relatively short time—are organized in three clusters.
   The first cluster (“strengthening resilience”) includes selected initiatives
aimed at boosting the resilience of the continent’s assets. These initiatives
comprise Africa’s natural capital (landscapes, forests, agricultural land, inland
water bodies, oceans); physical capital (cities and physical assets in coastal
areas); and human and social capital (including improving social protection
for the more vulnerable people against climate shocks and addressing the
­
climate-related drivers of migration, thereby mitigating the effects of climate
shocks on social cohesion).
   The second cluster (“powering resilience”) relates to opportunities for
scaling up low-carbon energy sources in Africa. In addition to helping

                                                 alternative revenue-generating activities can be undertaken, health services
                                                 can be provided more easily, study hours can be extended contributing to
                                                 better education, and so forth.

                                                 decision-making tools for promoting climate-resilient development across
                                                 sectors by strengthening hydro-meteorological systems at the regional and

                                                 investments.

                                                 Resilience
                                                 African countries are considerably more vulnerable to climate variability and
                                                 change than much of rest of the developing world (map 2.1). What are the key
                                                 sources of vulnerability for Africa? What should the priorities be for investing
                                                 in strengthening resilience on the continent?
                                                   One way to set priorities is to consider the effects of climate-related stres-

                                                 and economic systems. Natural capital (including land, forests, landscapes,
                                                 water, and fisheries) is a direct source of income and employment for a large

other types of capital in a sustainable fashion.
   Physical capital includes cities, infrastructure, and other kinds of produced
capital. Climate extremes such as floods, storm surges, and heat waves are
already straining cities, roads, drainage systems, power plants, ports, and
other types of infrastructure. Future climate change will probably require the
rethinking of planning strategies and the raising of building standards to
ensure adequate resilience of the built environment to the harsher climate of
the future.
   Climate change also threatens the ability to build and maintain human ­capital,
through health and education, which is key to development. Rising tempera-
tures and more frequent floods are likely to make African s­ ocieties more vulner-
able to water- and vector-borne diseases. Climate shocks also prevent households
from saving and setting aside the resources needed for their children’s educa-
tion. And increasing evidence suggests that climate shocks—particularly when
combined with a range of other social, ethnic, and religious factors—contribute
to the emergence of conflicts, which leads to the erosion of social and human
capital (through displacement, death, disease, and so forth).
   In most African countries, vulnerability is a multidimensional problem
(figure 2.2). Across the continent, interventions are required to strengthen

Natural Capital
Climate-resilient           Africa’s forests, and the broader landscapes of which they are part, are key sources
landscapes                  of livelihoods for millions of Africans. Climate variability and change, combined with
                            land conversion (which is often fueled by climate change), will affect the productivity
                            of these ecosystems and their ability to sustain livelihoods.
Climate-smart agriculture   Climate variability and change (heat waves, droughts, floods, extreme weather)
                            reduce agricultural productivity, depressing farm incomes and affecting the
                            employment and well-being of 40–60 percent of Africans.
Integrated watershed        Climate change is affecting hydrological cycles, increasing the severity and frequency
management (Niger,          of flood episodes and dry spells. It is making it more difficult to plan and finance
Chad, Zambezi basins)       investments in irrigation, water supply, and energy production interventions.
Ocean economy               Climate variability and change affect key ocean-based sources of livelihood, such
(East Africa)               as fisheries, aquaculture, and tourism.
Physical Capital
Climate resilience of       Coastal areas are estimated to account for 56 percent of West Africa’s GDP.

Africa)                     sustainability of these areas. Erosion is expected to worsen as the sea level rises.
                            Floods caused by severe weather events and poor infrastructure and planning
                            threaten the livelihoods and health of people in coastal cities and rural areas.
Climate-smart cities        Sub-Saharan Africa is the fastest-urbanizing continent in the world, with an average
                            urban population growth rate of 3.4 percent. Poor people in urban areas are
                            particularly vulnerable to climate change, because they often have no other option
                            but to settle in wetlands, floodplains, landfills, garbage dumps, and rocky areas.
                            Climate-friendly urban transport solutions, such as bus rapid transit (BRT), can help
                            improve urban mobility and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Human and Social Capital
Drivers of migration        Increasing evidence indicates that climate change and environmental degradation
                            are threat multipliers—factors that interact with other risk drivers and sources of
                            vulnerability to exacerbate fragility in states and societies and create conditions
                            conducive for conflict and large-scale migration.
Social protection           Limited savings and access to finance inhibit poor households’ ability to cope with
                            and recover from disasters. In response to climate shocks, poor households are
                            often compelled to sell productive assets for immediate liquidity, remove children
                            from school, and take other steps that have lasting and scarring effects on the
                            affected individuals, their households, and society. These actions threaten to undo
                            years of hard-won development gains.

connectivity can create economic opportunities in lagging regions with higher
rates of poverty and inferior access to critical services (education and health
in particular) than urban and economic core areas. Ensuring that the trans-
port network is resilient to climate variability and change, including extreme
events, is important for overall national resilience.
   This plan is a living document that will be updated and expanded in the
coming months to cover other areas not addressed in this version, such as
health and transport, which the Bank is well positioned to support through
sector dialogue and financial/technical assistance.
   The rest of this report identifies the background and development chal-
lenge, the proposed set of activities, the expected outcomes, the climate-­
related benefits, the financing requirements, and key partners for each priority
area. To allow for incremental progress in implementation, the plan includes
two separate time horizons, one for resource mobilization and another for the
generation of results (table 2.2). The cut-off dates for each phase were selected
to line up with the cycles of replenishment of the International Development
Association (IDA).

Strengthening the Resilience
of Africa’s Assets
To reduce the risk posed to their development prospects by climate variability
and change, African countries need to strengthen the resilience of their natu-
ral, physical, and human capital. Natural capital can be protected by making
farmland, landscapes, watersheds, and oceans more resilient. Physical capital
can be preserved by adopting smart climate policies for cities and coastal
areas, which are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Human capital can
be protected by boosting social protection and addressing the drivers of
migration. This part of the business plan provides detailed proposals in each
of these areas.

                  Agriculture
                  The World Bank will support climate-smart agriculture (CSA) in Sub-Saharan
                  Africa by advocating for the main regional CSA initiatives, fostering adoption
                  of improved CSA policies, and financing national and regional investment
                  programs to scale up adoption of CSA technologies and management options
                  (table 3.1). Within the context of the Comprehensive African Agricultural
                  Development Program, the World Bank is also developing an investment
                  facility that will support countries in the preparation of proposals on CSA as
                  well as other topics prioritized in the 2014 Malabo Declaration on Accelerating
                  Agricultural Growth and Transformation. The so-called Malabo facility may
                  be used to support investments not only through the World Bank but also

Sectoral Background and Development
Challenges
Agriculture is a major economic driver in Africa and key to poverty allevia-
tion and food security: Growth in the sector reduces poverty by about three
times as much as growth in other sectors. Agriculture typically represents
30–40 percent of GDP in Africa and employs up to 65 percent of the labor
force, providing livelihoods for millions of smallholders and their families.
   Africa is home to more than 225 million undernourished people. It also
has the world’s highest rate of stunting (40 percent) (FAO 2014). Farm fami-
lies in Africa and other parts of the world are already overrepresented
among the poor. Climate change will strongly reduce their chances of ­escaping
poverty.

22	                     Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
                  Climate variability is already reducing productivity. Crop productivity
               simulations show that cereal yields between 1981 and 2002 would have been
               ­
               2–3 percent higher in the absence of climate shocks—an estimated produc-
               tion loss of 40 million tons of grain a year (Lobell and Field 2007). Without
               actions to improve the resilience of agriculture, a rise in average temperatures
               of 2°C by the middle of the century might reduce yields by up to 20 percent
               (Schlenker and Lobell 2010). Additional temperature increases would cause
               exponentially more harm. More irregular rainfall amplifies temperature risks;
               the consequent droughts may trigger famines.
                  Agriculture and agriculture-driven land use produce significant green-
               house gas emissions (24 percent of the global total [IPCC 2014]), but they can
               also become a part of the solution. CSA practices such as agro-forestry and
               improved livestock and pasture management can reduce emissions and
               remove carbon out of the atmosphere.
                  African agriculture must strive to attain a triple win: dramatically increas-
               ing productivity, enhancing the resilience of farming systems, and achieving
               lower emissions. CSA can deliver on all three goals (Box 3.1).
                  Commensurate measures to preserve and increase transportation connec-
               tivity for agricultural communities will have a reinforcing effect on agricul-
               tural resilience by making it easier for increased harvests to find their way to
               markets, enabling the efficient distribution of agricultural inputs, and allow-
               ing for the efficient movement of food products to regions experiencing poor
               harvests as a result of climate change.




Box 3.1  Increasing African Food Security While Reducing Greenhouse
Gas Emissions through Climate-Smart Agriculture
African agricultural and livestock systems are extremely vulnerable to climate change: Drought,
heat, extreme events, changes in water availability, disease, and pest infestations, to name but a
few of the many complex impacts, reduce yields and increase the rate of animal deaths.

Falling yields come at a time when population growth and increasing incomes will require
African agricultural systems to almost triple overall production. Doing so in a business as usual
scenario would triple agriculture and land use–related emissions, catapulting Africa to near
the top of international agricultural emission contributors and threatening achievement of the
2°C goal. CSA investment plans, projects, and policies can help address these challenges and
increase production, enhance resilience, and reduce emissions. Indeed, with the help of low-
carbon agricultural production systems, Africa could triple food production while controlling
emissions.

The widespread use of high-efficiency, low-energy irrigation systems could reduce drought stress,
enabling higher production and lower losses as a result of natural disasters and improving energy
efficiency per kilogram of food. Scaling up agro-forestry would dramatically reduce fertilizer use

                                                                               box continues next page

  and capture carbon in trees and soils. More efficient livestock systems would increase protein
  availability while reducing emissions per kilogram of meat or dairy produced. Conservation agri-
  culture techniques would protect soils from wind and water erosion. Weather information and
  early warning systems would enable farmers to take better decisions, reducing risk and protecting
  yields in uncertain climate and weather conditions.

  All CSA measures share two important features. First, they reduce pressure for land use change
  by increasing yields per hectare. Integrated landscape approaches help capture these benefits in
  forests and savannahs. Second, they improve the efficiency of agricultural inputs (fertilizer, water,
  feed conversion), thereby reducing emission intensity.




Initiatives to Address the Challenges and
Enhance Resilience
At the 2014 Malabo Summit, convened by the African Union within the
context of the renewal of the Comprehensive African Agricultural
Development Program (CAADP), African heads of state committed to
accelerating agricultural growth and enhancing the resilience of livelihoods
and production systems by 2025. They endorsed Vision 25 × 25, which
aims to have 25 million farmers in Africa using CSA practices by 2025.
   The Africa Climate-Smart Agriculture Alliance aims to reach 6 million
farming families with CSA by 2022.1 Its initial focus is in Ethiopia, Kenya,
Malawi, Niger, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zambia.
   The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the
East African Community (EAC), and the Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC) are jointly implementing the Initiative for Climate
Smart Agriculture in Eastern and Southern Africa, funded by the European
Commission, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the U.K.
Department for International Development (DFID). The initiative aims to
establish evidence-based policies on CSA that may attract adaptation and
mitigation finance to the region.
   Under the CAADP umbrella and with the support of the German Agency
for International Cooperation (GIZ), the New Partnership for Africa’s
Development (NEPAD) is implementing a program on adaptation of agricul-
ture to climate change that supports selected regional economic communities
and African Union member states in implementing climate change adapta-
tion strategies.
   The Food, Agriculture and Natural Resources Policy Analysis Network
(FANRPAN) operates a series of CSA initiatives in eastern and southern
Africa focused on evidence-based policy making, strengthened institutional
capacity, and cross-country watershed management.

24	                   Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
    Many initiatives on CSA are thus underway. This business plan will help
these efforts source funding and explore their synergies.
    In June 2015, in Bamako, a West African CSA alliance was launched and a
framework for the integration of CSA into regional agriculture policy was
discussed during a high-level forum hosted by the West African Economic
and Monetary Union (ECOWAS) and the Permanent Interstate Committee
for drought control in the Sahel (CILSS).
    World Bank CSA lending operations in Africa include two major CSA proj-
ects under preparation in Niger and Kenya. Discussions are ongoing in many
other countries.
    The Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)
and the Africa Climate-Smart Agriculture Alliance have developed a frame-
work document that guides investment on CSA for Africa.2 It outlines
­
country-led action to support and enhance existing country CSA programs.
 The document can guide countries seeking to become more climate smart by
 developing national CSA action plans. As part of the Africa Climate Resilient
 Investment facility described later in this business plan, countries would also
 receive assistance through a CSA center of excellence, supported by the World
 Bank and hosted by the African Union and NEPAD.
    CSA country readiness assessments and investments plans based on this
 framework will be developed in three pilot countries. They could be show-
 cased at COP21 to demonstrate best practice and form the basis of broader
 dialogue with partners and donors. In addition, two World Bank–assisted
 country investment operations will be prepared and presented to deliver a
 proof of concept of the framework approach.
    The Malabo facility will be established to support the next step of
 CAADP financial intermediation. It will be operational by December 2016.
 The World Bank, the African Development Bank, the International Fund
 for  Agricultural Development (IFAD), the German Federal Ministry for
 Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), DFID, NORAD, USAID,
 Agence Française de Développement (AFD), and other multilateral and
­bilateral sources will be invited to provide funding in order to enhance invest-
 ments in sustainable agricultural development.
    With the assistance of the World Bank, a CSA center of excellence would be
 established at the African Union in Addis Ababa or at NEPAD in Pretoria, to
 support the Malabo facility and the Africa Climate Resilient Investment
 Facility. The center would offer technical assistance (through the Food and
 Agriculture Organization [FAO], Climate Change, Agriculture and Food
 Security [CCAFS], and other centers of the CGIAR) as requested by ­countries.
 It would ensure regional coordination, shared learning among participating
 countries, and preparation of tailored country ­ support packages.
    The center would provide assistance in the following areas:
••   assessing CSA country readiness by taking stock of ongoing CSA
     activities
••   determining CSA preparedness, policy needs, investment gaps, and
     human capacity constraints

Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development 	                   25
••     developing integrated national CSA strategies and investment plans, with
       building blocks and clear roadmaps for implementation
••     translating CSA strategies into transformational action on the ground
       and engaging with the private sector and other partners
••     promoting best-practice learning and results tracking systems to maxi-
       mize lessons learned.


Expected Outcomes
With the center of excellence in place, CSA country readiness assessments and
investments plans would rapidly multiply across Africa. Within 12 months of
COP21, 10 readiness assessments and investment plans would be developed;
within 24 months the number would increase to 30. A rapid scale-up of CSA–
related lending in Africa would lead to five investment ­  operations within
12 months of COP21, 15 within 24 months, and 30 within 36 months.


Financing Plan
Table 3.2 describes the financing plan.



Key Partners
The World Bank will deploy comprehensive resources, including IDA/IBRD
and trust funds, to support the objectives outlined above. Given the growing
role of the private sector in agricultural development, the Bank will team up
with other branches of the World Bank Group, including IFC and MIGA.

                  Creating Climate-Resilient
                  Landscapes
                  The World Bank advocates for poverty alleviation, shared prosperity, and
                  sustainability to move toward a climate-resilient, low-carbon, and sustainable
                  ­
                  development path. Sustainable management of natural resources for resilient
                  landscapes is at the heart of achieving these objectives. The Bank’s work on
                  building the resilience of African landscapes is based on promoting the use of
                  an integrated landscape management approach that ­      recognizes the impor-
                  tance of moving beyond single-sector interventions in order to take into
                  account the resilience of both ecosystems and livelihoods.

                  4.1 Forested Landscapes
                  The World Bank will support the climate and forest agenda in Africa through
                  a range of instruments that will help slow deforestation, prevent forest-related
                  carbon emissions, and promote sustainable use of forests for improved liveli-
                  hoods and enhanced resilience to climate change (table 4.1).



                  Sectoral Background and Development
                  Challenges
                  Africa’s forests, landscapes, and ecosystems contribute to poverty alleviation,
                  shared prosperity, and inclusive green growth by providing goods and ­services
                  that sustain the livelihoods of the rural poor and contribute raw materials
                  to other economic sectors.1 Forests are a critical resource for Africa’s poor:
                  The poorest fifth of the population earns more than 30 percent of its income
                  from forest and environmental resources—more than the share generated
                  by agriculture.
                     Africa’s forests are under extreme pressure because of demands for food,
                  fuel, and fiber. Demand for new land, timber, fuel wood, charcoal, bush meat,
                  and medicinal plants, coupled with weak governance and inadequate enabling
                  conditions, poor land use management and tenure security, and illegal activ-
                  ity, contribute to forest loss and degradation. Illegal use of forests, unclear
                  tenure rights, disenfranchised stakeholders, and unskilled managers pose
                  ­
                  significant challenges to managing forest resources well.
                     Climate change poses a key challenge for Africa’s forests and the people who
                  depend on them. Forest degradation and land conversion create greenhouse
                  gases. Climate change can result in droughts and stresses on fragile ecosys-
                  tems, increasing the risk of forest dieback, forest fires, and pest infestations.

  Protecting forests can contribute to adaptation and resilience to climate
change, because forests protect water supplies and ecosystem services and
provide an important safety net for the poorest households.
  Programs for reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation
(REDD+) can potentially yield financing for development and job creation
in poor communities. REDD+ efforts have catalyzed a vibrant and inclusive
dialogue on planning, strategy, opportunities, and tradeoffs on land and for-
­
est issues with only small investment. They are laying the groundwork for
building consensus on the role of forests, the ways in which they can contrib-
ute to sustained economic growth, and the need to improve land use planning
and recognition of rights, which could generate more investment in the sector
in the future.



Initiatives to Address the Challenges and
Enhance Resilience
The Bank’s work on forests in Africa and beyond rests on the following tenets:
••    Enhanced and sustained engagement is necessary to move toward sus-
      tainable management of forests as an essential contributor to economic
      development and poverty alleviation.
••    Improved management and conservation of forests will require efforts
      outside the sector to address drivers of deforestation, trade-offs, and
      competing incentives for land use and conversion.

32	                    Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
••   Countries need an enabling environment in which farmers and small-
     holders can invest in trees and landscapes as part of fuelwood provision,
     rural enterprises, and forest-based ecotourism.
••   Deforestation, landscape degradation, and soil erosion impose increas-
     ingly heavy economic costs that undermine efforts to improve agricul-
     tural productivity and protect the watersheds that contribute to needed
     hydropower development.
Adaptation to and mitigation of climate change and conservation of biodi-
versity provide useful entry points for policy dialogue and sources of finance
that can help move this agenda forward.
  The Bank is helping client countries access climate finance opportunities
that can act as incentives to shift toward more sustainable practices. It has
invested in improving forest sector planning, governance, and consultation to
put in place REDD+ programs in 14 countries. Forest Investment Programs
(FIPs) have been complemented by measures to enhance the capacity of
indigenous people and local communities to participate in REDD+ through
the FIP Dedicated Grant Mechanism for Indigenous People and Local
Communities. The Bank is continuing to build on the TerrAfrica program,
which has created a platform for forging a common vision to addressing
Africa’s most daunting land management issues.
  In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo, Ethiopia,
Ghana, Liberia, and Mozambique, the Bank is helping implement an inte-
grated portfolio of well-funded engagements on forests, landscapes, and
biodiversity. Most of these countries have large tracts of forest and recognize
­
the importance of improving forest management as part of spurring ­   economic
development and mitigating the effects of climate change. The Bank is sup-
porting these countries’ efforts to improve governance systems, address driv-
ers of deforestation, and engage communities in improving practices with
better benefit sharing. These endeavors are putting clients in a position to
access larger sources of financing through payments for performance (under
the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility Carbon Fund, the BioCarbon Fund,
and bilateral arrangements). Success in addressing deforestation issues and
accessing climate finance is also sending a signal to other development ­partners
and the private sector, which helps mobilize or leverage other forms of financ-
ing that can scale up good practices and sustain sectoral transformation.
  Investment programs such as the FIP are increasing the number of pro-
grams piloting forest investments. FIP has committed resources to three new
country programs (in the Republic of Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, and Mozambique)
and has provided Cameroon, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zambia with financial
resources to develop forest related investment plans.
  New streams of funding are being made available. One is the Central
African Forest Initiative (CAFI), being created to increase investments in the
Congo Basin. It is expected to substantially reduce greenhouse gases from
deforestation and forest degradation, improve local livelihoods, enhance
the  functioning of ecosystems, and increase access to performance-based
payments to reinvest in sustainable forest landscapes.

Expected Outcomes
The expected outcomes are conservative estimates based on results from
country emissions reductions programs by 2025. Investments in forests and
REDD+ will help countries move from a condition of degraded landscapes
with low productivity and high incidences of poverty to improved landscapes
with better productivity, sustainable livelihoods, and more equitable sharing
of benefits. These investments, coupled with improved governance and inclu-
sive participation, are expected to lead to (a) improved economic outcomes
from productivity and livelihood opportunities for local communities;
(b)  enhanced social benefits and community empowerment (from institu-
tional support, communications, capacities; (c) more sustainable forest and
land stewardship (from better policies, incentives, and practices); and
(d) greater forest and agricultural biodiversity, soil conservation, habitat con-
nectivity, and ecosystem services. Ecosystem s     ­ervices provide benefits to
downstream users and other sectors of the economy. Such services include
water conservation, flood prevention, run-off and siltation control, protec-
tion of fisheries, and conservation of biodiversity.
   Forest- and climate-related investments can also improve the livelihoods of
forest-dependent people and help preserve cultures and traditions. Forest
investments also generally help build the capacity of government agencies
responsible for forest and natural resource management as well as the com-
munities that use and depend on these resources.



Climate-Related Benefits
Forest- and climate-related investments improve the livelihoods and increase
the resilience of rural communities in targeted regions who manage agricul-
tural and forestry landscapes for their livelihoods. Smallholder farmers,
including women, can gain access to new skills, technologies, and markets
that contribute to their ability to adapt to change and deal with economic
shocks. Enterprises of all sizes can benefit from clearer policies and regulatory
processes, more productive landscapes, and improved management practices
among their suppliers.
   Investments also contribute directly to the mitigation agenda by address-
ing drivers of deforestation and improving land and forest management and
stewardship, which allows greater carbon storage in the natural environment.
Many programs provide explicit support and incentives for reducing emis-
sions by offering results-based payments linked to verified performance at
the field level.

    The African Resilient Landscape
4.2 
    Initiative
The World Bank will support the African Resilient Landscape Initiative
(ARLI), which will use a landscape approach to integrate multiple sectoral ini-
tiatives, facilitating linkages and coordination among them. The initiative will
mobilize financial and technical resources from multiple sources to help design
and implement country- and region-specific integrated landscape-level strate-
gies. Through ARLI, the Bank will support resilient landscapes in the Sahel,
the Horn of Africa, and East Africa by combining geographical and socioeco-
nomic approaches to managing land, water, and forest resources in support of
food security and inclusive green growth (table 4.3). Connecting various type
of land uses (including agriculture, woodlands, agro-silvo-­    pastoral lands,
croplands, and irrigated agricultural lands) promotes productivity, resilience,
carbon sequestration, biodiversity, water regulation and quality, national secu-
rity, and regional stability.



Sectoral Background and Development
Challenges
The multidimensional challenges of poverty, population growth, land degra-
dation, deforestation, unsustainable watershed management, climate variabil-
ity, unsustainable land use, migration, and fragility have undermined
resilience to natural and economic shocks. These challenges require inte-
grated solutions across borders. Creating resilient landscapes that strengthen
the integrity of ecosystems to provide the full range of services for productive
sectors and livelihoods, including migrant and fragile communities, requires
collaborative action at scale. It also requires coordination of planning and

                      The World Bank is increasingly supporting its country clients in their efforts
                   to implement a more integrated landscape approach to managing competing
                   demands for land, water, and other natural resources. The landscape approach
                   is based on recognition of the complex interlinkages among the different com-
                   ponents of natural capital, an insight of great importance to the communities
                   that live in a reality in which all is connected (that is, in the landscape).



                   Initiatives to Address the Challenges and
                   Enhance Resilience
                   The following initiatives are under way:
                   ••   The Burundi Sustainable Coffee Landscape Project is piloting sustainable
                        land and water management practices.
                   ••   The Regional Pastoral Livelihoods Resilience Project seeks to enhance the
                        resilience of pastoral and agro-pastoral communities in cross-border
                        drought-prone areas of Kenya and Uganda and to improve government
                        capacity to respond to a crisis or emergency.
                   ••   The Regional Sahel Pastoralism Support Project (PRAPS) seeks to
                        increase access to essential productive assets, services, and markets for

      pastoralists and agro-pastoralists in selected transborder areas and along
      transhumance axes in six Sahel countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali,
      Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal) and to strengthen country capacities to
      respond to pastoral crises and emergencies.
••    The Rwanda Landscape Approach to Forest Restoration and Conservation
      Project is demonstrating landscape management for enhanced environ-
      mental services and climate resilience in one priority landscape.
••    The Sahel and West Africa Program (SAWAP), in support of the Great
      Green Wall Initiative, seeks to expand sustainable land and water man-
      agement in targeted landscapes and climate vulnerable areas in Benin,
      Burkina Faso, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria,
      Senegal, Sudan, and Togo.
Building on the TerrAfrica platform, the Africa Union/NEPAD is establishing
a broad-based African Resilient Landscapes Initiative (ARLI).2 ARLI, which
will be launched at COP21, will assist developing countries in (a) ­  promoting
the inclusive and sustainable use and management of natural resources, cen-
tered on people’s social, economic, and environmental welfare and resilience;
(b) scaling up and leveraging sectoral interventions, so that the whole is greater
than the sum of individual interventions in terms of ­  ecological and economic
gains; and (c) ensuring the integrity, restoration, and sustainable management
of landscapes across the region. It envisions bringing together elements of
sustainable forestry management practices, sustainable farming practices
­
(climate-smart agriculture), and pastoralism within African landscapes.
­
   ARLI will commit to bringing 100 million hectares of degraded and defor-
ested land under restoration in Africa by 2030. Doing so would improve soil
fertility and food security, increase access to clean water, combat desertifica-
tion, increase biodiversity and habitat, create green jobs, bolster economic
growth and livelihood diversification, and increase the capacity for climate
change resilience and adaptation. ARLI will also support implementation of
the African Landscapes Action Plan.
   ARLI’s goal will be achieved through implementation of multiple cross-­
sectoral investments, including the following programs:
••    Sustainable Landscape Management (Ghana)
••    Sustainable Agricultural Land Program (Madagascar)
••    Agriculture and Natural Resources Landscape Management
      (Mozambique)
••    Resilient Natural Resource Management for Growth (Tanzania)
••    Resilient Landscapes for Development Program (Ethiopia, Kenya,
      Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda, and a regional project])

                  Promoting Integrated
                  Watershed Management
                  The World Bank is actively engaged in integrated management of Africa’s
                  watersheds, through policy dialogue, technical assistance and financial sup-
                  port, with a particular emphasis on the management of trans-boundaries
                  water resources, though vehicles such as the Cooperation in International
                  Waters in Africa (CIWA) program. This component of the business plan
                  intends to scale up support to four selected basins (the Niger, Lake Chad,
                  Zambezi, and Victoria basins), with the goal of strengthening the ability of
                  riparian countries in these basins to manage their water resources for sustain-
                  able development in a climate-resilient way.

5.1  Niger River Basin
The World Bank will support climate-resilient development in the Niger River
Basin through the preparation of a Climate Resilience Investment Plan (CRIP)
and the cofinancing of its implementation (table 5.1).



Sectoral Background and Development
Challenges
Nine countries in West and Central Africa—Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon,
Chad, Ivory Coast, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Nigeria—share the Niger River
Basin. Its surface area, which spans nearly 1.5 million square kilometers,
is marked by a mosaic of climates, ecosystems, human settlements, and agri-
cultural production systems. The population in the basin is highly vulnerable.
Seven of the 10 basin countries are among the 20 poorest countries in the
world, and 4 are landlocked. Most of the countries in the Niger Basin have
predominantly rural populations that rely on rain-fed agriculture, pastoral-
ism, and other natural resource–based livelihoods. Food security and social
well-being depend mostly on unpredictable and extreme rainfall patterns,
particularly in the Sahel part of the basin.
   Climate change is exacerbating these challenges. The Niger Basin is
already experiencing variability of extreme precipitation and a long-term
trend of increasing aridity and decreasing precipitation. There is consider-
able uncertainty about the implications of climate change for the hydrolog-
ical cycles in the basin (as in much of West Africa), with some projections
suggesting drying conditions and others pointing to wetter ones. This
uncertainty underscores the importance of strengthening the capacity
of  institutions in the Niger Basin to plan water resources investments

                   Initiatives to Address the Challenges and
                   Enhance Resilience
                   Between 2002 and 2008, the Niger Basin Authority (NBA) and its member
                   states undertook a Shared Vision process for the sustainable development
                   of the region. Major outcomes included the Niger Basin Water Charter
                   (approved in 2008) and a Sustainable Development Action Plan (SDAP)
                   (approved in 2007). The SDAP calls for the development of socioeco-
                   nomic infrastructures, the preservation of ecosystems in the basin, capacity
                   building and stakeholder participation, and an $8.2 billion investment
                   program.
                     Several donors—including AFD, AfDB, GIZ, and the World Bank—­
                   support the NBA and its member states. The World Bank has provided finan-
                   cial support of $451.5 million in lending to countries in the basin through
                   the Niger Basin Water Resources Development and Sustainable Ecosystems
                   Management Program ($444 million) and the Niger River Basin Management
                   Project ($7.5 million, under the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa
                   Fund). It is preparing a third operation, the Economic and  Environmental
                   Rehabilitation of the Niger River in Mali project ($55 million).
                     Building on existing and well-established support for cooperative water and
                   natural resources management and development in the basin, the World Bank,

                   Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development 	                                    43
in collaboration with a variety of partners, will support climate-­   resilient
development in the basin through a combination of infrastructure develop-
ment and institutional strengthening. Specific support will be guided by the
CRIP, which is under preparation, under the leadership of the NBA, with the
full involvement of the riparian countries. The plan, as adopted by the ripar-
ian countries, will be presented at the COP21 meeting, along with initial
information on funding pledges.



Expected Outcomes
The CRIP will achieve the following outcomes:
••    Improve information to support water management and development
      decisions by riparian countries, so that they can better predict and h
                                                                           ­ arness
      available water resources in view of increased variability and changing
      rainfall patterns.
••    Identify institutional needs for information sharing, increase the sustain-
      ability of water-storage infrastructure, mitigate the impacts of climate
      variability, generate low-carbon energy, and ensure results and impacts at
      the grassroots level.
••    Develop multipurpose infrastructure for energy, irrigation, transport,
      and minimum flows.
••    Develop run-of-river dams to provide low-carbon energy sources.
••    Optimize water storage, in order to improve redistribution and maintain
      low flows.
••    Equip rural poor with small-scale storage options to help withstand water
      shocks.
••    Undertake collective action for erosion control, pollution abatement,
      fisheries management, and ecosystem conservation.
••    Scale up the use of sustainable land management and affordable irriga-
      tion solutions to enhance the resilience of millions of people.



Climate-Related Benefits
The main aims of the CRIP are to strengthen the overall resilience of the basin
population (through job creation, for example) and to help reduce the climate
vulnerability of people and ecosystems to water stress conditions; flooding;
deterioration of water quality; degradation of soil, grazing land, and ecosys-
tems; and rising sea level.



Financing Plan
The funding envelope of the CRIP is estimated at $3.1 billion, about
$600 million of which has been identified. A rough estimate of investment
preparation financing is $50 million. IDA resources can provide the initial

                  5.2  Lake Chad Basin
                  The World Bank will support climate-resilient development in the Lake
                  Chad Basin through technical work, investment financing, policy dialogue,
                  and resource mobilization. These efforts will be grounded in existing docu-
                  ments, such as the Water Charter and the Five-Year Investment Program,
                  which will be updated, scaled up, and operationalized (table 5.3).



                  Sectoral Background and Development
                  Challenges
                  Lake Chad is a large body of water in the Sahel region of Africa, at the ­southern
                  fringe of the Sahara Desert. It is a very complex hydrosystem from an ecolog-
                  ical, social, and political standpoint. Its active hydrological basin spreads over
                  815,000 square kilometers. Chad, Niger, Nigeria, and Cameroon are the lake’s
                  riparian states. The basin is home to about 50 million people, many of them
                  among the poorest in the world.
                     Over the past 50 years, the Lake Chad area has experienced significant
                  climate, hydrological, ecological, and social changes. The lake’s surface,
                  ­
                  including its marshlands, shrunk significantly, from an average of about
                  20,000 square kilometers in the 1960s to about 8,000 square kilometers today.
                  As a result, in the early 1970s, the lake transitioned from its original state
                  characterized by one body of open water, to a very different one, dominated
                  by marshlands and of much smaller size.
                     Throughout the last century, and particularly since the 1970s, fishers,
                  farmers, and herders from different ethnic groups migrated to the lake’s
                  shores to exploit its rich natural resources and to flee droughts, famine, and

conflicts in other parts of the region. Since the 1980s, armed criminal
groups, and more recently, Islamic extremists, have taken refuge around
the lake.
   These changes have created both opportunities and threats. On the positive
side, thanks to migrants’ know-how and the fertile land freed up by the
lake’s shrinkage, the lake area has been able to provide livelihoods to about
2 million settlers around its shore. It has also become a net exporter of food,
contributing to the food security of about 15 million people in the lake’s hin-
terlands, including two growing regional metropoles (N’djamena, Chad and
Maiduguri, Nigeria).
   On the negative side, navigability has been reduced, insecurity is hamper-
ing development efforts, and the lake is fragile and vulnerable to deteriora-
tion. Access to the lake’s natural resources is subject to increasing disputes.
Contamination from pesticides is starting to affect fisheries and livestock
production. The risk of hydrocarbon contamination is rising as oil
exploitation in the region is increasing. The sustainability of current produc-
tion systems is not guaranteed, and several Ramsar protected wetlands may
be at risk.
   Despite its socioeconomic and ecological significance and very weak
­
development indicators, the Lake Chad area has attracted relatively little
investment from its riparian states or donors. In the face of the additional
pressure that climate change exerts on the region’s fragile natural resources,
there is an urgent need to identify sustainable management options that will
meet the development needs of the local population. Key issues to address
include the following:
••    Is there scope for promoting further transformation of the lake for
      productive activities, or would doing so undermine the lake’s ecosystem
      ­
      services and therefore the livelihoods that depend on them?

48	                      Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
••   Does water contamination from pesticides and oil exploitation pose a
     potential threat to the lake?
••   Is there scope for expanding irrigation, given the modification of the
     hydrological cycle that climate change will bring about?
••   If drying trends continue, should interbasin transfer from the Congo
     Basin be considered?
••   How much groundwater can be safely used?
The socioeconomic and ecological importance of the lake and the challenges
it faces call for policy and investment action at the regional and national levels
as well as sustained military action to reestablish peace. The Lake Chad Basin
Commission (created in 1964 to sustainably and equitably manage the basin’s
water resources, preserve its ecosystems, and promote regional integration);
the basin states; and donors have key roles to play.



Initiatives to Address the Challenges and
Enhance Resilience
In 2012 the Lake Chad Basin Commission developed a water charter
that  refines and complements the principles of and responsibilities for the
integrated, equitable, and shared management of water and other natural
resources, in order to achieve the sustainable development of the Lake Chad
Basin. Since then all member states except the Central African Republic and
Nigeria have ratified the charter, but most of its principles still need to be
made operational.
   The commission also developed a five-year investment program for
2013–17. Its objective is to reduce poverty and improve the living conditions
­
of the people in the basin by improving natural resource management
and  associated production systems. The plan calls for spending of about
$904  million. It was presented at a donors’ roundtable on April 4–5, 2014,
in Bologna, Italy, but most of its activities remain unfunded.
   The reengagement of the World Bank in support of Lake Chad develop-
ment was recently approved in the form of a technical assistance, with finan-
cial support from the Cooperation for International Waters in Africa (CIWA)
catalytic funds. This support will assist riparian countries and the Lake Chad
Basin Commission in better understanding the future of the lake and defining
a framework for future engagement based on broad consensus. This ongoing
technical assistance is intended to provide the strategic foundation for a long-
term engagement in the Lake Chad Basin and to guide the preparation of a
long-term, multiyear, multicountry program.
   Technical assistance includes two components. The first involves strength-
ening information/knowledge of and building consensus over the challenges
facing Lake Chad and their underlying causes (providing answers to some of
the questions raised above). The second supports the Lake Chad Basin
Commission and its member states in crafting a shared vision for the lake’s
development based on the assessment developed in phase 1, as well as in

Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development 	                    49
preparing a climate resilience action plan to achieve the vision. It is expected
that the following activities will be well advanced, or completed, by the COP21
meeting:
••    a donor mapping, as a first step toward identifying the Bank’s value added
      in reengaging and drawing lessons from donors’ projects or programs
      under implementation
••    a framework document for the Lake Chad Climate Resilience Action
      Plan (Chad-Res), including an assessment of the lake’s current situation,
      a long-term development vision for the lake, and priority actions to reach
      that vision
••    consultations around the Chad-Res Framework document, to increase
      country buy-in and support from the international donor community
      and coordinate and finance the investments proposed
••    endorsement of the Chad-Res Framework document by the commission’s
      ministerial council, before its presentation at COP21.


Expected Outcomes
The following outcomes are expected within three years of the COP21:
••    development and adoption of the Operational Action Plan for Climate
      Resilience in Lake Chad, which will include the findings of technical
      work on improved understanding of the lake’s hydro-system, ecosystems,
      and productions systems and reflect the consensus built on the challenges
      facing the lake, their underlying causes, and the actions necessary to
      address them
••    mobilization of resources by development partners to fund the Climate
      Resilience Action Plan
••    implementation of the Climate Resilience Action Plan in two phases (the
      first through 2020, the second through 2025), to enhance the resilience of
      Lake Chad populations, production systems, and ecosystems to climate
      change and other stressors and improve the living conditions of the peo-
      ple living on the shores of Lake Chad.


Climate-Related Benefits
The proposed actions are expected to increase the resilience of the people
and ecosystems around the lake to climate change and other stressors and to
maintain or even increase the lake’s contribution to food security in its hinter-
lands. More sustainable fishing, agriculture, and cattle-raising practices will
make the lake’s population less vulnerable to drought or other hazards.

5.3  Zambezi River Basin
The World Bank will support climate-resilient development in the Zambezi
River Basin through technical work, investment financing, policy dialogue,
and resource mobilization (table 5.5). This support will be integrated as part
of the Zambezi River Basin Program, which is financed through a series of
projects under the multidonor trust fund for Cooperation in International
Waters in Africa (CIWA) and the World Bank.



Sectoral Background and Development
Challenges
The Zambezi River Basin is one of the most diverse and valuable natural
resources in Africa. Its waters are critical to sustainable economic growth and
poverty reduction in the region. In addition to meeting the basic needs of
more than 30 million people and sustaining a rich and diverse natural envi-
ronment, the river plays a central role in the economies of the eight riparian
countries (Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania,
Zambia, and Zimbabwe). It provides important environmental goods and
services to the region and is essential to regional food security and hydro-
power production.
   The river and its tributaries are subject to strong seasonal variation in the
hydrological regime. The cycle of floods and droughts has devastating effects
on the people and economies of the region, especially the poorest members of
the population.
   The basin is likely to be severely affected by climate change, as a result of the
effects of higher temperatures and decreased rainfall on evaporation and run-
off, according to most of the models vetted by the IPCC (2013). In other parts

                  of Africa, great uncertainty persists about the pattern of future changes in
                  precipitation. In contrast, the vast majority of models for the Zambezi River
                  Basin project very significant drying trends, with declines in runoff of
                  40 ­percent or more by midcentury.
                     Sustained economic growth of more than 6 percent a year in many of the
                  riparian states is providing new opportunities and increasing development
                  pressure on the resources of the basin. The combined GDP of the Zambezi
                  River Basin riparian states is estimated at more than $100 billion. Despite
                  this increasing prosperity, poverty is persistent across the basin, and coeffi-
                  cients of inequality in some of the riparian states are among the highest in
                  the world.
                     The Multi-Sector Investment Opportunity Analysis identified more than
                  $16 billion in investments at the prefeasibility or feasibility stage of prepara-
                  tion. Reflecting the dual nature of the regional economy, new investments in
                  large infrastructure coexist alongside a parallel, subsistence economy that is
                  reliant on environmental services provided by the river.



                  Initiatives to Address the Challenges and
                  Enhance Resilience
                  The World Bank is part of a multidonor initiative to support climate-resilient
                  cooperative development in the Zambezi River Basin. The program is guided
                  by an Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) Strategy for the

                  Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development 	                               53
Zambezi River Basin (ZAMSTRAT), which provides a guiding vision, along
with prioritized activities and projects. The initial phase of support to the
Zambezi River Basin Committee (ZAMCOM) focuses on strengthening four
key areas:
••    regional cooperation and integration, by supporting ZAMCOM’s legal
      establishment, financial sustainability, delivery of key functions, and
      establishment of effective partnerships with key institutions throughout
      the basin
••    water resources management, by supporting the public availability of
      basin-wide data and information, analytical tools for planning for and
      managing extreme events, and harmonized national transboundary
      legislation
••    water resources development, by supporting a common investment plan-
      ning framework and advancing investment opportunities with regional
      benefits
••    stakeholder engagement and coordination, by establishing partnerships
      and effective strategic communications.
The first phase of the program involves assisting in the development of a pipe-
line of projects and investments that are expected to be implemented in
accordance with the strategic plan for the basin being developed with support
from CIWA. One investment in the pipeline is the Batoka Gorge hydroelec-
tric scheme, envisaged as a 2,400 MW run-of-river plant upstream of the
Kariba Dam. The project is being developed by the Zambezi River Authority,
an entity run jointly by Zambia and Zimbabwe.



Expected Outcomes
The potential outcomes envisaged under the program of support over the
next 10–15 years are substantial and include the following:
••    Poverty will be reduced throughout the basin, as a result of expanded
      development, and sustainable water resources management.
••    Energy security will be enhanced, through $10.7 billion worth of hydro-
      power investments that yield an additional 35,300 GWh a year of firm
      energy and an additional 60,000 GWh a year of average energy.
••    Agricultural production will increase, enhancing regional food security,
      through an additional 343,000 hectares increasing the amount of irriga-
      tion to 775,000 hectares a year (85 percent located in Malawi, Zambia,
      and Zimbabwe).
••    Employment will Increase, particularly in the agricultural sector, with
      more than 500,000 jobs created.
••    Economic resilience will increase and growth benefits will be sustained,
      through reduced exposure to floods (avoiding average losses on the
      order of more than $1 billion a year) and adaptive measures to climate
      change.

••   Regional transport costs and travel times will be reduced, through invest-
     ments in bridges and navigation.
••   Water supplies will be secured to meet urban and industrial demand
     (more than 1,000 million cubic meters of water a year is proposed to be
     delivered to Botswana, Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe).
••   Environmental restoration of the Zambezi Delta and improved fisheries
     production will be achieved, through the systematic introduction of
     basin-wide environmental flows in the delta.
••   The contributions of tourism and mining to GDP will increase, through
     integrated, sustainable development.
••   Fisheries production will be enhanced, through improved management
     of water resources.
In the lead-up to COP21 (or shortly thereafter), the design framework for the
Zambezi Water Information Management System and a consultative frame-
work for development of the strategic plan for the Zambezi River Basin will
be developed.
  Within three years of COP21, it is expected that the following outcomes
will have been achieved:
••   The Zambezi Water Information Management System will be operational,
     allowing the exchange of data among the eight riparian states.
••   A strategic plan will be guiding investments by the riparian states.
••   Feasibility studies will have been conducted, financing secured, and
     construction launched on strategic investments.

Climate-Related Benefits
The climate-related benefits from the development of information manage-
ment systems and tools, along with the strategic plan, are expected to be sub-
stantial. Activities will provide a context for assessing climate resilience and
introducing appropriate mitigation and adaptation measures toward more
resilient, low-carbon growth trajectories.
   The development of low-carbon hydropower resources in the Zambezi
River Basin will help balance the regional power mix and provide for low-
carbon development and clean energy options. Development of these hydro-
power resources within the context of the strategic plan will provide a series
of climate-resilient investment options; improve adaptation measures related
to disaster preparedness and enhanced economic and social resilience;
and  introduce mitigation measures relating to climate-smart agriculture to
improve food security.

Key Partners
The Zambezi River Basin Program is guided by member states within the
basin through the ZAMCOM Technical Committee, composed of senior offi-
cials and the ZAMCOM Secretariat. The committee provides the reference
point for support from international cooperating partners (ICPs).
   A consultative forum of ICPs has been established in accordance with the
agreed principles of the SADC framework. The Zambezi-ICP Partnership
(ZICP) is a strategic advisory body to the ZAMCOM Secretariat that acts as
an interface for policy and technical dialogue between the ZAMCOM organs
and the ICPs. ZICP has a range of tasks. One of them is to serve as a resource
mobilization mechanism by sharing information on funding gaps and pro-
viding a forum for open dialogue, networking, and confidence building, in
order to create a shared understanding by the ZAMCOM Secretariat, the
ICPs, and other stakeholders on strategic issues related to implementation of
the Zambezi Strategic Plan.
   Active partnerships include the multi-donor trust fund for Cooperation
in  International Waters in Africa (CIWA), hosted by the World Bank, and
bilateral partnerships with AfDB, DANIDA, DFID, GIZ, and SIDA, among
others.

                  5.4  Lake Victoria Basin
                  The World Bank already supports the Lake Victoria Environment Management
                  Program (LVEMP), which promotes various climate-resilient solutions to the
                  environmental challenges in the Lake Victoria Basin. Through the design of a
                  new phase of LVEMP, a climate-resilient development strategy will be drafted
                  as the basis for a model multisector regional adaptation program in an area of
                  critical environmental and social importance (table 5.7).



                  Sectoral Background and Development
                  Challenges
                  The Lake Victoria Basin is a major population and poverty center in Africa
                  and a transboundary natural asset of global importance. The area covers
                  about a ninth of the land area of the East African Community but is home to
                  about a third of its population below the poverty line.
                    The lake supports the world’s largest freshwater fishery, with a total annual
                  landed catch value estimated at about $500 million in revenues, about half of
                  which are export revenues. The establishment of the Nile perch fishery in the
                  1980s and 1990s provided a resource boom that drew in poor and disadvan-
                  taged people from neighboring countries. The fishery provides livelihood for
                  3 million people. Large rural populations are also dependent on the degraded
                  lands in the upper basin, particularly in Burundi, Rwanda, and the Kenya
                  highlands.
                    The waters of the lake and its catchment area provide 90 percent of Uganda’s
                  hydropower; most of the hydropower for Burundi and Rwanda; and the
                  water supply to major urban centers, including Kampala, Kigali, Mwanza and
                  Kisumu.

   The basin is also of biological importance. The largest African Great Lakes—
Victoria, Tanganyika, and Malawi—are unique in the number of endemic ver-
tebrate species they support. The Afro-montane forests of the highlands on
both sides of the basin support some of the most diverse terrestrial habitats in
the world. Protected areas cover 25 percent of the basin’s land area and include
some of the most iconic parks in Africa, including Serengeti and Virungas.
   The Lake Victoria Basin is also a global example of environmental degrada-
tion. Introduction of the Nile perch was associated with the mass extinction

58	                      Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
of endemic native fish species; perch stocks themselves have now declined to
probably less than half of their peak levels, as a result of increased fishing and
other environmental stresses.
   Environmental degradation within the basin poses increasingly broad
threats to livelihoods and welfare. Loss of forest cover and erosion of soils has
chronic impacts on land productivity; where gullies destroy land, property,
and even lives, the impacts are acute. The flow of sediments and other pollut-
ants into the basin’s rivers and ultimately the lake reduces the supply of ­potable
water and causes algal blooms that are unpleasant for lakeshore communities
and limit the tourism potential of the region.
   One of the most striking indicators of poor ecological health is the rapid
colonization of the lake by water hyacinth. Infestations of this invasive float-
ing plant periodically block access to kilometers of lakeshore, preventing use
of the lake for transport and fishing and posing serious health and safety risks
to local inhabitants.



Initiatives to Address the Challenges and
Enhance Resilience
The LVEMP program aims to reduce a range of environmental pressures on
the Lake Victoria Basin and improve the welfare of its inhabitants. It supports
increased climate resilience in a variety of ways.
   LVEMP includes three main components. The first—strengthening institu-
tional capacity for managing shared water and fisheries resources—builds
the  capacity of the regional, national, and local institutions responsible for
coordination, research, management of resources, and enforcement of envi-
ronmental standards in order to harmonize policy and regulatory standards
and undertake ecosystem monitoring and applied research. It includes moni-
toring water quality and water hyacinth outbreaks and, in the long run,
strengthening hydro-met information systems.
   The second component—point source pollution control and prevention—
focuses on the management of major urban pollution sources from sewage
and industrial sources. Improved sanitation, wastewater management, and
cleaning of urban drainage channels reduce flood impacts; programs that
promote cleaner production by private industries are achieving considerable
efficiencies in the use of water and energy resources. This component also
includes navigation safety investments that help reduce a frequently fatal
­
climate risk to users of the lake.
   The third component—watershed management—is being implemented
through community-driven investments in more sustainable land manage-
ment, rehabilitation of key ecological infrastructure (particularly riparian
buffer zones and wetlands), and diversification of sustainable livelihoods.
These interventions yield more productive and resilient agriculture and
livelihoods for people living within the particularly vulnerable catchments.
Downstream they modulate hydrological flows and sedimentation (which
increase flood and drought risk) and reduce the nutrient loading into the

Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development 	                     59
lake (which affects fisheries, potable water supplies, and even [through
water ­ hyacinth infestation] access to the lake and the hydrological
balance).
  The current phase of the LVEMP was extended until the end of 2017 in
order to allow for preparation of a follow-on investment phase to begin in
FY18. In accordance with the Africa Climate Business Plan, the objective is to
use this design period to strengthen the climate-resilience components of the
next phase and develop an explicit climate resilience strategy for the Lake
Victoria Basin as a basis for attracting additional funding. Key initiatives
would include the following:

••    Development of a Lake Victoria Basin climate-resilient development
      strategy for eventual adoption by the Sectoral Counsel of Ministers for
      the Lake Victoria Basin of the EAC. The strategy would be accompanied
      by a financing roadmap assessing external funding sources.
••    Expansion and development of more systematic programs of sustainable
      land and water management based on erosion and sediment transport
      models and watershed monitoring and evaluation systems for improved
      targeting of available resources and prediction and verification of envi-
      ronmental and livelihood impacts to encourage additional investment. In
      addition to climate-smart agriculture, potential interventions would
      include sustainable rural energy systems to reduce pressure on forests
      from unsustainable wood fuels. The LVEMP has been piloting the intro-
      duction of biodigesters in cattle-rearing areas as an incentive to increase
      stall feeding and reduce pressure on forests. Taking this intervention to
      scale depends on improving its financial returns by reducing installation
      costs and finding ways to commercialize excess gas. Rwanda provides an
      example of licensed production of wood fuels from wood lots that could
      revolutionize charcoal production elsewhere.
••    Protection of ecological infrastructure, including riparian buffer zones,
      wetlands, forests, water towers, national parks, and fish nursery grounds.
      This effort would start with a comprehensive assessment of ecological
      assets within the basin, their environmental and livelihood functions,
      and the pressures they face. It would include development of remote
      ­
      sensing–based monitoring systems for water quality and water hyacinth
      spread, building on pilot work conducted with the European Space
      Agency. These ecological processes are influenced by climate factors and
      may eventually be amenable to hydro-met-linked forecasting rather than
      just monitoring after the fact.
••    Partnering with the private sector to promote green industries. This effort
      would involve expansion of existing program in resource-efficient produc-
      tion, coupled with new initiatives to promote green supply chains and
      develop nature-based enterprises in support of watershed management
      and resilient livelihoods. Given the scale of the sustainability challenges
      within the basin, it is critical to actively engage the private sector. So far the
      resource-efficient production project under LVEMP has leveraged about
      $30 of private sector investment for every $1 of project expenditure.

60	                     Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
••   Enhancement of hydro-met knowledge and forecasting services for
     improved disaster response and infrastructure resilience. This effort
     would include the modelling of potential climate-induced impacts on
     lake levels to identify climate threats to coastal infrastructure (including
     new port infrastructure under the Lake Victoria Transport Project) and
     assess the vulnerabilities of urban and transport infrastructure to flood-
     ing. Navigation safety programs are expected to be expanded under the
     transport project but will require parallel investments in weather fore-
     casting to improve effectiveness.


Climate-Related Benefits
Recent climate change and extremes have had significant impacts on agricul-
tural production within the basin and caused periodic flooding in numerous
areas within it. There is considerable uncertainty over the impacts of future
climate change within, but the importance of the balance between direct
evaporation and precipitation over the lake and rapid water-level changes in
the past suggests they could be severe. Because the lake is large enough to act
as a regional climate driver, significant impacts to it could have effects
throughout large areas of central Africa and the Sahel.
   The effects of climate change and environmental stresses are mutually rein-
forcing. Land degradation and loss of natural habitats increase the impacts of
rainfall extremes both upstream (through reduced retention of soil moisture
and nutrients) and downstream (through siltation, flooding, and gully forma-
tion). The effects of climate change on fisheries are likely to be exacerbated by
overfishing and pollution, through stresses on key nursery grounds and
changes in the thermocline and nutrient cycles. Inadequate urban waste man-
agement increases the risk of and from flooding, through storm drainage
channels blocked with refuse and the health risks from polluted floodwaters.
   The climate resilience development strategy will provide a model for inte-
grated rural and urban resilience, achieving the following:
••   improving the land management and ecological infrastructure of key
     watersheds and their climate-buffering ability
••   enhancing the health and resilience of important fisheries
••   promoting the diversification of rural livelihoods
••   improving the design of port and lakeshore infrastructure
••   increasing the efficiency of use of climate-affected water and energy
     resources by local industries
••   reducing key risk factors to urban flooding
••   strengthening emergency response.


Expected Outcomes
The climate-resilient development strategy is expected to substantially
increase the volume and coordination of adaptation investments within
the basin. Rural resilience interventions could reach 1 million beneficiaries

improving a range of key natural assets.
   Better information and monitoring systems would allow millions of basin
inhabitants to adapt better to climate-related events, including storms and
floods as well as induced water quality and water hyacinth events. Assessment
of infrastructure vulnerabilities could safeguard new port investments and
lead to significant improvements in flood management (for example, improve-
ment and maintenance of storm-water drainage) in urban centers with ­several
million inhabitants.

Key Partners
The World Bank will deploy IDA resources through the regional LVEMP
­
program and related operations. Trust fund resources (such as funds from
the Nordic Development Fund and CIWA) will augment this support. Pilot
Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) investment planning processes are
supporting efforts in Rwanda and Uganda.
  The private sector is considered a key source of finance (LVEMP has already
leveraged levels of private finance that are comparable to IDA investment).

Experience suggests that private sector investments in resource efficiency and
more resilient livelihoods will grow to at least $300 million by 2025.
   The East African Community, including member governments and techni-
cal institutions (particularly the Lake Victoria Basin Commission), is a key
counterpart. The Nile Basin Initiative and the Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary
Action Program  (NELSAP) will also be engaged in developing strategies,
models, and basin information systems.
   A range of development partners currently fund or are interested in sup-
porting related activities within the basin or the African Great Lakes more
broadly. They include AfDB, DFID, KfW, SIDA, and the US government.
These potential sources of funding, as well as traditional and emerging sources
of climate finance, including the GEF and the GCF, will be actively pursued.

                  Fostering Climate-Smart
                  Ocean Economies in Africa
                  More than 60 percent of the world’s economic output takes place near
                  coastlines. The ocean economy in some African countries contributes as
                  ­
                  much as 27 percent of revenues and a third of export revenues. For example,
                  an estimated $22 billion a year is derived from the coastal and marine
                  resources of the South West Indian Ocean region. Coastal tourism is the larg-
                  est contributor to GDP in Africa, at more than $11 billion a year.
                    In recognition of the importance of oceans, in 2015 world leaders adopted
                  the  Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 at the UN General Assembly
                  (“Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources”).



                  Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development	                65
Given the interconnectedness between climate change (SDG 13) and the blue
economy, the proposal presented here seeks to foster climate-smart ocean
economies in Africa.
   In 2014 African heads of state and governments pledged to embrace and
develop the blue economy concept as a vital part of the future development to
be outlined in the African Union’s Agenda 2063. In 2015 the Indian Ocean
Rim Association adopted the Mauritius Blue Economy Declaration, which
recognizes the interconnectivity of fisheries, infrastructure, energy, and
­seabed mining.1
   Table 6.1 describes proposed support to climate-smart ocean economies.

Sectoral Background and Development
Challenges
Over the coming decades and centuries, the health of the ocean will come
under increasing stress as a result of rising seawater temperature, ocean
acidification, and ocean deoxygenation. Coral bleaching, caused by rising
ocean temperatures, is already affecting vast areas of tropical coral reefs,
which harbor 25 percent of marine biodiversity.
   Small island developing states have long been aware of these issues. These
challenges are now affecting all of Africa’s coastal states and Africa overall, as
fish are a continental asset.
   Fisheries are directly susceptible to the effects of climate change. Ocean
acidification and changes in ocean circulation directly affect the productivity
of the ocean and the incomes coastal communities derive from ocean resources.
Much of the ocean resource is already degraded; climate change increases the
vulnerability of the ocean ecosystem and the communities that depend on it.
   The authorities and communities lack information on how to change the
way  they operate in response to climate change, making it difficult or impos-
sible for them to internalize climate resilience and adaptation into their
ocean-dependent economic sectors. The World Bank will support studies that
fill the gap in knowledge and enhance investments to improve the resilience
of fishing communities based on sustainable fisheries management. “Blue
­
carbon” sinks, such as mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and other vegetated
ocean habitats, can sequester up to five times the carbon absorbed by tropi-
cal forests, for example. Planning and accounting for these services ought to
be central to development planning and risk reduction.



Initiatives to Address the Challenges and
Enhance Resilience
The World Bank is providing Mauritius with technical support via the non-
lending Building the Ocean Economy in Mauritius project. This support cov-
ers bunkering, shipping/sea port–related activities, fisheries and aquaculture,
private sector development, renewable ocean energy, education, and marine
finance. The goal is to spur growth and sustainable development, create jobs,
increase regional cooperation, and build resilience in the face of climate
change. A series of diagnostics and policy notes is being prepared, which will
serve as a foundation for knowledge exchange with other countries.
   The Seychelles’ new Ministry of Finance, Trade and the Blue Economy is
pursuing its blue economy objectives by focusing on fisheries, aquaculture,
and blue bonds. Through the Paris Club, the Seychelles will exchange
$82 ­million worth of debt for funds to turn 30 percent of its 1.4 million square
kilometer Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) into marine protected areas, half
of which will be no-take zones. It will also develop marine spatial planning for
the EEZ and the extended continental shelf.


Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development	                     67
   The ocean off the coast of West Africa offers some of the richest fishing
grounds in the world. The West Africa Regional Fisheries Program (WARFP)
is helping the countries of the West Africa Regional Fisheries Commission
restore and recapture their ocean wealth though a long-term, three-phase
approach that involves (a) developing a foundation for managing fisheries and
fighting illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing to prepare for effective
management of national fisheries; (b) supporting governance reform, regional
integration, and revenue augmentation by investing in the enabling environ-
ment; and (c) supporting private sector–led sustainable growth. The program
currently includes Cabo Verde, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Liberia,
Mauritania, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. Activities that increase the resilience of
fishing communities need to be strengthened in each WARFP country.
   In the Indian Ocean, from Yemen to South Africa and from Comoros to
Maldives, the Southwest Indian Ocean Fisheries Governance and Shared
Growth (SWIOFish) program assists countries in managing one of the
globe’s most important areas for fisheries and marine biodiversity. The objec-
tive is to improve the management effectiveness of selected priority fisheries
at the regional, national, and community level. The project is designed to
contribute to the World Bank Group’s corporate goals of ending extreme
poverty and promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable fashion. It recog-
nizes the importance of fisheries as a key contributor to food security and
nutrition, the safety net, and job creation for the rural coastal populations of
the southwest Indian Ocean, which include some of among the poorest and
most vulnerable people in the world to climate change. The project provides
support for (a) enhancing regional collaboration among South West Indian
Ocean Fisheries Commission (SWIOFC) countries; (b) improving the poli-
cies, strategies, institutions, and legal frameworks necessary to improve the
performance of priority fisheries, regional marine environmental health, and
resilience to climate change; and (c) increasing value addition and diversify-
ing fishers’ livelihoods to reduce poverty and pressure on the region’s fisher-
ies, improving the regional business climate, enabling private sector
productivity and investment, and supporting public investments critical to a
viable private sector.
   Several African coastal countries have initiatives in the pipeline, are bene-
fiting from existing initiatives, or are learning from regional initiatives on the
ocean economy. Two examples are the Global Program for Fisheries
(PROFISH)2 and the Areas beyond National Jurisdiction Program (ABNJ).3



Expected Outcomes
On the analytical side, the expected outcomes concern adoption of the
evidence of climate change into the ways in which fisheries and the ocean
­
economy are managed. Fisheries monitored by regional commissions will
include climate variations in the scientific evidence governing fishery man-
agement, and national climate-smart blue economy development plans will
be presented to parliaments.

68	                  Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
                         On the investment side, the following outcomes are expected:
                    ••    Coastal fishery communities will develop alternative livelihood/jobs
                          streams.
                    ••    Coastal habitats, including blue carbon and other coastal assets, will be
                          managed by identifying a portfolio of investable projects, while ensuring
                          that local shareholders have a voice in dialogue around the blue
                          economy.
                    ••    Investment in climate-smart infrastructure will be made.



                    Climate-Related Benefits
                    Climate-related benefits relate mostly to adaptation. Countries adopting a
                    climate-smart approach to the ocean economy, particularly in fisheries, are
                    ­
                    expected to become more resilient to changes, because healthier marine
                    resource are more resilient to environmental changes and healthier marine
                    resources generate more revenue, which in turn creates employment.
                    Countries that manage their fisheries at higher abundance levels and with
                    a  better understanding of the changing patterns of fish stocks will become
                    more food secure. Countries adopting climate-smart ocean economy will
                    adapt better to the negative effects of climate change on specific coastal
                    populations.

Sectoral Background and Development
Challenges
Africa’s urban transformation from a largely rural population to a predomi-
nantly urban one by 2030 presents massive challenges and huge opportuni-
ties. If managed well, cities will continue to be engines of growth, stimulating
opportunities in a safe and inclusive way.
   Successful growth will require putting climate and disaster risk mitigation
and adaptation agenda at the heart of the development debate. Integrating
lower-carbon technologies upstream in the planning process, particularly for
long-lived infrastructure, provides opportunities to reap economic, health,
air quality, and climate benefits while supporting more sustainable develop-
ment patterns.
   Not taking timely action will lead to increased climatic and disaster
impacts. A majority of the World’s 325 million extremely poor people are
projected to be living in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 (ODI 2013). Among the
11 countries at greatest risk of disaster-induced poverty by 2030, 8 (the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Nigeria,
South Sudan, Sudan, and Uganda) are in Sub-Saharan Africa.
   The urban poor are particularly vulnerable to disaster impacts, because
they often live in highly exposed or at-risk areas (wetlands, floodplains,
landfills, garbage dumps, rocky areas). Because Africa is the fastest-​
urbanizing continent in the world, with an average urban growth rate of
­
3.4  percent, the consequences of climate change on cities—especially the
poor people who live in them—will be enormous.

72	                     Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
Initiatives to Address the Challenges and
Enhance Resilience
Three major support areas are proposed:
••   strengthening planning and capacity building in high-risk cities, using
     the City Strength Diagnostic, a qualitative, rapid diagnostic process that
     uses a combination of guided interviews, exercises, and review of existing
     studies to determine sectoral and cross-cutting recommendations, and
     other risk assessment, planning, and financing tools
••   investing in resilient infrastructure (upgrading transport infrastructure
     and  critical buildings, encouraging climate-resilient land use, improving
     solid waste management, and adopting integrated watershed management)
••   forging partnerships and city networks for knowledge sharing (30 cities
     will be selected for support, with phasing as indicated in table 7.2).
The selection of cities will be made on the basis of size and population growth,
disaster and climate risk, and demand (table 7.3):
••   Population size and growth: The focus will be on megacities (cities with
     more than 10 million people), large cities (cities with 1–5 million people),
     and medium-size cities (cities with 500,000–1 million people) that are
     growing at more than 3 percent rate a year.

••    Disaster and climate risk: Cities will be selected on the basis of the severity
      of the hazard exposure and climatic impact.
••    Demand from the city: Willingness and support from the city is crucial for
      sustained and effective engagement. World Bank presence in the country
      will also be factored in.
Six initiatives to support resilience planning are already under way:
••    Urban resilience planning is being conducted and the City Strength
      Diagnostic used in Addis Ababa and selected secondary cities in Ethiopia.
••    Urban poverty and resilience studies are being conducted in Antananarivo,
      Madagascar and Maputo, Mozambique.
••    Flood resilience planning is being done in greater Accra.
••    Climate change and disaster risk management multisectoral investment
      plans are being developed as a part of IDA’s policy commitment to pro-
      vide an opportunity to support urban resilience planning in cities in
      Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Malawi, Mali, and Senegal.
••    The GEF sustainable cities program is in effect in Senegal.
••    The creditworthiness academy (described below) is engaged in more than
      90 municipalities in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.
Four investment projects are ongoing, and one is being planned:
••    The $90 million Senegal Storm Water and Climate Change Adaptation
      project, focusing on flood prevention and preparedness, is underway in
      Dakar.
••    The $75 million Dar es Salaam Metropolitan Development Project,
      focused on strengthening institutional and urban management systems,
      is ongoing in Tanzania.
••    The $200 million Ibadan Urban Flood Mitigation Project, focused on
      flood risk mitigation, is ongoing in Nigeria.
••    The $85 million Cities and Climate Change project, focused on flood risk
      mitigation and preparedness, is ongoing in several cities of Mozambique.
••    The $50 million Resilient Cities project is being planned in Sierra Leone
      to support post-Ebola resilience building.
   New initiatives include technical assistance of $50 million for 30 cities as
well as $2 billion of investments in 20 cities over the fast-track and longer-term
phases of the business plan. Funding for additional investments will be made
available to 10 cities after 2026.
   Technical assistance will help selected cities conduct baseline analyses of
development challenges, including municipal financing, intergovernmental
fiscal transfers, and scenario analyses that will help identify the most sus-
tainable cost-effective technology and policy interventions in each city.
These data-driven studies will support the development of climate- and
disaster-­resilience action plans and lead to the preparation of investment
proposals capable of delivering climate- and disaster-resilient development.
A portion of the technical assistance will focus on capacity building, helping
cities build both the human resource pool and the institutional environment

74	                    Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
they need to craft and implement climate and disaster plans. Key areas of
planning that will be supported include the following:

••   building vulnerability awareness, by improving the understanding of
     disaster and climate risk by measuring financial risk and fiscal implica-
     tions and assessing physical risk, governance, and systems
••   strengthening emergency management and response planning, by
     improving channels, facilities, equipment, and protocols to ensure
     smooth deployment under high-risk circumstances and creating a web-
     based open data-sharing platform to capture postdisaster decisions,
     interactions, and changes over time
••   identifying resilience-building investments, including investments that
     improve fiscal health and land use, services, and infrastructure planning.
     Potential risk-reduction measures include enforcement of resilient pub-
     lic infrastructure, permitting, and construction; risk-informed infra-
     structure investments; and risk transfer and management strategies,
     such as climate and disaster reserve funds, disaster- and climate-linked
     social protection facilities, public asset catastrophe risk pools, and private
     property catastrophe risk pools.
Technical assistance will build on the following tools, which are already
being used:

••   City Strength Diagnostic: This tool brings together multiple line minis-
     tries, departments, and agencies with academic institutions to identify
     opportunities to increase the social, financial, and physical resilience to
     disaster and climate risk through hard (infrastructure) and soft (policy)
     measures and integrate systems-oriented solutions into national and local
     development planning.
••   City Creditworthiness Initiative: This tool, which helps cities access financ-
     ing, has become an integral part of the World Bank’s sustainable urban
     development strategy. It provides local authorities with comprehensive,
     hands-on, long-term support that helps them (a) increase their  credit-
     worthiness by strengthening their financial performance; (b) develop an
     enabling legal, regulatory, institutional, and policy framework for respon-
     sible subnational borrowing through reforms at the national level; (c)
     improve the “demand” side of financing by developing sound, cli-
     mate-smart projects that foster green growth; and (d) improve the “sup-
     ply” side of financing by engaging with private sector investors. The
     initiative comprises two primary components, credit worthiness acade-
     mies and creditworthiness implementation programs. City creditworthi-
     ness academies are hands-on learning programs that teach city leaders
     the fundamentals of creditworthiness and municipal finance. They serve
     as the launching point for city creditworthiness implementation
     programs.
••   Low-carbon planning to mitigate carbon emissions and achieve ­       compact
     urban form: Climate Actions for Urban Sustainability (CURB) is a new


Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development 	                     75
      scenario planning tool supporting low-carbon planning in cities.
      Developed jointly by the World Bank, C40, AECOM, and Bloomberg
      Philanthropies, it supports the development of more compact and
      energy-​efficient development (reduced sprawl), which could reduce
      greenhouse gas emissions by 39 percent.
••    City climate planner certification: This tool (under design by the Bank, in
      collaboration with other international institutions) will seek to build local
      capacity through training programs. Certification will focus on local
      emissions inventories, the foundation of low-carbon action plans.
   In parallel, the Bank will provide technical and financial support to develop
climate-friendly urban transport solutions, such as bus rapid transit (BRT),
which can both help improve urban mobility and reduce greenhouse gas
emissions (box 7.1).



     Box 7.1  Developing Bus Rapid Transport Systems in Lagos
     With an estimated 25 million people, Lagos, Nigeria is one of the largest and fastest-growing
     megacities in the world. Before development of the bus rapid transport (BRT) solution, city pub-
     lic transport was limited to 75,000 unreliable, expensive, and polluting mini-buses (danfo) and
     shared taxis (kabu-kabu), which together made 16 million trips daily. The poor half of the pop-
     ulation spent a fifth of its disposable income on transport. A typical journey from the main resi-
     dential areas to Lagos Island took two hours.

     The World Bank–financed Lagos Urban Transport Project identified bus services as a key compo-
     nent of a plan to overhaul the transport system. BRT is a roadway-based rapid transit system that
     looks and behaves like a subway but offers high-capacity rapid transit services on dedicated lanes
     in city streets rather than underground. In March 2008, this 22-kilometer project connecting
     Lagos mainland with the island became the first dedicated bus route in Sub-Saharan Africa. The
     BRT runs 16-hours a day, using 220 buses to move more than 200,000 passengers daily. In its first
     two years of operation, it moved more than 120 million passengers. The World Bank provided
     technical advice and a $100 million IDA credit.

     As a result of the project, journey time was reduced by an average of 25 minutes from one end
                                                                                             percent
     of the route to the other, and transit fares fell by more than half. The BRT carries 25 ­
     of  all passenger traffic along the corridor while accounting for just 4 percent of vehicles.
        generated 2,000 jobs for drivers, bus conductors, inspectors, mechanics, and ticket sellers
     It ­
     and another 10,000 indirect jobs to operate formal and informal park-and-ride facilities and
     mini-fast-food services.

     In addition to these social benefits, the BRT project has reduced CO2 emissions by 13 percent and
     greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent. Wait time has been cut from 45 to 10 minutes, reducing
     the exposure of passengers to pollution, thereby reducing the incidence and severity of respira-
     tory diseases.

Expected Outcomes
Programs are expected to yield benefits related to efficient urban form,
strengthen the tax base and increase access to municipal bonds, and
improve cities’ capacity for integrated risk management, including man-
agement of natural and human hazards. Specific benefits include
(a)  enhanced adaptation and mitigation planning and implementation
capacity of local city governments and key stakeholders; (b) more resilient
buildings, infrastructure, and services, particularly optimized transport
­
services; (c) better preparedness for hazards, such as floods, water scarcity,
and ­ sea-level rise, including better emergency response capacity; and
(d) heightened awareness and greater public involvement in resilient plan-
ning and implementation.



Climate-Related Benefits
The proposed activities will benefit 20–25 of the Sub-Saharan African cities at
greatest risk from climate change, home to some 62 million people. Major
climate benefits include the following:
••   Adaptation to climate change: Planning for and adapting to climate and
     disaster impacts as well as disaster preparedness, long-term cost sav-
     ings from the deployment of early warning and response systems to
     better respond to emergencies, more robust technology and infrastruc-
     ture that is better capable of withstanding climate-related and disaster
     risks, and improved public health from the strengthening of local health
     systems to ensure that they are better able to address climate-related
     risks
••   Mitigation of climate change: Low-carbon development; long-term cost
     savings from the deployment of more energy-efficient technologies;
     reduced transport-related energy use; improved air quality, from the
     use of cleaner fuels and more efficient technology; improved urban
     environment, from the use of more efficient solid and liquid waste
     ­management systems; and greater social inclusion, through the ­creation
     of  more comprehensive, accessible and cleaner public transportation
     networks.

                 The Bank will help increase the resilience of coastal assets in West Africa to
                 climate and other natural hazards through a mix of technical assistance and
                 investments that will seek to preserve and rehabilitate the natural coastal
                 resources essential for livelihoods; spur economic development and increase
                 social welfare; and support the sustainable development of key growth ­sectors,
                 such as fisheries, tourism, and industry. The regional dimension of  coastal
                 degradation calls for both national and regional dialogue, at the policy and
                 the technical level. Table 8.1 summarizes the proposed interventions.

Sectoral Background and Development
Challenges
The West African coastal area is one of the most rapidly urbanizing areas in
the world. It is home to major industries, including tourism, agro-industry,
and off-shore petroleum exploration and production, as well as city and
­
seaside residences. About 56 percent of the GDP of West African coastal
states originates in coastal areas.1 About 31 percent of West Africa’s popula-
tion and 51 percent of its urban population live along the coastline.
   Two major climate-related issues threaten the sustainability of West Africa’s
coastal areas: erosion and flooding. Countries face severe shoreline losses, as

80	                      Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
a result of coastal erosion, which is expected to worsen with sea-level rise.
People’s livelihoods and health are at risk as a result of floods caused by severe
weather events and poor infrastructure and planning.
   Human activity and climate change cause shoreline recession. The artificial
stabilization of the shoreline; the deterioration of natural formations, such as
mangroves; the construction of major infrastructure that interrupts sediment
flow; the extraction of materials; and the multiplication of dams deprive these
fragile coastal areas of important sediment deposits. Lack of coordination of
anti-erosion solutions at the local, national, and international levels com-
pounds the problem. The poorest and most marginalized populations are
most vulnerable to erosion, which is likely to intensify in the future.
   A combination of factors causes coastal flooding. Rapid and often
unplanned urbanization and settlement on floodplains and other risk-prone
areas cause significant conversion of the natural landscape that once pro-
tected against erosion and flooding. Lack of waste collection services increases
vulnerability to flooding, as waste, in particular plastic, ends up clogging
urban drainage canals and coastal lagoons. Excessive solid waste becomes a
health hazard in urban neighborhoods and unplanned settlements and slums.
   Climate change scenarios for West Africa suggest an increase in the fre-
quency and intensity of tidal waves and storm surge, which will exacerbate
coastal erosion. They suggest that a sea-level rise of one meter would cause
the loss of 18,000 square kilometers of land, exacerbating damage to infra-
structure and displacing populations.
   Coastal zone pressures also affect the ability of regional fisheries to maintain
healthy fish stocks and remain relatively unattended. Coastal habitats serving
as refuges and nurseries are being degraded, as a result of mangrove harvest-
ing, petroleum refining, land-based marine pollution, and other factors.
   Roads are particularly vulnerable to erosion and flooding. Without action,
the costs to road users of climate-related incidents is estimated to increase by
up to 30 percent by 2050. In Ghana the estimated cost of adapting the road
network is up to $1.1 billion (in 2009 net present value terms). Increased
maintenance costs greatly exceed the costs of changing road designs (World
Bank 2010c). Upstream diagnostics to identify critical vulnerabilities in the
road network can ensure that technical solutions are built into network
design.
   With the support of the World Bank, several countries are developing
methodologies to assess the vulnerability of road systems (box 8.1). The Bank
will explore whether such instruments could be used in the Sub-Saharan
African countries that are most exposed to coastal erosion and flooding.



Initiatives to Address the Challenges and
Enhance Resilience
In 2007 the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU)
launched and implemented a regional program to fight coastal erosion. The
program sponsored a regional shoreline monitoring study and the drawing

Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development	                      81
  Box 8.1  Increasing the Resilience of the Road System in Morocco
  Morocco is facing extreme climate events that appear to have increased in frequency and intensity
  over the past decade. Since 2009 the cost to repair roads affected by extreme climate events has
  been about $400 million, $300 million of which was taken from the road maintenance budget.
  Intense rainfall led to large-scale mudslides, as well as flooding and road erosion. The Rabat-
  Casablanca motorway was severally eroded, and many poor rural communities were temporarily
  isolated from access to commercial and urban centers.

  In 2010 the Moroccan authorities requested support from the World Bank to study the adaptation
  of the transport sector to climate change. Four road ­sections were selected for study. A risk assess-
  ment was performed for each road to identify critical points and propose engineering solutions
  to increase the resilience of the roads to extreme climate events. Solutions focused on improving
  the hydrological and geotechnical conditions of the roads and identifying technical solutions for
  more resilient pavement. A simplified guide was ­    prepared for the Road Directorate, including
  technical norms for building, rehabilitating, and maintaining road infrastructure.



up of a management scheme for West Africa’s coastal areas. This work was
prepared by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
The 2011 Dakar conference of West African environment ministers from
11 countries adopted the IUCN management scheme for West Africa,2
which provides a thorough diagnosis of coastal areas and a detailed review
of risks.3
  As part of the IDA17 Replenishment, the Bank committed to scale up
support to IDA countries to develop and implement country-led multisec-
toral plans and investments for managing climate and disaster risk in devel-
opment in at least 25 additional countries. For 5 of the 15 countries selected
in Africa (Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Mauritania, São Tomé and Principle, and
Togo), coastal erosion was identified as a priority area to be addressed by the
multisector plans.
  In 2014 the Bank started the West Africa Coastal Areas (WACA) Program,
in partnership with WAEMU and the Nordic Development Fund (NDF). The
program offers technical assistance in response to countries’ demand to
combat coastal erosion and flooding. It includes three axes of intervention,
­
in support of regional coastal shoreline monitoring and management,
national integrated coastal zone management planning, and preparation of
specific multisectoral investment plans.
  The program will complement other initiatives, such as the West Africa
Regional Fisheries Program (WARFP), which is addressing issues such as ille-
gal fishing, overfishing, and sector governance issues. Investment plans
include hard infrastructure and green infrastructure. Hard infrastructure
includes construction of transportation networks, piers, artificial reefs, groins,
and erosion and flooding preventive infrastructure. Green infrastructure
involves increasing and preserving areas with green or natural infrastructure
(mangroves, sand dunes, vegetation, coastal aggregates, coastal forest, lagoons

82	                   Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
and coastal swamps, water plants, and so forth) that prevent coastal erosion
and flooding.


Expected Outcomes
Fast-track expected outcomes (to be achieved by 2023) include the
following:
••   Rates of erosion will be reduced in 30 percent of identified coastal erosion
     hotspots.
••   Flood risks will be reduced for 30 percent of the population in priority
     flooding areas.
••   Decision-Support Coastal information Monitoring Systems will be in
     place in all participating countries.



Climate-Related Benefits
Through monitoring and actions to preserve mangroves, climate-resilient
and low-carbon management of coastal areas in West Africa will ensure the
conservation of many species specific to this type of environment. Such man-
agement may also reduce the impacts of sedimentation on biodiversity.
   Management of liquid and solid waste is necessary to maintain a healthy
and productive coastal environment, to benefit biodiversity habitat, ecosys-
tem functions, and reproduction of fishery resources. Removal of solid waste
that is clogging drainage systems will prevent severe flooding. Investments in
climate-resilient infrastructure is expected to increase the socio-economic
resilience of coastal communities and nations.



Financing Plan
Table 8.2 describes the financing plan.



Key Partners
Key partners are defined here as institutions that have indicated interest
in exploring participating in the WACA Program. They include the WAEMU,
a key convening organization in West Africa. NDF provided the seed
­
funding  to initiate critical technical assistance in four countries, based on
country demand. The French government has indicated interest in exploring
options for collaboration. USAID has an ongoing program in Ghana that is
aligned with WACA objectives and has the potential to be scaled up region-
ally. In addition to the support of countries under the WACA Program, the
proposed actions are supported by GIZ, under the Africa Climate Investment
Readiness Partnership. It is expected that the IUCN will be interested in
participating as well.

Sectoral Background and Development
Challenges
The impacts of climate change and natural disasters will disproportionately affect
the poor. Limited savings and access to finance inhibit poor households’ ability
to respond to and recover from disasters and to make the investments necessary
to adapt to climate change. Poor households may be compelled to employ

86	                     Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
harmful coping strategies, such as taking out high-interest loans they cannot
repay, selling productive assets for immediate liquidity, and removing children
from school so that they can provide additional household income. All of these
actions can have a lasting and scarring effect on the affected individuals, house-
holds, and society. They threaten to undo years of hard-won development gains.
   Vulnerabilities among the poor to the impacts of climate change are espe-
cially high in many parts of Africa. Across most of the region, increases in
agricultural productivity have been the primary driver of poverty reduction.
Forecasted climate change impacts highlight sharp reductions in agricultural
yields in the face of erratic precipitation and increases in the number and
severity of extreme weather events, including floods and droughts. The poor
often live in locations that are more exposed and vulnerable to the impacts of
disasters and climate change. When severe flooding hit Malawi in 2014, for
example, the worst-­   affected regions had headcount poverty rates of nearly
twice the national average.
   Social protection can significantly increase the resilience of poor and vul-
nerable households by responding to disasters and building resilience at the
household level so that households are better equipped for risk and better able
to respond to disaster and adapt to climate change. Formal social protection
instruments, although growing in coverage across the region, tend to be small,
fragmented, and largely donor driven, however (although there are some
notable exceptions). At the same time, the more widely used traditional cop-
ing mechanisms with which poor households manage shocks—assistance
from the family or the community in times of need—are often overwhelmed
by covariate climate-related shocks and are not sufficient to meet the chal-
lenge of adaptation. Consequently, humanitarian relief is the most prevalent
form of assistance for poor populations in many African countries. This relief
is unpredictable, does not address underlying vulnerabilities, and often
reaches beneficiaries only after a lengthy appeal process, by which time the
worst impacts of negative coping have often already been experienced.
   In the face of climate change and increased climate-related shocks, it is
important to increase the scale and scope of social protection systems across
Africa. Social protection systems are being built in a number of countries,
including Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Rwanda. The World Bank has been
a major partner in most of these efforts, providing strategic and design advice,
technical assistance, and financing and distilling and brokering knowledge on
these programs. Increasingly, these social protection programs are being
explicitly linked to the challenge of climate change and designed with flexibil-
ity, scalability, and adaptive capacity.



Initiatives to Address the Challenges and
Enhance Resilience
Adaptive social protection (ASP) is a new integrated approach that can help
countries address the challenges of adaptation and climate/disaster risk
management. ASP programs are flexible social protection programs that can
­

Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development	                     87
protect poor households from climate and other shocks before they occur
(through predictable transfers, the building of community assets, and other
programs that help vulnerable people cope) and scale up to respond to
extreme events when they hit. ASP programs are implemented in a way that
avoids having an adverse impact on the environment or creating perverse
incentives and thus resulting in maladaptation.
  An ASP system may include the following features:
••    safety nets programs that can be easily scaled up to respond to climate-­
      related shocks (the main instruments for responding to shocks include
      conditional and unconditional cash transfers for the poorest people
      and for people affected by shocks and public work programs, which can
      support the development of climate-resilient infrastructure in vulnera-
      ble areas)
••    complementary activities, such as training on basic skills and livelihood
      diversification, sanitary and health practices, and nutrition awareness
      programs, to strengthen the human capital and resilience of the poor.
••    linkages to early warning and climate information systems, which can be
      used for targeting and planning purposes and for helping design effective
      emergency response and adaptation programs.
••    other formal and informal insurance or risk-financing mechanisms that
      may complement and support social protections systems to build long-
      term resilience.
••    targeting mechanisms that help identify the people most vulnerable to
      natural hazards and climate change–related risks, so that information can
      target the people most at risk of being hit by these types of shocks and
      quickly scale up a program once disaster hits.
••    other building blocks that form part of the development of comprehen-
      sive adaptive social protection systems, including management informa-
      tion systems, payment systems, and monitoring and evaluation.



Expected Outcomes
The expected outcome of this component of the business plan is an increase
in the number of people covered by ASP programs across Sub-Saharan Africa.
Intermediate outcomes include the following:
••    Government policy/strategy informed: Government policy/strategy will be
      informed through the delivery of knowledge products for ASP and direct
      support to the development of social protection strategies (incorporating
      climate change adaptation and disaster risk management).
••    Client capacity increased: The design and implementation capacity of ASP
      programs and systems will be strengthened through provision of just-in-
      time technical assistance and capacity building.
••    Knowledge deepened: The exchange and dissemination of best-practice
      examples of ASP initiatives with clients will be facilitated through a


88	                   Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
                    regional platform for knowledge exchange and the dissemination of
                    success stories and lessons learned.
                    ­
               ••   Innovative approaches and solutions generated: New innovative approaches
                    will be developed through support to knowledge creation and just-in-time
                    technical assistance for ASP.



               Climate-Related Benefits
               ASP initiatives have the potential to directly increase resilience and promote
               adaptation at the household level through three channels (box 9.1 exemplifies
               the case of Ethiopia):
               ••   the scale-up of operations after a shock hits, in order to deliver assistance
                    to affected poor households in a timely and predictable manner
               ••   public works initiatives that can help address drivers of vulnerability and
                    promote adaptation to climate change through projects that target water
                    insecurity, soil erosion, and carbon capture
               ••   a permanent program for the poorest that helps build resilience and thus
                    reduces the need for emergency response.




Box 9.1  Responding to Crises and Building Resilience in
Ethiopia
Ethiopia’s ASP system channels funding from national and global partners into a set of programs
that allows it to scale up in response to severe droughts, such as the one that hit the Horn of Africa
in 2011. A combination of initiatives, including temporary employment and cash assistance, pre-
vented many poor, food-insecure families from starving. Ethiopia was the only affected country
that did not see an increase in its poverty rate as a result of the drought.

In addition to responding to crises, Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) delivers
public works that have allowed poor communities to directly engage in the process of adapt-
ing to climate change. More than 60 percent of the program’s public works subprojects tar-
get soil and water conservation, strengthening both livelihoods and resilience to the impacts
of variable rainfall. PSNP projects have helped construct infrastructure that increases water
retention, with positive spillover effects for livelihoods. PSNP participants have constructed
600,000 kilometers of soil and stone bunds, which enhance water retention and reduce soil and
water run-off. Small-scale irrigation from water sources developed by the PSNP has helped
4–12 percent of households expand livestock holdings, increasing incomes by 4–25 percent.
PSNP soil erosion and water conservation projects have led to significant and visible increases
in wood and herbaceous vegetation cover and a broader diversity of plant species, regreening
previously desolate areas.

Sectoral Background and Development
Challenges
Environmental change has always been a driver of human mobility. However,
there is growing evidence that climate change, climate-induced events, and
environmental factors are likely to play an increasingly important role in
influencing migration, both within developing regions and from developing
to developed regions. Climate change is expected to affect all forms of migra-
tion in Africa–internal and cross-border, short and long distance, temporary
and permanent, voluntary and forced—with negative impacts on millions of
poor people in Africa. In affected areas, it could undermine and reverse much
of the development progress that has been achieved in the last two decades.
The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that African societ-
ies must prepare for inevitable changes in the climate during the next few
decades and that climate change will amplify existing stresses on water avail-
ability and agriculture and affect public health.

Box 10.1  Drought, Migration, and the Seeds of Conflict
A mix of droughts, governance failure, and conflict led to massive displacements in Somalia
in 2011. A long-term trend in increasing aridity and poor water management has significantly
reduced Lake Chad, reducing its area from 25,000 square kilometers in the early 1970s to approx-
imately 2,500 square kilometers today. The shrinking of the lake has impaired fishery livelihoods
in the area, forcing communities to migrate to other areas, where they compete with hosting com-
munities for already scarce resources. Climate change has increased the intensity and frequency
of seasonal flooding, severely affecting large areas in southern Nigeria and northern Cameroon,
leading to the short- and long-term displacement of thousands of people and the resettlement of
communities.

Livelihoods-driven migration leads to disputes and conflicts between displaced population and
host communities, fueling existing localized conflicts and creating conditions for disputes across
borders. These disputes have spawned instability that has allowed movements like Boko Haram
to take root.



                  Numerous studies, including the World Development Report 2011: Conflict,
               Security, and Development, have also suggested that climate change and envi-
               ronmental degradation can contribute to increased social tension.
               Environmental stresses are “threat multipliers”—factors that interact with
               other risk drivers and sources of vulnerability. A number of studies conclude
               that environmentally induced scarcity of resources, in combination with
               socioeconomic, political, institutional, and societal vulnerabilities, can exac-
               erbate fragility in states and societies, creating conditions conducive for con-
               flict and large-scale migration.
                  Several regional and national assessments on forced displacement and
               mixed migration in Africa (box 10.1) document how extreme events such as
               drought and floods have profound negative impacts on livelihood opportuni-
               ties and productivity, which in turn feed into drivers for instability, conflict,
               and forced and economic displacement, deepening conditions of poverty and
               vulnerability.
                  Environmental change will affect the nature of migration and migration
               flows, both now and in the future, through its influence on a range of eco-
               nomic, social, and political drivers that themselves affect migration. The need
               to understand and address the multiple drivers of migration and their com-
               plex, interactive effects is urgent.



               Initiatives to Address the Challenges and
               Enhance Resilience
               Addressing these challenges calls for diagnostics and targeted knowledge
               exchange to inform the design of responsive programming and dialogue
               with country clients and leverage new and additional sources of finance to

               Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development 	                           93
support resilience building at the local, national, and regional levels through
appropriate policy, institutional, and investment responses. The Global
Practice team working on Social, Urban Rural and Resilience (GSURR) in
the Africa Region will work with key internal and external partners to
deliver innovative joint operations to strengthen social and economic resil-
ience in rural and urban spaces to address the drivers and impacts of migra-
tion and provide durable solutions. In the fast-track phase, the team will
focus on two regions with urgent needs—the Lake Chad Basin and the
Horn of Africa—to enhance developing and ongoing operations, undertake
strategic analytical pieces to build an evidence base, inform further project
design, and pilot innovative approaches that can be scaled up in the longer
term. Strategies and operations developed will be scaled out to other subre-
gions, such as the Great Lakes Region, as demand grows and resources are
mobilized.
   The AFR GSURR team will pilot innovations to enhance ongoing opera-
tions and provide proof of concept of approaches to be scaled up in the longer
term. Six pilot projects are planned:
1.	 Building resilient communities in the Lake Chad Basin. In partnership with
    AFD, and based on ongoing analytical work, the Bank will pilot a project
    covering communities in Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria, and Niger that will
    aim to strengthen the environmental and social resilience of communi-
    ties around the lake to mitigate the drivers and impacts of migration. The
    project will pay particular attention to boosting the productivity of these
    communities in a socially inclusive manner. Strategies of spatial integra-
    tion and development will be tested to enhance the economic resilience
    of the region through sustainable practices.
2.	 Understanding the effect of behavioral change on water use in urban areas.
    This pilot will use innovative behavioral approaches to improve the use
    and management of water resources in urban areas that depend on the
    Lake Chad tributaries in order to mitigate adverse impacts on the hydrol-
    ogy of the lake.
3.	 Building a community-driven early warning system in Ibadan. This pilot
    will support a community-led subcomponent within the Ibadan Urban
    Flood Management Project to engage at-risk communities in mapping
    and understanding flood risk and developing an early warning system for
    flood events.
4.	 Promoting community-driven environmental management in Mbale. This
    activity will support community-led land management and agricultural
    practices to mitigate landslides along the slopes of Mt. Elgon, in Mbale, in
    eastern Uganda. During discussion of the scope of the regional displace-
    ment operation, the Ministry of Finance was keen on the Bank looking at
    displacement as a result of landslides in the area, where there have been
    reports of deaths, property destruction, and relocations over the past
    three years.
5.	 Promoting participatory scenario development for policy making.
    Effective policy interventions to support adaptation must incorporate

94	                  Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
    diversity in their design—diversity of socioeconomic and climatic con-
    texts, variations in institutional arrangements, and differences in the
    locally available resources that structure current adaptation practices.
    This activity will build on existing methodologies to inform climate
    adaptation policies.
6.	 Building community-driven resilience and adaptive social ­   protection.
    The Ethiopia Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) is widely
    seen as demonstrating the potential of a social protection program
    to build individual, household, and community-level resilience in
    the face of climate change-related stresses (see box 9.1). The Niger
    Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) also models elements
    of an adaptive social protection focus. The Zambia PPCR embod-
    ies a demand-driven approach to supporting community-based
    adaptation. Expansion of the PPCR to a second round of countries
    (Ethiopia, The Gambia, Madagascar, Malawi, Rwanda, and Uganda)
    provides opportunities to scale up adaptive social protection and
    community-based adaptation in ways that complement durable solu-
    tions to conflict- and climate-related mixed migration and forced
    displacement. The AFR GSURR team will work in partnership with
    the Social Protection and Labor Global Practice and the community-
    driven development community to ensure that the social dimensions
    of resilience are addressed and communities are empowered to better
    manage risk.
It is expected that the pilots will be scaled up into additional operations.
   Two new operations are under development:
••   The Regional IDA Operations on Development Response to Displacement
     and Borderlands and Lagging Regions in the Horn of Africa ($450 mil-
     lion planning and design phase) aims to improve access to social ser-
     vices, expand economic opportunities, and enhance environmental
     management for host and forcibly displaced households in targeted
     areas of Djibouti, Ethiopia and Uganda. It includes three investment
     components: social and economic infrastructure and services, sustain-
     able environmental management, and a livelihoods program. The oper-
     ation seeks to stabilize border areas in selected Horn of Africa countries
     through social and institutional development and the promotion of eco-
     nomic activities.
••   The Resilience and Cohesion of Displaced Persons & Border Communities
     in the Great Lakes Region ($100 million) project aims to improve liveli-
     hoods and socioeconomic infrastructure for refugees, internally displaced
     persons, returnees, and host communities in the Democratic Republic of
     Congo, Tanzania, and Zambia. It will also strengthen the systems of par-
     ticipating government agencies to deliver development programs to these
     populations.
There is a critical need to address data gaps and develop a better under-
standing of the push and pull factors behind mixed migration, identify its

Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development 	                    95
impacts, and craft durable solutions to inform investments. Some areas of
focus include the following:

1.	 Linkages between hydrological changes, climate change, resource degradation,
    livelihoods, and migration in the Lake Chad Basin. This study will analyze
    water resources and ecosystem services in the Lake Chad Basin; the liveli-
    hoods depending on those resources; and the relationships between changes
    in resource availability, degradation of existing resources, livelihoods, and
    forced displacement and conflicts in the region. It will examine migration
    patterns from other rural areas into communities surrounding the lake and
    migration to urban areas in the vicinity of the lake. The analysis will identify
    specific areas of intervention that would enhance the resilience of commu-
    nities around the lake and mitigate drivers and impacts of migration.
2.	 Impact of urbanization and water management of the Lake Chad tribu-
    taries. This assessment will identify the linkages between rapid urbaniza-
    tion in western and central Africa and its implications for water resources
    management of the Lake Chad tributaries. It will examine the pressures
    that rural-urban migration places on food production and water access
    and identify critical entry points in the urbanization process to mitigate
    adverse impacts and ensure that the lake continues to be a sustainable
    source of livelihoods.
3.	 Resilient communities in the Lake Chad Basin. This study will focus on
    understanding the autonomous adaptation and risk management strat-
    egies that poor and marginalized groups have developed over centuries
    in response to climate variability and environmental change. It will also
    examine ways to address the increasing tensions between pastoralists and
    agriculturalists as a result of growing tensions related to water access. It will
    identify potential interventions to enhance community resilience to con-
    flict related to water management and agricultural activities in the basin.
4.	 Knowledge partnership on mixed migration innovation. This initiative
    will exploit the Bank Group’s convening power to leverage and build on
    cutting-edge work on mixed migration. Extensive work under the UK
    Foresight Project on Migration and Global Environmental Change is
    being followed up by a new project of the Royal Geographical Society on
    “trapped populations” in countries including Somaliland and Zimbabwe.
    The Centre de Recherches Internationales (CERI) of Sciences Po Paris is
    leading an extensive knowledge network that already works closely with
    the Nansen Initiative. The AFR GSURR team is linked in internationally
    with GSDRC’s Applied Knowledge Services and internally in with the
    Bank Group–facilitated Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and
    Development (KNOMAD), a global hub of knowledge and policy expertise
    on migration and development issues. KNOMAD brings together a wide
    range of relevant institutions, academics, and practitioners. Other internal
    partners within the Bank include the Social Protection and Labor (SPL)
    Global Practice in Africa, the Global Program on Forced Displacement,
    GFDRR, and urban development specialists within GSURR.

Expected Outcomes
The expected outcome of these activities is to gain a better understanding of
the drivers and impacts of mixed migration, in order to facilitate the develop-
ment of government policies and investments support planned, facilitated
migration as an effective adaptation strategy. Intermediate outcomes include
the following:

1.	 Evidence base deepened and applied: Activities will facilitate the gen-
    eration, exchange, and application of knowledge among global and
    local partners related to critical topics, including the understanding
    of autonomous risk management strategies of poor communities, the
    relationships and linkages between different push and pull factors driv-
    ing migration, and good-practice examples of how to address adverse
    impacts while promoting planned, facilitated migration as an effective
    adaptation strategy.
2.	 Government policy/strategy informed: The creation of key knowledge
    products, operational innovations, and knowledge exchanges will inform
    government policies and strategies related to climate change adaptation
    and migration.
3.	 Client capacity increased: Provision of just-in-time technical assistance
    and capacity building will strengthen the design and implementation
    capacity for addressing mixed migration and strengthening resilience at
    the local level.
4.	 Innovative approaches and solutions generated: Support to knowledge
    creation and just-in-time technical assistance for addressing the drivers
    and impacts of migration will help develop new innovative approaches to
    migration.



Climate-Related Benefits
The proposed activities have the potential to directly increase social and eco-
nomic resilience and promote adaptation at the household and community
levels. They will do so by understanding and supporting autonomous adapta-
tion and risk management strategies of affected groups, empowering affected
groups to drive a risk management agenda in support of their development
goals, and linking poor communities to necessary information and resources,
such as social protection systems and alternative livelihood opportunities.
Community-level work to increase resilience and diversify livelihood sources
could also be designed to target water insecurity and soil erosion and pro-
mote increased carbon capture.

POWERING RESILIENCE
Some 600 million people and 10 million small and medium-size enterprises
in Sub-Saharan Africa still do not have a connection to the electric grid. In
many countries, power systems are small and poorly maintained by utilities
that often operate at a deficit. As a result, many energy users on and off the
grid rely on fossil energy sources for lightning or heating. These sources are
more expensive and produce significantly fewer productivity gains for con-
sumers than modern energy sources.
   In response, the Bank has committed to the objectives of the Sustainable
Energy for All initiative by 2030. These objectives include providing universal
access to modern energy services, doubling the global rate of improvement in
energy efficiency, and doubling the share of renewable energy in the global
energy mix.
   Low-carbon energy sources offer mitigation benefits associated with
increasing the share of renewable energy across the region while also provid-
ing the power needed to tackle the access challenge and improve resilience.
By investing both on and off the grid, crowding in private sector investment,
and leveraging mainstream and emerging technologies in the renewable
space, the World Bank can contribute to improving one of the key drivers of
security, productivity, job creation, and poverty reduction. Such investments
will require increased concessional financing for ancillary infrastructure
(roads, water availability, deep grid investments, and so forth).
   On-grid generation investments, which center on solar photovoltaic (PV),
hydropower, and geothermal, should be calibrated to optimize additional
transmission and distribution needs as well as the regional interconnections
that play an increasingly important role in overcoming the problems associ-
ated with small domestic market size and improving reliability. Large-scale
renewable generation investment could also include concentrated solar power
(CSP) and wind as regional markets take off. Off-grid investments can lever-
age small distributed generation systems, such as solar portable lanterns and
solar home systems, as well as mini-grids that may blend fossil fuel with solar
PV generation. Given the size of the investment required and the important
role to be played by the private sector, leveraging the comparative advantages
of the different parts of the World Bank Group—including IFC advisory and
investment services and MIGA insurance to attract private sector participa-
tion—will be critical.

Sectoral Background and Development
Challenges
Sub-Saharan Africa is home to some of the highest insolation rates in the
world. Recent decreases in the cost of solar PV technology create an opportu-
nity for countries to diversify their energy mixes without increasing carbon
emissions. Countries are starting to recognize ways of leveraging this abun-
dant resource. They are beginning to employ planning techniques to deter-
mine where and when to deploy utility-scale solar PV plants, off-grid solar
PV solutions, and solar or hybridized mini-grids.
  Despite its growing list of benefits, solar PV accounts for less than
    percent of the electricity generated across Sub-Saharan Africa, however.
0.5 ­
The vast majority of generation is concentrated in South Africa.



Initiatives to Address the Challenges and
Enhance Resilience
As costs continue to fall, utility-scale solar systems are becoming an increas-
ingly attractive technology as part of a least-cost energy mix. Many coun-
tries in Africa rely on thermal generation using liquid fuels at a cost of
$20–$30/kWh. Recent competitive tenders for solar PV have demonstrated
increasing price competitiveness. In Uganda the GET FiT process reduced
independent power producer (IPP) tariffs to $0.17/kWh in 2014; in South
Africa tariffs under the Renewable Energy IPP Program fell to $0.065/kWh
in 2015. Solar PV can also be deployed more quickly than other technologies
and rolled out in a modular/distributed fashion.
   Despite these advantages, grid-scale solar PV remains unfamiliar to many
utilities, and examples of competitive selection for solar IPPs are scarce.
Africa has a notional pipeline of more than 5 GW of solar PV projects, but
most projects are unsolicited, expensive, and unbankable. In response, the
World Bank is rolling out Scaling Solar, an initiative to rapidly expand private

102	                    Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
investment in utility-scale solar PV projects, by combining standardized
bankable project documents, advisory services, stapled financing from IFC,
and stapled credit enhancement from the World Bank and MIGA.
   Recent reductions in the price of solar system components and the intro-
duction of pay-as-you-go business models have made solar lanterns and solar
home systems more accessible, spurring market growth in excess of 100 ­percent
a year. Modern solar PV solutions are vastly superior to traditional alterna-
tives and have established themselves as a key transitional solution for rural
households.
   An increasing but still small number of higher-density rural communities
are benefiting from energy access from hybridized solar/diesel mini-grids.
Mini-grids have typically been diesel powered, but the dramatic reduction in
the cost of PV panels and new storage solutions have made retrofitted or
newly built solar-powered mini-grids increasingly attractive.
   Although interest has ballooned in recent years, most client governments
in the region still lack tangible plans for developing solar PV. Along with sub-
sidy reform and other sectorwide interventions, a sharper focus on renewable
energy policy is key to creating attractive investment opportunities. The pack-
age proposed in this business plan combines sector dialogue, technical assis-
tance, and financing as part of a widening effort to move from unsolicited
bids to proactive planning and transparent, competitive tendering processes.
   Technical assistance and transaction advisory can help overcome the lack
of familiarity and institutional capacity still common with solar PV. It  can
help governments identify priority projects and address technical concerns
about variability and dispatchability. Such support can be combined with
transaction advisory services provided under the Scaling Solar initiative, a
one-stop-shop developed by the World Bank Group to support rapid, trans-
parent, and competitive tender processes. The approach integrates due dili-
gence, standardized documentation, and stapled financing in way that is
designed to maximize pool of qualified developers and minimize costs.
   Because of the high investment costs of solar PV in both grid-connected and
off-grid segments, reducing the cost of capital and providing liquidity is key to
driving down prices. International financing institutions can help by providing
working capital facilities for importers/distributors of ­quality-verified pico-PV
products and solar home systems; when relevant, grants or low-cost financ-
ing to kick-start markets and reward first movers; and stapled financing
and/or guarantees for public private partnerships for utility-scale solar PV
plants, including guarantees to mitigate off-taker payment risk.
   Implementation of the proposed approach would involve the following
activities:

••   identifying priority countries based on upstream resource mapping and
     analysis of power supply and demand trends on a case-by-case basis (the
     focus is likely to be on high-insolation regions, such as the Sahel, and
     landlocked countries that rely heavily on thermal power generation)
••   reviewing and optimizing legislative and regulatory frameworks to facili-
     tate the deployment of solar PV through both public and private entities

Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development	                    103
••     identifying priority on-grid projects, through technical studies on grid inte-
       gration and reinforcement, location analysis, and advanced control systems
••     facilitating access to working capital for solar PV companies.



Expected Outcomes
Outcomes of the fast-track phase of the proposed package include the devel-
opment of 1 GW of grid-connected solar energy projects and the provision of
5 million off-grid consumers with modern energy services by 2023. Over the
longer term (by 2026), the plan would develop 5 GW of grid-connected solar
energy projects and provide 55 million off-grid consumers with modern
energy services.



Climate-Related Benefits
Solar energy has enormous potential to mitigate climate change, with mar-
ginal abatement costs that can now reach zero (or, in some situations, create
profits). It provides an opportunity to replace kerosene, diesel, and unsustain-
able use of wood, with major health and environmental benefits.



Financing Plan
Investment required to achieve the plan’s overall targets is estimated at
$8 ­billion, including $3.2 billion in the fast-track phase (table 11.2). To achieve
the fast-track phase financing targets by 2020, resources (including partner
funding and private sector investment) will need to be identified by 2017.

                  The World Bank will continue to support the development of hydropower
                  resources through technical work, financing, policy dialogue and resource
                  mobilization. These efforts will be grounded in the development of large
                  hydropower generation capacity as well as water regulation to ensure year-
                  round production and create further downstream hydropower development

Sectoral Background and Development
Challenges
Hydropower is a clean, large-scale, and affordable source of renewable energy
that has the potential to play a major role in addressing Africa’s power supply
crisis. Hydropower currently provides 24 percent of Sub-Saharan Africa’s
power needs, and there is potential to increase this share to 40 percent over
the coming years.
  Some 50 GW of hydropower could be developed immediately, at costs of
$0.01–0.08/kWh. This prices make hydropower the lowest-cost, largest-scale
renewable energy resource currently available to the region—with potential
for transformative, growth-inducing developmental impacts.
  Hydropower is a valuable complement to other forms of renewable energy,
because it provides a base load and can store surplus generation during
off-peak periods. It contributes to mitigating climate change mitigation (by
­
reducing carbon emissions compared to thermal generation) and adaptation
(by providing storage capacity).



Initiatives to Address the Challenges and
Enhance Resilience
Cameroon has the third-largest hydropower development potential in Sub-
Saharan Africa, estimated at more than 12,000 MW, with the Sanaga River
Basin providing nearly half the untapped potential. Total installed electricity
generation capacity from all sources in Cameroon is currently only about
1,000 MW, however. Of the 6 GW hydropower potential in the Sanaga River
Basin, 4.2 GW is suitable for large-scale development.
   The estimated hydropower potential of the Konkouré River Basin, in Guinea,
is 2.4 GW—about 40 percent of the country’s 6 GW hydropower potential. Two
main projects have been implemented: the Garafiri project (75 MW), commis-
sioned in 1999, and the Kaleta project (240 MW), commissioned in  2015.

108	                  Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
Further development of the basin will require additional regulation of the river
to reduce the seasonality of flows and increase all-season capacity downstream.
   An important step in developing Cameroon’s largely unexploited hydropower
potential will be the commissioning of a regulating dam at the Lom Pangar site
in 2017. This dam will increase the guaranteed all-season hydropower capacity
on the Sanaga River by about 40 percent, immediately adding 120 MW at exist-
ing downstream hydropower plants, which will also generate electricity in the
dry season. The Lom Pangar dam will allow for further downstream develop-
ment of large-scale hydropower plants by ensuring firm all-season water flows.
   Fast-track support would help construct the 420 MW Nachtigal hydro-
power project, conduct feasibility and bankability studies, and bid out other
hydropower sites in the Sanaga Basin. The Nachtigal project is being devel-
oped by a consortium consisting of Electricité de France (EDF), IFC, the gov-
ernment of Cameroon, and Rio Tinto Alcan, at an estimated cost of $1 billion.
Nachtigal is expected to be commissioned in 2020. Support would also include
technical assistance for the development of future selected hydro sites.
   The Souapiti Dam, on the Konkouré River, in northern Guinea, is of strate-
gic importance, because it regulates the Konkouré Basin and because Souapiti
is one of the best hydropower production sites in West Africa, with potential
generation capacity of more than 500 MW. The program would focus on sup-
porting the development of the Souapiti project, which is estimated to cost
$1–$1.5 billion. The West African Power Pool (WAPP) Secretariat has com-
missioned a study to update existing feasibility studies and conduct a finan-
cial and economic assessment of the project to determine the optimum
bankable option for development under a public-private partnership (PPP)
structure. The study will include an assessment of domestic demand (includ-
ing by the mining industry) as well as the potential for export, thanks to new
regional interconnections (such as the Gambia River Development
Organization and the Côte d’Ivoire-Liberia-​         Sierra Leone and Guinea
Electricity Networks Interconnection Project [CLSG]) currently under
implementation. Environmental and social studies are also ongoing. Next
steps will include advisory services to support the structuring of a PPP and
the selection of a private developer through competitive tendering.



Expected Outcomes
Outcomes for the proposed package by 2026 include the development of
1 GW of hydropower capacity and the downstream regulation of river flows
in two of West Africa’s largest river basins for further development.



Climate-Related Benefits
Hydropower is a renewable, efficient, and reliable source of energy that does
not directly emit greenhouse gases or other air pollutants and that can be
scheduled to produce power as needed, depending on water availability.

Although it does cause indirect greenhouse gas emissions, mainly during the
construction and flooding of the reservoirs, the greenhouse gas emissions
factor (4–18 grams of CO2e per kilowatt-hour) is 36–167 times lower than
factor for electricity generation from fossil fuels.



Financing Plan
Total financing for the development of 1,000 MW of hydropower is expected
to reach $2 billion (table 12.2), including $1.2 billion for the fast-track phase.



Key Partners
Implementation for the initiatives will be carried out in close collaboration
with the governments of Cameroon and Guinea, as well as with the entities to
which power is eventually sold.

Sectoral Background and Development
Challenges
Africa has significant potential for geothermal development; East Africa
alone can potentially harness 14,000 MW of geothermal energy, but only
1.5 percent (209 MW) has been developed. Ethiopia and are already operat-
ing geothermal plants, and other countries are considering geothermal sites
for development. The high risk of exploratory drilling is a major obstacle to
the scale-up of geothermal energy; considerable upstream public investment
is required before downstream development by the private sector.



Initiatives to Address the Challenges and
Enhance Resilience
The World Bank Group has played a central role in reducing the risk and sup-
porting the development of geothermal globally. It provided $2.2 billion for
geothermal development between 1977 and 2015, by far the largest amount of
any multilateral development bank. It has provided concessional loans and
guarantees in support of geothermal exploration drilling in Djibouti, Ethiopia,
and Kenya. MIGA issued an $88.3 million guarantee to Ormat Holding Corp.
to cover a $98.1 million equity investment in OrPower 4 in Kenya.
  The Bank Group’s program for geothermal development generally includes
the following support:
••     Policy support. The Bank provides technical assistance to help client
       governments craft appropriate regulatory and institutional frameworks
       ­
       and price electricity.
••     Surface exploration. The Bank can support surface exploration to identify
       the potential for drilling.

112	                     Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
••   Mitigation of drilling risk. Through concessional finance and guarantees,
     the Bank Group mitigates the high risk of drilling for resource (steam)
     identification.
••   Engagement of commercial investment. IFC and MIGA work directly with
     the private sector to support private sector investment.
The Bank Group launched the Global Geothermal Development Plan (GGDP)
in 2013 to bring together donors and multilateral lenders to coordinate
financing for specific geothermal projects.



Expected Outcomes
Outcomes for the proposed package include the development of 500 MW of
geothermal capacity and the opening up of the geothermal sector across the
East Africa Community for further investment by 2026.



Climate-Related Benefits
Geothermal power generation does not involve fossil combustion and emits
only minimal amounts of greenhouse gas. Abatement of greenhouse gas
depends on the current and projected power mix in a country: The climate
benefit is maximized when geothermal energy displaces inefficient (and often
expensive) fossil fuel–based thermal generation (making geothermal develop-
ment particularly desirable in land-locked and resource-constrained
countries). In addition to leaving a minimal environmental footprint,
­
­geothermal power generation is highly resilient to the effects of climate change.



Financing Plan
Investment required to achieve the targeted 500 MW of geothermal capacity
development is estimated at $2.8 billion (table 13.2). The Bank can provide
diverse and unique financial solutions, including long-term concessional
financing for exploration and upstream studies, guarantee packages to miti-
gate investor risk, Scaling up Renewable Energy in Low Income Countries
Program (SREP) funding for pilot renewable energy projects, and technical
assistance. The World Bank Group can also leverage IFC competitive financ-
ing products, which can crowd in private sector investment.



Key Partners
Implementation of the initiative will be carried out in close collaboration with
the governments of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania, as well as the
private sector for downstream development. Support will also be sought
from partners in the Global Geothermal Development Plan.

Sectoral Background and Development
Challenges
Floods and droughts cause heavy losses of livelihood and life in Africa. In
2012, for example, Madagascar and Nigeria each are estimated to have lost
more than 1 percent of GDP from flooding and cyclones, with losses totaling
$8 billion. Africa is set to experience more frequent adverse weather events,
including droughts, floods, and heat waves. Accurate hydro-met data, fore-
casts, and early warnings are key to informed and timely decisions that reduce
loss of life and assets and protect development gains.
   Improved hydro-met services can help build resilience in Africa’s urban
agglomerations. If development gains are not protected against climate risks,
a vicious cycle of urban poverty, inequality, and fragility could be triggered,
retarding growth and development.
   Improving hydro-met services is integral to sustainable growth in Sub-
Saharan Africa. The services provided by NMHS are a “public good,” because
of their cross-cutting, diffuse, and non-rival benefits. The cost-benefit ratio of
investing in hydro-met services is between 1: 3 and 1: 15, according to the
World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
   Only 10 NMHS in Africa provide adequate forecast and warning services.
According to a 2014 WMO survey, 54 percent of surface stations and
    percent of upper air weather stations in Africa do not report data.

NMHS report to different ministries in different countries, and there is no
universal protocol for data and information sharing. Lack of investment in
human capital has reduced capacity. The challenge is to invest in new systems,
train people to operate them, sustain operations and maintenance regimes,
and generate information that meets end-users’ needs.
   Funding is insufficient and fragmented—and too little of it goes to the sys-
tem architecture and sustainability aspects of NMHS; meeting operations and
maintenance costs remains a challenge (World Bank 2013). A comprehensive
approach to strengthening hydro-met with equal emphasis on infrastructure,
capacity, and policy is wanting. Coordination, sustainability, and last-mile
connectivity are major challenges. The financing and scope of modernization
must be substantial and adopt a systems approach in order to be transforma-
tive. Last-mile service, which should include impact-based forecast and
warning services, is key for realizing climate resilience benefits for both citi-
zens and core government ministries (WMO 2015). Governments need new
capabilities in operations and maintenance, technology, human resources,
and policy, which will require larger operating budgets.



Initiatives to Address the Challenges and
Enhance Resilience
Several development partners are providing technical assistance to hydro-met
services. National meteorological services from many countries have been
providing support to African counterparts, often coupled with bilateral aid.
  ClimDev-Africa—a joint initiative of the African Development Bank, the
African Union Commission, and the United Nations Economic Commission
for Africa (UNECA)—was set up in 2009 to improve weather and climate ser-
vices in Africa. It aims to fill information gaps and improve the analytical base
for informing weather and climate policies, build observational infrastructure
across Africa, support climate resilience and low-carbon development, and
understand the economic impacts of climate change. Its main focus is on
regional organizations; national-level investments are small (usually less than
$2 million). The World Bank has supported strengthening NMHS in Africa
through programs on agriculture, water resources management, and early
warning systems. The Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) is an
opportunity to scale up systematic investments in three countries (Mozambique,
Niger, and Zambia). Large-scale watershed management and basin-wide pro-
grams in Malawi and Nigeria provide opportunities for systemwide support.
  The Integrated African Strategy on Meteorology for 2013–2017—­developed
by the African Union Conference of Ministers Responsible for Meteorology
(AMCOMET), in collaboration with the WMO, the African Union
Commission, member states, and others—highlights the challenges posed by
weather-related hazards to economic development. The strategy calls for
regional cooperation and the upgrading of observation networks; increases in
the capacity to receive, share, and transmit observed data; more timely and
accurate weather and climate forecasts and warning services; and improved

decision support tools. It does not quantify the investment needs for the mod-
ernization of hydro-met services at the national and regional levels.
  Investment needs for systemwide modernization of hydro-met services in
Africa are substantial: A conservative estimate of high priority investments
in all developing countries is $1.5–$2 billion (World Bank 2013b), with more
than half of investment needs in Africa. A 2012 regional assessment by the
Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) calls for investing
$120  million in SADC countries. Its estimate of needs, particularly for
capacity building, training, and implementation support, are conservative.
  In June 2015, the World Bank, the WMO, and the African Development
Bank launched the Africa Hydro-Met Program: Strengthening Climate and
Disaster Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, which aims to strengthen 15
NHMS and 4 regional centers in its initial phase, at a cost of $600 million. The
program is designed as an inclusive framework program to modernize NMHS
and their regional affiliates. It offers a collaborative platform for development
partners to collaborate and scale up their support while keeping African gov-
ernments in the lead. Its objective is to strengthen the ability of NMHS in
Africa to provide timely, accurate, and actionable weather, climate, and
hydrological forecasts and warnings and to contribute to climate resilience,
economic development, and disaster risk management. The program seeks to
leverage partnerships and foster interagency coordination. It is aligned with
the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) and the Integrated
African Strategy on Meteorology. It champions better hydro-met services as a
public good and calls for scaling up investment financing from development
partners and operational financing from host governments.
  The program includes three main components:
••     strengthening NMHS, including by improving their ability to deliver
       service, building their capacity, and promoting policy and institutional
       ­
       reforms
••     modernizing regional centers, including by fostering cooperation with
       national institutions
••     integrating national, regional, and global systems and knowledge and
       advisory services.


Expected Outcomes
Expected outcomes include the following:
••     timely and reliable forecasts at the local, regional, and national levels
••     improved delivery of weather, climate, and hydrological services
••     better international collaboration, including on early warnings.
By the COP21 meeting, impact-based forecasting will have been introduced
in Mozambique; the modernization program for the Ethiopian National
Meteorological agency and the Hydrology and Water Quality Directorate will
have been prepared; and ongoing works in Kenya, Malawi, Uganda, and
Zambia under the PPCR will be proceeding.

120	                    Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
   Within two to three years after COP21, technical assistance and moderni-
zation activities will commence for NMHS in 10 countries and 2 regional
centers; first benefits from impact-based forecasts will be realized in
Mozambique; and up to 10 NMHS will have improved access to global prod-
ucts and services, subject to resource availability. Within two to four years
after COP21, modernization programs will be in effect in 15 countries and
4 regional centers, with anticipated completion by 2023, subject to resource
availability.



Climate-Related Benefits
Key sectors—including agriculture, energy, water, health, and transport—
directly benefit from hydro-met services. Agriculture, which is largely rainfed
in Africa, accounts for 60 percent of employment and 40 percent of exports.
The Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Program (CAADP),
first endorsed by African governments in 2003, stresses improved water man-
agement and climate-smart agriculture, both of which depend on good and
timely hydro-met information. Energy is key to poverty reduction and eco-
nomic development. Hydro-power, a substantial current source of energy
in  Sub-Saharan Africa today, also depends on hydro-met data for optimal
performance.
   A 2010 World Bank study highlights the economic costs of lack of electric-
ity and argues for a renewed emphasis on hydroelectricity. Efficient water
resources management would bring multiple benefits, ranging from irrigated
agriculture, hydroelectricity, water supply, watershed management, to erosion
control, and so forth. Transport and connectivity boost growth. Only a third
of Africa’s rural inhabitants live within 2 kilometers of all-weather roads.
Africa has 60 percent of the world’s malaria cases and 80 percent of its deaths.
Effective hydro-met services and data support effective planning of targeted
interventions aimed at improvements in all these sectors.
   The proposed activities would yield direct benefits for the citizens of all
participating countries by improving their climate resilience. In addition
to  providing weather, climate, and hydrological forecasts and warnings,
NMHS are also expected to inform climate adaptation and mitigation
activities.
   Phase I of the hydro-met program would benefit more than 100 million
people in 15 Sub-Saharan African countries and 4 regional organizations by
building the technical, human, and financial capacity for providing forecasts
and warnings, in order to enhance resilience to climate and disaster risks and
augment the capacity to adapt to climate variability and change. Major cli-
mate resilience benefits would include the reduction of climate and disaster
risks and impacts; improved disaster preparedness; enhanced resilience of
social and productive infrastructure, resulting in improved public health,
food security, nutrition, water management, energy security, transport and
communications, trade and competitiveness, employment generation, gover-
nance, and state-building.

Key Partners
The main partners will be national governments and regional organizations
in Sub-Saharan Africa, including the African Union Commission and the
regional economic communities. The World Bank, the WMO, and the African
Development Bank will proactively seek the strategic partnership of interna-
tional, regional, and bilateral development partners and technical institu-
tions, including hydro-met agencies. They will also reach out to civil society,
the private sector, and academia, in Sub-Saharan Africa and globally, to build
a world-class network of knowledge, solutions, and resources.
   Financing partnerships for the program will leverage resources from the
World Bank and the African Development Bank (including the ClimDev ini-
tiative), soft financing from multilateral and bilateral development partners,
and climate financing funds. The possibility of establishing a new multidonor
trust fund will be explored in order to maximize the synergy and collabora-
tion of all partners.

Sectoral Background and Development
Challenges
Proper integration of climate change in the planning and design of infrastruc-
ture investments can significantly reduce the risk posed by climate to the
physical and economic performance of hydropower and irrigation invest-
ments, according to Enhancing the Climate Resilience of Africa’s Infrastructure
(ECRAI), conducted by the World Bank in collaboration with UNECA
(Cervigni and others 2015). The study emphasizes the importance of identi-
fying adaptation solutions that balance the risk of inaction (ignoring climate
change) against the risk of wrong action (that is, ignoring the uncertainty
surrounding future climate outcomes and committing to a single climate
scenario).
  Integration of climate risks in the planning of climate-sensitive invest-
ments requires a change in mindset toward an integrated framework
approach that brings together climate information, climate impact assess-
ment, and decision making for investment. Such a paradigm shift requires
credible climate information used with appropriate modeling tools,

124	                   Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development
supported by dedicated institutions to better inform policy and develop-
ment planning.


Initiatives to Address the Challenges and
Enhance Resilience
The Africa Climate-Resilient Development Facility is intended to facilitate
this paradigm shift. It would take the results and methods developed in
Enhancing the Climate Resilience of Africa’s Infrastructure forward and enable
their application to scale in Africa. The objective of the initiative would be to
strengthen the capacity of African institutions (including national govern-
ments, river basin organizations, regional economic communities, and power
pools) to plan, design, and implement investments in selected sectors, in
order to increase their resilience to climate change. An Africa-based center of
technical competence and excellence would help governments, planners, and
developers in Africa integrate climate change in project planning and design.
It would attract climate finance from the Green Climate Fund and other
sources.
   To quickly gain high-level political acceptance, the core of the facility
would be anchored at the Africa Climate Policy Center in Addis Ababa,
which operates under the umbrella of the ClimDev-Africa program. Certain
activities would be undertaken in collaboration with, or outsourced to,
a small number of regional centers of excellence in western, eastern, central,
and southern Africa. The facility would operate through a small number of
full-time experts and a roster of external consultants to be mobilized on a
task-specific basis.
   The facility would be set up over a period of about 9–12 months. During
this phase, a detailed business plan would be crafted, a core team recruited,
a roster of external experts created, and the partner regional centers of excel-
lence selected. Initial reach-out, liaison, and coordination with key organiza-
tions in climate change resilience in Africa would also take place.
   Once operational, the facility would carry out its activities in a sequenced
way, including a pilot stage of 18 months and a consolidation stage of
24  months and beyond. Activities to be carried out would include the
following:
••   Creation of an open data and knowledge platform of key data and refer-
     ence material that project developers need in order to incorporate climate
     risk into project design and execution of corresponding data clearing-
     house functions.
••   Development of guidelines at the policy, sector, and project levels inte-
     grating climate risks in key climate sensitive sectors (water, energy,
     transport). These guidelines would take into account the challenges spe-
     ­
     cific to Africa in terms of climate data and climate change projections for
     the continent.
••   Provision of on-demand advisory services to project developers, includ-
     ing on preparation of terms of references for prefeasibility and feasibility

Accelerating Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development	                   125
       studies and review and quality assurance of technical reports from
       consultants.
••     Preparation of reports on innovative options to support adaptation to cli-
       mate change in project planning or design. Examples of this incubator
       function include (a) assessment of the use of insurance instruments as an
       additional modality to mitigate the risk that climate-sensitive infrastruc-
       ture may not always be able to generate intended benefits (in the hydro-
       power and irrigation subsectors, for instance) and (b) exploration of the
       role of adaptive management in the design of infrastructure projects,
       whereby instead of committing upfront to a single design option, project
       developers could choose to adapt the design over time in response to new
       information on the significance of climate risks.
••     Organization of awareness and training courses in targeted countries in
       Africa on methods for climate resilient investment planning and design
       (including those tested in the ECRAI analysis). The focus would be on
       how to integrate climate risk analysis in the project cycle of long-lived
       investments (in energy and transportation, for example). In energy, the
       process would involve starting from the upstream stages of planning at
       the river basin and power-pool levels and drawing on prefeasibility stud-
       ies of individual investments. Training would reach different levels of
       ­policy makers and practitioners, from regional economic communities to
        country ministries and river basin organizations.
••      Convening of seminars and conferences to share and disseminate
        knowledge.
During the start-up/design phase, the possibility will be explored of combin-
ing the technical/advisory services on climate-smart investment planning
and design with financial assistance to cover the additional costs the project
designer may incur to include climate vulnerability and climate resilience
assessments in feasibility studies and other preparation activities. The pro-
posed facility would focus on technical services but might facilitate access
to  financing through other channels (such as the World Bank Global
Infrastructure Facility [GIF]).



Expected Outcomes
Results indicators include the following:
••     technical guidelines for investment planning and design under climate
       uncertainty developed, reviewed by peer reviewers and stakeholders, and
       adopted by project developers
••     open data and knowledge platform for use in climate-resilient project
       design made available on-line and hosted and maintained by African
       organizations
••     capacity of project developers in the use of methodologies for managing
       climate risks in the planning and design of projects in selected sectors
       strengthened

                   These outputs would strengthen the capacity of African organizations to plan
                   and design investment projects in a climate-resilient way.



                   Climate-Related Benefits
                   To exemplify the kind of climate-related benefits, it is useful to refer to the
                   ECRAI study. It finds that under drying climate scenarios, failure to integrate
                   climate change in the planning and design of power and water infrastructure
                   could entail losses of hydropower revenues of 5–60 percent (depending on
                   the basin). It also finds that consumer expenditure for energy could increase
                   by up to three times the baseline values. Under wet climate scenarios, busi-
                   ness-as-usual infrastructure development could lead to forgone revenues of
                   15–130 percent of the baseline (assuming that greater precipitation is not
                   used to expand the production of hydropower).
                      By strengthening the capacity of African institutions to integrate
                   climate  change in project planning and design, the proposed initiative
                   ­
                   would reduce the risk of suboptimal performance of long-lived
                   investments. Doing so would increase the resilience not only of the proj-
                   ­
                   ects analyzed but also of the communities and countries that depend on
                   the  services delivered by those projects for their social and economic
                   development.

Key Partners
The Africa Union Commission (through the Commissioner for Infrastructure
and Energy) and UNECA asked the World Bank to team with them to estab-
lish the facility. It is envisaged that the partnership will be broadened to
include other organizations, including regional economic communities,
river basin organizations, power pools, and regional climate centers. Within
the financing community, the NDF has expressed interest in supporting the
initiative; discussions are underway with AFD, DFID, the European Union,
and GIZ.

Making It Happen
The Africa Climate Business Plan envisages mobilizing and deploying some
$16 billion of fast-track financing and $21 billion in longer-term support.
This part of the business plan outlines the financing plan, presents the results
framework, and describes the organizational arrangements that would allow
the World Bank and its many partners to implement the plan.

Financing Plan
The financing plan estimates the resources required to implement the Africa
Climate Business Plan (in both the fast-track and longer-term phases, table 16.1)
and identifies possible sources of funding for the fast-track phase (table 16.2).
The activities included in the plan are “in the pipeline”: they have not yet been
approved by the governing bodies of the financiers (although in several cases
project preparation is nearing completion).
   The following caveats and clarifications are in order with respect to possible
financing sources:
••   International Development Association (IDA): IDA is the part of the
     World Bank Group that helps the world’s poorest countries by providing
     highly concessional loans (called “credits”) and grants for programs that
     boost economic growth, reduce inequalities, and improve people’s living
     conditions. IDA resources included in this business plan represent

     ­ stimates by Bank staff (based on historical trends, project pipelines,
     e
     and ongoing dialogue with governments in client countries) of IDA
     funding needs that could contribute to the plan’s financing. In several
     cases these resources could be part of larger envelopes of IDA financing
     (envelopes that include the financing of other development activities
     related to those included in the plan but of which only the part included
     in the plan will generate co-benefits in terms of climate adaptation or
     low-carbon development).
        Resource mobilization for the fast-track part of the plan spans two IDA
     cycles: IDA17 (which ends June 30, 2017) and IDA18 (which will run
     from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2020). Activities that would start in the
     earlier years of the plan would be considered for financing under IDA17;
     ­
     estimates of financing in the outer years of the plan refer to activities to be
     considered for support by IDA18 and are more tentative. The plan is fully
     consistent with the recently announced World Bank Group goal to
     increase the share of financing with climate co-benefits by one-third by
     2020. That increase will be achieved through better integration of climate
     considerations into project planning and design. The additional technical
     work during project preparation needed to achieve such integration could
     be co-financed by dedicated resources mobilized by donors and
     partners.

     instruments, including the Climate Investment Funds (in particular the
     Forest Investment Program [FIP]), the Global Environment Facility
     (GEF), the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (including both the readi-
     ness and the carbon finance mechanisms), the Green Climate Fund
     (GCF), and other initiatives, such as the Central African Forest Initiative
     (CAFI). Estimates are based on consultations with staff of each financing
     institution (on eligibility, strategic fit, and so forth). Some GCF projects
     (such as the hydro-met project) have already been submitted to the GCF
     Secretariat; others are in preparation.
••   Other development finance (bilateral and multilateral institutions): Figures
     included in this category are based on technical consultations with the
     staffs of a variety of financing partners of the World Bank, including the
     AfDB, the West African Development Bank (BOAD), and ­             bilateral part-
     ners (including AFD, DFID, GIZ, and NDF). These consultations range
     from preliminary to advanced, but in general there is a r    ­ easonable expec-
     tation that a substantial portion of the funding identified will materialize.
••   Private sector: Estimates of private sector financing reflect the potential
     of projects to generate streams of revenues adequate to remunerate
     ­
     private  investors. Private sector participation is expected mainly in the
     energy sector and to some extent in agriculture.
••   Domestic sources: Estimates of domestic financing are based on the
     record of government counterpart financing across World Bank projects.
••   To be determined: “To be determined” is an estimate of the residual gap
     that needs to be filled in order to fully finance the projects included in

       the plan. It is expected that this document will serve as a platform to
       help close this gap, by mobilizing additional interest and support
       from  both existing and new partners with an interest in promoting
       ­climate-resilient, low-carbon development in Africa (such as China and
        the Arab funds).

                   Results Framework
                   The Africa Climate Business Plan is expected to mobilize resources and
                   increase resilience to climate variability and change (table 17.1). The plan’s
                   contribution to resource mobilization will be measured by two indicators.
                   The first is the share of resources mobilized at various stages of implementa-
                   tion. The targets are for 25 percent of funding to be mobilized by June 2017
                   (end of IDA17), 50 percent by December 2018 (mid-term of IDA18), and
                   75 percent by June 2020 (end of IDA18).
                      The plan is also expected to have catalytic/leveraging effect on climate
                   finance for Africa beyond the activities included in the plan, which do not
                   exhaust the universe of development activities with climate co-benefits.
                   The plan could help promote the uptake of initiatives beyond the sectors or
                   geographical areas included in the plan, through positive spillover or imita-
                   tion effects. A second indicator of resource mobilization is therefore the
                   share of IDA commitments to Sub-Saharan Africa with climate co-benefits,
                   an indicator the World Bank has been monitoring since 2011. The target is to
                   increase this share from a baseline of 17 percent (the average across all sec-
                   tors for FY11–FY15) to 22 percent over the period FY16–FY20. The increase
                   would help the World Bank Group meet its recent commitment to increase
                   climate finance.

  The second area of the results framework is the increase in Africa’s resil-
ience to climate variability and change. A wide range of outcome indicators
has been proposed for each of the plan’s components. The proposed aggre-
gate target is for at least 75 percent of these indicators to be met by June 2023
(the end of IDA19). The lower-than-100 percent target reflects the fact that
the goals of the Africa Climate Business Plan are ambitious.

              Organizational Arrangements
              Two levels of organizational arrangements are proposed for rolling out the
              plan. At the external level, to ensure an adequate framework for successful
              implementation of the plan, the Bank will continue to systematically inte-
              grate climate change considerations into country and sector dialogue, in
              accordance with commitments made as part of the IDA17 replenishment.
              This effort includes addressing climate change in Systematic Country
              Diagnostics (SCDs) and integrating climate considerations in Country
              Partnership Framework (CPFs) the main components in the Bank’s new
              approach to country engagement (box 18.1). These processes will also help
              identify the instruments that could best achieve the results envisaged by the
              plan (policy lending, investment lending, technical assistance, programs for
              results, guarantees, and so forth).
                To nurture and expand partnerships for implementing the plan, the Bank
              will convene working-level meetings with organizations collaborating on
              ­
              specific components on an as-needed basis. It could also organize high-level
              conferences with a wide range of stakeholders. The first such meeting could
              take place in the early stages of implementation, in order to spur efforts on
              both fundraising and action on the ground. The second could take place
              toward the end of the implementation period (in late 2018, for example). It
              would be aimed at considering prospects for extending/scaling up the plan in
              order to achieve its longer-term goals.
                Briefing during the World Bank Annual and Spring Meetings would be
              organized on an as-needed basis. A dedicated page on the website of the
              World Bank Africa Region will be created and maintained to ensure broad
              dissemination of work carried out under the plan.




Box 18.1  The World Bank Group’s Approach to Country
Engagement
In 2014 the World Bank Group adopted a new approach to country engagement. Known as the
Country Partnership Framework (CPF), the new approach aims to make the country-driven
model more systematic, evidence based, selective, and focused on the goals of ending extreme
poverty and increasing shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. It guides the Bank Group’s
support to each member country.

A Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) informs each new country partnership. The diagnos-
tic identifies the most important challenges and opportunities at the country level for reaching
the corporate goals. Consultations with a range of stakeholders informs the SCD process, from
diagnostic through completion.

   Within the Bank, implementation of each component of the plan will be led
by a Global Practices (GP) collaborating with other units within the Bank as
needed (table 18.1). Adequate resources will be secured through the annual
Work Program Agreement process, based on consultation and dialogue
among the GPs and the relevant Country Management Units.
   To facilitate the monitoring of progress, a small technical team, led by the
Regional Coordinator for Climate Change and working under the oversight
of the Practice Manager for Environment and Natural Resources, will work
with the GP teams to prepare semiannual progress reports on implementa-
tion. The Senior Regional Advisor for Africa will convene semiannual
meetings of the GP Senior Directors to review implementation reports;
provide strategic ­  direction to the technical work; discuss partnerships,
external outreach, and dissemination; and provide inputs to the IDA17
completion report and the IDA18 midterm report. If necessary, there could
also be periodic meetings at the level of Practice Managers, chaired by the
Senior Regional Advisor, to review progress and ensure synergies across
GPs in implementation of the plan.
