        Key POINTS

        •	 Global momentum around emerging evidence of the linkages between water,
            sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and undernutrition, and high-level policy
            dialogue advocating for nutrition-sensitive WASH, has created a “window
            of opportunity” to influence how the World Bank Group approaches lending
            for WASH projects, and how policies are designed for greater impact on
            nutrition.
        •	 Achieving nearly universal coverage of the most effective nutrition interventions
            in high burden countries would only reduce stunting by 20 percent globally,
            suggesting a critical role for nutrition-sensitive interventions such as WASH
            to address the remaining burden.
        •	 Increased use of geographic and demographic targeting of WASH projects
            can help reach populations where water and sanitation coverage is low and
            undernutrition is high.
        •	 Incorporating state-of-the-art behavior change methods and insights from
            behavioral economics into World Bank Group operations in the WASH
            sector, and documenting behavioral outcomes, can provide plausible
            evidence of impact on nutrition.
        •	 Institutional levers can be used to align incentives of task teams and
            senior management toward multisectoral approaches, while results-based
            incentives can align objectives at the project level.
        •	 WASH interventions can increase nutritional impact by measuring and
            monitoring outcomes beyond access to services, such as usage,
            maintenance of infrastructure, and behavioral change.




Undernutrition is estimated to cause 45 percent of all child deaths (Black
et al. 2013), and is responsible for 11 percent of the global disease burden (Black
et al. 2008). It results in productivity losses1 to individuals estimated at more
than 10 percent of lifetime earnings, and gross domestic product (GDP) losses as
high as 2 to 3 percent. Reducing undernutrition is at the core of the World Bank
Group (WBG) mission to end poverty. However, nutrition interventions are not
sufficient to tackle the problem of undernutrition: even at 90 percent coverage
the core set of proven nutrition interventions in high nutrition burden countries
would only decrease stunting by 20 percent globally.

    Inadequate dietary intake and disease are directly                                Multisectoral Approaches (Alderman et al. 2013). The report

    of access to clean water and sanitation, and poor hygiene                         and community implementers responsible for the design

    spanning multiple sectors of agriculture, social protection,                      to mainstream nutrition activities into multisectoral action

    Children who are stunted (having low height-for-age) suffer                       in the report as a key sector for maximizing nutritional

    school attendance, reduced human capital attainment, and                          cost-effectively; and the nutrition perspective, on how

    The objective of this paper is to support task teams              The solution is not as straightforward as including nutrition
    and senior management to integrate WASH into                      in project development objectives (PDOs), for which task

    development programs), and to make WASH interventions             into WASH projects, while at the same time avoiding
    more nutrition-sensitive, and thus more impactful on              unnecessary complexities, to ensure that the contribution

           nutrition through meaningful outcome indicators,
           such as infrastructure quality, usage (behavior), and
           maintenance

    The role of WASH, in particular, in improving nutritional
    outcomes has received greater attention in recent years. The
    attention has centered on a hypothesis that environmental
    enteropathy may be a key cause of chronic child
    undernutrition, and the primary pathway linking poor
    WASH to poor nutrition outcomes, rather than through
    diarrhea. A burgeoning body of evidence is finding strong
    linkages between poor sanitation, and open defecation in
    particular, and stunting. Finally, the strong association
    between income poverty, child stunting, and lack of access
    to water supply and sanitation highlights the critical need
    for interventions that will benefit this target group and
    increase prosperity among the bottom 40 percent.

    Despite global momentum around this emerging evidence
    and high-level policy dialogue advocating for nutrition-
    sensitive WASH, practical guidelines on how to work cross-
    sectorally are currently lacking. This is particularly the case
    for WBG lending operations, which focus to a large extent
    on infrastructure investments, rather than the “softer” side
    of WASH, which includes behavioral change. To achieve
    greater impact, approaches to integration need to go beyond
    the traditional realms of handwashing with soap and safe          Woman and children washing hands, Indonesia. Photo: Ray

IV.                         World Bank Group’s Water Program

Although WASH interventions supported by World Bank
Group projects may contribute to improved health and
nutrition outcomes, nutritional outcomes are perceived
as too far down the causal chain to be adopted as project
development objectives.

The 1993 Water Resources Management Strategy was the first
in the World Bank Group to recognize the health benefits of
water supply and sanitation (World Bank 1993). In 2004, the
Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Board developed a sector
program to guide WBG lending and nonlending technical
assistance, which recognized improving health outcomes as
one of five cross-cutting operational, policy, and institutional
priorities requiring investment in WASH infrastructure as well
as behavioral change and a focus on the poor as an institutional
priority (World Bank 2004). The program adopted a three-
pronged strategy to realize health benefits of improved WASH:
(i) access to sufficient quantities of water, (ii) sanitary disposal
of excreta, and (iii) sound hygiene practices.

Over the past decade, a handful of water supply, sanitation,
and hygiene projects supported by the World Bank Group
have explicitly targeted nutrition. A portfolio review
conducted for this paper examined whether and how WBG
water supply, sanitation, and hygiene projects incorporate
health and nutrition objectives, activities, and outcomes.
The review included all water supply (WC), sanitation
(WA), and general water and sanitation (WZ) approved                                            This new latrine was built by a local sanitation entrepreneur

     safety nets, home gardens and small livestock production, and targeted emergency food aid.
