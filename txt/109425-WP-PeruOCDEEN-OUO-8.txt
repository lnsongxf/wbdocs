What is the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development - OECD?
The OECD is an intergovernmental organization that provides a forum for debating public policy designs and promote
coordinated initiatives among its members through shared standards that assure its members’ long term development. It was
founded in 1961 and presently has 35 member states.
Its mission is to promote policies that improve the economic and social wellbeing of people around the world.
OECD works together with member states to support their reform processes in four major areas.

Why work with the OECD?
  • Peru wants to adopt the best governance practices and standards of OECD nations to build stronger institutions and so
    guarantee its long term development, narrow the inequality gaps and strengthen its development.
  • This is an opportunity to share government management and public policy experiences and good practices, and on their
    implementation.
  • OECD cooperates and discusses issues with stakeholders in each nation and makes independent recommendations.
  • It provides a seal of recognition to improved public policy design thus contributing to creating a better business climate
    and confidence for new investments.
  • It helps to consolidate sector reforms to foster long term growth , and helps in identifying potential barriers to
    accomplishing such goals.
  • It allows to constantly assess the country’s performance, and thereby build credibility in its long term development
     outcomes.

How is Peru’s relationship with the OECD structured?
First approach: participation in key bodies and adherence to instruments
Peru’s participation in the OECD dates back to 1998 with a focus on investments.
Before submitting its formal request to join the Organization and implement a Country Program, Peru approached certain OECD
subsidiary bodies from which it had received ad hoc invitations to participate, and gradually became increasingly active in them.
They are the following:
   Investments Committee (since 2008),
   Development Center (since 2009),
   Competition Committee (since 2011),
   Consumer Policy Committee (since 2012),
   Working Group on Bribery in International Business Transactions (since 2014).
   In October 2014 during negotiations of its Country Program, Peru joined the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange
     of Information for Fiscal Purposes (GFTEI).

Country Program 2015-2016
The Country Program is a structured mechanism of joint cooperation created by the OECD to support emerging and dynamic
economies like Peru’s in designing their reforms and strengthen their public policies.
Peru’s participation in the Country Program is the result of its interest in designing good practices like those of other member
countries, and the OECD’s interest in expanding its relations with a country that has made significant strides in the last 20 years,
in particular regarding economic issues.
It operates as a tool to contribute to the country’s development agenda by fostering measures to increase national productivity,
since it:
   • catalyzes the changes needed in national policies to enhance the country’s productivity;
   • allows to improve the quality of public policies and citizen services provided by government;
   • supports institution building and provides continuity to proposed reforms;
   • creates a space for dialogue and dissemination of the country’s progress and other priority policy issues;
   • provides a tool for learning from other OECD member countries’ experience;
   • leverages relations among governments.

 • The OECD Regional Program for Latin America was launched on 1 June, 2016, at the OECD Ministers’ Council Meeting in
   Paris, France. The program’s objective is to support the region in advancing its reform agenda.
 • A natural step in the evolving strengthening relations with OECD was to obtain the co-chair of the Program, together with
   Chile. This will allow Peru to contribute to the region as a whole its experience of recent years in economic growth and
   social development, as well as its experience from its work together with OECD within its Country Program.
 • The areas that will provide the foundation to start such experience sharing among regional experts and OECD within this
   Program are increased productivity, enhanced social inclusion, and institutional strengthening. Work in this priority areas
   will allow to identify the best public policy strategies and instruments to create efficient and diversified economies that
   will be better integrated to global value chains.


Aspiration to join the Organization:
 • Peru aspires to become a full member of the Organization before 2021.

  What does it mean for Peru to join OECD?

 • Joining OECD presupposes turning the reform process into an ongoing process through permanent review and idea
   sharing mechanisms focusing on public policy and government practices.
 • It will allow Peru to play a more active participatory role in preparing new solutions to global problems. OECD is not just
   a “think tank” but a “do tank” where new international standards and instruments are created, and Peru can contribute
   to it.
 • It will allow to shorten the learning curve to development, train its public officials on a permanent basis, and prevent
   policy erosion resulting from policies that had contradictory or no effect in other countries. There are no recipes. Only
   experiences. Technical work may help in leveraging reforms in Peru.
 • It will strengthen the framework of values we share with OECD member countries, including democracy, respect for
   human rights and the rule of law, and the market economy. OECD has as its objective to consolidate economic growth
   and stability, which is the foundation for the social reforms needed to accomplish greater social wellbeing. In addition, it
   interacts with large international business and labor networks.
 • Participation in various OECD instances and adopting the Organization’s standards will allow to gain gradual certification
   for different areas of government administration.


Institutional framework of Peru’s relation with the OECD
 • Actions to establish Peru’s relations with OECD, including the Country Program and the Regional Program for Latin
   America and the Caribbean, are coordinated by the Peru OECD Commission created by Supreme Decree 086 2015 PCM.
   The Commission is presided by the Cabinet Chief Office, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Economy and
   Finance. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in charge of the Technical Secretariat.
 • The above mentioned Supreme Decree declares the actions, activities and initiatives undertaken within the process to
   establish the relationship between Peru and OECD are a matter of national interest.
 • Action leaders have been appointed in various ministries to closely coordinate efforts with the Peru OECD Commission so
   as to honor all the commitments made by Peru as part of the Country Program.
