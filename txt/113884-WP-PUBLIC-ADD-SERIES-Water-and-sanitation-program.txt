 Relative poverty refers to living standards that are lower than those of other people in the population. For example, poverty could be defined as being one
of the poorest 20 percent of people in the population or, in other words, having material living standards that are lower than 80 percent of the people in the
population. The wealth index is one way of determining relative poverty. Other definitions of poverty are based on ownership of assets and the characteristics
of the person’s household. For example, someone with a piped water supply and car would be wealthier than someone who has to retrieve water from a river
and does not own a car (Rutstein & Johnston 2004).

   Reasons for Not Treating Water

   purchasing power, results clearly indicate that lack of                bills while 10 percent pay occasionally. A large majority

   that do not treat drinking water cited several reasons, notable        awareness and knowledge on safe drinking water
   among these were:
       •	 Running water is already safe; and                              However, it is interesting to note that a large majority
       •	 It is too expensive to treat water.                             of households across all quintiles are willing to pay for

   About 88 percent of households in the lowest quintiles                 households give high importance to safe and improved water
   and 24 percent in the highest quintiles lack knowledge and             for household consumption purposes.
