Foreword

The World Bank Group (WBG) aims to end extreme poverty and boost shared
prosperity in a sustainable manner. The thoughtful management of the world’s
remaining forests and trees is critical to achieving these goals.
   As the world warms and its population grows, forests and trees stand at the
intersection of many decisive challenges: sustaining agriculture; reducing the
impact of droughts, floods, and storms; regulating water and climate; storing
carbon; protecting infrastructure; providing timber, paper, and energy; and
housing critical biodiversity. Forests are also where some of the world’s most
vulnerable ­  people live. Actions taken to enhance the governance and sustain-
able management of forests contribute directly to developing economic
opportunities for the poorest.
   Forests are however under significant threat. Increasing demands for food,
fiber, fuel, and minerals often drive large-scale land use changes at the cost of
forest and tree cover. Unless these competing land uses are understood and
comprehensively managed, forest loss will translate into economic and social
losses and severe environmental degradation: When forests are cleared,
carbon emissions accelerate, plants and animals vanish, and soil erosion
threatens agriculture and infrastructure. Rising temperatures and increas-
ingly unpredictable precipitation patterns pose an additional threat to the sta-
bility of forests already affected by disease and more frequent fires.
   At the WBG, we recognize the importance of forests to sustainable and
inclusive development, and support renewed public and private sector efforts
to address the global forest challenge.
   The Forest Action Plan FY16–20 aims to integrate the sustainable
management of forests more fully into the development mosaic and define
­
priorities for the WBG for the next five years. It builds on the Forest Strategy
of 2002 and identifies two focus areas of engagement: sustainable forestry,
where we aim to have investments contributing to the sustainable manage-
ment of forests and value chains, and forest-smart interventions, where we
aim to ensure that our work in other sectors does not come at the expense of
forest capital, while also strengthening the foundations for positive forest
outcomes.
   The Forest Action Plan is part of an encouraging trend. Globally, govern-
ments and citizens, utilities, and private companies are increasingly aware of
the impacts of forest loss on their economies, carbon footprint, resilience,
productivity, and supply chains—and are showing greater willingness to
change business as usual. Building on inputs received from various stake-
holders, the Forest Action Plan defines the WBG’s contribution to the global
forest agenda.
   Several recent international processes and partnerships have led to an
unprecedented engagement of public and private actors in support of reduc-
ing deforestation and forest degradation, restoring degraded land, and
increasing forest cover. The Bonn Challenge, launched in 2011, proposes to

World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20	                                  vii
restore 150 million hectares of the world’s deforested and degraded lands by
2020; the Tropical Forest Alliance, a global public-private partnership founded
in 2012, encourages partners to reduce tropical deforestation in the sourcing
of commodities such as palm oil, soy, beef, and pulp and paper; and the 2014
New York Declaration on Forests issued a widely backed call to cut natural
forest loss in half by 2020 and end it by 2030. Forests feature prominently in
the Sustainable Development Goals, which were universally endorsed in
2015—Goal 15, in particular, aims to conserve and restore terrestrial ecosys-
tems through actions that include halting deforestation and restoring
degraded forests. The Paris Agreement on climate change strongly encour-
ages parties to take action and support activities that reduce emissions from
deforestation and forest degradation through results-based payments and
other sustainable forest management approaches; and more than 90 countries
identified the need to address forest and land use changes in their Nationally
Determined Contributions to address climate change.
   The Forest Action Plan FY16–20 will guide our engagement as we partner
with the public and private sectors to make these aspirations a reality.

Executive Summary

The Forest Action Plan FY16–20 (FAP) confirms the aim of the World Bank
Group (WBG) to strengthen the role of forests in achieving the WBG’s goals
of ending extreme poverty and increasing shared prosperity in a sustainable
manner by 2030. The FAP seeks to support countries that are willing to embed
forests in their development priorities, by focusing more deliberately on the
positive contributions that forests make to the poverty reduction, food secu-
rity, economic development, and climate action agenda. The FAP comes at a
time of stepped up forest ambitions in key d       ­ ocuments, ranging from the
Sustainable Development Goals, to the Paris Agreement under the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which highlights the
key contribution of forests to the climate challenge.
   The FAP builds on the 2002 WBG strategy, Sustaining Forests: A Development
Strategy, which continues to provide the overall framework for WBG engage-
ment in forests, as well as a detailed analysis of the emerging demands coming
from client countries. The FAP follows a review of the implementation of the
Forest Strategy that was conducted by the Independent Evaluation Group
(IEG) in 2012–13,1 and a proposal by WBG management, endorsed by the
Committee on Development Effectiveness, to prepare a Forest Action Plan
that would address some of the weaknesses identified in the IEG review.
   The FAP articulates the WBG’s value proposition on forests for the next five
years and identifies key action areas for WBG engagement. It brings together
new knowledge, technology, and capacity for collaboration across sectors for
renewed impact through sustainable forestry investments and forest-smart
operations outside the forest sector. Through the implementation of the FAP,
which is in line with the Climate Change Action Plan, the WBG will aim to
support client countries’ efforts to implement priority actions linked to forests
and other land uses identified in their Nationally Determined Contributions
(NDCs) to combat climate change and its impacts.



Contribution of Forests to Sustainable
Development
Up to one-fifth of the global population—1.3 billion people—derives direct
and indirect benefits from forests in the form of employment, forest products,
and contributions to livelihoods and incomes. Rural households living near
forests obtain about 22 percent of their income from timber and non-timber
sources. An estimated 9 percent of rural populations—11 percent in Africa—
are lifted above the extreme poverty line with income from forest resources.
Forests also provide a crucial safety net for rural people in times of economic
distress, helping them bolster their income to offset losses in agricultural
income caused by weather shocks, crop failures, or changes in commodity
prices. Forests also contribute to food security and health, by supplementing

diets as well as providing fuelwood for cooking and sterilizing food for about
2.4 billion people.
   The formal timber sector contributes $600 billion to the global economy
(about 1 percent of gross domestic product). It is estimated that more than
50 million people derive jobs from timber activities. Forests also make a
vital contribution to the overall economy through the generation of essen-
tial services that sustain key sectors (agriculture, energy, water, mining, and
transport), and rural and urban areas by maintaining the fertility of the soil,
protecting watersheds, providing habitat for biodiversity, and reducing the
risk of natural disasters (such as floods and landslides). However, the eco-
nomic role of forests is broadly underestimated, in part because much of the
forest-related economic activity takes place in the informal sector, and
much of the income from forests is noncash—food, fodder, energy,
house-building materials, and medicine. In addition, the value of the ser-
vices delivered by forests and trees has long been overlooked because it
could not be monetized.
   Globally, forests remain under significant threat, despite the growing rec-
ognition of the decisive role they play in socioeconomic growth and in lifting
people out of poverty while providing critical services for long-term natural
resource sustainability. Although the pace of global deforestation has slowed
since the 1990s, it still affects an area larger than Costa Rica each year.
Deforestation and forest degradation contributed about 15 percent of the
world’s greenhouse gas emissions, the third largest source after coal and oil,
over the 2005–2010 period. Pressures on forests are likely to continue for the
next several decades. Population growth—along with rapid urbanization and
changes in consumption patterns in middle-income countries—is expected
to cause a sharp increase the demand for food, fiber, energy, and minerals,
driving large-scale land use changes at the cost of forest and tree cover.
   Threats to forests are manifold and often interdependent. Hence, address-
ing the threats requires recognition of the real economic contribution of for-
ests, as well as a coordinated multisector perspective—a “landscape approach”
that provides the organizing principle for investing in and managing land,
water, and forest resources based on rational spatial planning and socioeco-
nomic considerations. Such an approach ensures that activities in other sec-
tors, such as agriculture, transport, mining, or hydropower, are undertaken in
ways that limit the impacts on forest integrity while at the same time maxi-
mizing development benefits. To address the global forest challenge, forests
would need to become an integral part of national development agendas. For
that to happen, forests would need to be recognized for the many opportuni-
ties they offer, instead of only the challenges and risks associated with their
management.
   Sustainable forest management also calls for enhancing community
involvement in decision-making processes related to the use of forests,
increasing investments in planted forests, working in partnership with the
private sector to make their business models forest-smart, and strengthening
forest governance to foster responsible investments and combat illegal log-
ging. Some two billion hectares of lost or degraded forests and landscapes

                   could be restored, yielding tremendous benefits in economic opportunities,
                   while sequestering a significant quantity of carbon from the atmosphere.
                   As highlighted by more than 90 countries in their NDCs, forests and land use
                   are an integral part of the solution to climate change, contributing to the mit-
                   igation and adaptation agendas.



                   Forest Action Plan FY16–20: The WBG’s
                   Contribution to the Forest Agenda
                   Building on the 2002 Forest Strategy, the FAP identifies two focus areas for
                   WBG engagement for the next five years: (i) sustainable forestry, where we
                   aim to have investments contributing to sustainable management of forests
                   and value chains, and (ii)  forest-smart interventions, where we aim to have
                   interventions in other sectors not come at the expense of forest capital. These
                   two focus areas build on three cross-cutting themes that aim to improve the
                   enabling environment and strengthen the foundations for positive forest
                   outcomes: climate change and resilience, rights and participation, and insti-
                   tutions and governance. The following table outlines why the WBG priori-
                   tized the two focus areas and three cross-cutting themes, and how it will
                   deliver on them.

Implementation of the Forest Action Plan
The FAP spells out implementation modalities that will help strengthen the
WBG’s ability to deliver on the forest agenda during the next five years.
   Upstream assessments. The WBG will aim to have investments made in other
sectors carried out in a “forest-smart” way, such that they do not come at the
expense of forests. To do this, interventions in forests and other economic sec-
tors will be guided by comprehensive, ex ante, and robust information on
potential trade-offs for forests as well as opportunities for restoration. The
Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) and Country Partnership Framework
(CPF) instruments offer ideal platforms to identify the challenges and oppor-
tunities related to forests in a strategic and integrated manner by initiating,
within the WBG and with client countries, upstream dialogues on forests. To
do this, Country Forest Notes (and subnational notes as appropriate) will be
prepared for priority countries (with forest-related trust funds as well as
through the World Bank’s budget when available), and will present an upstream
analysis of threats to forests in individual countries or regions, as well as
opportunities for socioeconomic growth in the forest sector. The notes will
aim to inform the SCDs and CPFs. The notes will also reflect priority actions
presented by countries in their NDCs to the Climate Convention.
   Programmatic approach. The operational centerpiece of the FAP is a new
business model that moves away from the instrument-driven approach that
has shaped the WBG forest portfolio over the past few years, to a more pro-
grammatic approach that strategically positions the WBG to support coun-
tries that are willing to pursue a forest-smart development trajectory. The
approach will support an integrated development model that advances
socioeconomic opportunities and needs without jeopardizing the health of
forests. It is based on four features: country-owned program, appropriate
mix of financial instruments, cohesive financial architecture, and long-term
engagement.
   This new business model responds to concerns raised about the prolifera-
tion of small-scale operations. The programmatic approach seeks to achieve
greater strategic coherence in forest-related interventions, and simplifies
how a country can access various sources of funding for the sustainable
management of its forest landscapes. The programmatic approach will take
into account the specific challenges and opportunities a country has identi-
fied regarding forests and their contributions to the national economy and
global public goods. It will support country-owned strategies that seek syn-
ergies and minimize trade-offs between interacting land uses (including
agriculture, energy, transportation, extractives, ecosystem services, and bio-
diversity). Such an ambitious undertaking will be piloted in selected coun-
tries where the World Bank already has a significant involvement in the
forest sector and sectors affecting forests, and where there is a significant
commitment from the government and other stakeholders to go beyond
business as usual.
   Results and impacts. Strengthening the monitoring and reporting of the
performance of the WBG forest portfolio will help build a strong evidence

World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20	                                 xv
base on results from investments. The FAP supports actions at two levels: (i)
improving the capacity of the WBG to monitor progress toward achieving
results, reporting on these, and evaluating impacts of forest-relevant inter-
ventions; and (ii) supporting client countries’ efforts in building robust sys-
tems to monitor and report on the status of their forests.
   Knowledge base. Knowledge generation (through analytical work and oper-
ations) and dissemination will be a key focus area. The portfolio of analytical
and knowledge work, funded by trust funds of the World Bank, will be aligned
with the focus areas identified in the FAP. Through project cycle, perfor-
mance, and learning reviews of forest-related interventions, an operational
knowledge base will be developed. This will be systematically captured and
disseminated so that it can inform project/program design, and help deter-
mine midcourse corrections if appropriate. Trust fund resources will also
support the consolidation of a knowledge management system.
   Institutional and operational arrangements. The programmatic approach
proposed under the FAP will aim to move away from the project-by-project
and instrument-driven approach that has shaped the forest portfolio over the
past few years, toward a more programmatic approach that would strategi-
cally position the WBG to support countries delivering on forest-smart inter-
ventions. Building on the lessons learned from the Finance and Markets
Global Practice, which has pioneered this approach over the past few years,
the programmatic approach will seek to consolidate and streamline the prep-
aration and implementation processes of different operations under the same
program. The approach will aim for a stronger collaboration across Global
Practices and Cross-Cutting Solutions Areas, with a focus on working as one
team within the WBG. The WBG will also work with partners and donors to
improve the effectiveness of forest climate funds, to reduce transaction costs
and increase impact.
   Partnerships. The WBG works with a wide range of stakeholders and part-
ners at the country, regional, and global levels. To support its new business
model, the WBG will place special emphasis on partnerships that can deliver
operational support to client countries through coordinated efforts. Platforms
established under the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility and Forest
Investment Program (and its associated Dedicated Grant Mechanism for
Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities) have deepened the World Bank’s
engagement with a variety of stakeholders involved in the forest sector.
Continuing dialogue and exchange with civil society and other groups will
remain central to the implementation of the FAP.

Introduction: Why a Forest
Action Plan?

The World Bank Group (WBG) Forest Strategy, Sustaining Forests: A
Development Strategy, continues to frame the institution’s work in the forest
sector. Adopted in 2002, Sustaining Forests was prepared at a time when the
World Bank was seeking to re-engage more broadly and proactively in sup-
port of forests, after a decade of relative inactivity, when little attention was
paid to the active management of natural forests.1
   The 2002 Sustaining Forests is organized around three main pillars. World
Bank support should (i) harness the potential of forests to reduce poverty in a
sustainable manner, (ii) integrate forests effectively into sustainable economic
development, and (iii) protect the vital local and global environmental ser-
vices and value of forests. The overall framework for World Bank action out-
lined in Sustaining Forests has been robust, and there is a consensus across a
diverse group of stakeholders that the broad parameters that are described in
the strategy continue to have great relevance and provide the flexibility to
respond to emerging challenges.
   For example, although it was not explicitly addressed in the 2002 strategy
in depth, the World Bank’s support for work on forest carbon has been con-
sistent with the institution’s focus on developing partnerships and protecting
the global services and value of forests.
   A review of the implementation of the Sustaining Forests strategy was con-
ducted by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) in 2012–13.2 Although it
confirmed that the 2002 WBG Forest Strategy was still relevant and aligned
with the World Bank’s mission and comparative advantage, the IEG identified
a few areas of weaknesses in implementation, in particular in the impact of
WBG interventions on poverty alleviation, and reporting on results from
investments at a strategic level.
   In February 2013, the WBG’s Committee on Development Effectiveness
(CODE) welcomed the recommendations from the IEG review. CODE
expressed strong and unambiguous support for continued WBG engagement
in the forest sector and confirmed that the WBG has a unique and key role to
play in promoting effective, sustainable forest management in client countries,
including timber concession reform. CODE supported the WBG’s proposal to
prepare a Forest Action Plan (FAP) building on the 2002 Sustaining Forests
strategy and taking into account the IEG’s recommendations to strengthen the
impact of WBG forest interventions. Specifically, the committee urged the
WBG to strengthen its focus on poverty reduction targets, in particular
through the development of short-term proxy indicators for long-term
impacts and improved monitoring and evaluation frameworks, and to address
how forest support can be integrated into wider smart land use policies.
   In light of the guidance from CODE, the FAP describes the framework for
WBG support to the forest sector, and to sectors affecting forests, for the next

five years. It builds on two focus areas: (i) sustainable forestry, where the aim
is to ensure that investments related to forests contribute to the sustainable
management of forests and value chains, and (ii) forest-smart interventions,
where the aim is to have interventions in other sectors not come at the expense
of forest capital. The FAP describes how the WBG will aim to create resilient
and sustainable forest landscapes. The FAP builds on the priorities for sup-
porting inclusive and green growth that are outlined in the WBG’s
Environment Strategy 2012–22, Toward a Green, Clean, and Resilient World
for All, and is fully aligned with the WBG Climate Change Action Plan.
   The FAP supports the global forest agenda, such as the newly adopted 2030
Sustainable Development Agenda (and the associated Sustainable Development
Goals); the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change, which highlights the key contribution of forests to the
climate challenge; the Bonn Challenge; and the May 2015 Ministerial
Declaration of the United Nations Forum on Forests, which highlights “how
sustainable forest management (SFM) is vital to transformative change and to
addressing development challenges—from poverty eradication and economic
growth to food security and climate change mitigation and adaptation.”
   In July 2014, the WBG introduced a new institutional organization, with 14
Global Practices (GPs) and five Cross-Cutting Solutions Areas (CCSA). The
new organization aims to enhance the institution’s ability to respond to
emerging challenges in client countries. In that context, the Environment and
Natural Resources GP was tasked to lead the work on forests (including the
development of this FAP). The Environment and Natural Resources GP works
closely with other GPs and CCSAs and in coordination with respective coun-
try management units to promote the forest agenda. In addition, close collab-
oration with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) provides opportunities to encourage
the private sector (ranging from small and medium enterprises to larger com-
panies and financial intermediaries) to invest in a forest-smart way.
   The FAP was developed through a joint effort involving all World Bank GPs
and CCSAs, as well as the IFC and MIGA. The content and thrust of the draft
FAP was discussed with external stakeholder groups to get their views and
comments on the proposed actions. To that end, the WBG engaged, among
others, the observers to the governing bodies of the Forest Investment
Program and the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, as well as other nongov-
ernmental organizations and several governments.



Notes
	1.	 In 1991, the scope of what the WBG could support was greatly restricted, includ-
     ing among other things a ban on any support to commercial logging in tropi-
     cal forests. Despite the very significant latitude for forests sector investment that
     remained, the 1991 policy had a chilling effect on World Bank lending, accompa-
     nied by progressive disengagement.

1. Contribution of Forests to
Sustainable Development

  Summary
  This chapter describes the role forests play in contributing to the World Bank
  Group’s goals of ending extreme poverty and increasing shared prosperity in a
  sustainable manner by 2030. The chapter also provides an overview of the
  challenges and opportunities for the forest sector today, including climate
  change, competing uses of land, growing demand for forest products, land
  rights, financing, and forest governance.

  Forests sustain the livelihoods of millions of people, provide a promising path-
  way out of poverty, and contribute significantly to national economies. Forests
  also offer essential ecosystem services that support various economic sectors
  and contribute to ecological resilience and stabilization of the global climate
  system. However, the global extent of forests has continued to decline.

  While forests still face major challenges, opportunities have emerged that could
  transform the way forests are managed. Forests have a unique role to play in
  combatting climate change, as they contribute simultaneously to the mitigation
  and adaption agendas: they can help build productive and resilient landscapes
  while removing atmospheric carbon and other greenhouse gases. Concerted
  action is needed if society is to make long-lasting use of global forest resources
  for poverty eradication and sustainable economic development, and protect the
  global forest estate for future generations.




Forests and the World Bank Group’s Goals
Forests and trees provide vital resources and ecosystem services for all of
humanity through the regulation of climate and hydrological systems. The
number of people deriving direct and indirect benefits from forests and trees—
in the form of employment, forest products, and contributions to livelihoods
and incomes—is estimated at 1.3 billion (FAO 2014). If sustainably managed,
forests and trees can contribute to long-term economic growth, social inclu-
sion, and environmental stability. As such, forests are essential to achieving the
World Bank Group’s (WBG’s) goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting
shared prosperity in a sustainable manner, and the broader 2030 Sustainable
Development Agenda set out in the Sustainable Development Goals.

Forests Provide Pathways Out of Poverty
Some 300 million to 350 million people, about half of whom are indigenous,
live within or close to dense forests and depend almost entirely on forests
for subsistence (Chao 2012). Hundreds of millions more, including people

in cities, depend on forest resources for food, construction materials, and
energy sources.1
   Beyond subsistence, forests are an important aspect of rural livelihoods. In
Tunisia, a study shows that the 14 percent of the country’s population living
in rural areas derives 30 to 40 percent of their income from forests and range-
lands (Croitoru, Daly, and Bennouna 2015). The recently completed Poverty
and Environment Network (PEN) survey documented that rural households
living near forested areas derive 22  percent of their income from forest
sources.2 This contribution is larger than that of wage labor, livestock, self-
owned businesses, or any other category aside from crops. About half of
the  income from forests is noncash and includes food, fodder, energy,
house-building materials, and medicine (see figure 1.1). This noncash contri-
bution, or “hidden harvest,” is especially important for the extreme poor. The
dependence of the poor on forests is further increased by their limited access
to markets, as many live in remote areas. Although the relative share of income
from forests decreases for the upper quintile of a population, the consump-
tion of forest products increases in absolute terms (Angelsen et al. 2014).
   Forest resources enable people to rise out of extreme poverty and reduce
vulnerability. According to the PEN findings, an estimated 9 percent of the
rural population is lifted above the extreme poverty line3 because of income
from forest resources. The impact of forests on poverty is greatest in the Africa
region, with forest-related income lifting 11 percent of rural households out
of extreme poverty.4
   In addition, forests represent an important safety net for rural people in
times of economic distress. Many households respond to an income shock by
seeking additional resources from forests (Angelsen and Dokken 2015).
Forests also play an important role in offsetting losses in agricultural income
caused by weather shocks or changes in commodity prices (Noack et al. 2015).
Forest income diversifies the income portfolio of all groups, but this diversifi-
cation is particularly important for the poor.

   Given the importance of forests for rural livelihoods and safety nets for the
poor, effective and sustainable forest management is essential to ensure that
forests continue to contribute to poverty reduction, and that the regressive
effects from forest loss that risk driving people into extreme poverty are
avoided.

Forests Mitigate Climate Change and
Strengthen Resilience
Climate change poses a significant threat to meeting the WBG’s corporate
goals. Forests are uniquely placed in the climate change agenda, as they can
provide both mitigation and adaptation benefits. Forests can store and seques-
ter carbon as well as provide ecosystem services that enhance the resilience of
ecosystems. Maintaining and restoring healthy forests are thus an essential
part of meeting the WBG goals.
   Together, deforestation and forest degradation contributed to 2.9 billion
tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) annually during 2005–10, about
15 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the third larg-
est source after coal and oil. The Paris Agreement adopted at the United
Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) recognizes forests as a critical
piece of the effort to combat climate change. In their Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDCs), more than 90 countries indicated their commitment
to limit forest loss as well as increase forest cover (through afforestation and
reforestation as well as tree planting on farmlands).
   In addition, forests play a crucial role in the adaptation agenda by enhanc-
ing ecosystem resilience to changing weather patterns. Forests provide
important safety nets as well for local communities, helping them cope with
climate shocks.5 Forests can also constitute natural infrastructure that pro-
tects against the adverse impacts of climate change, such as mangroves that
help reduce risks from disasters related to climate extremes and sea level
rise.6 The capacity of a forest ecosystem to cope with changing environmen-
tal conditions and deliver services that can mitigate climate shocks at a
broader scale is determined by its biological and ecological resources (Russell
et al. 2012).

Forests Support Jobs and Wealth Creation
Forests contribute to wealth generation and job creation. The formal timber
sector employs more than 13.2  million people, produces more than 5,000
types of wood-based products, and generates a gross value added of just over
$600 billion—nearly 1 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP)—each
year (FAO 2014).7 But these numbers reflect only part of the true contribution
of the timber sector to the economy, because the sector is mainly informal
and therefore its value remains unreported. Including the informal sector in
GDP calculations could double the contribution of the timber sector. The
informal sector also creates considerably more jobs than the formal sector: an
estimated 41 million people work full-time in the informal forest sector
(FAO 2014). (See figure 1.2.).

  Local energy needs are largely met by informal wood production. It is esti-
mated that some 840 million people, or 12 percent of the world’s population,
collect fuelwood and charcoal for their own use (FAO 2014). The fuelwood
value chain creates employment opportunities for tens of millions of rural
and urban households in the form of small-scale wood collection, charcoal
production, transportation, and last-mile retail (World Bank 2015). It is esti-
mated that the charcoal sector in Sub-Saharan Africa employs seven million
people (World Bank 2011).
  Non-wood forest products (NWFPs) generate significant income, with an
added annual gross value of $88  billion: this category includes medicinal
plants, bushmeat and game, nuts, and honey. In some regions, NWFPs are a
major source of livelihoods. For example, in Cameroon, bushmeat and valu-
able wild fruits account for more than 59 percent of the income of local com-
munities (Angelsen et al. 2014).

Forests Provide Ecosystem Services that
Sustain Economies
Forests and their biodiversity play a crucial role in sustaining the planet’s bal-
ance, and provide basic services such as soil retention, erosion control, water
and climate regulation, and pollination, which are essential to sustain key
economic sectors and services, including agriculture, energy, infrastructure,
and sanitation. These are referred to as “ecosystem services”—and they are
essential to people and economies.
   Forests, especially primary forests, are among the most important reposito-
ries for terrestrial biological diversity. Together, all types of forests offer
diverse habitats for plants, animals, and microorganisms. Biodiversity
presents opportunities for medicines, food, raw materials, and employment.

6	                                          World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20
                      Significant gains have been made in conserving biodiversity, with roughly
                      12 percent of the global forest area designated as protected areas. However,
                      protected areas are increasingly isolated within productive landscapes across
                      the globe, constraining the migration of plants and animals and thus their
                      capacity to adapt to changes in climate conditions.8
                         The value of the ecosystem services delivered by forests and trees is often
                      overlooked because it is not monetized. However, scientific literature and case
                      studies increasingly allocate monetary values to such services, in terms of
                      economic gain or cost avoidance (see figure 1.3). For example, the reduction
                      in sedimentation in the Three Gorges Hydroelectric Power Plant in China,
                      which resulted from large-scale reforestation in the upper watershed, greatly
                      reduced the enhancement costs of the reservoir that were needed to cope with
                      a heavy sediment load9 (Zhaoyin, Lee, and Melching 2014). Forests and trees
                      also offer protection against severe weather events, such as hurricanes and
                      tropical storms (Webster et al. 2005). Through the provision of key ecosystem
                      services, forests and trees can play a significant role in increasing the produc-
                      tivity and resilience of farming systems, and reducing damage from flooding
                      and sea level rise. Forests and trees increase local streamwater flow levels
                      while reducing storm runoff, buffering agricultural production from the
                      impacts of periodic interruptions in seasonal rainfall.
                         Forest loss may jeopardize long-term macroeconomic sustainability.
                      Standard income measures in national accounts do not regard the depletion
                      of natural capital as a cost of production (as they do for produced capital).
                      Therefore, for a resource-rich country, income generated from exploiting
                      natural resources may appear high in the short term, but may not be sustain-
                      able in the long run (see box 1.1). The World Bank’s adjusted net savings
                      indicator, published annually in the World Development Indicators (WDI),
                      offers a more inclusive picture of changes in a comprehensive set of capital
                      assets that constitute a nation’s wealth base, including a knowledgeable and

     Long-Term Growth Sustainability
     Figure B1.1.1 shows the calculation of adjusted net saving for Uganda in 2013. It starts with gross
     national saving (22 percent of gross national income [GNI]). After adjusting for the consumption
     of fixed capital, education expenditures (representing investment in human capital), depletion of
     natural resources (primarily net forest depletion for Uganda), and pollution damages, Uganda’s
     adjusted net saving is about 5 percent of GNI—much lower than the standard savings measure.

and minerals. Through this approach, the indicator provides national deci-
sion makers with a clear, relatively simple assessment of the sustainability
level of their countries’ growth policies.

Forests Sustain Cultures and Spiritual Values
A full appreciation of the benefits and services provided by forests also calls
for consideration of the cultural and spiritual significance of forests and
related landscapes for the people who live in them and depend on their
resources. The variety of cultural value (as well as symbolic) functions
ascribed to forests are as numerous and diverse as the communities and cul-
tures living in forests around the world. Although they are difficult to quan-
tify, these values are undeniably real. The traditional knowledge held by forest
communities, and particularly by indigenous peoples, has contributed to pre-
serving biodiversity-rich forests for countless generations. Although it is still
often disregarded, there is a growing recognition that this deep-rooted eco-
logical knowledge can help form the basis for sustainable forest management
approaches, whether the approaches have a conservation thrust or more pro-
ductive ends (as described in box 2.7, in chapter 2, on community forests in
Mexico).

Current Challenges and Opportunities for Forests
Forests are under significant threat. Population growth, along with changes in
consumption patterns in middle-income countries, has generated a boom in
the demand for food, fiber, energy, and minerals, which in turn exacerbates
pressures on natural forests. Although the pace of global deforestation has
slowed since the 1990s, it remains high: about 13  million hectares (gross)
were converted annually to other uses such as agriculture, infrastructure
development, and oil and mineral extraction, or were lost through natural
causes—in many cases exacerbated by climate change—between 2000 and
2010. During the same period, reforestation partially offset these losses,10
reducing annual net forest loss to 5.6 million hectares. But this still amounts
to a loss of forest area larger than the size of Costa Rica each year (FAO 2014).
Furthermore, as much as 40 million hectares of primary forests were con-
verted to secondary forests.
   With concerted action, society could make significantly improved
and long-lasting use of global forest resources for poverty eradication and
sustainable economic development. Although forests still face major chal-
lenges, opportunities have emerged that could transform the way they are
managed.

Climate Change
Challenge. The current and projected impacts of climate change, including
but not limited to rising temperatures and increasingly unpredictable precip-
itation patterns, increase the vulnerability of forests to pests, diseases, and
fires. At the same time, forest loss affects water cycles on a large scale and can
put water supplies and food security at risk.
   Opportunity. Forests and their biodiversity make a crucial contribution to
mitigating the impacts of climate change not only by absorbing GHGs from
the atmosphere, but also by regulating water flows, protecting coastal com-
munities from extreme events and sea level rise, and offering plant and ani-
mal species migratory corridors to more suitable habitats. Forests and trees
are the cornerstone of the land restoration agenda: some two billion hectares
of lost or degraded forests and landscapes could be restored and rehabilitated
to functional and productive ecosystems. Essential to this process is the res-
toration of the biodiversity within forest systems, which is the backbone of a
healthy ecosystem. The restoration of ecosystems and their biodiversity would
generate increased economic opportunities in rural areas, deliver improved
rural livelihoods and food security, help fill household energy gaps as a renew-
able energy source, enhance climate resilience, and mitigate GHG emissions
while taking pressure off pristine forests.

Competing Uses of Land
Challenge. For a long time, the default development path for forest-rich
nations has been to convert natural forests into agricultural or other
land  uses. This development model is usually referred to as the “forest

World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20	                                    9
  Box 1.2  Examples of Forest Loss in Various Regions
  Over 16 percent of Brazil’s original (pre-Columbian) Amazonian forest has disappeared, and
  current rates of forest loss are on the order of two million hectares per year. In Indonesia, it is
  estimated that more than two million hectares are being degraded and deforested each year,
  caused by unsustainable forest production and conversion to other uses. And after a century of
  forest conversion to cocoa production, reaching one million tons of cocoa produced per year,
  Ghana has reduced the area of natural forests by 80 percent.




transition theory,” holding that economic growth goes hand in hand with
deforestation (see box 1.2) (Mather 1992). This theory is now questioned,
however, and some countries, such as Brazil, show that the curves of
deforestation and economic growth can be decoupled, and that increased
agricultural value does not have to come at the expense of forests.
  Opportunity. A forest-smart, multisector or landscape approach consid-
ers forests and the services they provide to be key elements of the Sustainable
Development Agenda. This translates into decisions on land use that seek
to  minimize or mitigate negative impacts on forests and enhance their
positive contributions to other sectors. Greater attention to the role of for-
­
ests  in national development strategies can provide benefits for long-
term food security, poverty reduction, social development, and green growth.
Data and information on the long-term impacts of potential decisions on
forests can inform discussions on trade-offs in land use planning.
­

Growing Demand for Forest Products
Challenge. Demand for timber products is growing rapidly, with the demand
for global industrial roundwood predicted to quadruple by 2050 (Indufor
2012). This increase surpasses by a large amount the supply growth, deepening
the projected yearly supply deficit from one billion cubic meters in 2012 to 4.5
billion cubic meters in 2050. This rising global demand for timber and other
forest products risks fueling unsustainable and often illegal timber trade flows.
Planted forests can represent a promising option to fill the gap in timber sup-
ply. However, poorly designed planted forests can lead to the degradation of
critical ecosystems, erosion of the ecological services delivered by these eco-
systems, and lack of respect for the rights and interests of local communities.
   Opportunity. Since 2000, the area of planted forests has increased consider-
ably. Planted forest area now accounts for around 7 percent of the total area of
global forests—some 280 million hectares. The area continues to increase at a
rate of around five million hectares per year, through afforestation as well as
managed natural regeneration. The expansion of planted forests is largely
driven by the private sector. Carefully designed and managed planted forests
can present major opportunities for job creation and sustainable economic
growth in rural areas. Certification schemes as well as new models (such as
the New Generation Plantations) are paving the way for responsible

10	                                  World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20
investments in the sustainable management of forests—natural and planted—
in southern countries.

Forest Governance
Challenge. Estimates indicate that industrial hardwood timber of question-
able origins might constitute 23–30 percent of global supply, and the avail-
ability of illegal supply depresses prices by 7–16 percent. Illegal logging on
public lands results in estimated losses in assets and revenue in excess of $10
billion annually. Because of its value and scale, illegal logging is also a driver
of wider systemic corruption and can fuel conflicts and threaten security.11
   Opportunity. Progress has been made over the past 10 years in tackling ille-
gal logging,12 resulting from a combination of actions taken at the interna-
tional and national levels to monitor and track illegal activities.13 However,
forest governance requires continuous efforts to tackle emerging challenges
through policy changes, strengthened institutions, and enhanced monitoring
systems. New information and communications technologies (ICTs) provide
opportunities to monitor forest cover in almost real-time, allowing for the
detection of fires and deforestation hotspots. Timber can now be tracked all
along the supply chain, and public participation is enhanced through open
data applications (such as e-government and open government).

Private Financing for Sustainable Forest Management
Challenge. The required funding for sustainable forest management is esti-
mated to be between $70 billion and $160 billion per year globally (World Bank
2014). The amount needed to supply the world’s need for wood products alone
is about $50 billion. Mobilization of adequate financing for the forest sector
remains a challenge. Private financial flows to this sector are estimated to be as
high as $15 billion per year (Asen, Savenije, and Schmidt 2012). Although pri-
vate financing is promising, it is not yet distributed evenly across regions, and
the potential in many developing countries has yet to materialize.14
   Opportunity. Increased investments in plantations are expected to go
to emerging and developing countries. This represents a shift in this industry,
where historically private investment in timber production and processing
has been concentrated in high-income countries. Some countries in Latin
America15 have significantly increased their plantation area over the  past
decade, but opportunities exist in other regions, particularly in Africa. There
is tremendous potential to unlock the investment of responsible private oper-
ators in sustainable forest management and forest  product value chains in
emerging and developing countries. This will  require a robust regulatory
framework that ensures that forest investments are done in an environmen-
tally friendly and socially responsible way.

Rights Over Forests
Challenge. The widespread pressures on natural forests—human-made (for
example, incursions by loggers and deforestation) or natural (for example,
climate change–induced droughts or fires)—have increased the vulnerability

World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20	                                   11
of indigenous peoples and other traditional-living rural populations, by jeop-
ardizing their secured access to forest lands and resources. Where the state
has asserted its rights to land and forests and subsequently chosen to allocate
these rights to investors in the forest or other sectors, conflicts with indige-
nous peoples and local communities that have long depended on these areas
have escalated.
   Opportunity. In the past decades, there has been a trend toward more
community involvement in decision-making processes related to the use of
­
forests.16 Research shows that decentralization of the use and ownership of
forests and trees to local communities improves forest conservation and
management, with significant productivity and yield increases (RRI 2014).
­
Local control over resources and community-based forest management also
offer opportunities to reduce poverty among forest-dependent households.


Notes
	1.	Conventional biofuels (firewood, charcoal, crop residues, and cattle dung) rep-
      resent the main source of energy for about 2.4  billion households in southern
      countries. Firewood represents the most important rural domestic fuel. In large
      parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, conventional biofuels represent about 90 percent of
      the rural energy supply, and in China, they represent 70 to 80 percent (IUFRO
      2015; IEA 2006).

	 9.	 From 1950 to 1989, the Chinese government invested $1.6 billion for the enhance-
      ment and reinforcement of grand levees, because the heavy sediment load from
      the Loess plateau caused continuous siltation of the lower Yellow River bed. Since
      1989, the grand levee has not required further enhancements, because erosion in
      the Loess plateau has been greatly reduced and the sediment load reduced from
      1.6 billion tons to about 0.2 billion tons per year. It can thus be calculated that
      reforestation and sediment trapping in the Loess plateau has created a value of
      about $40 million per year.
10.	
	     While forest cover has globally decreased, some regions have shown signifi-
      cant  increases in response to different land use dynamics. In Central Europe,
      the forest cover increase is generally the result of changing production patterns
      and urbanization leading to abandoned former agricultural lands transitioning
      back to forests. In East Asia, and particularly in China, active reforestation has

     played a major role. In Latin America and Africa, forest area has been on the
     decline.
11.	Interpol has linked illegal charcoal production and terrorist groups. According to
	
     its estimates, in East Africa a terrorist group can earn $38 million to $56 million
     a year solely from the illegal charcoal trade. In Africa overall, these groups can
     make $111 million to $289 million a year from the illegal or unregulated charcoal
     trade.
	
12.	 Recent studies indicate that since 2000, illegal logging has fallen around
     50 ­percent in Cameroon, between 50 and 75 percent in the Brazilian Amazon,
     and 75 ­  percent in Indonesia, while imports of illegally sourced wood to the
     seven major consumer and processing countries are down 30 percent from their
     peak (Lawson and MacFaul 2010).
13.	
	    Such actions include legality schemes (such as the Forest Law Enforcement,
     Governance and Trade program and the FLEGT and Lacey Act), procurement
     regulations, and forest certification.
	14.	Obstacles include higher real and perceived risks in investing in developing coun-

 16.	In 2013, 30.1 percent of global forests in low- and middle-income countries
     were  designated for or owned by local communities or indigenous peoples,
          percent were owned by private firms or individuals, and the remaining

2. Focus Areas and
Cross-Cutting Themes

  Summary
  The Forest Action Plan FY16–20 builds on and strengthens the World Bank
  Group (WBG) Forest Strategy (Sustaining Forests), and identifies two focus
  areas for WBG engagement for the next five years: sustainable forestry, ensur-
  ing that investments related to forests contribute to sustainable management of
  forests and value chains, and forest-smart interventions in other sectors, sup-
  porting interventions that do not come at the expense of forest capital. These
  two focus areas build on three cross-cutting themes that aim at improving the
  enabling environment and strengthening the foundations for positive forest
  outcomes: climate change and resilience, rights and participation; and institu-
  tions and governance.

  Through the Forest Action Plan, the WBG aims to boost the potential of the
  forest sector to lift people out of poverty and generate lasting economic returns
  in clients’ countries. It will also support client countries in defining develop-
  ment pathways that fully take into account the importance of their natural cap-
  ital. In forest-rich countries, the World Bank will aim to minimize the adverse
  impacts on forests of investments in sectors such as agriculture, energy, trans-
  port, and mining. In countries where forest capital has been depleted, the WBG
  will aim to support clients’ efforts to restore this capital and associated services
  through multisector engagements. In all cases, an integrated landscape
  approach will guide WBG engagement.




World Bank Group Value Proposition
The WBG recognizes the importance of forests to development and to deliv-
ering on its corporate goals of eradicating extreme poverty and boosting
shared prosperity by 2030 in a sustainable manner, as described in chapter 1
and figure 2.1. The Forest Action Plan (FAP) will guide WBG interventions
over the next five years.
   The debate over how the WBG should support forest management in devel-
oping countries has long been hampered by multiple trade-offs between land
uses. How can forests be conserved while increasing agricultural productiv-
ity? How can demands for timber and other forest products be met without
contributing to forest loss? How can GHG emissions be reduced in the face of
increasing energy demands? How can the rights of indigenous people and
forest-dependent communities be protected while encouraging the private
sector to make productive investments in forests? How can competing
demands for other natural resources, such as water, be managed in a way that
accounts for the value of forests?

             not exist
                                                                      impacts of climate change




   The evolving global context requires moving beyond just accepting nega-
tive trade-offs, and calls for greater attention to how the forests and their bio-
diversity can be incorporated more fully into inclusive development strategies
that contribute to food security, poverty reduction, social development, and
green growth. For example: how can forest and forest-related supply chains
generate economic opportunities and jobs in rural areas? How can forests and
their biodiversity contribute to strengthening resilience and productivity in
farming systems through climate-smart agriculture? How can forest conser-
vation, including reforestation and restoration, improve the reliability and
sustainability of urban water supplies? How can forest investment strengthen
local rights of use and access to natural resources?
   These questions feature in the WBG’s Forest Action Plan FY16–20. The
FAP builds directly on the 2002 WBG Forest Strategy (Sustaining Forests),
which defined three interdependent pillars that are still deemed relevant in
guiding the WBG’s work on forests: harnessing the potential of forests to
reduce poverty, integrating forests in sustainable economic development, and
protecting vital local and global forest ecosystem services and values.
   Responding to the emerging challenges and opportunities on forests, the
FAP defines the modalities of operationalization of the 2002 Forest Strategy
for the next five years. It proposes priority areas of engagement for the WBG
and identifies two focus areas and three cross-cutting themes (see figure 2.2).
These priority areas build on an in-depth assessment of the WBG’s forest
portfolio over FY02–15, using the lessons learned and experience gained
over the past decade (see appendix A), as well as a detailed analysis of the
emerging demands from clients. This exercise has helped prioritize key inter-
vention areas where the WBG already has a credible track record or potential
to grow, based on comparative advantage. The Forest Action Plan FY16–20
has been prepared as a joint effort of the entities of the WBG—World Bank,
International Finance Corporation (IFC), and Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency (MIGA)—with the objective to maximize the complemen-
tarity and impacts of the interventions of the three entities. The FAP has also
benefitted from inputs from various stakeholders.

                    Focus Area 2        Ensure that investments in other economic
                                        sectors (for example, agriculture, energy, mining,
                    “Forest-Smart”      transport) consider avoiding/minimizing
                   Interventions in     adverse impacts on forests and/or maximizing

   The FAP articulates the WBG’s value proposition on forests. In particular, it
responds to priority actions identified by countries in their NDCs to the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In
that sense, the FAP fully aligns with the WBG Climate Change Action Plan.
   In practice, the distinction between the two focus areas is somewhat artifi-
cial, because there are significant synergies between them. Many operations
in the current portfolio or in the pipeline directly respond to both areas.
Nonetheless, the approach is helpful for highlighting key themes in the pro-
gram, and entry points for engaging a range of stakeholders and sectors.
   WBG support will depend on country-specific contexts and will be tailored
to the specific needs, requests, and priorities identified by clients. This will
translate into different types of engagement with various stakeholder groups
(public sector institutions, private sector actors, community-based organiza-
tions, and civil society). Selectivity will be a guiding principle in the imple-
mentation of the FAP. And discussions with clients will define how the WBG
interventions can be responsive to country situations and delivered at the
scale necessary to have transformative impact.


Focus Area 1: Sustainable Forestry
Forests in many developing countries support the livelihoods of hundreds of
millions of people, mostly the poor and vulnerable, who are often remote
from market opportunities. Beyond sustaining livelihoods, sustainably man-
aged forests also offer opportunities to lift people out of poverty where alter-
natives do not exist. Even in the most high-income economies, some pockets
of poverty often remain in forested areas. At the same time, population growth
and associated changes in consumption patterns are increasing demand for
forest products (such as wood-based energy, construction, and poles) and

16	                                   World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20
               placing more pressure on natural forests. Responding to the growing demand
               while preserving natural forests is an enormous challenge. The sustainable
               management of existing forests can only meet a fraction of this demand.
               There is an urgent need for ambitious interventions and investments to stim-
               ulate diversification of the supply through reforestation/afforestation and
               planting trees on farms. In addition, producers need to be effectively con-
               nected to consumers through sustainable value chains.
                 The FAP aims to support investments in sustainable forestry, with a partic-
               ular focus on optimizing the potential of natural forests to provide cash and
               noncash income and generate jobs and economic opportunities for forest
               dwellers; supporting tree planting and plantations to respond to growing
               demand for timber, fiber, and fuelwood while reducing pressures on natural
               forests; investing in rehabilitating degraded lands; and promoting sustainable
               value chains through small and medium-size forest enterprises (SMFEs) and
               responsible investments in forests.

               Protect and Optimize the Management of Natural Forests
               Forests have the potential to support job and wealth creation for forest dwel-
               lers in many different ways: products extracted from forests (timber and
               non-timber) can be used or sold, and sustain profitable value chains; unique
               ­
               forest biodiversity can attract nature-based tourism; and forest dwellers can
               be rewarded for their forest stewardship through payments. Moreover, the
               protection of natural habitats and associated biodiversity is understood as a
               core of countries’ wealth. However, in many countries, this potential is not
               fully tapped. The WBG will aim to support clients in unlocking this potential
               through a variety of potential supports.

               Participatory Forest Management
               Participatory forest management has been a key focus of the World Bank’s
               work in many countries, such as the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Mexico,
               and Turkey (see box 2.1). In these countries, the World Bank has helped



Box 2.1  Community-Based Management of Forests in the Lao
People’s Democratic Republic
The World Bank has supported community-based management of forests in Lao PDR for more
than 20 years. These efforts have shown significant impacts in poverty alleviation in forested
areas, through the enhanced involvement of communities and benefit-sharing schemes. The
current Sustainable Forestry for Rural Development project (combining World Bank and Forest
Investment Program resources for a total of $31.8 million, with technical assistance from the
Government of Finland) supports the participatory sustainable forest management approach. The
project covers 2.3 million hectares located in 41 production forests in 13 provinces. The project
works with provincial, district, and local authorities to improve the livelihoods of more than
400,000 rural community members in more than 1,000 villages.


               World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20	                                         17
support innovative arrangements that give local communities a much larger
stake in forest management and the rehabilitation of degraded woodlands, pas-
tures, and watersheds. Such interventions have had significant impacts in pov-
erty alleviation and economic opportunities.1 However, to yield the expected
results, the interventions need to cover the dimensions of rights and access.
   Many countries (including such diverse countries as Indonesia, Moldova,
and the Russian Federation) have decentralized their forest management to
local authorities at different levels.2 Although these models were intended to
bring forests closer to local control, they were seldom matched with the
needed transfer of resources or technical management capacity.

Key Actions: Building on successful experiences, the World Bank will
aim  to  continue supporting the participatory management of forests. The
approach and models will be applied in response to country-specific needs,
circumstances, and demand. In South Asia, community-based forest manage-
ment approaches are very common (forest user groups in Nepal, for instance,
and joint forest management in India). However, these initiatives have been
able to address only partially the first-generation problems of ownership;
issues related to increased investments to enhance productivity and equitable
distribution of benefits persist. In Africa, the concept of community forestry
is much more recent, and focus could be given to social organization of the
communities. In Latin America and the Caribbean, which has a long experi-
ence of community-based forestry, the highest returns would come from a
focus on integration into the value chain and market access. In Eastern Europe
and Central Asia, the specific focus could be on accompanying the decentral-
ization of the forest management functions, ensuring an adequate transfer of
funds, and strengthening local technical capacities.


Sustainable Management of Production Forests
Forest productivity can be enhanced through tailored silvicultural interven-
tions that increase the potential offtake of timber and non-wood forest prod-
ucts through sustainable forest management measures, to meet a range of
market demands. At the institutional level, good forest management planning
is required, and institutions need to be strengthened to optimize the use of
natural forests in a sustainable way. To inform decisions, good inventory data,
technically and financially sound management plans, and knowledge of
advanced silvicultural practices are needed. Changes in key parameters (tem-
perature and humidity) can be expected to have a drastic effect on forest
health and increase vulnerability to shocks. This will require adaptive silvicul-
tural management techniques to cope with the increased occurrence of fires
and diseases.

Key Actions: The World Bank is ready to support governments to tap the
full  potential of sustainable forest management for timber production, by
building capacity at various levels (national as well as local), enhancing forest
management practices, and investing in pest management and fire control

Box 2.2  Promotion of Better Forest Management Practices
in Belarus
The objective of this project is to enhance silvicultural management and reforestation and
afforestation, increase the use of felling residues, and improve the public good contribution from
forests in targeted forest areas. The project supports the intensification of the silviculture through
investment in modern harvesting machinery. It will also facilitate modernization of forest
nurseries; installation of video and communications equipment for monitoring, surveillance, and
detection of fires; introduction of fire-fighting equipment to help extinguish fires once started; as
well as development of a web-based interface for early alerts. It is estimated that the measures on
prevention, improved detection, and more timely and effective response to forest fires will reduce
future losses by 30 percent.




               (see box 2.2). Building sound databases on forest resources and robust moni-
               toring systems will also remain key areas of focus. The World Bank will care-
               fully consider any new potential engagement in forest concessions by assessing
               ex ante the economic, social, and environmental impacts through Strategic
               Environmental and Social Assessments (SESAs).

               Sustainable Production of Non-Wood Forest Products
               Beyond timber products, forests provide essential NWFPs, such as fruit,
               shoots, medicinal plants, roots, mushrooms, wildlife, and insects gathered
               from the forest. These products are particularly important for women-led
               households in many poor rural areas. NWFP extraction reduces risk and vul-
               nerability in two ways: as a diversification strategy, it provides households
               with a wider range of welfare-improving activities, and as a coping strategy, it
               provides food or income potential to balance consumption levels when agri-
               cultural or other outputs fall.3

               Key Actions: The World Bank will aim to ensure that the potential of NWFPs
               is properly assessed and fully embedded in broader forest investments. In
               most countries, the regulatory framework related to the management of
               NWFPs is often weak or overly complex, so that most activities are excluded
               from the formal sector. Building on the extensive work done over the past two
               decades on regulations for timber products, the World Bank will support
               countries that are willing to frame regulations that can better accompany the
               development of sustainable NWFP value chains (see box 2.3).

               Forest Biodiversity Protection
               Forests, especially primary forests, are among the most important reposito-
               ries for terrestrial biological diversity. Together, all types of forests offer
               diverse habitats for plants, animals, and microorganisms. Biodiversity
               presents opportunities for medicines, food, raw materials, and employment.

  Box 2.3  Non-Wood Forest Products: Economic Opportunity for
  Forest Communities in Brazil
  Forest-dependent communities are among the most marginalized in the world. Deforestation has
  an impact on their surroundings and livelihoods. A new Dedicated Grant Mechanism (DGM),
  designed by and for those communities and financed by the Forest Investment Program (FIP),
  puts indigenous peoples and local communities in charge of the design and funding decisions for
  projects that fight forest loss. The first DGM project implemented by the World Bank in Brazil
  ($6.5 million in FIP funding) helps finance agroforestry initiatives based on native and adapted
  fruits, pays for processing units for agriculture and non-wood forest products, and assists in the
  production and commercialization of handicrafts in the Cerrado region.




Significant gains have been made in conserving biodiversity, with roughly
12 percent of global forest area designated as protected areas. However, pro-
tected areas are increasingly isolated within productive landscapes across
the globe. For decades, a widely held view was that protected areas should
remain in a vacuum, separated from the people who live in and around
them, rooted in the notion that they should be set apart from the rest of the
landscape and that measures to protect biodiversity should remove anthro-
pogenic influences. This mindset has evolved and there is now a widespread
recognition that the only solutions to protected area management that work
are those that fully embrace the role of local communities and fit into a
broader land use model at the territorial level.4 In addition, biodiversity is
not only found in natural forests under protection status; biodiversity rep-
resents an essential element of production forests and trees in the landscape
(including plantations).

Key Actions: The WBG recognizes the importance of preserving forest wealth
and biodiversity. It will continue to support its clients’ efforts to establish and
manage their protected forest areas by helping them tap into designated
resources (such as the Global Environment Facility, GEF). The WBG has long
promoted an integrated approach to biodiversity in its portfolio. Under the
FAP, this trend will be reinforced with the push for more integrated interven-
tions, where protected areas are fully embedded into a broader landscape.

Nature-Based Tourism
Nature-based tourism (or ecotourism) is becoming an increasingly impor-
tant subsector in some developing countries, generating significant reve-
nues for governments and local communities. Natural forests and associated
biodiversity often feature high in nature-based tourism and are being pro-
moted as such by many developing countries. Preserving the wealth of for-
ests is a requisite, and degradation of forest landscapes undermines tourism
potential as well as other economic opportunities (see box 2.4).

Box 2.4  Nepal: Urgent Need to Rebuild Forest-Based Tourism
In 2013/14, 70 percent of all tourists in Nepal visited protected areas, ensuring that nature-based
tourism is the largest tourism contributor to the national economy. Seven of the 20 protected
areas in Nepal were damaged in the April 2015 earthquake: two of the top nature tourism
destinations (the World Heritage site Sagaramatha National Park and the Annapurna Conservation
Area) are among the seven affected protected areas. This leaves the local communities who live in
the buffer zones of protected areas and depend largely on tourism-related activities very vulnerable.

Restoration of nature-based tourism and community livelihoods in an integrated manner requires
urgent attention. Investments to revive the local economy and help communities in the buffer
zone to get back on their feet is an immediate need, not only for recovering from the earthquake,
but also for restoring and enhancing a principal source of economic growth in Nepal. In June
2015, the Government of Nepal requested World Bank support in restoring nature-based tourism
and livelihoods in and around the earthquake-affected protected areas.




               Key Actions: The WBG will support clients that are interested in material-
               izing the potential of nature-based tourism as a key contributor to their
               economies. To tap this potential, a coordinated approach is required to
               respond to various challenges—the regulatory framework, infrastructure
               (mostly transport and lodging), and professional skills as well as nature.
               The WBG is uniquely positioned to present comprehensive support to cli-
               ents that are interested in sustainable development of the nature-based
               tourism sector, through an appropriate set of technical skills as well as a
               financial package (combining International Bank for Reconstruction and
               Development (IBRD)/International Development Association (IDA)
               resources for productive investments, IFC resources for private engage-
               ment, MIGA guarantees for risk mitigation, and GEF grants for nature-
               based offers).

               Payment for Ecosystem Services
               Healthy forests and trees provide critical ecosystem services. However, the
               value of these services is ordinarily not quantified, and thus they are often
               overlooked in decision-making processes. Countries in Latin America,
               such as Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Mexico, have established pro-
               grams of payments for ecosystem services (PES) that put a monetary value
               on the services delivered by forests and trees. Such value is paid by the
               “users” of the services to the “forest dwellers” who preserve the forests and
               associated services. These PES programs have shown results in providing
               incentives for behaviors that support more sustainable management of for-
               est resources; in many countries, the programs have provided a significant
               contribution to incomes.
                 For the past two decades, the WBG has played a critical role in supporting
               the development of markets for ecosystem services and global public goods,

               World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20	                                             21
especially forest biodiversity. The WBG has supported the establishment
and further refinement of most of the existing PES schemes in place today
in Latin America. The ongoing work conducted under the Wealth Accounting
and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services (WAVES) initiative5 also helps
construct a better understanding of the value of the ecosystem services per-
formed by natural capital, such as forests, and could inform the develop-
ment of future PES schemes.

Key Actions: WBG engagement in this area is expected to grow. The World
Bank will continue to support the setup of PES schemes in interested coun-
tries. Demand is emerging from other regions (particularly Africa), and
technical support as well as cross-fertilization through South-South
exchange will be promoted. The World Bank will also continue to pilot inno-
vative models—for example, some teams are working on piloting direct cash
transfers to forest dwellers for sustainable forestry practices in South Asia
and Central Asia.

Performance-Based Payments under REDD+. The mechanism estab-
lished under the UNFCCC rewards developing countries for their efforts to
reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (Reducing
Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, Conservation of
Forest Stocks, Sustainable Management of Forests and Enhancement of
Forest Carbon Stocks, REDD+), promote sustainable management of for-
ests, and enhance forest carbon stocks. Phase 3 of this mechanism6 provides
payments for performance: payments are made for each ton of carbon (or
equivalent) that is not emitted to the atmosphere or that is sequestered
through forest ecosystems.
   With instruments such as the BioCarbon Fund (BioCF) and the Carbon
Fund of the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, the World Bank has been
pioneering results-based payments for verified GHG emission reductions
over the past decade. The experience from the first two tranches of the
BioCF has demonstrated that carbon payments can represent a substantial
addition to the disposable income of forest dwellers. Applying the lessons
learned from these pilots to the third tranche of the BioCF (the Initiative
for Sustainable Forest Landscapes, ISFL) and the Forest Carbon Partnership
Facility (FCPF) Carbon Fund, which both support large-scale REDD+ pro-
grams, the WBG will work on defining models that can scale up the poten-
tial of carbon transactions to combat climate change while o  ­ ffering forest
communities economic opportunities through sound ­           benefit-sharing
mechanisms.

Key Actions: With the increase in funding for climate action and interest in
performance-based payment mechanisms,7 the World Bank will aim to deploy
these instruments strategically to support client countries’ efforts toward a
low-carbon development trajectory. These instruments are a prominent fea-
ture in the WBG forest pipeline, form part of the programmatic approach,
and are likely to drive the portfolio in some key countries.8

Encourage Sustainable Plantations and Tree Planting
Economic development, coupled with population growth and urbanization,
increases the demand for forest products, which is projected to grow dramat-
ically in the coming decades. The annual demand for global industrial round-
wood is projected to quadruple by 2050, from 1.5 billion cubic meters in 2012
to 6 billion cubic meters (Indufor 2012). In Africa, there is no sign of a tem-
pering in the demand for wood-based energy.
   Natural forests alone will never meet these demands, nor should they—as
this would put them under significant risk and alter their long-term capacity
to deliver social and ecosystem services. At the same time, it is estimated that
worldwide about two billion hectares of forest landscapes have been degraded
or even lost. These could be restored to functional ecosystem services through
reforestation and tree planting, while delivering the triple win of improving
rural livelihoods and food security, increasing climate resilience, and helping
in the mitigation climate change (through sequestration of carbon and reduc-
tion of pressure on pristine forests).
   Since 2000, the area of planted forests has increased considerably.
Historically, most of the planted forests are found in northern countries, but
there are increasing investments in southern countries. In some countries
in Latin America, there has been an aggressive effort over the past decades,
primarily led by the private sector, to grow plantations. As a result, Brazil,
Mexico, Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay have 7.7 million, 0.9 million,
    million, 1.2 million, and 1.0 million hectares of planted forests, respec-
3.0 ­
tively (FAO 2015).
   When carefully designed and managed, planted forests can produce far
more timber per year and per hectare compared with natural forests, and
this can relieve pressure on natural forests/woodlands and preserve their
capacity to deliver ecosystem services. Planted forests can also represent
major opportunities for job creation and sustainable economic growth
in rural areas. However, examples of bad plantations are not uncommon.9
As the area of intensively managed plantations grows, and to ensure that
the (social, economic, and environmental) potential of planted forests
fully materializes, there is an urgent need to mainstream good plantation
practices.

Responsible Investments in Large-Scale Commercial Reforestation
As noted in chapter 1, net private financial flows to the forest sector in
developing countries are estimated to be as high as $15  billion per year
(Asen, Savenije, and Schmidt 2012). With the growing demand for timber
products and clear prospects that production is shifting from high-income
countries to developing countries, private investments will shape the way
forests are managed in developing countries. Although this development
offers tremendous potential for boosting the forest sector’s contribution to
the rural economy in those countries, it will need to be managed with strong
environmental and social safeguards for the investments to be sustainable
and equitable.

Key Actions: The WBG aims to help establish an attractive business climate
for private operators while setting high standards for responsible investments.
This specific area of engagement opens promising avenues to strengthen the
collaboration between the entities of the WBG by building on their respective
comparative advantages. The World Bank aims to work with governments to
define a sound regulatory framework that enables responsible investments in
commercial plantations, based on economically, socially, and environmen-
tally sound standards. In turn, the IFC will encourage investments of respon-
sible private operators, ensuring that such investments are economically
viable and profitable and measurably pro-poor.10 MIGA can unlock potential
investments by reducing the risks associated with them. Such collaboration
between the public and private sector arms of the WBG has already started in
a few countries, such as Colombia, Ethiopia, and Mozambique. It is expected
that this portfolio will expand in the next five years, as interest in commercial
plantations is growing in many countries.11


Smallholder Plantations and Tree Planting
Another interesting trend that has emerged over the past decade is tree plant-
ing and small-scale plantations in agricultural landscapes. Trees have become
an integral part of the agricultural landscape in all regions except North
Africa and West Asia. Virtually all of Central America’s agricultural land has
at least 10 percent tree cover, as does 82 percent of Southeast Asia’s, 81 percent
of South America’s, and 47 percent of Sub-Saharan Africa’s. Such dynamics
not only yield significant economic benefits through productivity increase,
they also generate environmental gains, including improved habitats and
connectivity for biodiversity as well as contributing to mitigating climate
change and adapting to its impact.
   A few countries have already supported smallholder plantations and tree
planting as a credible response to the growing local demand for timber prod-
ucts. For example, the Government of Vietnam launched a program to sup-
port the development of smallholder tree plantations as an alternative to
large-scale industrial-style plantations. Working with smallholders on small
plantations has shown significant—and measured—impacts on reducing
poverty directly and indirectly (see box 2.5).
   In African countries, private woodlots respond to the growing demand
for wood-based energy. The rising price of wood, caused in part by
increased demand and greater resource scarcity, can make the production
of wood on private woodlots an increasingly viable enterprise for farmers
across the region (see box 2.6). In addition to increased farm incomes, the
woodlots reduce farmers’ vulnerability to shocks (for example, price or cli-
mate shocks).

Key Actions: The World Bank will support client countries that want to set up
a conducive framework for small-scale plantations and tree planting in farm-
land. In particular, it will support clients in identifying and tackling barriers
to developing small-scale plantations and tree planting. Barriers can include

Box 2.5  Sustainably Managed Smallholder Plantations in Vietnam
A project to support the development of environmentally sustainable and commercially viable
smallholder tree plantations in Vietnam led to the cultivation of 76,500 hectares of previously
non-forested land by nearly 41,000 households, providing them with sustainable economic
revenues. The project provided positive financial returns to smallholder investors that significantly
contributed to reduce poverty in the targeted areas (for instance, Thua Thien Hue: from 6.4 to 8.9
percent; Quang Nam: from 22.8 to 18.2 percent; Quang Ngai: from 22.5 to 17.6 percent; and Binh
Dinh from 16.0 to 13.5 percent). The 2005–15 project, which received $48.5 million in funding
from the WBG, also promoted land tenure and financial access. The use of rotational harvesting
has made the plantations more sustainable. The project also successfully piloted a timber
certification program in a small section, from which timber with the certification earns a
30 percent premium. The project has contributed to broader achievements in land tenure and
inclusive finance. Some 29,000 households received land use rights certification, and loans
managed by a Vietnamese state-owned development bank were extended to more than 28,000
farming households, 98 percent of whom have met their repayments. The project included the
provision of technical assistance in business planning and harvesting.




Box 2.6  Senegal: Sustainable and Participatory Energy Project
(PROGEDE I)
The first phase of the Strengthening Public Expenditure Management Program/PROGEDE was
launched in 1997 and closed in December 2004, having fully achieved or surpassed all its
objectives and development outcomes and outputs. PROGEDE was rated as highly satisfactory.
The sustainable fuelwood supply management component of the project directly benefited some
250,000 people—equivalent to approximately 21 percent of the population in the Tambacounda
and Kolda regions. A sustainable incremental income generation base (wood and non-wood
products) of about $12.5 million per year was established, equivalent to $40,000 on average per
participating village. Of that total, more than $3.7 million (30 percent) resulted from women-led
economic activities.

The demand management and inter-fuel substitution options component of the project directly
benefited some 250,000 families (30 percent) in the principal urban and peri-urban areas of the
country, with a particular health (reduced indoor pollution) and time-saving benefit to women.
This component of the project also benefited several hundred urban-based traders, including
charcoal wholesalers, charcoal retailers, and stove artisans.




               insecure land/tree tenure, limited technical knowledge and financial capaci-
               ties of smallholders, and insufficient market information. Demand is emerg-
               ing from several countries—for example, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, and
               Ghana—that are willing to encourage small-scale plantations. Building on the
               experiences in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, the WBG stands ready

               World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20	                                             25
to support client countries’ efforts in that direction. There are also opportuni-
ties for encouraging local private sector investment in plantation establish-
ment. For example, in the Europe and Central Asia region, partnership
schemes are being developed between local private investors or user associa-
tions and state agencies to establish, manage, and harvest plantations and
orchards on state land.

Support Sustainable Forest Value Chains
To respond to the growing demand for timber, diversification of supply is
necessary but not sufficient. Developing and securing access to markets is
another key element. Taking value chains as an entry point focuses the atten-
tion on links to markets, which in turn can help create sustainable enterprises
and contribute to growth. This strategy opens opportunities for different
types of enterprises to respond to different types of markets through different
models.

Small and Medium-Size Forest Enterprises
SMFEs offer important opportunities to promote nonfarm employment in
rural areas, including for women, and to strengthen rural-urban links. SMFEs
are the primary source of forest sector employment in most developing coun-
tries. In some countries, SMFEs can account for up to 80–90 percent of
employment in all forest enterprises, formal and informal, and contribute to
a large share of the demand for timber at the domestic level. SMFEs can be a
means for accruing wealth locally, empowering local entrepreneurship,
strengthening social networks, and engendering local social and environ-
mental accountability.
   However, SMFEs often face internal limitations (technical, organiza-
tional, and financial) as well regulatory or bureaucratic hurdles, inadequate
or biased policies, insecure operating environment or access to resources,
poor market information, difficult access to credit, inadequate technology
and advice, and poor infrastructure. These limitations impede SMFEs from
fully materializing their potential to grow, create jobs, and provide goods
and services that benefit rural communities and the markets they serve
(see box 2.7).

Key Actions: Building on the experience gained in some countries, such as
Mexico, the WBG will give increasing attention to SMFEs and work on
addressing the various constraints they face to unlock their potential to gen-
erate wealth and jobs. In particular, the WBG will join forces (the Environment
and Natural Resources and Trade and Competitiveness Global Practices
(GPs) as well as IFC and MIGA) to support the development of SMFEs. In
particular, it will help them to tap the investment and  technical capacity
needed to overcome their constraints (technical and organizational), as well
as identify and access promising markets. As a starting point, three GPs
launched a program of analytical work on SMFEs in early 2016, with financ-
ing from the Program on Forests (PROFOR).

Box 2.7  Competitiveness of Community Forest Enterprises
in Mexico
In Mexico, some 80 percent of forests are owned by local communities and indigenous people,
giving forestland ownership a strong social nature. In the past 25 years, many Mexican forest
communities have managed to develop reasonably successful commercial community forest
enterprises based on timber and non-timber products. Some of these are among the world’s most
advanced examples of commercial community forestry. Yet, Mexico’s forest resources are far from
meeting their potential for alleviating poverty and contributing to local development and the
national economy. And the large majority of forest communities globally runs even less-
advanced forest businesses.

A 2012 study, financed by the Program on Forests, evaluated the economic and financial viability,
sustainability, and competitiveness of 30 community forestry enterprises in Mexico. The analysis
showed that although most of the enterprises were competitive, high production costs associated
with their remoteness and the low level of mechanization proved to be constraints, and some
enterprises were jeopardizing their long-term sustainability by overharvesting. The study
informed policy actions that were undertaken by the government to assist communities in
improving their competitiveness.

                  Private Investments in Forest Value Chains
                  In new and emerging economies, investments in the forest sector are usually
                  integrated, covering the different links of the value chain, from production to
                  processing and marketing (as a strategy to mitigate the risks). Such integrated
                  value chains can take various forms: they can be exclusively managed by the
                  investing operator or build on partnerships with smallholders (out-grower
                  schemes). If properly managed, partnerships between smallholders and
                  large-scale operators can yield positive development results. However,
                  although private financing is promising, obstacles to investments (including
                  high risks, real and perceived) have hampered the full materialization of the
                  potential so far in most developing countries.12

                  Key Actions: Private investment represents a great opportunity for the enti-
                  ties of the WBG to come together to support responsible investments in forest
                  value chains. The World Bank can help establish investment environments
                  that are conducive to investors; the IFC can partner with responsible private
                  sector investors to expand investment in the forest value chain; and MIGA
                  can mitigate the potential risks associated with investments in the forest sec-
                  tor. Under this key action area, the IFC will lead WBG engagement in invest-
                  ing in integrated value chains:13 This engagement can involve small- and
                  large-scale operators and bring together communities and companies through
                  partnership arrangements, build small and medium-size enterprises, or
                  enable socially responsible corporate investments. The following priority

Mexico, Mozambique, and Tanzania for forest/wood products, and Brazil,

Focus Area 2: Forest-Smart Interventions in other
Economic Sectors
Forests are part of a broader landscape. It would be unrealistic to assume that
changes in forests would have no impact on other land uses and on people
living in the landscape and vice versa. For example, forest loss can lead to
increased erosion and silt loads in hydropower reservoirs. At the same time,
forests deliver ecosystem services that are essential for sustaining growth in
economic sectors such as agriculture, energy, and mining. Sustainably man-
aged forests can deliver important revenue streams to national treasuries. To
address the global forest challenge, forests would need to become an integral
part of national development.
   Acknowledging the interlinkages between forests and other land uses, the
WBG aims to support its clients’ pursuit of a forest-smart development tra-
jectory through an integrated landscape approach. Such an approach pro-
vides the organizing principle for investing in land use management, based
on rational spatial planning and socioeconomic considerations (see box 2.8).




  Box 2.8  The Sahel and West Africa Program: Example of
  an Integrated Landscape Approach
  The Sahel and West Africa Program (SAWAP) is a flagship for the integrated landscape approach.
  The program uses a geographic and socioeconomic approach to connecting protected areas,
  forestlands, woodlands, agro-silvo-pastoral lands, croplands, and irrigated agricultural lands, to
  help secure a robust mix of primary and secondary ecosystem services from the landscape mosaic
  while enhancing adaptive capacity and resilience to climate change. Through farmer-managed
  sustainable land and water management and natural regeneration practices, the program is
  expected to transform African drylands into more productive and resilient ecosystems—­re-­greening
  the Sahel landscapes and helping communities build their resilience.

  SAWAP, under the TerrAfrica platform, is a $1.1 billion flexible investment umbrella in support
  of the Great Green Wall Initiative, which is addressing land degradation in a region from Senegal
  on the Atlantic coast to Djibouti on the Red Sea. The program has under implementation 12
  country-led, multisector investment operations in Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana,
  Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, and Togo—allowing connectivity at the ecosys-
  tem, national, and regional levels. Notably, the program has also provided an opportunity to com-
  bine financing (International Development Association, Global Environment Facility, Forest
  Carbon Partnership Facility, government contributions, and other trust funds) to build a compre-
  hensive financial package—thus ensuring a long-term, programmatic, and coordinated approach
  to investing in resources and ecosystems to address landscape priorities.


28	                                 World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20
The forest-smart approach clarifies the dynamics between various land uses,
including forests, and is essential for successfully enhancing landscape
­productivity and resilience in a sustainable manner. Supporting forest-smart
 interventions will not only ensure that adverse impacts on forests and
 their biodiversity are avoided or minimized, but also will proactively seek
 win-win solutions where both are fully integrated in the design of the
 interventions.
    While the first focus area can be seen as the “traditional” WBG engage-
 ment in the forest sector, this second focus area offers new perspectives and
 forms of engagement at the territorial level. This focus area responds to the
 growing demand from client countries that are looking for new mecha-
 nisms to understand and address the trade-offs between land uses, and to
 come up with integrated solutions. Under its new organizational structure,
 striving for multidisciplinary coordination to tackle complex development
 problems, the WBG is uniquely positioned to deliver on this ambitious
 agenda. Together with the Climate Change Cross-Cutting Solutions Areas
 (CCSA), the Sustainable Development Practice Group sets the foundation
 for bringing to client countries the best knowledge and technical expertise
 on planning and managing the interaction among various land uses
 (­
  agriculture, forestry/agroforestry, mining, energy, and transport) in a
 multidisciplinary and coordinated manner. In addition, Focus Area 2 pro-
 vides an  opportunity to pursue a coordinated public/private approach to
 forest-smart Investments, through enhanced coordination between the
 ­
 World Bank, IFC,14 and MIGA.
    The FAP proposes a two-pronged approach to forest-smart interventions:
upstream and strategic analysis of potential trade-offs between economic
growth and forest protection, and a coordinated approach to deliver opera-
tions that fully embed forest dimensions in design and implementation.

Inform Decision Making on Land Use
For development to be forest-smart, decisions about investments in forests
and other economic sectors would need to be guided by comprehensive,
ex ante, and robust information on potential trade-offs for forests, includ-
ing  opportunities for restoration. Avoiding unnecessary trade-offs would
require, as appropriate and feasible, upstream analysis and strategic envi-
ronmental and social assessments of proposed investment options and their
potential impact on forests. This approach also enables the identification of
additional development co-benefits that can be incorporated into planned
interventions.

Forests as a Key Element of the Sustainable Development Agenda
The WBG aims to help client countries define a long-term development
path that can be achieved without irreversibly jeopardizing their forests and
the services they deliver. To do this, a good understanding is required of the
true value of standing forests and their biodiversity, as well as the land use
change dynamics at the landscape level. When externalities are actively

World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20	                               29
 addressed and managed, it is more feasible to find no-regret options or
­win-win solutions.

Key Actions: The WBG will continue to expand the use of analytical tools,
notably through the WAVES initiative and natural capital accounting, to help
assess the value of forest capital and its contribution to the national economy
through the production of goods (timber and non-timber) as well as the pro-
vision of key ecosystem services that sustain the broader economy.
   Specifically, the Environment and Natural Resources GP, with support from
other GPs and in coordination with respective country management units
(CMUs), will develop a series of succinct but comprehensive Country Forest
Notes on the status of forests, and provide options to minimize the trade-offs
on forests by assessing the potential adverse impacts of sector investments on
natural forests. This effort will also highlight opportunities for improved land
use management, especially through restoration. Whenever possible, these
notes will directly feed into the strategic diagnosis exercises conducted at the
national level, and will inform WBG engagement in priority countries. The
notes will enable more innovative and integrated upstream analysis of invest-
ments and policies, which seeks to deliver on a broader range of development
benefits. A key objective of this  strategic analysis is to define investment
options that are not achieved at the expense of forests.15 The strategy is to
avoid locking countries into pathways that may lead to irreversible conver-
sion of land, such as the destruction of natural forests. It also aims at identify-
ing potential win-win options across sectors, including through the restoration
of degraded ­ forested lands.
   The notes will build on the extensive knowledge generated through the
preparation of the national REDD+ strategies that the World Bank is cur-
rently supporting in 38 countries.16 It is expected that by 2020, at least
20 Country Forest Notes17 would be prepared. Financing for these exercises
will be leveraged from different sources, particularly existing forest-related
trust funds (such as the FCPF, BioCF, Forest Investment Program (FIP), and
PROFOR), but also, when available, from the World Bank’s budget.


Land Use Planning
Land use planning is a key exercise to maximize economic and environmen-
tal outcomes and reduce conflicts resulting from overlapping usage. Trade-
offs among different sectors and within sectors need to be carefully assessed
and clearly understood by stakeholders. This understanding will help in
defining management strategies at the territorial level through a continuum
of various land uses that support productive activities while preserving the
long-term capacity of natural capital to deliver goods and services. Land use
planning calls for a geographic and socioeconomic approach to managing
land, water, and forest resources in a sustainable manner. The approach
requires long-term collaboration among land managers, land users, and other
stakeholders, to achieve the objectives of economic growth and provision of
ecosystem services while protecting human well-being.

30	                                 World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20
   To achieve effective land use planning, appropriate tools and capacities
would need to be developed and applied to provide a comprehensive under-
standing of current and optimal land use options. Geospatial tools are already
used by many sectors, but data are often not shared with other stakeholders
nor integrated into comprehensive maps.18 Decision-making processes thus
often rely on partial and sometimes outdated information.19 This situation
results in many overlapping land uses, which may lead to conflicts. Cross-
sector platforms and information sharing are prerequisites to foster integrated
territorial landscape planning, defining clear boundaries across the various
land uses. Innovative ICT tools can facilitate the integration of databases and
equip governments and stakeholders with the necessary tools to support land
use planning.
   Good land use plans should give particular attention to protecting high-
value forests (in biodiversity, watershed functions, carbon stocks, and cultural
values, in particular). Optimally, economic development that triggers forest
conversion should be directed away from high-value forests. The land use
planning exercise can help identify those forest areas that need to be preserved,
areas that can coexist with other land uses, and areas that could potentially be
converted into other uses. Spatial planning can also help gear the potential
development of economic activities toward degraded lands. This is particu-
larly relevant to the agribusiness sector where prioritization of agribusiness
development on degraded lands could avoid the need for costly and uncertain
mitigation schemes to compensate for lost forest resources. Another key ben-
efit of land use planning is the possibility to define aggregated biodiversity
offset schemes. For sectors such as mining and infrastructure, the impacts on
high-biodiversity forest areas are sometimes not avoidable. To achieve “net
gains” from forest biodiversity and after avoidance and other forms of mitiga-
tion have been pursued, compensation of impacts through biodiversity offsets
may be needed. But biodiversity offsets are expensive for any single private or
public sector actor to implement alone. Through land use planning, the gov-
ernment can identify aggregated biodiversity offset schemes ex ante.20

Key Actions: The WBG will support clients that are willing to understand the
interlinkages between the different land uses and assess ex ante the potential
impacts (positive and negative) on forests so that decision-making processes
related to spatial land use planning are better informed. Such strategic work
has been conducted at the level of the Congo Basin (covering Cameroon, the
Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial
Guinea, Gabon, and the Republic of Congo) to project the impacts on forest
cover of various economic scenarios on a 2030 horizon (see box 2.9).
   The WBG will support its client countries in their efforts to build up land
use planning as a key tool to maximize economic, social, and environmental
outcomes. Such plans would clarify the various uses of land (based on the
most up-to-date information related to population settlements, status of
the existing forests, level of degradation, and potential productive capacity of
the land). The plans would also contribute to reducing problems resulting
from overlapping usage titles (and potentially conflicting land uses).

  Box 2.9  Modeling Deforestation Trends in the Congo Basin to
  Inform Policy Makers
  The population of the Congo Basin is expected to double between 2000 and 2030, to 170 million.
  The people will need food, energy, shelter, and employment. Historically, deforestation rates
  in the Congo Basin have been among the lowest in the tropical rainforest belt. Local and regional
  development, population growth, and global demand for commodities are likely to increase
  deforestation and forest degradation in the Congo Basin. Although subsistence activities, such as
  small-scale agriculture and fuelwood collection, are currently the main causes of deforestation
  and degradation in the basin, new threats are expected to emerge.

  During 2012–13, a study was conducted to analyze deforestation dynamics in the Congo Basin
  and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The study combined a modeling exercise
  with a qualitative analysis of trends in different sectors (in particular, agriculture and transport),
  and included a dialogue with experts from the region. The main results suggest that pressures on
  forests are likely to increase significantly because of a combination of various factors, including
  growing population, conversion into agricultural uses for major crops, and enhancement of road
  networks.

  The Congo Basin countries are now at a crossroads. They are not yet locked into a development
  path that will necessarily come at a high cost to forests. They can define a new path toward forest-
  friendly growth. The question is how to match economic change with smart measures and policy
  choices so that the Congo Basin countries can grow while maintaining their extraordinary natural
  assets over the long term—in other words, how they can leapfrog the traditional dip in forest
  cover that is usually observed in the forest transition curve. A series of recommendations has
  been discussed with representatives of the Congo Basin countries and is now undergoing more
  in-depth assessment at the country level.

  Such work on land use planning also has the potential to ease the IFC’s
work with private sector investments. The IFC’s Performance Standard 6
requires mining, infrastructure, agribusiness, and other projects to achieve a
“net gain” when affecting high-biodiversity forest areas that are considered
critical habitat. Net gains are difficult to achieve without ex ante planning by
governments to avoid impacts, as far as possible, on the highest-biodiversity
value forests in the landscape.

Deliver on Forest-Smart Operations
The very nature of forests (and their associated services) gives them a special
place in the WBG portfolio that spans different GPs (such as Agriculture;
Water; Energy and Extractives; Social, Urban, Rural, and Resilience (SURR);
and Transport) (see appendix A on Learning from the World Bank Group’s
Forest Portfolio). Cross-GP collaboration will support forest-smart interven-
tions that will offer solutions to complex challenges related to potentially

32	                                   World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20
                 competing land uses, helping the GPs to define operational responses to the
                 various dimensions of rural development. Particular focus will be on:
                 ••   Ensuring that interventions in land-based sectors (such as agriculture,
                      hydroelectric energy, extractive industries, and transport) are done in a
                      forest-smart way—that is, they consider avoiding or minimizing their
                      potential adverse impact on forests.
                 ••   Proactively seeking win-win solutions where forests and trees are fully
                      integrated in the design of the operation and contribute to its objective of
                      development, along with identifying opportunities for additional devel-
                      opment co-benefits.

                 Key Actions: Per the World Bank’s Safeguard Policies21 and the IFC’s
                 Performance Standards, all projects are systematically reviewed early in the
                 project preparation process for identification of potential adverse impacts on
                 forests. Through the Safeguard Policies and Performance Standards, the WBG
                 is committed to ensuring that any adverse impacts are avoided to the maxi-
                 mum extent possible or otherwise minimized, mitigated, and offset wherever
                 possible. In addition, through different trust funds, innovative tools are being
                 developed to help task teams better understand the indirect and induced
                 potential impacts on forests, and thus design operations that fully embed this
                 dimension (see box 2.10). For example, in Latin America and the Caribbean,
                 a knowledge platform has been developed to support environmentally sus-
                 tainable infrastructure construction.22




Box 2.10  New Tools to Inform Decision Making on Infrastructure—
Example from Road Rehabilitation in the Democratic
Republic of Congo
Transport infrastructure in the Democratic Republic of Congo is among the sparsest and most
dilapidated in the world. There is thus an urgent need to improve interprovincial as well as intra-
provincial connectivity to promote trade and economic cohesion. Infrastructure investments in
long-lived assets, such as roads, have the potential to shape the development of the Democratic
Republic of Congo for generations to come. This suggests the need for careful planning and
holistic decision-making tools that take into account the wide range of direct and induced
impacts.

Transport, Economic Growth, and Deforestation in the Democratic Republic of Congo—A Spatial
Analysis developed a methodology to help planners make better informed decisions to identify
trade-offs and maximize net welfare benefits. The approach draws from the state of the art across
a variety of disciplines—spatial (geographic information system) analysis, spatial econometrics,
economic theory, and conservation biology—to create an approach and set of tools that can guide
the location and level of investments by estimating benefits and environmental costs at a highly
disaggregated spatial scale.

  Beyond safeguards and standards, the WBG aims to promote forest-smart
multisector programs: the new organizational structure, based on sector GPs
and the CCSA, aims to enable effective delivery of multisector solutions tai-
lored to country-specific needs. The interlinkages between forests and other
sectors have been assessed in detail in some countries, for instance forest and
agriculture (see box 2.11), forests and roads in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (see box 2.12), and forests and extractives in the Congo Basin and West
African countries (see boxes 2.13 and 2.14). It is expected that by 2020, the
WBG would have supported about 10 countries in developing and imple-
menting large-­scale, multisector programs promoting forest-smart develop-
ment, mobilizing various sources of financing (IDA/IBRD, climate funds, and
other trust funds).

Agriculture and Water
By 2050, the world will need to produce around 50 percent more food than it
does now to feed the world’s estimated 9.6 billion people. Globally, deforesta-
tion has largely been driven by the demand for new agricultural land. Without
significant structural changes in the way food systems are expanded in devel-
oping countries, this added burden of food production poses significant
threats to the world’s forests. Forest loss brings with it biodiversity loss and
disturbances to local and global water systems, which can put water supplies
and food security at risk.
   The fact that agriculture is the leading driver of deforestation globally has
created a significant impetus for looking at “forests” much more broadly,
through the landscape lens. The landscape approach blurs the traditional
frontiers between farms and forests. Rather, through integrated management
of land and water resources, it fosters the vision of a continuum of various
activities that are all interlinked and interdependent, spanning crop produc-
tion, cattle ranching, land restoration, forest production, and protected areas.
Under such a landscape approach, water is often the underlying element that
guides decisions on land use.

Key Actions: Over the past few years, the portfolio on integrated landscape
management has grown significantly, building on the complementary exper-
tise of various GPs and the Climate Change CCSA (CC-CCSA). The portfolio
combines activities that aim to introduce trees in farmland (through agrofor-
estry and/or silvopastoralism) or to change agricultural practices so that they
do not come at the expense of natural forests (toward reduced or zero net
deforestation). The WBG is currently preparing a series of landscape pro-
grams in about 20 countries (see examples in box 2.11). Forests and trees are
usually a key dimension of integrated landscape management. The interac-
tion can be through the planting of trees, the reforesting of degraded river
basins to restore key ecosystem services, or the transformation of key agricul-
tural commodity value chains toward zero net deforestation. As the WBG
becomes more engaged in this business line, it is expected that more models
of interventions will arise as a tailored response to country needs. Demand is
rapidly growing from client countries to deliver integrated solutions to rural
development. Collaboration with the Agriculture, Water, and  SURR GPs is
central to delivering on this agenda, as well as with the CC-CCSA, as most of
the programs are expected to have a “climate finance” window.

Infrastructure (Transport, Dams, and Hydropower)
Through forest-smart investments in infrastructure, the WBG aims to mini-
mize the potential negative impacts of infrastructure on natural forests (directly
or indirectly through the economic activities it can stimulate) and to maximize
the positive impacts of associated forest interventions (“green infrastructure”).

Transport. One of the most important infrastructure investments in the
developing world is transport, including roads, airports, rail, and seaports.

World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20	                                   35
Transport sector infrastructure investments are critical to improve the
mobility of goods and people, and to facilitate trade and commerce in an
increasingly interconnected world. Furthermore, transport is an enabling
infrastructure for other types of infrastructure. However, the provision and
operation of transport infrastructure can come with significant negative
impacts on forests.23 The direct impacts (such as the direct footprint or clear-
ing land for road or other transport infrastructure construction) can be eas-
ily identified and mitigated (through compensation plantations).24 The
indirect and induced cumulative impacts resulting from boosting economic
activities in the areas served by transportation have a potentially much larger
scope and are much more complicated to quantify.
   The vast majority of the WBG’s current transport portfolio involves reha-
bilitation of existing surface transport infrastructure rather than the con-
struction of new infrastructure. This is to maximize the use of existing
infrastructure in capacity and cost effectiveness and efficiency. Although
rehabilitation investments may come with minimal direct impacts (because
of preexisting structures), they can drastically change the economic profile of
the areas affected, and generate significant induced impacts on natural forests
in the medium and longer term. A recent study on the upgrading of existing
roads (from very poor to good condition) found near complete deforestation
within a narrow radius of about 1–1.5  kilometers straddling the road
(Damania and Wheeler 2015; box 2.10). The magnitudes of these impacts
differ significantly, depending on the type of transportation mode (road, rail-
way, or fluvial) that is being improved.
   Cross-drainage investments are a major cost factor in transport projects,
such as roads and rails, and appropriate forest management in the upstream
catchments of stream and river crossings can reduce the risks of erosion and
landslides on linear transportation infrastructure. For port infrastructure, sil-
tation management in upstream catchments and enhanced management of
mangroves and other coastal systems can significantly reduce adverse impacts
in the event of coastal storms.

  The main goal of the project was to rehabilitate and improve approximately 3,000 kilometers of
  non-paved roads in the Democratic Republic of Congo, connecting several provinces (Equateur,
  Oriental, Maniema, Nord and South-Kivu, and Katanga) in the heart of the Congo Basin’s pristine
  forest. The project incorporated fairly robust mitigation measures, involving particularly close
  and proactive engagement with local communities. A whole component of the project was
  dedicated to participatory land use planning and sustainable livelihood opportunities. It included
  participatory mapping of existing forest use, support for local initiatives for community forest
  income-generating activities, and agricultural intensification.

Key Actions: There are various ways to move transportation investments
toward forest-smart investments.
••   At the design stage, the use of SESAs, building on spatial and economic
     prospective analysis, can be instrumental in modeling the induced impacts
     on forests and identifying alternatives that could lessen such impacts. For
     instance, trajectories can be adjusted to avoid ecosystems with high-­
     biodiversity value. Such an upstream analysis can also unveil the options
     for a multimodal network as an alternative to all-roads. SESAs should
     seek to minimize forest fragmentation, which diminishes the resilience of
     forest systems and has an impact on certain types of biodiversity.
••   When adverse impacts on forests and biodiversity have been identified,
     specific activities can be embedded in the design of the operation to mit-
     igate such impacts. One example of good practice integrating the forest
     dimension into a transport infrastructure investment is the Pro-Routes
     Project for the Democratic Republic of Congo. This project shows how a
     constraint (sensitivity to the value of forest areas and forest-dependent
     communities) was turned into an opportunity for a more creative solu-
     tion, bringing together experts from various sectors (see box 2.12)
••   Where appropriate, landscaping plans and investments can be added to
     the design and implementation of infrastructure projects.25 For example,
     in Kazakhstan, a forest project under preparation will help establish shel-
     terbelts alongside new or improved roads. This will help reduce road
     maintenance costs by lessening the need for sand removal during sum-
     mer and snow removal during winter.


Dams and Hydropower. As demand for water regulation, irrigation, and
energy access increases, more investments in dams and hydropower facilities
are being made in developing countries. These investments provide services
to growing populations and economies, but they can impose a significant toll
on forests. For example, in the case of large dams, the area of inundation can
submerge forests, adversely affecting several of the services they provide.26
The requirement to address this forest loss (such as through the planting and
care of offset areas) varies widely across and even within countries. There can
also be induced adverse impacts on forests from access roads or associated
irrigation or transmission systems.
   Investing in forests can help lengthen the lifespans of these investments
or lower their maintenance costs. The productivity and sustainability of
investments in system storage (for example, for irrigation, water supply, or
multipurpose dams or hydropower—storage-backed and run-of-the-river)
are intrinsically linked to the health of their catchments. Well-forested
catchments27 often provide many regulating ecosystem services in terms of
erosion reduction, sediment management, and some attenuation of flood
peaks through improved interception and infiltration into groundwater.28
Deforestation changes the catchment hydrology and can increase erosion,
affecting performance by reducing the effective storage and life of the dam
as the sediment fills the live storage/pondage.

World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20	                                37
Key Actions: Most investments in dams and hydropower plants already come
with catchment/watershed plans that identify activities for afforestation,
reforestation, community woodlots, agroforestry, and so on, that can
improve the relevant services provided by forests to the investments.
Specific attention will be given to the actual implementation of those plans
(with more systematic monitoring). In addition, the Environment and
Natural Resources GP, along with the CC-CCSA, will support task teams in
identifying potential innovative financing (such as for climate mitigation
and adaptation or GEF), to enhance forest-related investments in the asso-
ciated watersheds.


Wood-Based Energy
Fuelwood represents the main source of energy for cooking and sterilizing
food for about 2.4 billion people in developing countries, and it is likely to
remain so in future decades. In Sub-Saharan Africa,29 estimates in the
World Energy Outlook 2010 predicted that by 2030, more than 900 million
people might rely on wood-based biomass energy (IEA 2010). The princi-
pal use of fuelwood is by households for cooking and heating, although
commercial and industrial use is increasing sharply (for example, in restau-
rants, bakeries, coffee and tea processing, the textile industry, and cement
production). Representing 60–80 percent of total wood consumption in
developing countries, fuelwood often accounts for up to 50–90 percent of
all energy used.
   The fuelwood sector in many developing countries operates informally
and inefficiently, using outdated technologies, which limits the benefits to
communities and delivers little official revenue to the government. The
unsustainable harvesting of fuelwood to supply large urban and industrial
markets can contribute to forest degradation and deforestation. Indoor air
pollution caused by smoke from burning firewood is known to lead to severe
health problems. The World Health Organization estimates that 4.3 million
deaths a year worldwide are attributed to diseases associated with cooking
and heating with solid fuels, with a particularly high toll on children and
women30 (WHO 2008). Traditional cookstoves are also an important con-
tributor to climate change and account for more than 20 percent of global
black carbon emissions.
   Despite the fact that commercial fuelwood markets involve significant lev-
els of finance and provide an important source of income through the supply
chain, wood-based energy still does not receive the level of attention com-
mensurate with the problem in most developing countries.31 The situation is
very different in other regions of the world, where wood is now seen as a
modern and efficient source of energy. Many countries in the European Union
and North America use wood energy in the form of chips or pellets, where it
can be a clean and carbon-neutral fuel alternative to fossil fuels.32 With
increasing demand for wood energy in high-income economies, the global
trade in wood energy products, such as wood chips and pellets, has steadily
increased in recent years.

Key Actions: The WBG aims to support modernization of the wood energy
sector in developing countries. To do so, a coordinated approach is needed to
transform this sector, and actions need to be taken all along the value chain,
from the promotion of sustainable production of wood to the dissemination
of clean cookstoves. The Energy GP, together with the Environment and
Natural Resources and Health GPs, has recently launched a program on
Efficient, Clean Cooking and Heating, under the Energy Sector Management
Assistance Program.
   This area of intervention is of particular importance in Africa and South
Asia. With the right blend of political will, carefully targeted technical and
financial support, and a renewed focus on enabling frameworks, the next
5–10 years could be a turning point for the wood-based energy sector. The
World Bank has already had successful experiences with the fuelwood supply
chain (see box 2.6 on Senegal). Important new developments include the
emergence of new, cleaner cooking solutions (stoves and fuels), innovations
in business models, and increased support for the clean cooking agenda from
the public health community, governments, and development partners.
   In countries in Europe and Central Asia, the WBG will continue support-
ing expansion of the use of wood-based energy as an alternative and clean
source of energy. In Belarus, for example, the Biomass District Heating Project
($90 million) is scaling up the efficient use of renewable biomass in heat and
electricity generation, by investing in biomass boilers and wood chipping
equipment in some municipalities. This is complemented by the Belarus
Forestry Development Project ($43.5 million), which is investing in modern
harvesting equipment and wood chippers, to increase the production of
woody biomass from forests, through utilization of currently under-thinned
young and mid-aged forests and an increase in the use of felling waste for the
production of woody biomass.


Extractive Industries
All forest-covered mining countries face existing and potential land use
conflicts between mining, forestry, and conservation. Mining permits and
forest concessions often overlap. This is largely because of inconsistent levels
of transparency and coordination across the natural resource sectors, and
lack of clear land use planning at the territorial level. In addition, many for-
esters have found artisanal mining camps inside their concessions. Despite
strong government focus on large-scale mining, the artisanal and small-­
scale mining sector is still by far the largest mining sector in most develop-
ing countries (in employment, mostly informal) and can conflict with forest
activities.
   Although extractives industries can be confined to a specific geographical
space, mining operations are often associated with other developments, in
particular linear infrastructure, but also towns, hydropower dams, and so on,
which can put pressure on natural forests. When looking at the overall impact
of mining operations on forest landscapes, it is important to go beyond tradi-
tional assessments of direct impacts and take an integrated landscape-level

World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20	                                39
planning approach, which includes an analysis of the potential long-term and
induced impacts on people and forests.
   The responsible reclamation of mining sites offers an opportunity for
reforestation by reestablishing productive forests on mined lands. Such activ-
ities can generate economic value for landowners and communities, as well as
enhance environmental integrity, by accelerating the restoration of ecosystem
services, such as watershed protection, water quality enhancement, carbon
storage, and wildlife habitat.33

Key Actions: The WBG will continue to extend its analytical support to cli-
ents to inform decision-making processes on mining operations, including
reclamation plans. A series of analytical works supported by the World Bank
is already ongoing, exploring innovative approaches to help developing coun-
tries optimize the use of their mineral potential without jeopardizing forest
capital or the rights and interests of communities. SESAs can also be instru-
mental in orienting the design of mining operations, as well as the associated
infrastructure (see box 2.13).
   The concept of aggregated biodiversity offsets is especially relevant to the
mining sector. As the mineral resource is not movable, impacts on high-­
biodiversity forest areas are sometimes unavoidable. The IFC’s Performance
Standard requirements for biodiversity are onerous for companies in coun-
tries that lack an enabling environment provided through the government.
Aggregated offset schemes would benefit the conservation of forest resources
and unlock business potential in many countries, notably in West Africa,
where governments are aggressively pursuing mineral development with little
regard to forests (see box 2.14).




  Box 2.13  Promoting Forest-Smart Interventions in the Mining
  Sector—Examples in Africa
  The project Balancing Mining Development and Forest Conservation in the Congo Basin focuses
  on developing analytical tools and processes to help the Government of the Republic of Congo
  develop a strategy for the sustainable development of the TRIDOM region—an area in the heart
  of the Congo Basin that is rich in mineral ore deposits and biodiversity. In the Democratic
  Republic of Congo, the World Bank is supporting the development of tools and standards for
  extractive industries on REDD+ and forest conservation, to promote mitigation impacts through
  effective and efficient strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest
  degradation during exploration, exploitation, and rehabilitation activities.

  The West Africa Minerals Sector Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA) estab-
  lished a multi-stakeholder policy dialogue at the community, national, and regional levels. By
  developing spatial planning tools and emphasizing environmental considerations, such as pre-
  serving the integrity of the Upper Guinea Forest, as well as social considerations, such as increas-
  ing the transparency in access to land for mining activities, the SESA was able to create support
  for a regional approach to mining development in the Manu River Union.

Box 2.14  National Biodiversity Offsets Scheme: Road Map for
Liberia’s Mining Sector
In Liberia, the mining sector has the potential to become a significant engine for growth,
reconstruction, and broader-based development. Yet, the sector can also be a threat to the last
extensive forest areas in West Africa. The Guinean Forest, which runs through Liberia, originally
covered an estimated 1,265,000 square kilometers, but only one-tenth of the original vegetation
remains.

In close coordination with Liberian forest and conservation authorities, the World Bank devel-
oped the report A Road Map for a National Biodiversity Offsets Scheme for Liberia, Focusing on
the Mining Sector. The report recommends the application of a common methodology to be
used by all (mining) companies, to ensure that the conservation offsets they are implementing
are coordinated at the national level to increase their cumulative impact and follow the national
interest, rather than being done disjointedly on an investment-by-investment basis.

                      The WBG aims to help client countries define an approach that fully real-
                   izes the potential of artisanal mining in an economically, socially, and envi-
                   ronmentally sound manner, so that artisanal mining can contribute to
                   employment opportunities as well as state revenues, with minimized impact
                   on the environment. In Gabon, Liberia, and Madagascar, for example, inno-
                   vative approaches to engaging artisanal and small-scale mining communities
                   that are operating in protected forest landscapes were examined; the goal was
                   to go beyond policies of expulsion and move toward sustainable management.
                   As a result, there are fewer impacts on people’s livelihoods and the environ-
                   ment. In Brazil and Colombia, environmental management of artisanal min-
                   ing sites was part of a Mining and Energy Technical Assistance. There is also
                   interest from some client countries, particularly in the Africa and Europe and
                   Central Asia regions, to support reforestation to reclaim old mining sites and
                   transform the areas into functional ecosystems.



                   Cross-Cutting Themes
                   Climate Change and Resilience
                   Maintaining and/or restoring healthy forests is key to tackling the climate
                   change challenge and providing a safety net for local communities, especially
                   the most vulnerable groups in society. Climate finance has the potential to be
                   transformational in how forested areas are valued and used.34
                      Forests are now recognized as a key contributor to climate change mitiga-
                   tion through their capacity to sequester carbon from the atmosphere.
                   Scientific knowledge and methodological tools have built up over the past
                   decade, which led to the formal inclusion of REDD+ in the 2015 Paris

                   World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20	                                     41
Agreement. As a result, more than 90 countries included forest and land use
changes in their NDCs to address climate change.
  While the global community has focused in the first instance on reducing
forest loss and degradation, there is now greater focus on how to reverse these
processes and build productive and resilient landscapes that contribute to
countries’ development objectives while addressing the climate change chal-
lenge. Restoring degraded lands and enhancing the connectivity between
ecosystems, including forests, will be critical to building productive and resil-
ient landscapes.

Key Actions: The interventions proposed under this cross-cutting theme are
fully aligned with the WBG Climate Change Action Plan. Over the past few
years, the WBG has positioned itself as a key actor on ­ forest-based climate
change mitigation, mainly through the management of large trust funds, such
as the FCPF, FIP, and BioCF (for a total amount of more than $2 billion; see
table A.3 in appendix A). The WBG will aim to maintain a leading role, par-
ticularly through piloting new intervention models and large-scale programs
that promote the sustainable management of forest landscapes and contribute
to low-carbon and resilient development trajectories in rural areas. The IFC’s
Sustainable Business Advisory group will continue to work directly with firms
toward low-­ carbon business models.
   More focus will be given to the contribution of forests and trees to the
agenda on adaptation and resilience to climate change. The World Bank’s
portfolio already contains several large operations to restore forested land-
scapes, including drylands in the Africa region and degraded lands in Latin
America. Many projects implemented under the Pilot Program for Climate
Resilience (PPCR) support land management practices involving reforesta-
tion and tree planting. Growing attention is being given to protecting and
restoring mangroves that enhance resilience to natural disasters and climate
variability (in Bangladesh and China, for example). These operations can be
seen as a triple win, because they address the challenges of adaptation and
mitigation and can generate economic opportunities through sustainable
forest management.
   These interventions usually demand high upfront investments and there-
fore require a long-term engagement and a solid financial plan. Through its
programmatic approach, the WBG aims to offer a comprehensive technical
and financial package that responds to clients’ needs to pursue forest-smart
development trajectories. This approach aims to support countries in driv-
ing transformative interventions in forested landscapes, by blending trust
fund resources (including climate finance) with IDA/IBRD resources as
well  as IFC investments into a more ambitious offer (see chapter 3). It is
expected  that by 2020, this programmatic approach would be piloted in
about 10 countries.
   The WBG is committed to tracking the impact of its investments in
terms  of  GHG emissions. The Environment Strategy  endorsed by the
World Bank Board in 2012 requires the conduct of GHG accounting in World
Bank investment projects. The World Bank, in collaboration with other

42	                                World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20
international financial institutions, has adopted the International Finance
Institution Harmonization Framework for project-level GHG accounting.
Starting July 1, 2014, all forest-related investment operations are now subject
to GHG accounting, and tools have been made available to teams to comply
with this new requirement.35


Rights and Participation
Clear ownership, access, and management rights over forests are vital for
good governance and sustainable management of resources. Although most
forests remain publicly owned, forest ownership by private actors, communi-
ties, and individuals has increased. A growing body of research shows that the
transfer of rights over forests (or forest use) to forest users creates effective
incentives for improving forest conservation and management, with signifi-
cant productivity and yield increases and more equitable access to and own-
ership of forest resources. Forest dwellers can and will sustain or sustainably
enhance forest productivity if they have long-term security for their access
and user rights, a clear tenure situation, and access to affordable credit lines.
Access to affordable finance allows forest dwellers to be engaged at different
stages of the value chain—for instance, by adding value to timber and
­non-timber forest resources in the form of semi-finished or finished products
 that can be marketed at a higher price.
    The interventions described under Focus Areas 1 and 2 can only yield full
 and long-lasting impacts on population welfare if the rights of use and access
 to forests and trees are clear and secured. Uncertainties in these areas pose a
 significant constraint to the ability of communities to manage these resources
 and be involved in the value chain. Despite the growing recognition of the
 role that women play in forest-related activities, women still face inequalities
 in rights over forest resources, representation in relevant decision-making
 bodies, and access to credit lines. Empowering women in the forest sector can
 create significant opportunities and generate important spillovers for house-
 holds and communities.

Key Actions: A substantial share of the World Bank’s forest-related portfolio
over the past decade has supported forest land tenure reforms, including sig-
nificant shifts toward community-based forestland. Building on good experi-
ences, the World Bank will work with clients that are willing to strengthen
and expand local rights of use and access over forest resources, with a partic-
ular focus on indigenous groups. The World Bank will help its clients to
improve land tenure laws and regulations and modernize land administration
systems. The focus on decentralized forest management and community-​
based and participatory forest management will remain strong across the
WBG portfolio.
   The WBG is mainstreaming citizen engagement in its interventions to give
stakeholders the opportunity to participate fully in decision-making processes,
with the objective of improving the intermediate and final development
outcomes of the interventions (see box 2.15). In line with this commitment,
­

  Box 2.15  Strategic Framework for Mainstreaming Citizen
  Engagement in World Bank Group Interventions
  Citizen engagement is defined as the two-way interaction between citizens and governments or
  the private sector within the scope of World Bank Group (WBG) interventions—policy dialogues,
  programs, projects, and advisory services and analytics—that gives citizens a stake in decision
  making, with the objective of improving the intermediate and final development outcomes of the
  intervention. The spectrum of citizen engagement includes consultation, collaboration and
  participation, and empowerment. Access to information is a necessary enabling condition, but it
  typically implies a one-way interaction only. Therefore, information-sharing and awareness-
  raising activities alone do not meet the definition of citizen engagement. Closing the feedback
  loop (that is, a two-way interaction providing a tangible response to citizen feedback) is required
  to meet citizens’ expectations for change created by their engagement, and to use their input to
  inform improved development outcomes.

the WBG will support the effective participation of stakeholders in land use
planning exercises to promote forest-smart development trajectories (as pre-
sented under Focus Area 2). The trade-offs among different sectors and within
sectors need to be carefully assessed and clearly understood by the stakehold-
ers, so that they can define development strategies at the territorial level
(which could be subnational, national, or even regional). Such an approach
requires robust socioeconomic analysis and strong coordination among line
ministries, as well as engagement with stakeholders.
   Building on the 2015 WBG Strategy on Gender, emphasis will be given to
mainstreaming the gender dimension in all forest-related interventions, and
to identifying opportunities to empower women. Since FY13, all forest-­related
operations have been gender-informed (by meeting one of three ­         criteria:
inclusion of gender in design, project actions, or monitoring and evaluation).
It is expected that the forest portfolio will remain 100 percent gender-­
informed, with the target of meeting all three criteria. Systematic screening of
operations at the design stage will help in identifying the various entry points
that could be used to reduce inequalities between men and women in the for-
est sector, including secure tenure on forest resources, participation in deci-
sion-making processes, and access to economic opportunities (see box 2.16).
   In the forest sector, specific attention is given to indigenous peoples and
forest-dependent communities. Successful platforms already exist, such as
under the FIP and its Dedicated Grant Mechanism for Indigenous People and
Local Communities and under the FCPF Capacity Building Program. The
work with indigenous peoples on forest-related issues complements the ongo-
ing comprehensive dialogue launched in 2013 (see box 2.17). Dialogue through
these platforms is also complemented by concrete actions at the operational
level, where particular attention is given to ensure that indigenous people and
other forest dwellers directly benefit from World Bank operations.36

Box 2.16  PROGEDE II: Making Gender Equality a Core Element of
the Project Design
The first Sustainable and Participatory Energy Management Project (PROGEDE I) was
implemented from 1997 to 2004, to combat Senegal’s rapidly growing demand for household fuels
and the degradation of forests and the rural environment. Despite the project’s successes, some
challenges remained in the equal participation of men and women.

PROGEDE II was designed to build on the important achievements under PROGEDE I, but also
to address the gender gap by including gender equality goals in the project design. With gender
disparity in mind, PROGEDE II initiated a reform of local management structures, which are
referred to as CIVGFs (inter-village forest management committees). After a concerted effort,
women now make up between 33 and 50 percent of these structures. Furthermore, women
increasingly participate in training sessions on forest cutting and carbonization techniques, pur-
suits that formerly were dominated by men in accordance with the traditional gender roles gov-
erning the division of labor.

Box 2.17  Comprehensive Dialogue between the World Bank and
Indigenous Peoples
In March 2013, the World Bank Group embarked on the most extensive and comprehensive
dialogue with indigenous peoples in its history, to create a shared development agenda. The
dialogue was held in the context of the World Bank’s Safeguard Policy to update and review
processes.

The World Bank’s dialogue and engagement process has yielded promising results in a renewed
and stronger relationship between the World Bank and indigenous peoples. The discussion
revolved around critical issues for indigenous populations, including environmental and social
protection, climate change, inclusion, self-determination, human rights, education, economic
development, and health care. On April 13–15, 2015, 30 representatives of indigenous peoples
from around the world held high-level meetings with the World Bank in Washington, DC, includ-
ing Board members and President Kim, and proposed a platform to help chart the World Bank’s
road map for a future partnership with them.




                 Institutions and Governance
                 Over the past 25 years, forest management has improved dramatically through
                 better planning, knowledge sharing, legislation, and policies.37 Despite this
                 positive trend, much remains to be done in developing countries to ensure
                 that forest institutions have the necessary capacity to foster the sustainable
                 management of forests, and policies and regulations can respond to the chal-
                 lenges of the sector and be properly implemented. Forest governance remains

                 World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20	                                        45
a challenging agenda that requires actions at various levels and of different
forms. The overall impacts on forest governance are usually the result of the
combination of various factors (local and global). Building on the lessons
learned from the FY02–15 forest portfolio, the FAP identifies areas of inter-
ventions where the WBG has a comparative advantage and can support client
countries in advancing on this agenda.


Forest Policies and Institutions
The Forest Resource Assessment conducted by FAO in 2015 states that most
developing countries have made significant progress in defining forest-related
legislation and policies. However, many state-run forest agencies in developing
countries still face major human and financial as well as organizational con-
straints in adequately responding to the many challenges related to the sustain-
able management of forests. In large parts of Africa, for example, the state
asserted rights over huge areas of forests, but without the commensurate capac-
ity to manage them. Conventional command-and-control measures have
sought to limit human impacts on forests, but often served only to regulate,
collect revenues, and penalize “illegal” forest uses. As rural populations placed
greater pressures on forested areas, and as competition from other commodi-
ties grew, these roles became somewhat insufficient. An integrated landscape
approach would call for enhanced coordination with other line ministries (such
as Agriculture, Mining, and Energy) to promote forest-smart interventions.
   Forest governance requires continuous focus. Despite noticeable progress
over the past decade, the ever-rising demand for timber and other forest
products presents a major risk of fueling illegal trade. Illegal logging contin-
ues to plague the forest sector. It is estimated to cost developing countries on
the order of $5 billion per year in lost timber revenues to governments alone
(Haken 2011; Goncalves et al. 2012). It also depresses prices and discourages
legal operators.38 Illegal logging can drastically affect forest-dependent com-
munities and put the long-term viability of natural assets at risk. Impacts on
biodiversity are also of major concern. Illegal activities undermine overall
governance in many regions. Because of its value and scale, illegal logging is
also a driver of wider systemic corruption.39
   To respond to the evolving contexts and emerging challenges, institutions
constantly need to adapt and forest policies need to be adjusted. In many
countries, forest institutions are not optimally designed, staffed, or financed
to be able to manage large forest estates effectively. New technologies are now
available and can be used to enhance information on forests and guide deci-
sion making. Technological changes and the declining costs of mobile devices,
the Internet, and earth observation systems have  made global information
much more affordable and accessible. Many opportunities exist to use ICT to
improve forest monitoring and forest management,40 including timber track-
ing, chains of custody, forest cover monitoring systems, and budget manage-
ment tools. The use of ICT can also significantly improve transparency and
accountability, and reduce  opportunities for ­    collusion through the use of
online auctions and sales systems.   41



46	                                World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20
Key Actions: The World Bank’s portfolio has traditionally supported forest
policies and capacity building of forest agencies (or any other agencies in
charge of forest affairs). This focus will continue, but will take a slightly differ-
ent form going forward, to help client countries define an adequate policy
framework to respond to the new challenges related to sustainable forest
management, as well as develop the technical and organizational capacity to
enforce policies and regulations.

•• Improve the policy and regulatory framework. Pressures on forests take
   different forms in different countries and change over different periods of
   time. Policies and regulations need to evolve continually in line with
   changing circumstances. Improving forest governance also consists of
   eliminating the perverse incentives created through poor policy and reg-
   ulation, as well as ensuring harmonization and cooperation across all rel-
   evant ministries and subnational agencies.
	  Hence, the World Bank will aim to support countries to adjust their
   policy framework to tackle the new challenges in a way that responds to
   their specific context. In some cases, the priority will be on land tenure
   security; in others, it will be on simplifying existing regulations to facili-
   tate sustainable business for the operators. In most countries, the articu-
   lation of forest laws/policies with other sector laws/policies constitutes a
   cornerstone for the long-term preservation of forest capital. Such harmo-
   nization is at the heart of the ongoing efforts of the REDD+ strategy. In
   addition, strong focus will remain on supporting adequate enforcement
   of policies and regulations.
•• Modernize institutions. As indicated in Global Forest Resources Assessment
   (FAO 2015), although countries have made significant progress in estab-
   lishing new policies and regulations, enforcement of the policies remains
   a challenge in most countries. This requires strengthened institutions that
   are able to track forcefully and tackle ever-changing forms of illegality
   and promote sustainable uses of forest resources.
	  The WBG will aim to ramp up its assistance to forest institutions to
   help them broaden their interventions from only policing functions to
   a more comprehensive range of public service provider functions. The
   efforts on capacity building will extend to other line ministries to
   encourage the necessary coordinated approach on land use planning
   and management.
•• Use ICT to strengthen country information systems. Tapping the potential
   offered by ICTs requires investments in information systems and ana-
   lytical work. Technologies can enhance real-time knowledge of forest
   resources, help identify overlaps in land uses and conflicts that may
   emerge from them, and thus guide better decision making on resource
   allocation/uses. The technologies can contribute to enhanced transpar-
   ency in collecting and availing reliable data on forests.
	  The World Bank will continue to help countries build up robust moni-
   toring systems that produce reliable forest-related data and information to
   promote the sustainable management of forests. Special attention will be

World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20	                                      47
      given to early warning systems that can drastically reduce the adverse
      impacts of fires or diseases. Cadasters are also in great demand from client
      countries, to help them define land use in an optimal way and reduce con-
      flicts. In addition, the WBG will continue its collaboration with interna-
      tional space agencies, in particular with the European Space Agency, to
      support the development of forest monitoring systems in client countries.


Mobilization of Public Resources
Because of the absence of economic value estimates of forest ecosystem ser-
vices, the current National Accounting Systems of most developing countries
reflect only the marketed value of forests. So a whole array of ecosystem ser-
vices are not accounted for in the current calculus of national accounting and
GDP, grossly underestimating the forest contribution to the national econ-
omy. This is in turn reflected in low budgetary allocations to the forest sector,
as intergovernmental and intrastate fiscal transfers give considerable weight
to marketed benefits. This results in chronically underfunded forest depart-
ments and forest administrations that in turn are not in a position to exercise
their mandate appropriately. In many cases, forest institutions depend on
donors to cover the needs of the basic budget.

Key Actions: The WBG will aim to help countries to understand the true
economic value of standing forests, so that they can determine appropriate
budget allocations for the forest sector. This will help inform decisions on
public resource allocation and position forests as a priority sector for invest-
ment to sustain long-term growth. The WBG will build on the extensive work
done by WAVES on forest accounting, to illustrate the overall value of forests
beyond marketed value. The WBG will aim to work with client countries on
innovative arrangements that would mainstream environmental sustainabil-
ity into the core fiscal process. Such an approach can be strengthened in
phases to achieve the desired balance between environmental sustainability
and economic growth in the region.



Monitoring Progress with Implementation of the
Forest Action Plan
Monitoring of the FAP will align with the WBG’s overall Scorecard and will
accordingly report on three tiers.42 Tier I reports on the long-term develop-
ment outcomes that countries are achieving, Tier II reflects the results
reported by WBG clients that are implementing WBG-financed operations,
and Tier III covers operational and organizational effectiveness (see table 2.1).
The systematic use of core sector indicators will allow for aggregation of the
results and impacts at the program level. Details on the indicators and moni-
toring modalities are presented in appendix B. Progress toward implementa-
tion of the FAP will be reviewed annually, and a midterm review is planned
for FY18.

                            other important ecosystems, those that have not respected the rights and interests
                            of local communities, and those that are developed without consideration of for-
                            est biodiversity. Poorly designed planted forests can also lead to the degradation
                            of critical ecosystems.

           on planted forests (and not on natural forests).
11.	The World Bank is already responding to a growing demand for analytical work
	
           from the Governments of Colombia, Mozambique, and Paraguay, which are seek-
           ing support to define an appropriate framework based on international best prac-
           tices for plantations.
	12.	However, as indicated in chapter 1, there are signs of a changing trend, with a grow-
           ing part of the investments to commercial plantations going to southern countries.
           As of now, Latin American countries have benefited the most from this new trend.
 13.	Only 10–20 percent of the overall IFC commitment in the forest sector goes
 	
           exclusively to the upstream segment of the forest value chain (“pure timberland”).
 14.	The IFC is recognized as a leader in biodiversity and ecosystem services manage-
 	
           ment for the private sector through its revision of its Performance Standards in 2012.
 	
 15.	This upstream approach would be complementary to the rigorous application of
           the World Bank’s Safeguard Policy, which remains critical to identify, at the oper-
           ational level, potential risks of investments to the environment, including forests,
           and to people.

           the national REDD+ strategies in more than 50 countries.

           the importance of the forests, the timeline of preparation of Systematic Country
           Diagnostics/Country Partnership Frameworks, the pipeline of WBG projects and
           programs, and the availability of funding. In some cases, these notes will be pre-

    19.	
    	      In many countries, forest maps inadequately report the forest area, ignoring
           encroachment dynamics that lead to forest degradation and deforestation.
    	20.	Under this modality, public and private sector developments that affect forest bio-
           diversity would pay into such schemes, as is the case with offsets banking in coun-
           tries such as Australia and the United States. These schemes can unlock business
           potential while identifying measures to conserve forest and biodiversity resources
           for the long term.

           sion and runoff, while providing valuable green corridors, sequestering carbon,
           and providing eventual wood resources for local communities.

      improvement (Stains 2010). This compares with proposed conventional carbon
      capture and storage technologies with first-generation abatement costs of $120 to

3. Implementation of the
Forest Action Plan FY16–20

  Summary
  This chapter describes how the Forest Action Plan will be implemented
  through six main entry points: (i) strategic assessment of forest-smart options;
  (ii) programmatic approach; (iii)  enhancement of the monitoring systems at
  the operation, country, and global levels to track the results on forests;
  (iv) knowledge generation to improve decision-making process related to for-
  ests; (v) institutional adjustments to ease the delivery of transformative pro-
  grams on forests; and (vi) partnerships to maximize impacts on the ground.
  These entry points have been identified through an in-depth assessment of the
  World Bank Group (WBG) forest portfolio over the FY02–15 period, as well as
  a detailed analysis of the emerging demands coming from clients.

  While implementing the Forest Action Plan FY16–20, the WBG will strike the
  appropriate ­balance between country engagement to respond to clients’ specific
  demands and global engagement to generate evidence and pilot innovative
  approaches through trust funds.



Strategic Level: Upstream Assessments
and Scoping
The WBG aims to ensure that interventions in economic sectors (such as
agriculture, transport, mining, and energy) are done in a forest-smart way. To
do so, it will work across sectors to help countries identify, evaluate, and
deploy transformational investments that effectively incorporate forest divi-
dends and limit externalities. The goal is to avoid locking countries into path-
ways that may lead to irreversible conversion of land, including the destruction
of natural forests (as described under Focus Area 2 in chapter 2).
   The Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) and Country Partnership
Framework (CPF) instruments offer ideal platforms to identify the chal-
lenges and opportunities related to forests in a strategic and integrated man-
ner within the WBG and with country counterparts upstream in the
programming process. The Environment and Natural Resources GP, which
leads the work on forests, is committed to the preparation of Country Forest
Notes.1 These succinct but comprehensive notes will present the status of
forests and provide options to minimize trade-offs by assessing the potential
adverse impacts of sector investments on natural forests, but also by high-
lighting the opportunities for improved land use management, notably
through restoration. The notes will explore options to minimize the trade-
offs of planned World Bank interventions on forests, by providing an inno-
vative and integrated upstream analysis of policies and investments and

52	                                  World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20
their potential impacts on forests. In the medium and long term, these
inputs will foster a development model that aims to reconcile economic
opportunities (and needs) with healthy forest ecosystems. The upstream,
evidence-based considerations of various investment options can be used to
guide the development of forest-smart projects and programs in a more
consistent manner.
  Financing for these notes will need to be leveraged from various sources, in
particular from forest-related trust funds (such as PROFOR, but also FIP,
FCPF, and BioCF). However, as the true value of forests is better understood
by a range of stakeholders and partners, the expectation is that financing will
be progressively made available from more sources (including from the World
Bank’s budget). The notes will largely use the extensive data that are already
available for many of the countries where forest operations are ongoing, in
particular from the following sources (not exclusive):
••   Forest accounts developed under the WAVES initiative
••   Forest Investment Plans in FIP countries
••   REDD+ strategies developed under the FCPF Readiness Fund
••   Socioeconomic survey data collected through the Forest Module of the
     Living Standards Measurement Study
••   Global Forest Resources Assessments, such as conducted by the Food and
     Agriculture Organization
••   Country studies and other thematic studies, for example, financed
     through PROFOR and other partners.


Operational Level: Programmatic Approach
The operational centerpiece of the Forest Action Plan FY16–20 is a shift
toward a new business model that aims to move away from the project-by-­
project and instrument-driven approach that has shaped the forest portfolio
over the past few years. The shift is toward a more programmatic approach
that would strategically position the WBG to support countries delivering
on forest-smart interventions. This new business model responds to a con-
cern raised by various CMUs about the proliferation of small-scale opera-
tions, with a lack of strategic vision on forest-related priorities in a specific
country. The programmatic approach seeks to achieve greater strategic
coherence in forest-related interventions and simplify how a country
accesses various sources of funding in support of the sustainable manage-
ment of its forest landscapes. The approach also builds on the lessons learned
from the Finance and Markets GP, which has pioneered this approach over
the past few years.
   Although this programmatic approach would likely be beneficial for all
countries where forest landscapes are critical for sustainable rural develop-
ment and economic growth, some countries do not yet have a conducive envi-
ronment to engage programmatically in the short or medium term. In such
cases, the WBG will continue to support the forest agenda through projects as
requested, but will aim to provide the country a strategic vision of how a

World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20	                                 53
project-level engagement could leverage interventions at scale in the future.
Historically, in some countries (see the example of Mexico in box 3.1), the
WBG has started its engagement with small-scale, but strategic, projects that
then helped build the basis for a strong investment portfolio with substantial
resources over 5–10 years.
   The programmatic approach is based on four main features as its founda-
tions: a country-owned program, an appropriate mix of instruments, a cohe-
sive financial architecture, and long-term engagement.

Country-Owned Program
The programmatic approach will aim to support countries that consider for-
ests to be an integral part of their national development agenda, and are will-
ing to preserve forests in the rural landscape as a sustainable source of national
wealth and prosperity, while contributing to global priorities such as mitigat-
ing the impacts of climate change and conserving biodiversity. The program-
matic approach will take into account, in a systematic way, the specific
challenges and opportunities a country has identified for forests, as well as
their contribution to the national economy and global public goods. The
approach will support country-owned strategies that minimize trade-offs
between and optimize synergies with various interacting land uses (related to
agriculture, energy, transportation, extractives, ecosystem services, and bio-
diversity). It will identify solutions that serve the diverse objectives of various
stakeholders.

Appropriate Mix of Instruments
The WBG will aim to support its client countries with a menu of instru-
ments (including technical assistance, Environment and Sector Work,
Reimbursable Advisory Services, investments, policy loans, and results-
based finance), to define the mix that best serves their needs. Although the
use of Economic and Sector Work and investments has traditionally been at
the heart of WBG interventions in the forest and related sectors, the emer-
gence of climate finance for forests offers promising new avenues for lever-
aging additional resources to transform forested landscape at scale,
including through results-based payments. Development Policy Lending
operations accounted for a significant share of the total forest sector com-
mitments that were financed between FY08 and FY10. However, they no
longer feature prominently in the World Bank’s forest portfolio. As gover-
nance and policy reforms still represent major challenges for the sustain-
able management of forests (see chapter 2), the Environment and Natural
Resources GP will engage with Operations Policy and Country Services to
identify constraints to World Bank support for forest-related Development
Policy Lending. As of today, the forest portfolio2 has not included any
Program for Results operation. However, it is expected that this instrument
could feature more prominently in the forest portfolio in the coming years,
given the focus of the forest programs on results (including results related
to climate benefits).

Cohesive Financial Architecture
The country-based program can be financed through the use of one or more
financing sources from IDA/IBRD and climate and forest-related trust funds
administered by the World Bank (BioCF, FCPF Readiness Fund and Carbon
Fund, FIP, GEF, or others) for which the World Bank is an implementing
agency. Facilitating the ease of access to the various funds through a combined
“financing package” that blends and sequences different revenue streams
will allow the WBG to respond in a more coordinated and timely manner to
country-specific needs for sustainable rural development involving forests.
   Forest-smart interventions can come with an upfront investment cost that
is higher than business as usual. Robust economic and financial analysis will
be conducted to assess the long-term viability of such investments, as well as
the long-term benefits, for example, lower maintenance and operation costs.
Strategic partnerships with other stakeholders, such as bilateral and multilat-
eral organizations, as well as the private sector, will be fostered to support
forest-smart interventions and allow the crowding in of other finance and
technical expertise in support of the program’s objectives. In addition, to
encourage such interventions, World Bank lending instruments will be com-
bined with climate and other environmental finance instruments. To do so,
task teams will be encouraged to blend different sources of finance, including
climate finance, into larger transformational operations. Work on the pro-
grammatic approach will be an important component of the WBG’s commit-
ment to scaling up climate finance.3

Long-Term Engagement
Experience has shown that natural resource–based interventions targeting
impacts at scale are complex and need a long-term engagement strategy to
achieve the desired results. To be transformative, country programs usually
need to be implemented over a time horizon that is much longer than the typ-
ical project lifetime of three to five years, with support over a period of 10 to
15 years, through complementary interlinked interventions. This ambitious
undertaking is already being piloted in selected countries where the World
Bank has a significant involvement in the forest sector and sectors affecting
forests, and where there is a significant commitment from the government
and other stakeholders to go beyond business as usual. This includes countries
participating in the forest-related climate trust funds administered by the
World Bank. Lessons from the process and implementation of these country
programs will be gathered in a systematic manner and shared with interested
countries and in international forums. The WBG already has supported such
a programmatic approach in a few countries, such as Mexico (see box 3.1).


Strengthen Monitoring Systems
Monitoring the performance of the WBG forest portfolio needs to be fur-
ther improved to build a strong evidence base on the impacts of the invest-
ments. The Forest Action Plan FY16–20 proposes that actions be taken

  Box 3.1  Making the Programmatic Approach a Reality: Mexico’s
  Forest and Climate Change Program
  The World Bank has supported the forest sector in Mexico for the past two decades. The support
  evolved in scope and amount, to respond to specific needs. It started with institutional support to
  the newly created National Forestry Commission of Mexico (CONAFOR) in the late 1990s, and
  shifted to piloting programs in the 2000s, such as the Program on Payment for Environmental
  Services or the Program on Community Forests, which have since become emblematic programs
  not only in Mexico but worldwide. The forest program in Mexico is today the largest World Bank
  program on forests. It is an example of a mature country program supporting sustainably managed
  forest landscapes. The objective of the program is to help rural communities to manage their
  forests sustainably, build social organization, and generate additional income from forest products
  and services, including from REDD+. The program is in implementation and so far has leveraged
  $460 million in World Bank finance from various sources.

  The program strives for results at an unprecedented scale, by working across various sectors and
  bringing together various finance instruments in a coherent and coordinated manner. The program
  works in an area of 30 million hectares (about the size of Ecuador) and supports economic oppor-
  tunities for 3,000 communities through sustainable forest management and piloting of innovative
  incentive schemes to reduce pressures on natural forests. Through a package of various instruments
  and financing modalities, the World Bank Group (WBG) has been able to provide the Government
  of Mexico with a comprehensive offer, building on large investments (the heart of the program),
  good practices, innovation, and partnerships. The World Bank, with its convening power, fosters
  dialogue across institutions and stakeholders.

Results and Impacts of Operations
The review of the FY12–15 forest portfolio revealed significant weak-
nesses  in  reporting the results and impacts of the forest interventions, in
particular an uneven use of indicators across the portfolio, and the chal-
lenge  of capturing impacts that materialize beyond the lifetime of specific
operations. The Committee on Development Effectiveness (CODE) made
enhancement of the  quality of monitoring and evaluation of paramount
importance. To do so, the FAP identifies different activities that should com-
plement and reinforce each other to enhance the quality of the monitoring and
evaluation frameworks of upcoming operations: (i)  systematic use of core
­
sector indicators, (ii)  inclusion of predictive proxy indicators (PPIs), and
(iii) use of impact evaluations.

Systematic Use of the Core Indicators
Several core sector indicators and related guidance notes for World Bank
operations, including forest investments and other investments, were
launched in July 2012 and updated in 2014.4 The systematic use of core sector
indicators in projects and programs on forests will allow the aggregation of
results at the portfolio level, and more realistic reporting of achievements and
funding volumes. There is a renewed commitment to the rigorous application
of these core sector indicators in the results framework of forest and forest-­
relevant operations to overcome past inconsistencies. This will enable the
aggregation of the results at the portfolio level in the future.

Key Actions: From FY16 on, operational teams will be required to apply core
sector indicators systematically to operations in forest and relevant sector
interventions. Appendix B provides guidance for the use of the relevant core
sector indicators that should be included in each project/program, as they
correspond to the relevant focus areas of the FAP.

Inclusion of Predictive Proxy Indicators
Most project indicators (even core sector indicators) that are used in the proj-
ect results framework are mainly output-driven and tend to fall short in pro-
viding sufficient levels of information to predict longer-term forest sector
outcomes. In response to the IEG review of the 2002 Forest Strategy, CODE
urged the World Bank management to develop a set of PPIs5 that could be
included in the project results framework and would provide a robust enough
predictive value of longer-term impacts.
  The research on forest sector PPIs conducted by PROFOR identifies a set
of PPIs with the potential not just to measure the impacts of forest pro-
grams on poverty reduction and economic growth, but also on other impor-
tant development outcomes, such as biodiversity conservation, ­         climate
change mitigation and adaptation, and good governance (see box 3.2). The
identified PPIs have been included in recently-approved operations on
forests.6

  Box 3.2  A Crystal Ball for Forests: Using Today’s Indicators to
  Predict Tomorrow’s Impacts
  As forests are gaining more and more attention, there is a need to understand the links between
  policies/investments and impacts on the ground. This proves to be particularly difficult in the
  forest sector. First, forest-related interventions are usually complex, with forest policies, programs,
  and projects often including multiple objectives, requiring the integration of socioeconomic and
  ecological expertise, and entailing processes that unfold over different spatial scales. Second, such
  interventions often take a long time to show results. For example, the results of investments in
  thinning, tree stand improvement, or natural regeneration under sustainable forest management
  are unlikely to be evident for 10 to 30 years. These characteristics make the attribution of impacts
  to specific interventions (as opposed to other potential factors) especially difficult within the
  forest sector.

  Building on an in-depth review of the World Bank’s portfolio of forest operations from FY02–15
  and statistical analysis, the Program on Forests produced a report that concludes that predictive
  proxy indicators (PPIs) do exist and can be used in practice in forest-related interventions. The
  report presents a list of top-ranking indicators based on an assessment of their predictive poten-
  tial and their SMART score. The indicators are presented  in an indicator menu organized by
  major objective (poverty, biodiversity, climate, or governance), which includes brief notes on how
  the indicators might be used. However, the report highlights that there are no standalone “silver
  bullet” predictive proxies. A major conclusion is the idea that multiple indicators, considered
  together, can have strong predictive potential. The report describes a series of seven indicator
  clusters that form PPIs. To maximize the accuracy of their predictive power, each PPI is com-
  posed of a cluster of indicators that, taken together, was determined to have strong predictive
  potential. In addition, each PPI cluster is based on a plausible theory of change that explains why
  the PPI was likely to predict a certain outcome as a result of an intervention. Encouragingly, the
  core sector indicators that are already used by the World Bank have strong potential as PPIs,
  meaning that the core sector indicators can help to capture not only the end-of-project outcomes,
  but also the longer-term impacts of forest investments, and in a consistent way across countries
  and contexts.

Key Actions: Teams preparing new forest-related operations will be encour-
aged to include PPIs in their Results Framework. More work will be done on
this theme and particularly on the analysis of the causal chain, so that PPIs
can be constantly strengthened.

Impact Evaluations
The use of impact evaluations will be encouraged as part of project design.
Impact evaluations, when used systematically, as in the health and education
sectors, provide a strong evidence base of the  results chain and conditions
for success. Impact evaluations also provide opportunities for learning during

58	                                        World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20
project implementation and at completion, and thus contribute to the contin-
uous improvements of WBG interventions.

Key Actions: Task teams working on forest operations will coordinate more
systematically with World Bank evaluation teams (for example, the
Development Impact Evaluation [DIME] research group) to include an
impact evaluation from the onset of the preparation process.7 Practice man-
agers in other GPs will encourage all teams preparing an operation that may
have impacts on forests to assess the possibility for including an impact eval-
uation as early as possible, ideally at the design stage of the operation, to
ensure real-time learning.

Country Monitoring Systems
Many World Bank interventions include activities aimed at building up the
monitoring capacity of developing countries or that co-finance country mon-
itoring systems to make them robust and reliable sources of data and informa-
tion on forests. Through the FCPF Readiness Fund, the World Bank is
supporting 40 countries in developing or enhancing country systems to mon-
itor forest cover and associated GHG emissions, through measurement,
reporting, and verification systems. Once in place, these country systems allow
the government and other relevant stakeholders to monitor and report on the
status of their forests and results in a consistent and transparent manner.

Key Actions: As indicated in chapter 2, the WBG will continue to support the
strengthening of clients’ capacity to generate and monitor forest-related infor-
mation in a robust and reliable manner. Under the FCPF Readiness opera-
tions, the WBG provides support to almost 40 countries in the construction
of their monitoring, reporting, and verification systems. As more and more
ICT options emerge and data are made publicly available, the World Bank will
provide technical guidance to clients on how to build up their forest monitor-
ing systems to respond to future needs, particularly in the context of REDD+
under the UNFCCC.

Global Monitoring Tools
Forest-Related World Development Indicators
The World Bank’s adjusted net savings indicator, published annually in the
WDI, builds a comprehensive set of capital assets that constitute a nation’s
wealth base, including natural resources such as forests. In addition to forest
rents, the WDI annually publishes an indicator on net forest depletion, which
measures the value of timber extraction (including roundwood and fuel-
wood) that exceeded the natural incremental growth of productive forest area
in the country for a given year.8

Key Actions: In addition to working on improving the estimates of these
two current forest-related indicators, the Environmental Economics team

World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20	                                 59
in the Environment and Natural Resources GP is working on improving
the  estimates of forest rent, net forest depletion, and timber wealth, by
developing a methodology for more accurate estimates of timber prices and
updated estimates of timber rental rates. The focus is also on valuing the
benefits from key forest ecosystem services, based on a meta-analysis of the
valuation literature, including a methodology for scaling up spatially
explicit values to the country level. With enhanced indicators, the WDI will
report more accurate information on the forest contribution to a nation’s
wealth.

Forest Module in the Living Standards Measurement Study
A forest module has been developed under the Living Standards Measurement
Study (LSMS), which was established by the Development Research Group
to explore ways to improve the type and quality of household data collected
by statistical offices in developing countries.9 The specific module on forests
was piloted in Indonesia and Tanzania during the second half of FY15.
A  Sourcebook on the Design and Implementation of Forest Modules in
LSMS-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture will be developed in early FY16 to
provide countries with practical r  ­ecommendations on different options to
strengthen forest and tree-related data collection.

Key Actions: The rolling out of the Forest Module under the Living Standards
Measurement Study will enable countries to collect and use socioeconomic
data related to forests in a systematic manner, through the use of structured
surveys. World Bank forest interventions will include, where appropriate, a
capacity-building activity on the use of the module for forest departments,
statistical offices, or other appropriate institutions.


Strengthen the Knowledge and Evidence Base
Knowledge that Responds to Clients’ and
Global Challenges
The portfolio of analytical and knowledge work will be aligned with the focus
areas and cross-cutting themes identified in the FAP (described in chapter 2).
When prioritizing knowledge products, the World Bank will strike the appro-
priate balance that responds to country-specific and global needs. It will com-
bine various sources of financing, including trust funds, to advance knowledge
on global issues that can then in turn enhance the quality of engagement at
the country level. Over the next five years, however, there will be opportuni-
ties to adjust or change these themes, to ensure that knowledge products are
fully aligned with operational business lines.
••    Forests as pathways out of poverty. This analytical work will deepen the
      understanding of the forest-poverty nexus and the contribution of forests
      as potential pathways out of poverty. It will be supported by PROFOR and
      build on a series of cases in various countries.

60	                                 World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20
••   Commercial reforestation. This work will assess the potential of commer-
     cial reforestation as an economically, socially, and environmentally sound
     solution to increased timber and pulp demand.
••   Sustainable value chains and competitiveness. This work will identify
      opportunities to unlock the potential of forest value chains to generate
      jobs and economic opportunities (including for SMFEs).
••   Land use change dynamics. This work will provide better understanding
      of the interlinkages between forest cover and other land uses, with a
     particular focus on the trends in the production of major agricultural
     ­
      commodities (palm oil, soybean, beef, coffee, and so on) and large infra-
      structure development.
••   Forest-smart development in the agriculture, transport, energy, and
     ­extractive sectors. This work focuses on the inter-linkages between forests
      and other sectors. Analytical work already underway includes: low-­
      deforestation value chains (in collaboration with Agriculture GP); meet-
      ing future energy needs through wood energy, and minimizing mining
      operations’ impact on forests (with Energy and Extractives GP); and risk
      management for coastal zones, fire management, flood and landslides
      (with SURR GP). Discussions are on-going to develop additional pro-
      grams, including on forests and transport (with Transport GP) and for-
      ests and rights (with SUUR GP).
••    Contribution to climate change mitigation and adaptation. This work will
      assess the potential of the full forest product cycle for mitigation (through
      the promotion of long-lived durable wood products), and the contribu-
      tion of forests and their biodiversity to enhanced resilience and produc-
      tivity at the landscape level.


Learning from Operations
The systematic generation and use of knowledge is an integral part of
World Bank interventions and a core element of the different stages of its
country engagement—from early policy dialogue to completion of the
interventions (see box 3.3). Generating lessons and using knowledge is
imperative to making interventions more robust and successful, and to
ensuring long-lasting results.
   The Country Forest Notes will present an upstream analysis of threats to
forests, as well as opportunities for socioeconomic growth in the forest sector.
The notes will directly feed into the SCDs, to then be reflected in the CPFs.
Such an approach would ensure that future investments in agriculture, hydro-
electric energy, oil and gas extraction, mining, and transport consider avoid-
ing or minimizing their potential adverse impact on forests. It is proposed to
make CPFs forest-smart.
   At the operational level, performance and learning reviews will identify
and capture lessons, determine midcourse corrections, and help build the
WBG’s knowledge base. Completion and learning reviews will identify and
capture end-of-cycle learning to contribute to the WBG’s knowledge base and
inform the update of SCDs and CPFs.

     Box 3.3  Knowledge and Learning: A Key Element All Along the
     Project Cycle
     Knowledge is a strategic resource of the World
     Bank, as it reflects the comparative advantage of                    Strategic
                                                                           country
     a global organization with deep technical reach.                    diagnostics
     The World Bank is uniquely positioned to
     collect, integrate, use, and transfer the knowledge   Completion                     Country
     gained from new research or from the design           and lessons                 programming
                                                             learned                    framework
     and implementation of operations around the
     globe.

     Through the design and implementation of proj-
                                                                  Project             Project
     ects, knowledge, capabilities, and resources are         implementation          design
     built up in the World Bank and with clients over
     time. This knowledge finds entry into project
     design and enhances the likelihood of a success-
     ful outcome of the operation. This can take various forms: economic and sector work and impact
     evaluations. They are embedded in the project cycle and can respond to specific needs. This
     knowledge base helps to inform the preparation of country documents, such as the Systematic
     Country Diagnostic and Country Partnership Framework.




Streamline Institutional Arrangements and
Procedures
To ensure the successful design and implementation of the programmatic
approach, actions will be taken on the following aspects:
••    Strengthening collaboration across GPs, CCSAs, and agencies, and build-
      ing “One Forest Team”
••    Streamlining operational processing of programmatic engagements
••    Streamlining relevant global funds hosted by the World Bank, including
      procedural and governing arrangements.
  Although some of these changes can be implemented in a relatively short
time frame (for example, working across teams), others may require a longer
dialogue before action can be taken (for example, alignment of trust funds,
including governing arrangements).


Collaboration as “One Forest Team”
                                                                   ­ hapter 2
The successful implementation of the ambitious agenda presented in c
requires task teams that understand the challenges and opportunities associ-
ated with an agenda for integrated forest and other land uses, striving for
multiple benefits. The necessary staff profile required for such ambitious
operations ranges from expertise in forestry, landscape management, climate

62	                                      World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20
change (adaptation and mitigation), economics, governance, private sector
engagement, or social issues, to expertise in those sectors that will be addressed
through forest-smart investments.
  At the country level, the design and implementation of country programs
will require multidisciplinary teams with members from various GPs, CMUs,
and CCSAs. At the corporate level, the role of the World Bank’s Global Lead
on Forests is to foster synergies across GPs and seek opportunities for
enhanced collaboration at the country level. In many countries, experts from
the Environment and Natural Resources GP and CC-CCSA join forces to
deliver on forest programs. Such cross-GP-CCSA collaboration is at the heart
of the new World Bank structure. The WBG will also offer support through
the IFC and MIGA to investors that are willing to do business based on high
social and environmental standards.

Operational Processes
The programmatic approach proposed under the FAP will aim to move away
from the project-by-project and instrument-driven approaches that have
shaped the forest portfolio over the past few years. It will move toward a more
programmatic approach that would strategically position the WBG to sup-
port countries delivering on forest-smart interventions. Building on the les-
sons learned from the Finance and Markets GP, which has pioneered this
approach over the past few years, the programmatic approach will seek to
consolidate and streamline the preparation and implementation processes of
different operations under the same program.
   Some task teams have already piloted this approach for forest programs in
a few countries,10 by preparing packages that encompass more than one oper-
ation. These packages conceptualize the overall long-term WBG engagement
on sustainable forest landscapes at the territorial level (for example, in
Ethiopia’s State of Oromia, Zambia’s Eastern Province, and Colombia’s
Orinoquia region), and describe the WBG instruments and financing modal-
ities used to address the identified challenges in an integrated way that allows
for optimal use of technical and financial resources. Although the instru-
ments and financing modalities may require separate internal decision pro-
cesses, the consolidated packages would constitute the basis for the overall
dialogue on forests with the CMUs and clients; the packages would also pro-
vide for optimizing the number of decision points (at the concept and deci-
sion stages).

WBG-Hosted Forest-Related Climate Trust Funds
At the COP21 held in Paris, the Governments of Germany, Norway, and the
United Kingdom publicly expressed their support by pledging an additional
$5 billion to be channeled through a variety of existing mechanisms, includ-
ing relevant trust funds hosted by the World Bank.
   Based on experience with various financing mechanisms, developing coun-
tries and other stakeholders—while recognizing the key contributions of
trust funds to the forest agenda—have increasingly voiced concern about the

World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20	                                   63
proliferation of rules and procedures associated with different funds, making
access to these funds slow and cumbersome. Through programmatic engage-
ment, the WBG will explore options for a more streamlined approach across
these financial streams. It will work to align processing guidelines for new
trust funds with standard World Bank operational practices.
   The WBG will also work with partners and donors to improve the effective-
ness of the forest climate funds, to reduce transaction costs and increase impact.
In the short term, it will work to improve country-level coordination, whereas
in the medium term, it may need to work with partners toward rationalization
of funds and financial innovation to improve the performance of results-based
instruments while addressing short-term investment funding needs.



Partnerships
Since the adoption of the Forest Strategy in 2002, the World Bank has fostered
several important partnerships11 and worked closely with the United Nations
Forum on Forests (and the associated Collaborative Partnership on Forests),
as well as with the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research
(particularly the Center for International Forestry Research and the World
Agroforestry Center). The WBG is also an observer in various international
forums, including the United Nations Forum on Forests, UNFCCC, REDD+,
and United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. The WBG will
continue to be an active partner in global partnerships that advance the dia-
logue on the sustainable management of forests.
   In addition, the World Bank hosts influential trust funds on forests, such as
the BioCF, FCPF, FIP, and GEF, which contribute to shaping the global forest
agenda and support innovation.
   Over the past decade, there has been a major effort to establish partner-
ships with civil society organizations and other groups. Platforms established
under the FCPF and FIP and its associated Dedicated Grant Mechanism for
Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities have deepened the World Bank’s
engagement with a variety of stakeholders involved in the forest sector.
Continuing dialogue and exchange with civil society and other groups will
remain central to the implementation of the FAP.
   Cross-sector knowledge activities undertaken by PROFOR, a multi-donor
partnership hosted by the World Bank, will help guide forest-smart opera-
tions by focusing on the nexus between forests and energy, agriculture, pov-
erty, jobs, mining, and disaster risk management, for example. PROFOR is
part of a global effort to improve knowledge sharing and results monitoring
for more effective interventions in the forest sector. WAVES also offers a
venue for integrating natural capital in development planning, economic pol-
icy, and decision making in support of forest-smart development.
   To support its new business model, the WBG will place special emphasis on
partnerships that can deliver operational support to client countries through
coordinated efforts. The WBG already works with a wide range of stakehold-
ers and partners at the country, regional, and global levels.

64	                                 World Bank Group Forest Action Plan FY16–20
   For example, in many countries working on the REDD+ agenda, the oper-
ational teams are coordinating closely with partners involved in the forest
sector to optimize their support to country programs.
   At the regional level, different partnerships help the World Bank respond to
client country priorities. For example, in the Europe and Central Asia region,
a partnership between the World Bank, the World Wildlife Fund, and the
International Union for Conservation of Nature, with support from the
European Union, works to improve forest law enforcement and governance
in  seven countries, which together are home to more than 20 percent of
the  world’s forests. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the World Bank is a partner of
the TerrAfrica Partnership, which is hosted by the African Union and helps
countries to restore degraded land. The World Bank is also a member of the
Latin America and the Caribbean 20x20 initiative, which proposes to restore
20 million hectares of land in Latin America and the Caribbean.
   At the global level, the WBG is a partner of the Bonn Challenge, which
aspires to restore 150 million hectares of degraded lands by 2020, and of the
International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime, which is a collabo-
rative effort of five intergovernmental agencies whose mission is to bring a
coordinated response to wildlife and forest crime. The IFC works closely with
sustainable commodity roundtables to find viable solutions to green com-
modity supply chains.
   This list is far from exhaustive, but points to the rich partnerships that
strengthen the WBG’s work on forests at all levels, and will be instrumental in
implementing the FAP.

Appendix A: Learning from
the World Bank Group’s
Forest Portfolio

  Summary
  Between FY02 and FY15, the World Bank Group (WBG) invested a total of
  $6.5 billion in the forest sector, which corresponds to an average of $465 ­million
  per year. Based on the latest Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
  Development statistics, the World Bank ranks second in the list of official
  financiers of forest activities and first in the list of multilateral financiers.
  However, the World Bank’s share remains small compared with private finan-
  cial flows (about $15 billion per year).

  Overall, the WBG’s forest portfolio has performed reasonably well against
  World Bank-wide portfolio performance indicators. WBG investments have
  achieved significant milestones, including bringing 73.6 million hectares under
  participatory or community forest management, contributing to the creation of
  24 million hectares of new protected areas, declaring 45.4 million hectares as
  indigenous lands in the Brazilian Amazon region, and bringing 8.9 million
  hectares under sustainable forest management plans. However, there is room
  for improvement. In particular, the quality of monitoring and evaluation needs
  to be further enhanced to make the review of results and impacts achieved
  through WBG operations more comprehensive and robust.

  Over the past 10 years, the WBG’s forest portfolio has evolved significantly in
  the use of instruments. Development Policy Loans, which were frequently used
  between FY09 and FY12 in the forest portfolio, have been very limited in more
  recent years. This change is directly related to the generalized perception of
  high risk, particularly related to governance and land rights. This appendix
  presents an analysis of the risks and complexities of forest operations and
  attempts to untangle perception and reality.

  In financing sources, global programs on climate change (supported through
  trust funds) that are largely geared toward performance-based operations now
  dominate the forest portfolio (and pipeline). Although this situation this
  ­represents a major opportunity to align the forest and climate agendas in support
   of developing countries’ efforts toward low-carbon development, there is a need
   to complement these resources with International Development Association/
   International Bank for Reconstruction and Development support, to offer a
   comprehensive package that responds to developing countries’ needs. In addi-
   tion, better coordination with International Finance Corporation investments
   (as well as Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency guarantees) could unlock
   the potential for the creation of more jobs and wealth in forest value chains.

   Building on the portfolio review as well as the outcomes of the 2013 Independent
   Evaluation Group’s evaluation of the implementation of the Forest Strategy, this
   appendix provides an overview of the WBG’s forest operations (pipeline and port-
   folio), and how these align with the challenges and opportunities for forests set
   out in chapter 1. This gap analysis lays the foundation for the strategic directions
   of the current and future WBG pipeline, as further detailed in chapters 2 and 3.


   Over the past decade, the development finance landscape has evolved con-
siderably. Official capital flows to governments, while still an important share
of net flows, particularly to low-income countries, are no longer the main
source of development finance, as private flows have flourished. This trend
also applies to the forest sector, where private financial flows have been esti-
mated to be as high as $15 billion per year (Asen, Savenije, and Schmidt 2012),
while official development assistance was estimated at $895 million in 2013.1
Based on the latest Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
statistics, the World Bank ranks second in the list of official financiers of forest
activities and first in the list of multilateral financiers.2 However, the World
Bank’s share remains small compared with private financial flows.
   Between FY02 and FY15, World Bank operations—International
Development Association (IDA), International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD), and trust funds—that invested in forests or included a
component (or an activity) on forests3 represented a total amount of
$12.4  ­billion, of which about a fourth was specifically dedicated to forest
­
components and activities. For the same period, International Finance
Corporation (IFC) investments in forest product companies totaled approxi-
mately $3.3 billion (see figure A.1). The Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency’s (MIGA’s) involvement in the sector has been modest, supporting
only a few forest-­ related projects.

                 Review of the World Bank’s Portfolio, FY02–15
                 Over the FY02–15 period, the World Bank4 supported 309 operations with a
                 forest component/activity (forest-coded operations).5 The portion of the
                 finance directly targeting forest-related activities amounted to $3.2 billion.
                 This share was highly variable from year to year, ranging from a low of $53
                 million in FY04 to almost $600 million in FY12. In FY15, $239 million was
                 committed to forest-related activities (see figure A.2).

                 Portfolio Performance
                 Overall Results and Impacts
                 Since the adoption of the World Bank Group (WBG) Forest Strategy in 2002,
                 88 of the 309 projects with a forest component went through a full project
                 cycle during FY02–15 (approved, fully implemented, and brought to closure).
                 These projects accounted for around $1.2 billion in loans, credits, and grants
                 specifically allocated to forests.6
                    The review of the evaluative material from these operations highlights some
                 of the benefits from World Bank investments in forests:
                 ••   Improving livelihoods through support for participatory forest management
                      initiatives. Some 73.6 million hectares of forested land is now under par-
                      ticipatory or community forest management, including extensive pro-
                      grams involving indigenous peoples.
                 ••   Bringing about positive environmental outcomes through sustainable land
                      and water management, reforestation, and protected area management.
                      Extensive areas of forested land were restored or reforested. Around
                      25 percent of the projects in the portfolio contributed to supporting the
                      establishment, expansion, and development of forest protected areas,
                      contributing significantly to climate change mitigation, adaptation, and
                      biodiversity conservation.

••    Strengthening sustainable forest management and advancing the rule of law
      by increasing transparency and accountability and putting environmental
      standards in place. At least 8.9 million hectares of forests are now man-
      aged based on forest management plans, and at least 3.5 million hectares
      now meet independently certified sustainable forest management stan-
      dards. More than 400 government institutions have benefited from World
      Bank-supported capacity-building activities.
••    Improving forest governance by contributing significantly to initiatives such
      as the European Union’s Forest Law Enforcement, Governance, and Trade
      program, fostering sustainability in private sector companies (through the
      IFC and MIGA), helping the private sector to produce higher value-added
      products, increasing their productivity and production capacity, expand-
      ing out-grower markets, and providing jobs for poor rural communities.
  These impacts are considered to be underestimated, as the evaluative
material on closed operations did not consistently report results, thus limiting
the aggregation of results at the portfolio level. This is a challenge the Forest
Action Plan will address by further enhancing the guidance for monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) in forest and forest-related sector operations.

Performance Indicators
Of the forest-coded operations for which evaluative material is available and
that have been assessed by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG), 64 per-
cent have achieved outcomes that are “satisfactory” or better. Table A.1 sug-
gests that the forest portfolio has performed reasonably well against World
Bank-wide portfolio performance indicators and is at par with the Agriculture
and Environment and Natural Resources portfolios in the quality of the
achieved outcomes. The quality of the M&E system, however, is rated low and
needs to be substantially improved.
  The World Bank has responded to the call for incorporating gender con-
siderations in project design. The extent to which the forest portfolio is
gender-informed increased from 63 percent of all projects in FY10 to
­
100 percent in FY13.

                      Complexity and Perception of Risks
                      The often perceived risk, within and outside the World Bank, may be anchored
                      in anecdotal references to Inspection Panel cases related to the forest ­
                                                                                              portfolio.
                      However, records from the WBG’s Inspection Panel suggest a much more
                      nuanced and proportionate picture (see table A.2). A total of 13 requests
                      related to forests have been received by the Inspection Panel: only five focused
                      on forest projects and eight claimed adverse impacts of World Bank-funded
                      projects on forests (mainly on operations related to extractive industries,
                      water, and hydropower). These 13 requests represent 12.6 percent of the 103
                      total requests received by the panel in its 22 years of existence. Nonetheless,
                      although some Inspection Panel cases on forest operations gained attention,
                      the number of World Bank-funded projects on forests brought to the
                      Inspection Panel does not provide definitive evidence of the risk of the overall
                      portfolio and sector.

Major Features of the World Bank’s Forest Portfolio
Three main features characterize the World Bank’s current forest portfolio
and pipeline.
   A multisector portfolio by nature. Although most of the forest-coded opera-
tions are implemented through the Environment and Natural Resources
Global Practice, other Global Practices—such as Agriculture; Water; Energy
and Extractives; and Social, Urban, Rural, and Resilience—have tradition-
ally  included forest-specific components or activities in their portfolios
(see table A.3). Therefore, the forest engagement in most developing coun-
tries requires an integrated, multisector approach to address the dynamics
affecting forests, such as agricultural expansion, mining development, or
infrastructure construction.
   Importance of trust funds. Although the IBRD/IDA has traditionally
been by far the largest source of financing in volume (see figure A.3), trust

                  fund operations constitute the vast majority of the portfolio in terms of
                  number. Over the FY02–15 period, the 42 IBRD operations accounted for
                  a cumulative $7.8 billion, the 64 IDA operations for $3.5 billion, and the
                  203  trust fund operations for $1.1  billion.7 The large number of small
                  trust  fund operations (40  percent of which were less than $1 million)
                  has  contributed to a perception of fragmentation of the forest portfolio,
                  with a higher transaction cost per dollar committed. However, a new
                  trend  has emerged since FY13: the portfolio share of trust fund opera-
                  tions has substantially increased in financial volume (surpassing 50 per-
                  cent in FY15), and with much larger operations. The main sources for
                  these operations are the forest-related climate trust funds administered by
                  the World Bank.
                     The World Bank is hosting a variety of multi-donor trust funds to address
                  issues of global concern. Three major trust funds tackling forests and climate
                  change provide substantial additional resources to address the forest chal-
                  lenge globally: the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF), the BioCarbon
                  Fund Initiative for Sustainable Forest Landscapes (BioCF ISFL), and the
                  Forest Investment Program. Contributor countries have requested the World
                  Bank to manage and implement their funds to address the forest challenge,
                  taking advantage of the World Bank’s fund management and technical exper-
                  tise, country experience, global knowledge, and deep multisector engage-
                  ment. Commitments to these instruments have surpassed $2 billion (see
                  table A.4).
                     Even at the pilot scale, the interventions financed by the forest and climate
                  funds have been very successful at generating a wealth of knowledge, and
                  have opened opportunities for larger-scale operations on sustainable land and
                  forest landscapes that support long-term development trajectories.

                  (and Development Policy Loans) has traditionally driven World Bank
                  interventions in the forest and related sectors. More than 38 percent of the
                  total commitment to the Global Programs on Forests and Climate is

Review of the IFC portfolio
Investments All Along the Value Chain
The IFC has vast experience in the forest sector, and its portfolio spans
a  diverse group of subsectors throughout the wood fiber value chain
(­see ­figure A.4). The IFC supports forest investments (in plantations or natu-
ral forests); pulp, paper, and converted products (ranging from linter and
straw pulp to tissue, sacks, and various kinds of packaging); and wood-based
products (for example, wood panels, particleboard, and plywood). As such,
the IFC supports the forest products sector, which supplies a wide range of
essential products—from construction materials, paper, food packaging
­
material, sanitary products, and specialty chemicals, to watershed and soil
conservation—from a renewable resource.
   Forest investments can bring together communities and companies
through partnership arrangements, build small and medium-size enterprises,
or enable socially responsible corporate investments. These investments have
the potential to deliver benefits to farmers, small forest owners, local com-
munities, and indigenous peoples. In the upstream segment of the fiber
chain, the IFC views its investments in sustainably managed commercial
plantation operations as an important means of reducing pressures on natu-
ral forests. It promotes global best-practice forest management standards and
has contributed significantly to increasing the amount of total forestland
under certified management. In the downstream segment, the IFC invests in
wood-based industries that use “chain of custody” practices, and that aim at
using the best available technologies and efficient use of resources, including
recycled wood products.
   The companies supported by the IFC through advisory services and invest-
ments often generate significant employment, ranging from a few hundred to
tens of thousands of new jobs. Indirect employment impacts can be many
times higher. Of the approximately 31 IFC forest sector projects that regularly

IFC’s Investments over the Past 10 Years
The IFC finances investments with its own resources and by mobilizing capi-
tal in international financial markets. In addition to equity and loan financ-
ing, the IFC also provides technical assistance to its clients.
   In 2005–14, the IFC invested more than $2.4 billion in 54 forest sector
projects, with a total cost of about $10 billion.8 The size of the projects
­
ranged between $3 million (a packaging project in the Kyrgyz Republic) and
$3.6 billion (a pulp mill project in Brazil).
   The pulp and paper industry accounted for 58 percent of the IFC
investments, while 21 percent was directed at wood-based panel and
­
engineered-wood products (see figure A.5). The share of forest projects was
­
21 percent and on the rise (11 percent in 2006). During this period, about
65 percent of IFC projects supported an integrated approach along the value
chain (­production and processing). IFC technical assistance was mostly tar-
geted at specific projects, but some sector work was also carried out.
   Between 2005 and 2014, the IFC invested in 29 countries. East Asia and the
Pacific attracted the most financing, and financing was limited in Africa and
the Middle East.9 The relatively high proportion of IFC investments chan-
neled to the East Asia and Pacific region reflects the importance of the forest

the Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean, the IFC’s main investments
have targeted the rapidly expanding pulp and paper industries in Brazil,
China, and India.
   The current IFC portfolio in the forest products sector stands at
$675 ­ million, with 52 active investments involving 41 clients. Overall, the
portfolio shows good regional and subsector diversification, with a natu-
ral higher weight of East Asia (in line with the sector activity in the past
10 years) (see figure A.6). Twenty-four percent of the portfolio is invested
in IDA countries.
   The pulp and paper subsector represents 63 percent of the total sector port-
folio; the remaining 37 percent corresponds to the forest and wood products
subsectors.
   In terms of financial products, one-third of the portfolio is equity participa-
tion in forest-related companies, and the other two-thirds are loans.

Opportunities for the IFC in the Forest Products Sector
It is estimated that the forest products sector has been growing at about
  percent per year in the past decade. With the demand for fiber growing and

no sign of tempering, it is expected that most of the additional supply will
come from developing countries, which represents a shift in an industry
where historically private investment in timber production and processing
has been concentrated in high-income countries. Investments required for

planting, harvesting, and processing can be large (that is, establishing a mod-
ern pulp mill can cost more than $1 billion); thus, most of these investments
come from global corporations or joint ventures involving local partners and
development banks.
   The IFC has the potential to play a significant role in the industry, as
opportunities emerge in developing countries, by ensuring that these
large investments are made in a socially and environmentally responsible
manner. The IFC could motivate additional investments to maximize
the full potential of the forest sector in developing countries. So far, ­however,
the IFC has not responded to the booming opportunities (see figure A.7).
Investments in the sector remain limited in volume and scope. This is a
result of a shift in strategic focus within the IFC, the entrance of other
financial development and commercial institutions (such as the Brazilian
Development Bank or the Inter-American Development Bank) into
this  sector, and difficulties identifying industry players that can comply
with the IFC’s Standards, including those on Environmental and Social
Performance.



Review of the MIGA Portfolio
As a provider of political risk insurance, MIGA’s involvement in the forest
sector is demand-driven. Typically, a project sponsor’s first priority is to
secure funding and ensure its operational feasibility. Although in some cases
the financiers of the project will make their contribution contingent on MIGA
coverage, this is usually only the case for large-scale projects. Investments in
the forest products sector tend to be of a smaller scale, where political risk
insurance is seen as an important but not necessarily critical risk manage-
ment tool, and clients typically engage with MIGA at an advanced stage of
project development. MIGA’s engagement in the forest products sector is
therefore generally opportunistic, and its ability to influence project design is
limited; however, all projects—no matter how small—must comply with

                     MIGA’s Policy and Performance Standards on Environmental and Social
                     Sustainability.
                       Over the FY02–15 period, MIGA’s involvement in the forest products
                     sector was limited. MIGA currently has three investment guarantees related
                     ­
                     to the forest sector in its active portfolio, one of which is around $50 million
                     and the other two below $10 million.



                     Lessons Learned: Informing the Forest Action
                     Plan FY16–20
                     The lessons learned from the FY02–15 portfolio, as well as the IEG
                     recommendations from the evaluation of the implementation of the
                     ­
                     2002 Forest Strategy, are critical for defining the priorities for the Forest Action
                     Plan FY16–20. The lessons highlight shortcomings or lost opportunities in the
                     delivery model, and encompass areas that need improvements or a new focus,
                     along with those where scaled-up actions are appropriate. Table A.6 identifies
                     the key areas that will be addressed in the Forest Action Plan.



Table A.6  Key Areas to Be Addressed by the Forest Action Plan
 Improvements in the Delivery Model
 •	 Enhance the role of forests in the WBG portfolio.
 •	 Increase the commitments from IDA/IBRD resources to the forest sector and strategically combine them with
    trust fund resources to offer developing countries a mix of instruments that can best respond to country-
    specific challenges, opportunities, and circumstances.
 •	 Advance a landscape-based, forest-smart programmatic approach that more effectively addresses a range
    of development challenges and opportunities related to forests and that supports solutions at scale.
 •	 Make World Bank investments forest-smart: upstream collaboration with other Global Practices on
    investments to reduce potential adverse impacts on forests and optimize positive synergies.
 •	 Build stronger synergies between the different WBG entities (IBRD, IFC, and MIGA) to foster more socially
    and environmentally responsible private sector investments.
 •	 Systematically track results and generate socioeconomic data on forests to enhance the evidence base.
 •	 Systematically use core sector indicators to allow for aggregation at the portfolio level.
 •	 Foster multidisciplinary World Bank task teams.

 Areas That Need Scaling Up
 Forest Investments                                              Forest-smart investments

 •	 Protection of forest biodiversity, within and outside           decisions on sustainable development
    protected areas                                                 investments
 •	 Restoration of degraded forestlands                          •	 Sustainable forest-based commodities, including
 •	 Reforestation, including mangroves                              shade-grown coffee, cocoa
 •	 Tree planting and commercial plantations (small-,            •	 Promotion of the integrated watershed/basin
    medium- and large-scale), including on degraded                 management
    lands                                                        •	 Promotion of integrated landscape approach
 •	 Nature-based tourism                                         •	 Enhancement of landscape resilience
 •	 Work with small and medium-size forest enterprises           •	 Mainstreaming of the forest dimension in
                                                                    investments in agriculture, extractives, energy,

Notes
	1.	 OECD website, accessed on July 2015.
	2.	 It is difficult to establish the exact share of the WBG’s engagement because of the
     diverse nature of WBG instruments: financing from IDA compares with other
     official development assistance from bilateral and multilateral sources, while
     IBRD and IFC financing should be compared with other non-concessional public
     or commercial funding.
	3.	This refers to all operations that have been registered in the World Bank system
     with the forest code. Only a portion of the financing of the operation can be ded-
     icated to the forest-specific activities.
	4.	The World Bank means the IBRD part of the WBG, which implements IDA,
     IBRD, and trust fund operations.
	5.	When initiating a new operation, the task team indicates the various themes
     and  sectors covered by the operation, and reports the respective contribution
     (in percentage) to the different themes and sectors selected. One of the sectors is
     forests.
	6.	 The other 221 operations with a forest component, accounting for about $2 ­million
     in dedicated to forest activities, are currently under implementation.
	7.	The cumulative amounts refer to the full amount of the forest-coded operations
     (not the forest share).
	8.	 Over the period FY02–15, the IFC invested $3.3 billion.
	9.	The regions used by the IFC differ slightly from the regions used by the World
     Bank. Therefore, a regional portfolio aggregation by region for the WBG is not
     possible.

Implementing WBG-Financed Operations
As indicated in chapter 3, a specific effort will be made to improve the quality
of the monitoring of the forest portfolio. To do so, from FY16 on, task teams
will be required to use core sector indicators in the results framework when-
ever possible, to allow for aggregation at the portfolio level. Whenever possi-
ble (for instance, during a restructuring), all efforts will be made by the teams,
and with the support of the Practice Managers, to include core sector
indicators.
  Table B.2 provides guidance for the use of the relevant core sector indica-
tors that should be included in all forest-related operations, as well as indica-
tors which correspond to specific focus areas and cross-cutting themes of the
Forest Action Plan:
