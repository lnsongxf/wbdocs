     Project Background:
     Deepening the Afghan financial system and fostering financial inclusion are key pillars for sustainable growth and development. The “Access to Finance Project
     “contributes to strengthening the institutional capacity of the sector. It builds on WBG’s successful engagement in the development of the microfinance sector in
     Afghanistan since 2003 when the Microfinance Investment Support Facility for Afghanistan (MISFA) was established. This project is implemented by MISFA and the
     Ministry of Finance, to support and complements the government of Afghanistan’s efforts to implement a fully-fledged financial sector development strategy that
     focuses on increasing access to finance for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).

     Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
     To build institutional capacity to improve access to credit of MSMEs. Key component include:
     ■■     Improving access to financial services for micro and small enterprises by strengthening the microfinance sector through MISFA’s scale up of the Targeting the Ultra
            Poor Program and supporting the facility’s strategy and programs to increase access to financial services for micro and small enterprises.
     ■■     Improving access to financial services for small and medium enterprises by supporting the expansion of the Afghanistan Credit.
     Guarantee Facility (ACGF) and increasing commercial bank and microfinance investment lending.

     Results Achieved:
     While the project implementation is still in its early days, the procurement process related to the scale up of “Targeting the Ultra Poor Program” was complete and the
     contract was awarded on July 26, 2015.
     Key Partners:
     ■■     MISFA
     ■■     Ministry of Finance
     ■■     ACGF
     Note: The original project cost was $50 million, but due to currency fluctuation between XDR and USD the disbursement figures do not add up to the same total.

Project Background:
Limited access to quality inputs at affordable prices is a key constraint to higher agricultural productivity in Afghanistan. The agricultural inputs delivery network
remains underdeveloped, weakly regulated, and distorted, requiring investments and action at the institutional, policy and farm levels.
The project will build institutional capacity in the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation (MAIL) required for overseeing input quality control, safety and
reliability, and availability.
It will support the infrastructure and human resources needed to exercise and enforce quality control for fertilizers and other agro-chemicals, and improve functioning
and transition of the seed sector toward a market for certified wheat seed with minimal external support.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project objective is to strengthen institutional capacity for the safety and reliability of agricultural inputs and the sustainable production of certified wheat seed.

Components are:
■■     Improved Wheat Seed Production supports (i) varietal selection and production of breeder seed; (ii) production of foundation and registered seed; and (iii)
       coordination of the seed sector.
■■     Plant Quarantine Networks and Quality Control of Agro-chemicals supports enhancement of MAIL capacity to implement the quality control of agro-chemicals,
       including: (i) establishment of an office for pesticides registration; (ii) construction of various laboratories; (iii) provision of pesticide bio-efficacy trial equipment;
       and (iv) strengthening the fertilizer quality control inspection system.
■■     Input Delivery Systems supports the analysis of the recipient’s current agricultural input delivery systems and assists in the development of an action plan for
       investment activities in inputs delivery systems.
■■     Project Management and Monitoring supports management and monitoring of the project.
Results Achieved:
AAIP has technically and financially supported MAIL and its relevant directorates in production of breeder, foundation, and certified wheat seeds based on improved
production practices. The project has also completed the survey and design for establishment of 13 laboratory complexes for the Plant Protection and Quarantine
Directorate and designs for 10 Border Quarantine Stations. The project also has completed the survey and design of nine Regional Research Stations, and four Regional
Seed Production Farms. All this work will inform the future investments by the project as well as by the ministry in these areas. The project also provided in-country
training for 313 staff members of Agriculture Research Institute of Afghanistan (ARIA), Improved Seeds Enterprise Plant Protection and Quarantine Directorate. The
international training, including masters and PhD programs for the ministry’s target staff, are in progress.

     Project Background:
     Two decades of civil war severely damaged the Afghan road network at all levels: regional and national highways, provincial roads, and local access roads. Prolonged
     conflict denied most of the rural population access to essential social services including markets, health centers, schools, and government offices.
     Formulated in 2002, the National Emergency Employment Program funded short-term employment through restoration of the dilapidated rural infrastructure. This
     initiative evolved into the National Rural Access Program from 2005, with a strong focus on the provision of year-round rural access to basic social services.
     More than 11,000 kilometers (km) of rural roads and related drainage structures have been upgraded or rehabilitated under these programs through four projects
     financed through IDA, ARTF, and other funds.

     Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
     The objective of the Afghanistan Rural Access Project is to enable rural communities to benefit from all-season road access to basic services and facilities. Components
     are:
     ■■     Improvement and maintenance of secondary roads: Supports rehabilitation of about 1,000 km roads, 250 km of upgrading existing pavement to bituminous
            standard, about 1,000 km of routine and periodic maintenance of paved and unpaved secondary roads, and construction of about 1,000 linear meters of bridges.
     ■■     Improvement and maintenance of tertiary roads: Will support about 1,300 km of rehabilitation and 2,000 km of routine and periodic maintenance of tertiary
            roads, and construction of about 1,600 linear meters of bridges.
     ■■     Program planning and development, institutional strengthening and program coordination support: Will support human resource and institutional capacity
            building, program monitoring and evaluation, and program development activities.
     Results Achieved:
     ■■     Construction of 410 km of secondary gravel roads, 105 km of secondary asphalt roads, and 880 linear meters of secondary bridges.
     ■■     Construction of 900 km of tertiary roads and 1,050 linear meters of tertiary bridges.
     ■■     Routine maintenance of 1,032 secondary road and periodic maintenance of 132 km of secondary road.
     ■■     Routine maintenance of 3,250 km of tertiary road and periodic maintenance of 500 km of tertiary road.
     ■■     Establishment of new Geographic Information System (GIS)-based network planning.
     ■■     Roll out of first nationwide inventory and condition survey of rural roads.

Project Background:
Over 75 percent of the Afghan population lives in rural areas where agriculture is the primary activity and contributes about one-third of GDP. But poor governance,
weak factor markets, inadequate marketing infrastructure, ineffective business development services, and poor post-harvest practices limit the development potential
of this sector.

The Afghanistan Rural Enterprise Development Project aims to ensure the social, economic, and political well being of rural communities, especially the poor and the
most vulnerable, while stimulating the integration of rural communities within the economy.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The overall development objective of the project is to improve employment opportunities and income of rural men and women, and the sustainability of targeted local
enterprises. Components are:
■■     Community-led enterprise development: Creates savings groups, enterprise groups, and village savings and loans associations. These institutions are assisted in
       building their own capacities, increasing the value of trade, ensuring production is oriented towards identified market opportunities, and creating access to credit
       through internal lending.
■■     Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development: Supports the emergence of a stronger SME sector with improved trading linkages with the rural econ-
       omy and adequate access to financial services. The project finances a sequenced approach for SME support, i.e. identifying key value chains in each province,
       working with the stakeholders to identify choke points constricting growth, identifying opportunities for value chain linkages and defining skill gaps.
■■     Project implementation support: Project management, monitoring and evaluation.
Results Achieved:
The project has so far established 5,561 saving groups (52 percent female), 415 Village Saving and Loan Associations (VSLAs), 1,238 Enterprise Groups (65 percent
female), and has supported 563 (13 percent female) SMEs.

 A total of six Provincial Situations Analysis (PSA) are completed and 10 PSAs are underway. A total 113 Kochies and 143 disabled were supported to enhance their
enterprise development skills and productivity. As whole, more than 60,000 direct and indirect jobs created through the above achievements.

Key Partners:
Afghan Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, UK’s Department for International Development (DFID), and Swedish International Development
Cooperation Agency (SIDA).

     Project Background:
     A coordinated funding mechanism to support Afghan reconstruction is essential to help the country return to normalcy.

     Such an instrument needs to be aligned with national priorities, should promote transparency and accountability of reconstruction assistance, and reinforce the
     national budget as the primary policy instrument.

     The international community and the Afghan government have recognized that the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) should be used to fund the essential
     recurrent costs required for the government to function effectively

     Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
     The objective of the recurrent cost component of the ARTF is to provide a coordinated financing mechanism enabling the Afghan government to make predictable,
     timely, and accurate payments for approved recurrent costs related to salaries and wages of civil servants, and non-security related government operating and
     maintenance expenditures.
     Components are:
     ■■     Reimbursements of civil servant salaries: Establish an amount via grant renewals for reimbursement of civilian expenditures. With the assistance of a third party
            monitoring agent, the government submissions are then reviewed to determine that these have met the eligibility criteria.
     ■■     Reimbursement of operating and maintenance costs: Establish an amount via grant renewals for reimbursement of civilian expenditures. With the assistance of
            a third party monitoring agent, the government submissions are then reviewed to determine that these have met the eligibility criteria.
     ■■     Incentive program: Introduced in 2009, it refers to a series of policy actions and revenue benchmarks agreed to between the World Bank and the government
            that align with development priorities and which, if attained, entitle the government to an agreed amount of additional funding for the first two components.
     Results Achieved:
     Over 13 years, the project disbursed nearly $3.5 billion against legitimate recurrent costs in a timely fashion.

     This represents 20 percent of civilian recurrent costs in the period, and the process provided an opportunity for donors to conduct monitoring of all civilian costs for
     adherence to financial and eligibility standards.

     The incentive component led to significant reforms in revenue generation, public-sector governance, and private-sector development.

     Key Partners:
     Government of Afghanistan, all the ARTF donors (34 countries).

structures, and functions over the medium term to improve service delivery to the population. It is demand driven with ministries required to meet certain criteria to
participate.
A CBR ministry must develop a comprehensive reform plan (to be implemented with existing donor and government resources) with a results framework to which it
is held accountable.
CBR enables a ministry to hire skilled Afghans into civil service positions at more competitive rates.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project’s development objective is to assist the government in improving the capacity and performance of select line ministries in carrying out their mandates and
delivering services to the Afghan people.

Components are:
■■     Technical Assistance Facility for preparation and implementation of CBR programs: Provides technical assistance to the participating ministries.
■■     Developing human resources: Supports the continued implementation of broad civil service reform efforts and placement of critical managerial and professional
       staff resources in participating line ministries.
■■     Civil service training: Intends to create partnerships between the Afghanistan Civil Service Institute and reputable international institutions to: (i) develop custom-
       made public administration management training programs for civil servants in managerial positions and for management interns; (ii) deliver the training
       programs; and (iii) develop faculty capacity at the Afghanistan Civil Service Institute.
■■     Project management, monitoring and evaluation: Focuses on overall project management, monitoring and reporting, and consultancy services for appraisal and
       review of implementation progress and results of CBR programs.
Results Achieved:
The ministries of Agriculture and Communications were approved as the first top tier ministries, enabling them to recruit a substantial number of skilled civil servants
to implement its CBR reform program.
The Ministry of Mines and Ministry of Social Affairs also have been approved, and several others are at various stages of proposal development.
Recruitment of senior-level civil servants funded through CBR is progressing; a total of 99 active senior management group positions are currently funded with over
100 more in various stages of recruitment.
CBR is also encouraging salary harmonization for donor-funded consultants led by the Bank.

Project Background:
Financial stability is central to sustainable development and financing growth in Afghanistan. Central Bank of Afghanistan (DAB) is required to play a pivotal regulatory
role to maintain financial stability and health of the financial system. Moreover, investing in financial infrastructure is a key to enhancing financial intermediation and
boost the system’s efficiency. This project is run by DAB and aims at supporting the following activities: (i) undertaking financial audits in accordance with international
standards, portfolio audits and institutional audits of 10 key commercial banks operating in Afghanistan (implemented); (ii) modernization of the Afghanistan national
payment system to facilitate payments within the country; (iii) support for the development of the Afghanistan Institute of Banking and Finance; and (iv) technical
assistance and training for project implementation.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project assists DAB in developing action plans for improved banking supervision and to establish key building blocks of financial sector infrastructure: payment
system, movable collateral and public credit registry.

Components and subcomponents are:
■■     Strengthening of DAB’s capacity: This component includes: (i) financial, portfolio and institutional audit of 10 commercial banks operating in Afghanistan, (ii)
       stock taking on capacity-building efforts on financial supervision over the last 10 years, and development and implementation of a capacity-building plan to
       sustainably strengthen the Financial Supervision Department; (iii) review of banking regulation framework; and (iv) development and implementation of action
       plans following audits of commercial banks.
■■     Development of the financial sector infrastructure: This component involves modernization of the national payment system, and support to the Afghanistan
       Institute of Banking and Finance.
■■     Technical assistance and training for project implementation.
Results Achieved:
■■     Under this project a fully fledged audit of the key 10 commercial banks operating in Afghanistan was completed and provided DAB with detailed and thorough
       guidance on the state of financial stability within the banking system.
■■     Developing the Movable Collateral Registry, which was established in February 2013 and followed by the establishment of the Public Credit Registry in December
       2013. Both are key building blocks to the Afghan financial system’s infrastructure. Having both systems fully functional streamlined the applications of small and
       medium-sized enterprises for banking loans and supported lending decisions.
■■     Establishment of the switch is underway at Afghanistan Payment System (APS). The procurement process for development of the Automated Transfer System (ATS)
       is complete and the contract is expected to be awarded soon. Having these two systems in place will boost financial intermediation and ease flow of liquidity
       within the banking system, hence, contributing to a more efficient and well-functioning banking system.
Key Partners:
■■     DAB
■■     APS.

     network connectivity. It also seeks to expand broadband connectivity and accelerate the development of the local private-sector information-technology (IT) industry.

     Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
     The goal is to expand connectivity, encourage widespread use of mobile applications in strategic sectors in the government, and support the development of the local
     IT industry.

     Components are:
     ■■     Expanding connectivity: Finances the expansion of the national backbone network by 1,000 kilometers (km) and supports the creation of an enabling policy and
            regulatory environment to increase the reach of high-quality mobile telephone and Internet services to more users.
     ■■     Mainstreaming mobile applications: Supports activities that build on the high penetration of mobile telephones in Afghanistan to expand the reach and improve
            the quality of public services and applications that support program management.
     ■■     IT industry development: Supports the definition of an IT sector development policy; an IT skills development program to expand the pool of skilled IT profession-
            als as a key building block for sector development in Afghanistan; and the setting up of an incubator for ICT firms in the ICT Village.
     Results Achieved:

Project Background:
The Irrigation and Restoration and Development Project is designed as a follow-up initiative to the International Development Association-funded Emergency Irrigation
Rehabilitation Project (EIRP).

While various bilateral and multilateral donors supported the reconstruction or development of specific dams or river basins, the EIRP was instrumental to the
government’s launch of a national irrigation rehabilitation program in 2004. The EIRP had a national coverage and was designed to respond to requests and demands
of local communities.

The mid-term review mission of the project was completed in July 2015. The project will be restructured and preparation of $70 million in additional financing from
the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund is in progress and expected to be approved by June 2016.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The objective is to increase agriculture productivity and output in the project areas.

Components are:
■■     Rehabilitation of irrigation systems: Supports the rehabilitation of irrigation schemes covering total irrigated area of about 300,000 hectares (ha).
■■     Small dam development: Supports the design and construction of about three multi-purpose small dams and appurtenances, and associated irrigation convey-
       ance and distribution systems.
■■     Establishment of hydro-meteorological facilities and services: Builds on work done under EIRP and will establish an efficient and effective hydro-meteorological
       service.
■■     Project management and capacity building: Includes (i) project management and construction supervision; (ii) support for capacity building; and (iii) incremental
       contract staff.
Results Achieved:
The project has made good physical progress and shown tangible impacts:
■■     A total of 98 irrigation schemes have been rehabilitated, benefiting 100,000 ha of irrigation command area (compared to the end project target of 300,000 ha)
       and 63,000 farmers.
■■     Pre-feasibility studies of 22 small dams have been done. Complete feasibility studies have been conducted for six of the best-ranked small dams in the northern
       river basin. Detailed social and environmental study will be done.
■■     Regular data collection from the establishment of 127 hydrological stations and 56 snow and meteorological station located in various locations on the five river
       basin is ongoing, and production of an annual Hydrology Book has been started. In addition, 40 cableway stations for flow measurement at selected hydrology
       stations are installed.

     Project Background:
     The Afghanistan New Market Development Project (ANMDP) is the first World Bank-funded project to be implemented by Ministry of Commerce and Industries (MOCI)
     since the World Bank’s re-engagement in Afghanistan. It seeks to support the development of the Afghan private sector.

     Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
     The objective is to help revitalize private sector activities in the four major cities – Kabul, Mazar-e-Sharif, Jalalabad, and Herat – by providing business development and
     technical assistance to support private firms’ initiative to gain market knowledge, improve product quality and processing.

     Components are:
     ■■     Facility for New Market Development: Establishes a cost-sharing mechanism to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and business associations to
            access business development services in order to enhance productive capacity and encourage innovation through product or market diversification.
     ■■     Project implementation support and technical assistance to MOCI: Supports MOCI with: (i) the establishment and operation of a project management unit for
            the ANMDP; and (ii) technical assistance to develop a strategic plan to access support from the recently approved Afghanistan Capacity Building for Results (CBR)
            Facility.
     Results Achieved:
     The Facility for New Market Development (FNMD) was officially launched on March 12, 2013. Since then, it has received 1,051 applications from SMEs and signed
     cost-sharing grant contracts worth $10 million with 434 firms and associations. Moreover, the Facility has processed 67 additional grant agreements with same SMEs
     who successfully completed their first cycle of agreements.

     Also through the Facility, more than 1,385 jobs have been created across the country, including more than 30 percent for women, with 155 new or improved products
     introduced in either domestic or export markets.

Project Background:
The National Solidarity Program (NSP) is a flagship program of the government of Afghanistan and is currently operating in all 34 provinces. The Afghan government
launched NSP to lay the foundation for a sustainable form of inclusive local governance, rural reconstruction, and poverty alleviation. It is identified in Afghanistan’s National
Development Strategy as the government’s principal community development program. The NSP, currently in its 12th year and third phase, is executed by the Afghanistan
Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD).

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The objective is to build, strengthen, and maintain community development councils (CDCs) as effective institutions for local governance and socioeconomic development.
Components are:
■■     Capacity building: Establish CDCs to: (i) function as village-level governance bodies for continued empowerment of village communities; and (ii) facilitate communities’
       participation in the various sector programs operating in rural areas.
■■     Community grants for economic and social development: Provide block grants to communities to fund priority investment schemes (subprojects) for rural and social
       development
■■     Project implementation: Support MRRD’s overall management and oversight of NSP.
Results Achieved:
Since 2003, NSP has successfully established CDCs in over 34,600 communities, and supported subsequent rounds of CDC elections in over 11,400 of these communities.
Over 485,000 CDC members have been elected, registered and trained in a variety of areas including their roles and responsibilities, basic accounting, basic procurement,
basic project management, and linkages with other government and development actors. Over 950,000 community members have also been trained to support the CDCs
with project management and/or operations and maintenance. In a sign of ownership, communities have contributed over $150 million in cash, -in-kind contributions, and
voluntary labor towards the subprojects implemented via the NSP.
Section A (NSP III):
Specifically under the current phase, over 14,530 new CDCs have been established and over 11,300 been re-elected. Together, over 25,700 CDPs have been prepared, and
over 41,200 subproject proposals designed. More than 40,800 of these proposals have been financed with block grants totaling $922 million, and of them over 24,600 have
been closed while others are ongoing. The sub-projects financed include transportation (30 percent), water supply and sanitation (25 percent), irrigation (26 percent) power
(5 percent) and others (14 percent). Over 15 million people have benefited from financed sub-projects. NSP has created temporary rural employment by generating over 27
million labor days.
Section B (Overall NSP I,II and III):
Cumulatively, during all the NSP phases to date, over 34,600 CDCs have been elected and over 11,300 of these have held re-elections. More than $2.19 billion has been
received, of which about $1.57 billion has gone to communities through block grants to finance over 87,900 sub-projects. More than 71,800 of these projects have been
closed and the remaining are ongoing.
Over 6.1 million families have benefited from NSP sub-projects financed. NSP has created temporary rural employment by generating over 52 million labor days during the
he past 12 years.

Project Background:
Most irrigation schemes in Afghanistan are operating at 25 percent efficiency, as compared to the norm of 40-60 percent elsewhere in South Asia. Water loss occurs
at farm level because the absence of proper farm-level irrigation systems (basins, furrows) leads to wastage of water supplied from the watercourses. Under the
Agriculture Production and Productivity Program, the first step is to improve agricultural productivity by reducing water loss in tertiary canals and proper on-farm water
management practices. Additional financing of about $45 million from the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund is being prepared. It is expected to be approved by
end of 2015.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The objective is to improve agricultural productivity in project areas by enhancing the efficiency of water used.
Components are:
■■     On-farm water management: Carries out social mobilization for the establishment of irrigation associations (IAs) in the project areas, including the provision of: (i)
       training to communities in organization and management of IAs; (ii) facilitation services for communities to develop the IAs’ internal legal rules and regulations;
       (iii) assistance to IAs to be registered under the Water Law; (iv) technical training to IAs; and (v) carrying out engineering surveys and infrastructure improvements
       to small irrigation schemes, or tertiary canals, covering approximately 10,000 hectares in the project areas.
■■     Institutional strengthening and capacity building: Develops institutional capacity at the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL) to plan, design,
       implement, and monitor on-farm water management programs. Supports the construction of five office buildings to accommodate the ministry’s irrigation direc-
       torate and staff at regional centers in Kabul, Herat, Mazar-e-Sharif, Baghlan and Jalalabad.
■■     Project management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation: Strengthens institutional capacity at the ministry for project implementation, monitoring, and
       evaluation by establishing and maintaining a project implementation unit comprising a Kabul-based core team, five project area teams, and internationally
       recruited experts.
Results Achieved:
■■     Land productivity of wheat and other crops has increased by 15 percent, while water productivity of wheat and other crops also increased by 10 percent and ir-
       rigated area by 10 percent.
■■     Physical rehabilitation of irrigation schemes exceeded its target with good quality and within the project budget allocation and timeline. To date, 100 irrigation
       schemes (mostly informal) have been rehabilitated covering a total of 19,000 hectares of irrigation command area.
■■     Establishment of 175 irrigation associations (IAs) has been completed. The IAs are based on traditional Mirab system and have taken up the responsibilities for
       operation and maintenance.
■■     Robust impacts have been observed on increasing agriculture production with relatively modest investment costs (on average less than $500 per hectare).

     Project Background:
     Building core public financial management (PFM) capacity in government has been one of the fundamental thrusts of the Bank’s in-terim support strategy for
     Afghanistan. The Bank has gained valuable insight on PFM issues in Afghanistan through International Development Association (IDA)-funded technical assistance
     projects and extensive analytical work.

     In the wake of discussions between the government and the donor community on a planned transition for Afghanistan to take greater responsibility in managing the
     reconstruction agenda, the government prepared and shared with donors at the Kabul Donor Conference in June 2010 a PFM “roadmap”. It is guided by the vision that:
     (i) policies that reflect the aspirations and needs of the Afghan people drive the government budget; (ii) a government budget assigns responsibility for development
     outcomes; (iii) efficient public finance and equitable allocation of resources sustain economic development; and (iv) accountable civil servants and equitable delivery
     of services build citizens’ trust in government.

     Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
     To strengthen public financial management through effective procurement, treasury and audit structures and systems in line with sound financial management
     standards of monitoring, reporting, and control.
     Components are:
     ■■     Procurement reform: Introduces procurement reform aimed at enhancing procurement facilitation, capacity building in line ministries and provinces, and insti-
            tutional development.
     ■■     Financial management reform: Supports financial management reform in treasury operations and system development, human resources capacity development,
            professional accountant organization, and line ministry public financial management assessments.
     ■■     Audit reform: Supports reforms and performance improvement through training for internal and external audit.
     ■■     Reform management: Supports monitoring technical assistance and reporting on benchmarks of the PFM roadmap
     Results Achieved:
     ■■     The legal framework underpinning public financial management in Afghanistan has been established. The government now prepares and passes a comprehen-
            sive budget in an orderly and transparent manner.
     ■■     A government–wide integrated financial management information system is in place.
     ■■     Project support to Afghanistan’s centralized procurement oversight has been mobilized and the National Procurement Authority, as successor to the Procurement
            Policy Unit, continues to assist with the reorganization, development, and assessment of procurement units in the line ministries.

Project Background:
The Afghan formal social protection system consists largely of a pension scheme for public sector employees, military, police and a Martyrs and Disabled Pension
Program. In addition, a social safety net encompasses a number of government and donor schemes that transfer cash and in-kind benefits to various groups.
In pensions, the government’s objective is to ensure fiscal sustainability and mitigate fiscal impact of the civil service reform on the pension program, making it
consistent with the broader public-sector reform agenda. However, the recent increase in spending in the Martyrs and Disabled Program puts at risk the sustainability
of social protection expenditures. In safety nets, the government aims to build a targeted and scalable system in the country.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project’s goals are to improve the administration of the public pension schemes, and develop administrative systems for safety net interventions, with a focus on
targeting and benefit payment delivery systems, while delivering cash benefits to the poorest families in specific pilot districts.

Project Components are:
■■     Pensions: Supports the design of new administrative arrangements for the public pension system and modernization of the existing pension systems, including
       the Martyrs and Disabled Pension.
■■     Safety Nets: Supports designing and piloting of targeting and delivery systems to establish a poverty-targeted cash transfer system. This includes capacity devel-
       opment at the ministry to deliver and coordinate social protection programs.
Results Achieved:
■■     Key elements of a reformed and modernized Public Sector Pension System are in place. Those elements include: a revised institutional and human resources
       structure of the Pension Department; a comprehensive new Management Information System (MIS); a set of business processes; fiscal forecasting models for
       revenues and expenditures; and a new chart of accounts of the pension system. Around 55,000 pensioners are registered in the new pension MIS and are paid
       through bank accounts.
■■      A multi-phased safety net cash transfer pilot has been designed, implemented, and evaluated. A targeting and benefit delivery mechanism has been tested and
       is now being further improved, together with computerized registration.
■■     The pilot program over the past three years has provided support in cash transfers to more than 16,000 poor and vulnerable families (around 80,000 individuals)
       in eight selected districts in five provinces.

     Background and Objectives:
     The development objective of the project is to increase the number of electricity connections for the urban centers of Charikar, Gulbahar and Jabul-es-Seraj and Pul-e-
     Khumri and to improve the availability of power from Naghlu and Mahipar switchyards.
     The original project had three components: (i) rehabilitation of the distribution system in Charikar, Gulbahar, and Jabul-es-Seraj (in Parwan province) and Pul-e-
     Khumri (in Baghlan province); (ii) rehabilitation of transmission switchyards at the Mahipar and Naghlu hydro-power stations on the Kabul River; and (iii) project
     implementation support to the Ministry of Energy and Water and the recruitment/retention of a project management firm. Under the additional financing, the
     implementation of components under the original project will be completed by covering the cost overrun and restructuring project implementation by components.

     Key Achievements:
     The Mahipar switchyard rehabilitation under contract has been completed and handed over to DABS, and staff at the hydropower station are trained on the operation of
     the new equipment. All materials for rehabilitation have been delivered to the Naghlu site, and the work has been started.Additional financing is expected to increase
     the number of electricity connections for the remaining urban centers of Pul-e-Khumri in an “institutionally efficient way”, and to improve the availability of power from
     the Naghlu and Mahipar switchyards by completing the remaining rehabilitation works at Ngahlu hydropower plant switchyard.

Background and Objectives:
As part of the Central Asia-South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project (CASA-1000), the four participating countries --Afghanistan, Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan
and Tajikistan, -- will implement individual community support programs (CSPs) in each country, with the aim of increasing the shared prosperity associated with the
project for communities along the CASA-1000 corridor.
The Afghanistan CASA-CSP Project development object is to provide access to electricity or other social and economic infrastructure services to communities in the
project area in order to strengthen community support for CASA-1000 transmission line.

Key Achievements:
Work under CASA-CSP will begin once the CASA-1000 project is operational. Once implementation begins, the CSP is expected to benefit communities that live along
a two-kilometer “Corridor of Influence” on each side of the CASA-1000 transmission line. It is expected that there will be approximately 700 communities spread over
23 districts in six provinces, with a total of over 152,000 families along the corridor.

     Background and Objectives:
     The Kabul Municipal Development Program (KMDP) grant for $110 million was approved and became effective in April 2014. As of April 9, 2015, within one year
     of effectiveness, disbursements stand at $15.2 million (14 percent). The project development objectives (PDO) remain highly relevant for Kabul, a city with over 70
     percent of its population living in unplanned settlements. KMDP’s cost- effective methodology enables equitable service delivery, strengthens the social capital of
     the beneficiary communities, and continues to entrench a culture of community participation in decision making over public expenditures that directly impact the
     community. The likelihood of achieving end-of-project, as well as intermediate, PDO indicator targets is high. The PDO is rated “satisfactory”.
     The project development objectives are to: (i) increase access to basic municipal services in selected residential areas of Kabul city; (ii) redesign the Kabul Muncipality’s
     financial management system to support better service delivery; and (iii) enable early response in the event of an eligible emergency.

     Key Achievements:
     Effective for just over a year, implementation of the KMDP grant is progressing well, and it is expected to achieve the indicator targets at the project outcome level and
     at the intermediate level by the closing date.
     Grant disbursements stand at $15.21 million (14 percent) and KMDP commitments at $23.5million (21.3 percent). By December 31, 2016, cumulative expenditures
     by KMDP within 20 months of effectiveness of the grant are expected to be about $35 million (about 32 percent).
     There are 313,885 direct beneficiaries (40 percent of the target number -- 102,995 from upgrading and 210,890 from trunk roads) and 76,985 indirect beneficiaries.
     The latter group includes students, teachers and staff of several schools and institutions of higher education that are located within the upgraded areas. About 73
     percent of the beneficiaries are women and children. About 11,300 tree samplings have been planted in 13 gozars with community contributions; and community
     solid waste collection mechanisms are functioning in most of the gozars. The works executed have generated 670,456 mandays of temporary employment.

Background and Objectives:
Unprecedented population growth in Kabul, large-scale destruction of the city’s infrastructure during the war, followed by a growing concentration of security-related
activity has exacerbated the backlog of infrastructure deficiency in a city that harbors the capital functions of the country. A city originally planned for less than one
million people, is now ranked 86th among the world’s largest agglomerations. The capacity of the existing road network is diminished further by an astronomical
growth in the number of motor vehicles that is today double the 300,000 vehicles for which the network was designed. The result is extreme congestion that is further
exacerbated by security-related encroachments and road closures.

Urban productivity of Kabul is deeply impacted by inadequate transport services. Although Kabul’s existing urban road network, initially planned and developed in
1960s with technical support from the former Soviet Union, provides generous widths, road surfaces have deteriorated due to age, poor maintenance, severe weather
conditions, and the lack of proper drainage. Fifty-five percent of the network is in need of rehabilitation. More than 61 percent of the urban population accesses their
homes through unpaved roads. The result is poor access to jobs and services, low mobility of passenger and freight movement, congestion, increased road accident
rates, and productivity losses.

The project development objective is to improve road conditions and traffic flows in selected corridors of Kabul City.

Key Achievements:
Initial activities including survey, design review, and procurement of civil works started during the preparation of the project. As of July 15, 2015, two of four national
competitive bidding civil works contracts (Lot-1 - 1.92 km and Lot-2 - 2.52 km) have been implemented and the road is opened to the traffic. Physical progress of Lot-3
stands at 65 percent and at 10 percent for Lot-4. The pro-curement process for two of four international competitive bidding civil works contracts (Lot-5 and Lot-6) has
been completed and the contracts are ready for award. The design review for Lot-8 is completed and the procurement process has started, while the design review for
Lot-7 and Wazir Abad canal is in progress. The terms of reference for the soft studies under Component B have been prepared and sent to the bank for review.

     Background and Objectives:
     It is widely acknowledged that Afghanistan’s growth is constrained by the incidence of poverty, high illiteracy, and the lack of a skilled labor force. This proposed project
     directly links literacy and skills development by designing interventions that improve access to skills for illiterate and unskilled young Afghan men and women. The
     project will incentivize non-formal training providers to provide quality training to Afghan men and women and increase their job-placement rates. Subsequently, the
     project shall promote entrepreneurship among youth to help improve their welfare status.

     To increase the potential for employment and higher earnings of targeted young Afghan women and men in rural and semi-urban areas through non-formal skills
     training. The project has the following components:
     ■■     Improving the quality of non-formal training and the labor market outcomes of trainees.	
     ■■     Project management, capacity building of the Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled (MOLSAMD) and monitoring and evaluation. Strengthening
            the capacity of National Skills Development Program/MOLSAMD for project implementation and monitoring.	
     ■■     Piloting entrepreneurship among unskilled and Illiterate young Afghans. Many young Afghans are unskilled and illiterate and are unprepared to compete in the
            labor market.	
     Key Achievements:
     ■■     Mapping of the training providers across the country.
     ■■     Complete the environmental and social assessment study.
     ■■     Consultative discussion with stakeholders for identification and development of 10 priority occupations for certification and curriculum development.
     ■■     Completion of the web-based applications for capturing project data in final stages.

Project Background:
The Afghanistan Secured Lending Project is part of the Financial Infrastructure Program in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region. The Inertional Finance
Corporation’s access to finance advisory services in the MENA region, through its Secured Transactions and Collateral Registries Team, assists government clients in
developing the appropriate legal and institutional frameworks to allow and encourage the use of movable assets as collateral for loans.
At inception of the project, the results from the Doing Business ranking on the Ease of Getting Credit, a measure of credit information sharing and legal rights of
borrowers and lenders, showed that the financial sector in Afghanistan was not able to meet the needs of small firms or individuals – Afghanistan ranked 179th out of
181 countries in 2009. 	
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The overall objective of the project is to achieve sustained development of the financial sector by increasing private-sector access to finance, particularly credit, in the
MENA region, by strengthening lender rights in movable assets.

In Afghanistan, the project operates under three components: (i) legislative reform resulting in enactment or amendment of laws and regulations to enhance rights
of creditors of movable assets; (ii) creation of a functioning movable asset registry to enable lenders to effectively file a notice related to their proprietary rights, and
(iii) awareness-raising and capacity-building activities to increase knowledge among stakeholders about the benefits of well-functioning secured financing systems.
The overall program targets are to benefit 250 micro, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with expanded access to finance, facilitate $13 million in financing to SMEs
(secured with movable property as collateral) and an overall $30 million in financing facilitated

Results Achieved:
■■     Legislation on secured transactions in movable property and a regulation for operating the registry adopted in Afghanistan Collateral Registry. There were 3,869
       new registrations as of May 2015.
■■     Improvement in 2015 from zero to nine in Afghanistan’s rating on the “Strength of Legal Rights Index,” a subset of Doing Business’ “Ease of Getting Credit”
       measure. Further in 2015, Afghanistan was ranked 89th out of 189 countries on the “Ease of Getting Credit” ranking.
■■     Establishment of the Afghanistan Institute of Banking and Finance in November 2010.

     Project Background:
     Afghanistan International Bank (AIB) has as shareholders the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and two Afghan private-sector business groups, Horizon Associates LLC
     (HA) and Wilton Holdings Ltd. (WHL). The three have ownership stakes of of 7.5 percent, 46.25 percent and 46.25 percent, respectively. The bank was founded in March
     2004 and is present in the major cities of Afghanistan through its network of 32 branches. It has roughly a 22 percent share in the total assets of the banking sector,
     and was the first bank to commence ATM services and introduce international debit card services in Afghanistan.

     AIB focuses its lending efforts on corporates and the small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), mostly in construction (31 percent) and fuel supply (31 percent)
     segments. In 2012, AIB acquired Standard Chartered Bank’s retail business in Afghanistan comprising one branch, nine ATMs and gross assets of $229 million. As of
     June 2015, AIB has 33 branches, two cash outlets and employs about 680 staff members.

Project Background:
The private sector in Afghanistan still lacks a sufficient level of capacity and understanding of good business skills and practices.
This lack of knowledge affects the ability of the private sector to grow or to export, which in turn affects economic growth. The business development services (BDS)/
management skills training market, while having improved its capacity to deliver high-quality training using material customized to the local business environment,
is still underdeveloped and requires further assistance to enable it to orient itself towards the private sector and its training needs.

The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has been contributing to the development of management capacity in both the public and private sector with its Business
Edge (BE) management-training program for the past four years (September 2008 to March 2013).
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
■■     The overall goal of the project is to enhance the business performance and increase the revenue of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) by developing
       their managerial capacities using IFC’s BE product.
■■     The project will build the capacity of local training providers to deliver BE management training to 5,200 individuals (of whom 1,820 are women), reaching 520
       MSMEs.
■■     Approximately 77 percent of the targets (4,000 individuals trained) will be reached by project completion (June 30, 2016) and 23 percent of targets (1,200) will
       be reached within three years of post-project completion (by June 30, 2019).
Results Achieved:
From inception in September 2008 to June 30, 2015, the project has delivered training to 9,056 people including 3,935 (43 percent) women and reached 801 MSMEs.
The impact assessment indicated that 91 percent of the private-sector respondents expressed a positive impact of the BE training on company performance.

From April 2013, to June 2015, the current project has delivered training to 5,604 people including 2,724 (48.6 percent) women and reached 547 MSMEs. In 2014,
two impact assessment surveys were conducted to determine both the impact of BE training on unemployed individuals and the impact of Business Thematic Radio
programs sponsored by IFC on businesses. Results show:
■■     68 percent of the trained individuals stated that the training helped them in getting jobs.
■■     8 percent individuals reported that the training helped them in setting up their own businesses.
Of the 608 respondents, 76 percent of individuals employed the skills and ideas acquired from the radio programs and most of them reported positive impact of the
programs on their businesses.

     Project Background:
     The Afghanistan Construction Permits Reform Project, launched in May 2014, aims to support the Afghan government as it revamps the way construction permits
     are issued across the country. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) will help officials simplify the often time-consuming permitting process and advise the
     government as it develops new permitting laws. The changes, planned for the provinces at the national and subnational levels, are designed to spur the growth of
     Afghanistan’s construction sector, a vital part of the country’s economy. That, in turn, is expected to increase the supply of affordable housing at a time when the demand
     for new homes is growing quickly. The project is part of a wider IFC effort to help diversify Afghanistan’s economy and spur growth across the nation.
     Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
     The objective of this project is to develop a simplified yet effective construction-permit system and regulatory framework that will improve the government’s efficiency
     and capacity to issue construction permits. By doing so, the private sector will benefit from reduced costs through the easing of permitting bottlenecks, which hamper
     the ability of the growing housing sector in Afghanistan to meet demand.
     The new framework will also allow the government to retroactively formalize unpermitted buildings. The project aims to reduce the time it takes to obtain construction
     permits from the current 334 days to 180 days, reduce the number of procedures from 15 to nine, and improve the capacity of civil servants operating the process.
     Changes are expected to increase both the efficiency and capacity of the Kabul Municipality to issue construction permits and, hence, increase applications under the
     reformed permits system by 40 percent.

     Results Achieved:
     ■■     Implement and monitor the new, simplified construction permit processes in Kabul to ensure smooth operations and make necessary adjustments based on early
            implementation results.
     ■■     Provide the necessary legal expertise to support the client in drafting framework changes in light of best practices.
     ■■     Support the Afghan government in the implementation of the capacity building/training plan. The training plan will comprise two levels to address operational-
            level staff and management (decision-making) level officials.
     ■■     Run the private public-dialogue as per the design stage.

Project Background:
Founded in 2003, Roshan is the leading local mobile operator in Afghanistan, with an estimated 27 percent mobile market share and 5.6 million subscribers as of
March 2013. The company currently reaches 230 cities and towns in all of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces and covers approximately 62 percent of the population.
In mid-2012, Roshan approached the International Finance Corporation (IFC) about financing: (i) the acquisition of its 3G license; (ii) the capital expenditures to roll-out
the 3G network and improve the 2G network; and (iii) consolidation of its existing loans into a single loan and extending its maturity
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
IFC provided Roshan with long-term financing not available from local commercial banks or capital markets to finance its 3G expansion plan.
Given an Internet penetration rate of only 4 percent and a fixed-line penetration of 1 percent in the country, IFC’s investment is expected to create a competitive
environment that motivates all operators to provide the best quality mobile data services at competitive prices to the Afghan population.
In accordance with the 3G license obligations, Roshan will extend its mobile broadband services coverage to achieve a target of 80 percent population coverage in key
cities within five years.
Other development impacts include: (i) broadening economic opportunity to reach the unbanked population in Afghanistan through Roshan’s mobile banking
services; (ii) financially supporting community social programs such as building schools and playgrounds and providing clean water wells; and (iii) reducing the
gender gap by financially supporting the inclusion of women in society.

Results Expected:
With IFC’s investment, Roshan is expected to achieve the following results by 2015:
■■     Increase mobile banking customers to 900,000 (against less than 100,000 at time of investment).
■■     Increase mobile customers to 8.1 million (against 5.6 million at time of investment).
■■     Increase direct employment to 1,417 (against approximately 1,200 at time of investment).
■■     Support local companies and small and medium-sized enterprises by partnering with over 4,600 dealers and distributors (against 4,300 at time of investment).
■■     Increase the amount of regulatory fees and taxes paid to the government to $59 million ($41 million in 2012).

     Project Background:
     This project builds on the success of a previous successful International Finance Corporation (IFC) intervention in the horticulture sector, Afghanistan Horticulture
     Exports Development, which helped farmers to adopt best agriculture practices for two major export commodities (raisins and pomegranates).

     The project will focus on improving farmers’ skills and expanding market opportunities for Afghan agriculture commodities through improving access to export
     markets, and strengthening the overall value chain, including processing opportunities for grade B fruits.

     The project will reach out to farmers located in remote locations, leveraging the skills of the extension workers association established and trained in the previous
     project. These farmers will be integrated into the supply chain of large fruit exporting and processing firms in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, these lead agribusinesses will
     be supported in becoming compliant with global standards required for access to high-end markets for food products.
     Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
     The overall objective of the project is to increase the supply of fresh and processed fruits, through improved compliance with market standards, and integration of
     farmers into the value chain of lead agribusiness firms, giving them access to wider market opportunities.
     The project will initially start its activities in Kandahar province, building on the success of the previous project, while assessing the potential of expanding to other
     provinces in Afghanistan.

     Results Expected:
     ■■     Support 1,000 farmers in adopting best agriculture practices for fruits and complying with market standards. The outreach to farmers will be ensured through the
            already-established network of extension workers in Kandahar.
     ■■     Improve the operations of at least one lead Afghan agribusiness firm through the integration of farmers who were able to implement best practices in their supply
            chains.
     ■■     Increase the sales value of Afghan fresh and processed fruits by $2 million, through at least four export contracts, as a result of supporting one or two leading
            Afghan agribusiness firms in accessing wider market opportunities.
     Key Partners:
     Large fruit processing companies in Afghanistan, the Extension Workers Association, local non-governmental,organizations, organizations engaged in supporting the
     agribusiness sector in Afghanistan, potential global buyers (IFC and non-IFC investment clients).

Project Background:
Dairy products are a major source of protein in Afghanistan. However, the dairy sector was largely destroyed during the Afghan civil war and has yet to fully recover.
Imported dairy products have gained the majority of the market share in large metropolitan areas, including Kabul.
Supporting the livestock and local dairy industries has been a priority for the Afghan government as well as international development organizations. However,
domestic producers continue to find it difficult to compete with imported products in terms of both quality and quantity.
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) issued a guarantee of $1.82 million for 10 years to Mido Dairy Production Co. (MIDO) to cover direct equity
against the following risks: transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
From both the country and sector perspectives, MIGA is playing an important role in facilitating private investment to promote the technical know-how and investment
needed to develop this sector in a conflict-affected country.

Project entails the establishment of a joint venture company in Afghanistan, MIDO. It has a dairy processing plant located in the suburbs of Kabul that will produce and
distribute high-quality dairy products such as milk and yogurt, primarily to Kabul.

Results Expected:
With MIGA guarantee coverage, MIDO is expected to achieve:
■■     The generation of 20-25 new permanent jobs.
■■     €1.2 million over the seven years of operation in taxes and fees.
■■     27.9 percent economic rate of return

     Project Background:
     Afghanistan is the third largest producer of raw (greasy) cashmere in the world, after China and Mongolia. Cashmere is harvested only in limited areas of Afghanistan,
     mostly in the western provinces of Herat, Farah, Ghor, and Badghis.
     Currently, Afghanistan exports around 1,000 metric tons of cashmere on an annual basis. The main trade center is Herat, where a handful of exporters gather to
     purchase the cashmere from farmers.
     The project was initially supported by the Afghanistan Small and Medium Enterprise Development program and funded by the US Agency for International Development
     (USAID). In 2011, this program provided funding to Traitex Belgium and Cashmere Fibres International, the largest dehairer of Afghan cashmere, to set up operations
     in Afghanistan to increase the value-added within the country and to promote the development of the sector.

     Traitex Belgium is an independent processing company that scours and carbonizes wool and cashmere. It is based in Verviers, Belgium. In June 2013, the Multilateral
     Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) issued a guarantee of $1.3 million to Traitex to cover direct equity against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war
     and civil disturbance.

Project Background:
In 2002, following decades of armed conflict, Afghanistan had a barely functioning and severely limited communications network. In early 2007, the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) made a commitment to provide support directly to the most recent (third) mobile
operator, MTN Group (then Areeba Afghanistan). IFC initially made an investment commitment in Areeba Afghanistan in 2006, which was later replaced by a larger
investment facility to MTN Afghanistan comprising an equity investment of $13.5 million and senior debt of $65 million to finance the expansion of MTN’s operations.
MIGA issued a guarantee of $74.5 million to cover its direct equity investment of $85 million in Afghanistan. The coverage was for 15 years against two risks: (i) transfer
and convertibility restriction; and (ii) expropriation. The Afghanistan Investment Guarantee Facility (AIGF), managed by MIGA, provided $2 million of first loss. In 2011,
when MTN Group expanded its network, MIGA issued a second guarantee of $84.1 million. These guarantees bring MIGA’s total gross coverage to $158.6 million and
total net coverage up to $108.6 million. IFC exited its equity investment in July 2013 and the debt will be fully repaid in September 2015.
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
From both a country and sector perspective, MIGA and IFC are playing an important role in facilitating south-south investment to promote the expansion of
telecommunications infrastructure in a conflict-affected country, increasing the availability and affordability of communication services in Afghanistan. Furthermore,
IFC’s investment has been supporting the expansion of telecom services into semi-urban and rural areas of Afghanistan. MIGA can mobilize additional capacity in the
private insurance market through its reinsurance arrangements. MIGA’s establishment of the AIGF, a first loss fund, with the help of other donor countries, has helped
bring down the risk of the transaction, making it more attractive for the private reinsurance market.

Results Expected:
With MIGA guarantee coverage and IFC’s investment and advisory support, MTN has been able to exceed expectations and reach over five million subscribers, close to
a one-third market share.

Key Partners:
AIGF – MIGA.

     Project Background:
     The formal sector in Afghanistan is still in a formative stage, since the reopening of the economy to international business in 2002-2003. The economy is dominated
     by informal enterprises. Registered firms are young and small: half of them have been operating for four years or less, and 91 percent of them have a maximum of
     five employees. Economic growth is estimated to have fallen to 2 percent in 2014, from 3.7 percent in 2013 and an average of 9 percent during 2003-12; the growth
     outlook for 2015 remains weak. Some of the major challenges that Afghanistan faces in the immediate and medium term are: restoring confidence and creating
     private-sector jobs; and strengthening cohesion and service delivery.
     This project can provide useful data to contribute to these goals as it will cover the measurement of four Doing Business indicators that are actionable at the local
     level and where subnational differences are likely to occur: starting a business, dealing with construction permits, registering property, and getting electricity. Even
     in countries characterized by centralized public sector like Afghanistan, these areas show subnational differences at the regulatory level and/or in how the national
     regulations are implemented in practice. The benchmarking will include four of the largest cities in addition to Kabul that serve as regional economic centers: Herat,
     Mazar e-Sharif, Kandahar, Jalalabad, Kabul.

     Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
     The objective of the project is to support the Government of Afghanistan to advance regulatory reforms at the subnational level to foster a better business-enabling
     regulatory environment across the country. It will do so by producing a Subnational Doing Business (SNDB) report that benchmarks business regulations and their
     implementation on four key Doing Business indicators (starting a business, registering property, dealing with construction permits, and getting electricity) across four
     municipalities (Herat, Mazar e-Sharif, Kandahar, Jalalabad) as well as Kabul.

     The report: (i) allows comparability among municipalities in Afghanistan and with 189 economies worldwide; (ii) identifies regulatory constraints in detail and
     highlights good practices; (iii) provides in-depth analysis and detailed policy recommendations on how to improve the areas measured; (iv) promotes peer-to-peer
     learning through the sharing of good practices; (v) and motivates governments to reform by repeating the measurement over time. A second round of Subnational
     Doing Business bench-marking starting in 2018 will update the measurements and document the reforms undertaken in response to the first benchmarking round in
     each of the cities. It will also provide further reform recommendations.

     Results Expected:
     The SNDB in Afghanistan is just starting and has no results to date.

Project Background:
The Afghanistan Leasing Project is currently part of the Financial Infrastructure Program in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. At the inception of the
project, Afghanistan had begun the process of rebuilding its shattered economy following decades of conflict. Responding to a request from the Government of
Afghanistan in May 2006 Advisory Services-MENA’s Leasing Program conducted a needs assessment to investigate the potential and scope for International Finance
Corporation (IFC) involvement to develop financial leasing in Afghanistan. The results of the assessment confirmed that the legal infrastructure, technical skills, and
knowledge of specialized financial products such as leasing are largely absent. Therefore, the need for a comprehensive project that would include legislative reform,
capacity building, and general awareness-raising activities to stimulate and develop the leasing sector was necessary.

This project will improve the access to finance for micro, small and medium sized enterprises (MSMEs). Micro and small businesses are flourishing and new financial
institutions have been established to service them. Leasing allows MSMEs to finance capital assets, increase production, improve profitability, and create jobs. As it is
inherently Shari’a compliant, leasing has particular relevance for Afghanistan. IFC is uniquely qualified to assist the government given its extensive experience, both
regional and global, in similar projects and expertise in providing advisory services to governments and the private sector to develop leasing markets worldwide.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The objective of the project is to assist in the development of the leasing sector in Afghanistan through creation of enabling legislation, awareness-raising and capacity-
building activities to various stakeholders.

The project will benefit MSMEs, financial institutions (banks, leasing companies etc.), and government institutions. Financial institutions will be able to diversify and
expand their portfolios and enterprises will have greater access to finance. Enterprises will be able to benefit from using assets and generate profits. Government
institutions and judiciary will obtain the necessary knowledge and skills to support leasing in Afghanistan.
This objective is expected to be achieved through (i) legal reform resulting in enactment of the Law on Leasing; (ii) tax reform resulting in improvement of the tax
treatment of leasing operations; and (iii) awareness-raising and capacity-building activities to increase knowledge among stakeholders’ (both government and private
sector) about the benefits of leasing.

Results Expected:
■■     The Leasing Law, based on UNIDROIT Model that is considered a global best practice, was enacted in April 2014 and published in the official gazette.
■■     Income tax manual approved.
■■     Final draft on leasing regulation has been submitted for approval by the central bank’s Supreme Council.
■■     Twelve capacity-building and awareness-raising events for more than 115 participants from the public and private sector were conducted. Satisfaction rate ex-
       ceeded 85 percent.

     Project Background:
     The World Bank Group fosters sustainable economic growth in developing countries by providing advisory services to businesses and governments aimed at specific
     aspects of private-sector development, including supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, enhancing access to finance, improving the business enabling
     environment, supporting privatization and public-private partnerships and promoting environmental and social sustainable practices. Advisory services are delivered
     through the Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice in the Bank’s South Asia Region.

     An analysis conducted by International Finance Corporation (IFC) Advisory in December 2013 revealed that starting a business at the subnational level is a very
     complex, unwieldy and time-consuming process and is a severe impediment to investment at the subnational level. This analysis recommended a fundamental
     rethinking of the strict system of starting a business enforced by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MoCI) at the subnational level. For example, the report
     recommended that the MoCI abolish duplicated and unnecessary regulations that were cumbersome to investors. Evidence collected from interviews with business
     managers at the subnational level, as well as with MoCI officials, indicated that the procedures for obtaining a business license and registration required a minimum
     of several weeks, and might extend to a few months. This is significantly slower than the two to three days currently required to complete the same process in Kabul.

     Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
     The objective of this project is to support the Government of Afghanistan at the national level in Kabul and at the subnational level in 16 other governorates by building
     on the reforms achieved in the Phase I of the Afghanistan Licensing Reform Project. The overall goal of Phase II is to support the MoCI in promoting an investment
     climate that is conducive to private-sector growth. To pursue this goal, the project targets to achieve the following objectives by project completion:
     ■■     Establishing further streamlined processes for increased efficiency and sustainability in the one-stop-shop created at the MoCI during Phase I of the project.
     ■■     Successfully rolling out the business registration and licensing reforms conducted in Kabul to MoCI offices at the provincial level in light of international best
            practices. This includes securing the proper needed information and communications technology infrastructure inside these governorates and building the capac-
            ity of the staff residing at these offices.
     Results Expected:
     The expected results for the project will be:
     ■■     Implement and monitor the new, simplified business registration and licensing at the national and subnational levels to ensure smooth operations and make
            necessary adjustments based on early implementation results.
     ■■     Provide the necessary legal expertise to support the client in drafting framework changes in light of best practices.
     ■■     Support the Afghan government in the implementation of the capacity building/training plan. The training plan will comprise two levels to address operational-
            level staff and management (decision-making) level officials.
     ■■     Run the private public-dialogue as per the design stage.

Project Background:
First Microfinance Bank Afghanistan (FMFB-A) was founded in 2003, and it was the first bank to be licensed in Afghanistan under the new law. It was founded by the Aga
Khan Fund for Economic Development (AKFED) and subsequently both the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and KfW became shareholders, while the Aga Khan
Agency for Microfinance (AKAM) replaced AKFED as the principal shareholder and sponsor of the bank. FMFB-A commenced business in May 2004 in Kabul and it is
regulated by the Central Bank (Da Afghanistan Bank, DAB). FMFB-A offers micro loans, small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) loans and deposit-taking solutions to
micro entrepreneurs in Afghanistan’s urban and rural areas and stands as the largest regulated microfinance lender in the country.

IFC’s involvement with FMFB-A commenced in 2002 with an original equity investment of $1 million for a stake of 16.7 percent. During 2012, IFC participated in the
FMFB-A’s rights issue subscription (amounting to $ 6.8 million) on a prorate basis of $1.1 million. During this rights issue subscription, AKAM has brought in its sister
agency the Aga Khan Foundation-US (AKF-US) as share-holder in the bank. As a result, the shareholding of FMFB-A is now changed, with AKAM holding a 39.2 percent
stake, KfW 32.3 percent, IFC 16.7 percent and AKF-US 11.8 percent.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
■■     To create the first commercially sustainable micro-finance institution in Afghanistan to contribute to the development of micro-finance as a viable and attractive
       commercial activity and provide financial services to the poor and underserved.
■■     To contribute to the reconstruction and economic development of Afghanistan by providing financing to the most dynamic sector of the fledgling economy - micro
       and small businesses.
■■     To develop the financial sector by providing basic financial services currently not available in the market. The project is expected to contribute to overall financial-
       sector reform by giving an example of a best-practice institution and supporting the Interim Authority in developing the evolving legal and regulatory framework
Results Expected:
FMFB-A has made a development impact evident from its position as the leading microfinance banks in Afghanistan. It is also regarded highly in the banking sector
through its continued and improving financial performance characterized by enhanced profitability backed by a growing loan book and sound asset quality despite its
operating in a tough macroeconomic and security-prone environment. It is a good corporate citizen, having contributed to the national exchequer through its payment of
taxes, and persistently strives to develop the private sector by introducing new products and market segments (such as housing finance and SME) to help improve access
to finance in the country. Moreover, it has also developed and implemented an environmental and social system that allows it to screen its portfolio and provide lending
on a social and environmentally responsible basis.

As of March 31, 2015:
■■     Net Loan Portfolio - $ 60.8 million.
