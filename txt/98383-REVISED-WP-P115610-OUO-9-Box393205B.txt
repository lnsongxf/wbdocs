O     fficial identification (ID) is more than a convenience; it is a fundamental human
      right. It is indispensable for connecting residents to electoral participation,
educational opportunities, financial services, health and social welfare benefits,
and economic development. It gives people a chance to better communicate with
and be recognized by their government while giving governments the opportunity
to listen and improve the lives of their citizens. Yet in the developing world, over
2 billion people lack an official ID. The problem disproportionately affects children
and women, from poor rural areas in Africa and Asia.

The role of robust identification systems and their importance to development
outcomes places them within the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
agenda — specifically as one of the proposed SDG targets (#16.9), but also as
a key enabler of the efficacy of many other SDG targets. Although there is no
one model for providing legal identity, this SDG would urge states to ensure that
all have free or low-cost access to widely accepted, robust identity credentials.
Regardless of the modalities to achieve it, unique identification — together with its
associated rights — is becoming a priority for governments around the world. The
international community should join forces to support this goal.

Disparate initiatives and siloed investments in registration and identification systems
are likely to be wasteful and duplicative, detracting from the far-reaching public
and private sector implications of universal digital identities. A standards-based
approach to ensure interoperability of systems – both at national and regional level
- could help in driving the technology costs down and in enhancing service delivery
across boundaries.

Recognizing the transformational potential of 21st century ID systems for the
delivery of basic services to the poor, the World Bank recently launched its
Identification for Development (ID4D) agenda. The goal is “making everyone count”
by “providing an identity and delivering digital ID-enabled services to all.”

As a stepping stone towards that vision, this study, developed in collaboration with
Accenture Development Partnerships, helps in conceptualizing the design and
implementation of ID4D programs in a highly integrated, interoperable and scalable
manner that can produce huge savings for citizens, government and businesses.




                                                                                      1
Pooled approaches and federated ID systems at the regional or sub-regional level
can also help in strengthening the value proposition of ID4D programs. Trust in
data security will be critical to achieving tangible results. Harnessing the power
of ID4D systems will require strong political will and leadership, and a supportive
institutional environment.

RATIONALE FOR THIS STUDY
This study is part of the Identification for Development (ID4D) agenda of the World
Bank Group. ID4D is a cross-sectoral initiative that unites teams from different
sectors of the World Bank Group. These sectors include Global Practices responsible
for Finance and Markets, Governance, Health, Information and Communication
Technologies, Social Protection, Trade and Competitiveness, along with the Legal
and Development Economics Groups, Gender Cross-Cutting Solution Area,
International Finance Corporation (IFC), Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA) and the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP). This agenda has
strong links to the World Bank Group’s twin goals of fighting extreme poverty and
promoting shared prosperity. It is also aligned with the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) agenda, specifically target #16.9 : “provide legal identity to all,
including birth registration, by 2030” 2.

Proof of identity is critical for the poor to gain access to basic services, such as
healthcare, social benefits and financial services. Similarly, identities are important
for the bottom 40% of the population to have better access to job opportunities,
services and finance. Yet hundreds of millions of children and adults worldwide do
not have any form of recognized identification (ID). As further described in Annex 1
- Unique Identity is paramount. In many countries, the design and implementation
of civil registration and identification programs are shaped by cultural preferences,
regulatory requirements, technological maturity and privacy needs. Identification
programs, sometimes implemented as digital ID programs, are often approached
from different points of entry, which might include broad national ID initiatives or
more narrow sectoral approaches (for example, in healthcare, social welfare or
finance).

In the absence of a unifying vision or coherent strategy, parallel use of different
points of entry can result in duplication and waste of public resources. And while
each country context is unique, it is important to develop systematic approaches
to avoid such duplication and waste. In pursuing sectoral initiatives relating to
identification, countries tend to develop parallel systems, which oftentimes are
neither connected nor interoperable. Therefore, nations seeking to roll out ID
initiatives can benefit from adopting a standards-based approach and by linking

national ID programs and sectoral interventions. This can result in enhanced
interoperability of systems and use cases. Such approaches need to take into
account various technological options that are currently available. In addition,
regulatory and institutional realities also need to be accounted for and, potentially,
adjusted to the new integrative approach. Selecting the right business model can
further help ensure sustainability of programs and returns on investments made.

With an eye toward developing such a comprehensive ID4D Integration approach
for client countries, the World Bank has partnered with Accenture Development
Partnerships to develop the present study.

OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
The main objective of this study is to provide guidance for the design and
implementation of ID4D programs, with the goal of fostering convergence among
disparate sectoral and national ID initiatives. Through extensive research and
consultations with stakeholders, the study describes an ID4D integration model for
three different country categories that can benefit from a more effective approach
to ID4D programs. The study offers a specific strategy and roadmap for each
country category, drawn from a representative client-country study, and provides
recommendations in areas including policy, processes, technology and business
models. The technical specification of solutions is not in the scope of this report,
nor is the corresponding investment plan, as this would be country specific. Given
the momentum, aspects relating to regional integration and pooled approaches
are also explored, though not in detail, rather as a way to outline future research
questions.

BENCHMARKING REPORT
                 BENCHMARKING REPORT OVERVIEW

 T   he Benchmarking Report defines the key features of a highly integrated, unified
     ID system and categorizes countries into different levels of maturity based
 on the degree to which they demonstrate these features. Reference literature3
 highlights the fact that countries develop foundational ID systems, which provide
 general identification covering the entire population (and can include civil registries
 and unique national IDs) and functional ID systems, which cover population
 subsets and are introduced in response to a demand for a particular service or
 transaction transaction (such as voter registration). Developing countries often
 have both types of systems in operation. This report aims to review and analyze
 the level of integration between these different systems, on the assumption that
 operating disparate, disconnected and parallel ID systems within a country may
 lead to duplication and waste of resources.

 The reviewed evidence shows that the vast majority of countries have fragmented,
 single-purpose ID systems4:

                               BENCHMARKING FRAMEWORK
 When defining a highly integrated national ID system, it is important to look at not
 only the ID system (and the technology behind it) but also the surrounding policy,
 regulatory and institutional structures that support enforcement of the system.
 Although each country context is different, a framework for such a system has
 the features shown in Table 3, which are described in subsequent sections in this
 report

The majority of developing countries will need to address a number of areas before
they reach a highly integrated state. These countries can be grouped into the three
categories described earlier: Advanced, Intermediate and Greenfield.

The Compendium of Cases Studies contains profiles of 15 countries categorized
by the criteria in this Benchmarking section. Additionally, a reference table
summarizing the categories in detail is provided in the Benchmark Summary of
this report.

                           BENCHMARKED FEATURES
 This section details each benchmarked feature of a national ID system and
 considers differences in progress between a highly integrated state system and
 systems falling into one of the three aforementioned categories.

 MATURITY OF FOUNDATIONAL REGISTRIES
 One key feature of a robust and integrated national ID system is that it is based
 on unique ID credentials, commonly achieved using strong biometric identifiers
 such as 10 fingerprints and / or 2 irises. Facial biometrics are often added for
 human adjudication and, in some cases, disambiguation in automated recognition
 systems. In countries using unique IDs, each registry contains the ID to confidently
 link an individual’s identity across disparate registries. In most cases, a country’s
 civil or population and vital statistics registry (CR system) is the foundational
 registry. This registry contains core population information (such as births and
 deaths) and unique IDs to link identity to all other registries. Consequently, it is
 important that civil registry systems be as complete and accurate as possible,
 aiming for 100% participation from the population and digitization of the system
 (i.e., all corresponding records are available electronically in the civil registry).

 However, some countries may develop a foundational registry even if their CR
 system is not robust. They can do so by directly building a registry from an expansive
 and accurate national ID enrollment. For example, India’s Aadhaar program lacks a
 fully mature birth/death registry system and about 80% of the nation’s population
 is registered. But the country has been able to build a foundational registry from
 scratch, thanks to its massive enrollment campaign.5 Because Aadhaar enrollment
 requires capturing a participant’s biometrics and biographical data (such as birth
 date, gender and address), India has developed the basis for a foundational
 registry without having to achieve a robust CR system.

 Countries that fall in the Intermediate category generally lack a strong foundational
 registry, but are working to improve their existing registries. If their civil registries
 are digitized (some may still be paper-based but undergoing conversion),
 they will likely have moderate population coverage. Kenya, for instance, has a
 58.4% birth registration participation rate and still uses paper-based certificates.
 However, administrators manually enter all data into Kenya’s Integrated Population

Registration System (IPRS) – which will serve as the primary foundational database
for its ID system.

Greenfield countries lack a robust CR system, making it difficult to effectively track
birth and death rates or keep accurate population records. Guinea, for instance,
has low birth-registry participation (only 58%), and the registry is entirely paper-
based; thus the system is subject to inaccuracies and data loss.6 Such countries
have no immediate option for using their CR system as a foundational registry for
a national ID system.

NATIONAL ID SYSTEM
A highly integrated national ID system:

     1.	 Includes the entire population.
     2.	 Has the ability to use biometrics to de-duplicate the target population;
         that is, create a unique ID and, in some cases, a token or personal
         identification number (PIN) for identity verification, typically in the form of
         a national ID card or e-ID/digital ID.

Highly integrated national ID systems are built on foundational registries that aim
to include the country’s entire population. Although India’s Aadhaar program is not
considered highly integrated, it does seek to include not just citizens but anyone
living in the country: the end target is 1.2 billion registrants. By having a unique
ID that does not necessarily entitle the user to citizenship or benefits, Aadhaar
can include registrants regardless of status. Later in this report, we discuss how
countries with minimally developed ID systems can begin strengthening them by
targeting subsets of populations and then building from there.

Unique IDs are critical for reducing fraud and preventing duplicate entries into
the system. They thus help ensure accuracy of data and minimize leakage of
benefits (such as rations), because intended recipients can be identified and
verified using biometric identifiers. India’s Aadhaar program, for example, captures
fingerprint, face and iris data to de-duplicate residents and typically uses a
single biometric identifier for verification. To ensure accurate de-duplication and
verification, quality biometric samples are imperative. Quality is measured using
proprietary and standards-based algorithms such as the U.S.-based National
Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Fingerprint Image Quality (NFIQ)
and ISO 29794-X (where X varies based on biometric modality). Standards also

 exist for determining whether the biometric capture device can produce images of
 sufficient quality for automated comparison. These include the Federal Bureau of
 Investigation’s (FBI) Image Quality Specification (IQS) in the United States and the
 Unique Identification Authority of India’s (UIDAI) Standardized Testing and Quality
 Certification Directorate (STQC).

 Countries in the Intermediate category generally have a national ID system in place,
 but it is not integrated with a strong foundational registry. Rwanda, for example,
 has a CR system that is not yet digitized (efforts are in progress), but it uses birth
 certificates (subject to inaccuracies) as a form of requirement for receiving a
 national ID card.7

 Greenfield countries typically lack a unique ID system or foundational registry
 altogether. Alternatively, they may have functional registries that capture Unique
 IDs for a population subset (such as registered voters), which they can use as
 a springboard for building a foundational registry/database later. For instance,
 Guinea has worked to develop a digital electoral/voting register. To date, roughly
 5 million people (about 87% of the voting population) are in the Election Register,
 and the government has collected biographic and biometric (4-10 fingerprints and
 a photograph) for each registrant. Guinea chose to issue unique IDs to a subset of
 its population, and it may be able to use this database in the future to include the
 remainder of the population.

 LEVEL OF INTEGRATION BETWEEN FOUNDATIONAL & FUNCTIONAL
 REGISTRIES
 Highly developed ID systems are useful to governments and citizens because they
 are typically integrated with a multitude of functional registries – and they have
 interoperable databases and systems. Such systems may include those needed
 to manage social security benefits, food or fuel subsidies, government payroll and
 passport issuance, to name just a few. Countries that have integrated their ID
 systems with their functional registries can more easily track benefits accessed
 by each user and can minimize benefits leakage (in forms such as “ghost” payroll
 payments or duplicated subsidy payments).

                              The Unique ID system and Civil Registry are integrated through the ID4D Integration layer. This architecture preserves
                                                    the modular nature of the model versus customized direct interactions.

 In this model, the ID4D integration layer, which is standards-based, secure,
 modular and open-source, enables:

      1.	 Stakeholders to interact through the ID4D Integration Layer, which is
          used for the common interchange of information among the constituent
          registries.

      2.	 Stakeholders to provide (expose) services for others to use (consume) in
          the areas of: data management, matching (e.g., identification, verification),
          operations management and reporting.

      3.	 Uses such as dynamically processing requests, receiving transactions,
          dispatching services, and temporarily persisting data. The ID4D
          Integration Layer receives service requests through the ID4D Integration
          Layer Adapter from the stakeholder institutions’ applications.

 Estonia is an example of a country that has used a highly scalable integration layer
 to link its foundational systems (the National Population Register, or NPR, and
 national ID system) to functional applications using “X-Road” middleware.8 All such
 applications depend on data stored in the NPR, and can execute services based
 on relevant data extracted from the NPR. As a result, Estonian citizens can access
 a number of economic, social and political services using their national e-ID card,
 which acts as their primary form of identification. Estonia has thus established a
 highly integrated national ID system without the use of biometrics; it relies solely on
 a PIN, digital signature and encryption features to authenticate user identity.

 Intermediate and Greenfield countries generally lack integration between functional
 registry systems. In many such nations, each registry provides its own type of ID
 to registrants, and any biographic or biometric data captured by these registries
 are not shared or linked across registries. In Sierra Leone, for example, fingerprint
 data captured as part of the country’s new national ID program (which covers 5%
 of the population) is not currently integrated with Sierra Leone’s existing social
 security program (16.7% of the population), which can capture both biographic
 and biometric data (fingerprints, irises and photographs). Consequently, there is
 likely overlapping data9.

POLICY & LEGAL REGULATIONS
Mature ID systems are supported by a strong backbone of data privacy and
e-transaction laws as well as policies mandating participation in the country’s
civil registries. These policies are enforced by stop-gap implementations or clear
penalties. The assumption is that participants’ private information will be available
to multiple stakeholders. Thus any compromise of this data would significantly
reduce public faith in the system. Data is protected when stored (and only for
the duration disclosed) and while in transit, and is accessible only to those with
appropriate credentials. Only relevant basic biographic information is collected,
and it does not include data that could be used to profile and possibly discriminate
against a target population.

In India, government regulators revisited its Information Technology Act (2000) in
2011 to clarify its rules surrounding security practices regarding sensitive personal
data or information (SPDI) and ensure that as the Aadhaar program continued
to grow, there would be scalable laws applicable to corporate organizations and
individuals. As time progresses, it is important that countries revise existing laws
to keep up with the proliferation of SPDI so that their national ID systems remain
trustworthy as an enabler for access to services and not a detractor of personal
freedom. Many Intermediate countries have data-privacy and e-transaction laws
that are in the process of being passed or that require revisions to reflect the
growing volumes and use of SPDI in government programs. In Kenya, for instance,
an uptick in cyber-crime has prompted the government to mandate additional
measures for digital certification in online transactions and to establish a National
Cyber Security Strategy.

Greenfield countries generally lack data-protection or e-transaction laws, partly
because they have limited digital registries.

INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE
Highly integrated national ID systems generally have become so because their
countries have established an independent governing body or agency that
oversees the system, or designated a ministry (such as the Ministry of the Interior
or the Prime Minister’s office) to “own” the system or oversee multiple government
registries.

By giving an overarching agency jurisdiction over the national ID system, a country
can ensure that the system is developed independently of individual department
interests. It is also important to establish a government mandate encouraging
all departments to contribute (if necessary) and to cooperate to ensure that the
national ID program operates at intended.


                                                                                    19
  Consider Botswana, whose Omang national ID card program is run by the Ministry
  of Labor and Home Affairs (which includes the CR system and citizenship program).
  Botswana also has a strong government mandate to integrate its national ID card
  with a number of other registries. As a result, the Omang card is “organically linked”
  across registries from birth through death and can thus be easily integrated with
  diverse government services such as voter registration and passport enrollment.

  Contrast Botswana’s experience with that of Guinea, where the Ministry of
  Communication & New Information Technologies is responsible for improving
  information and communication technologies (ICT) in each government sector.
  However, the government provides no overall direction for digitizing Guinea’s
  registries, and each ministry is responsible for maintaining its own registry. As a
  result, the Ministry of Communication & New Information Technologies has no real
  authority to drive improvements in the existing registries (including the civil registry)
  that could lay a foundation for a strong national ID system.

     ACCESSIBILITY
     Another important feature that defines the success of a national ID system is its
     accessibility and usability by its registrants. To ensure this, it is important for a
     country to develop an attainable plan to:

         1.	 Register all of the country’s participants, especially the rural and margi-
             nalized populations (“last mile”)

         2.	 Define a strategy for providing its population with consistent access to
             services

     In general, countries can leverage existing public offices/registrars (e.g. schools,
     post offices, civil registry offices) in order to register their main urban populations.
     In addition, they can also deploy mobile technologies for registering hard-to-
     reach people and setting mandates to improve the country’s fiber optics (internet)
     network and mobile tower capabilities (both of which are typically lacking in
     developing countries). India’s Aadhaar program, for example, has attempted to
     address this situation by setting up physical enrollment centers in rural villages
     (versus pushing online pre-enrollment, which was typical in urban areas). It has
     also made its banking transaction capabilities mobile phone-based, since cellular
     phone ownership is more ubiquitous than Internet accessibility.

     In Intermediate and Greenfield countries, there is often much work that will need
     to be done to improve accessibility to the rural and remote communities. These
     countries often run the risk of further marginalizing parts of their population if their
     national ID systems are not accessible to their “last mile” groups (especially if there,
     for example, are security risks with accessing parts of the rural or remote areas).



20
In those situations, it would be important for the government to establish the
necessary rapport with local leaders in order to build support within those hard-to-
access communities for participating in a national ID program.

ABILITY TO PROVIDE PHYSICAL CREDENTIALS FOR INDIVIDUALS
Finally, some countries prefer to have the ability to provide physical credentials for
individuals, such as e-passports or national ID cards. This feature is considered
optional given identity can be asserted virtually simply by having the unique ID
number, though some countries have historically provided cards and prefer
to continue in this manner. Physical credentials are created upon successful
enrollment into the Unique Identity System.

SCOPING REPORT
                   SCOPING REPORT OVERVIEW
The Scoping Report assesses mechanisms needed to support ID4D integration.
A successful integration is contingent on a country’s ability to reshape existing
mechanisms or create new ones as needed. Necessary mechanisms can be
organized into the following categories:

§§ Policy, legal and regulatory considerations
§§ Institutional structures
§§ Business models
§§ ID4D Integration technology
§§ Standards for integration at a regional level
Below, we examine the key components of each category and describe strategies
for overcoming common challenges.



   POLICY, LEGAL & REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS
To support a scalable, secure and efficient national ID system, countries need
a clearly defined and enforceable legal framework. Because biographic and
biometric data is sensitive, proper safeguards will increase reliability of the data,
decrease redundancy and widen the system’s applicability.

A policy is a proposed or recommended action to achieve certain goals. In the
context of national ID systems, a policy documents aspirations regarding the
establishment of such a system. The most useful policies clearly define the vision,
extent of coverage and scope of implementation of the national ID system. To
ensure that the suggested policy is implemented as intended, countries need
a legal safeguard, which can establish penalties for deviations from proposed
procedure. Regulatory mechanisms ensure ongoing execution of legal safeguards.
To establish such mechanisms, countries may create governing bodies, empower
enforcement individuals or allow controlled use of power.

At minimum, countries must define laws that:

    1.	 Keep data private and protect SPDI.

    2.	 Regulate electronic transactions.


                                                                                    25
          3.	 Mandate citizen and government participation in critical registries (typically
              the CR) that serve as foundational registries for the nation.
          4.	 Define penalties and regulations for violation of laws.

 Data-privacy and SPDI-protection laws

 In effective national ID systems, the government can uniquely identify its registrants.
 To support this ability, the system stores enrollees’ private data in a foundational
 database that is then regarded as the single source of “truth” from which the
 country provides services. Table 5 shows three core principles essential for data
 privacy and SPDI protection. Greenfield countries will likely need to start fresh in
 terms of their data-protection laws, while Intermediate countries can benefit from
 reviewing their policies’ comprehensiveness and strengthening them as needed.

                                      Table 5: Principles of Data Privacya
     Principle              Explanation
                            A data controller (government entity or private company) uses or collects data

                            or stored for any reason beyond the specific purpose.

 Countries in the Advanced category that have established adequate and
 enforceable data-protection laws may consider expanding their policies to include
 international or cross-border transfers of personal information. South Africa, for
 example, passed new data-protection laws in 2013 that mirrored the framework
 of the European Union (EU), considered among the more stringent frameworks in
 the developed world. South Africa also created a data-protection authority and
 established international data-transfer and direct-marketing rules.10

Regulation of electronic transactions

As National ID Systems become increasingly automated, electronic transactions
will continuously need to be monitored. Regulation and control of data in an
electronic form is of complex nature, and needs increased Machine-to-Machine
(M2M) communication for enforcement agencies to automatically get notifications
of violations. Some fundamental components like identification and accountability
must be well defined and ingrained when setting up enforcement laws for National
ID systems. The regulation of e-transactions must follow certain fundamental
principles enlisted in Table 6 below. These are indicative in nature and help gauge
the types of principle that countries should consider.

                           Table 6: Principles of Electronic Transactionsa
Principle                        Explanation

contracts
a	   (European Digital Rights (EDRi) Papers)

These laws should essentially stipulate that e-transactions are held to the same legal
standards as written/physical transactions. Greenfield and Intermediate countries
should put such regulations in place in conjunction with their data-privacy laws.

Mandated participation in critical registries

Although regulations and enforcement are important for national ID systems, it is
equally critical to enact laws making participation mandatory for citizens. Without
wide participation in critical civil registries (most importantly, birth and death),
nations cannot confidently rely on “breeder documents” for foundational registries.

While many nations already have laws mandating birth and death registration,
Greenfield countries need to establish them. Countries that have low registration
participation even though they have defined such laws (they may fall into the
Greenfield or Intermediate categories) can benefit by:

     1.	 Understanding what is preventing citizens from participating in registration.

     2.	 Developing temporary or permanent methods for enforcing the law.


                                                                                                             27
 Rwanda, for example, has a relatively low death-registration rate despite laws
 mandating participation. Yet it relies heavily on its civil registry to distribute its
 national ID cards. To improve death-registry participation, Rwanda intends to
 make a death certificate a requirement for burial.11

 Regulation and enforcement

 Once policies are in place and a country has framed them with legal obligations,
 regulation and enforcement mechanisms are needed to sustain the ideals laid out
 in the policy and legal safeguards. Such mechanisms can take forms including
 compliance reports, audits and progress monitoring. In France, for example, the
 Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL) (National Data
 Protection Authority) is authorized to enforce data-privacy laws. CNIL agents
 perform online inspections and issue compliance orders to companies that have
 violated the law. In accordance with French Criminal Code, a misdemeanor is
 punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment. Table 7 summarizes principles for
 designing effective policy, legal and regulatory frameworks.

 Setting up national ID systems is a complex activity and cuts across many areas
 of governance. As the examples cited here suggest, there is no single “correct”
 approach, given that countries at different maturity levels have diverse priorities.
 Advanced nations have opportunities to reinforce their approaches by better
 protecting citizens’ privacy and their right to “be forgotten.” Intermediate countries
 can make their current systems more efficient by incorporating automation while
 keeping electronic transactions secure. Greenfield nations can learn from the
 successes of Advanced and Intermediate nations and use the resulting insights to
 build and scale their systems quickly.

 An example of an advanced approach to establishing a regulatory environment is
 the European Commission’s Electronic identification and trust services (eIDAS),
 which “aims at boosting the user convenience, trust and confidence in the digital
 world, while keeping pace with technological developments, promoting innovation
 and stimulating competition.” This initiative recently gained political level agreement,
 and related policies and regulations will be developed once formally adopted in
 September.12

                       INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES

 O   nce a country has defined mandates for establishing a national ID system, it
     must designate an appropriate governing body to oversee implementation
 and maintenance of the system. This arrangement varies across countries with an
 ID system, but ideally the system is run by one of two bodies:

      1.	 An autonomous technical agency or governing body, which has
          overarching jurisdiction over multiple ministries.

      2.	 A ministry (such as the Ministry of the Interior, Home or Justice) that has
          jurisdiction over multiple registries (most importantly, the civil registry).13

 Although both scenarios offer different advantages, they share several key success
 factors. First, the national ID system is owned by an entity that has the authority
 to carry out its mandate without being hindered by bureaucratic obstacles or
 conflicting ministry priorities. If the governing body lacks authority over the activities
 of other ministries, taking an integrated approach to developing the national ID
 system may prove challenging.

  Second, both scenarios integrate the operations of the digital ID program with
 civil registration activities. This is valuable because a country’s civil registry usually
 constitutes the backbone of a digital ID program, thus both programs need to be
 aligned. Typically, countries in the Advanced and Intermediate categories build
 their digital ID programs as part of a campaign to improve their existing Civil
 Registration and Vital Statistics systems (CRVS) (deemed “first generation” cases),
 or use their digital ID programs to build a new population database from the ground
 up ( “second generation” cases).14

 Nevertheless, countries need to take care to minimize situations in which inter-
 agency competition may erupt. In India, for example, the Aadhaar program is
 overseen by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), an independent
 agency. Aadhaar began in 2009 and was launched almost in parallel with India’s
 National Population Register (NPR), which began in 2010. The NPR sought to
 register only Indian citizens rather than including migrants and temporary residents,
 which Aadhaar includes. Over the years, controversies have arisen frequently
 between the NPR and UIDAI, owing to the fact that both request overlapping data

30
(biometric and biographic) from residents and seem to have duplicative objectives.15
Consequently, even today, political debate persists on whether to eliminate one of
the two programs.

Greenfield countries may not have an overarching mandate to develop a national
ID program. In such cases, it may be more realistic (though not as ideal) to have a
single functional registry (such as social security or an elections commission) own
the registration and data collection of target users. This, however, is not generally
recommended for the following reasons:

    1.	 Some agencies are more stringent than others regarding credential
        validation (also frequently known as “breeder document” authentication),
        and different agencies may have different motives for collecting biometric
        and biographic data. If the government requires these registries to expand
        to include the entire population, much rework will have to be done to
        collect a second round of enrollment data.

    2.	 There is, from the outset, a lack of integration with other key registries,
        which can prove difficult to overcome when the country seeks to scale its
        ID system to a national level.

                            BUSINESS MODELS
 Three critical aspects of designing an appropriate business model for developing
 nations are:

     1.	 Developing a fair fee structure to the resident that allows financial
         independence to the system
     2.	 Enabling a variable fee structure allowing free national ID to marginalized
         populations
     3.	 Leveraging the ID system capacities to prevent fraud, reduce leakage and
         enforce policy resulting in public savings to sustain the overall costs

 Countries can implement national ID and information and communication
 technology (ICT) systems through public contracts, such as public procurement
 and public-private partnerships (PPPs). National legislation may offer additional
 options that are fit for purpose. Public procurement and PPPs involve similar
 business models, but PPP projects differ from traditional procurement projects in
 a number of ways. Specifically, in PPP projects:

 §§ All phases of a project are awarded to a single contractor, while in many
    countries traditional procurement may force awards to different companies
    (across design, build and maintenance phases). The traditional approach thus
    adds complexity, which can lead to difficulties as the project moves from phase
    to phase.
 §§ The contractor bears most of the project costs. The government and the
    business model implemented will repay the sum on the basis of the agreed
    outputs. Typically, the contractor or consortium will form a special company
    called a “special purpose vehicle” (SPV) to develop, build, maintain and
    operate the ID system for the contracted period. The contractor through the
    SPV is responsible for the initial investment with a combination of equity and
    private debt, which usually result in higher financial costs due to higher rates
    and dividend distribution.
 §§ Project costs are predetermined. The contracting authority (the government)
    undertakes to pay a specific sum if outputs are delivered as agreed. These
    costs reflect the risk evaluated by the private contractor and the financial costs
    of private funding.
 §§ The procurement process is more time consuming and complex than
    traditional procurement processes. Therefore, the PPP model is best suited for



32
   projects requiring a certain level of investment (for example, more than US$10
   million).
Below, we take a closer look at the two business models.

Public procurement

Governments may choose to fund all of the capital expenditures and operational
expenses for improving the transparency of and retaining the national ID system in
the public domain, and look to the private sector to bring in needed expertise and
efficiencies. The contractor is paid a lump sum for completed stages. This approach
is recommended when public funding is available, and only if the public authority
has enough expertise and resources to manage the selected contractor(s).

Generally assimilated to a public and noncommercial asset, the ID system can
also be funded by tax payers at its inception, and then by public spending after
implementation. For example, additional funding can come from fees paid by
citizens for document issuance (passports, national ID cards).

It is of interest to consider the two different models described below:

 1.	 Implementation of Aadhaar in India

 The Unique Identification Authority of India was established in 2010 as an
 attached office of the Planning Commission of India, which aims to provide
 a 12-digit unique Aadhaar number to all citizens of India. By the end of July
 2015, the government will have spent a total of US$940 million. Integration of
 schemes’ subsidies as well as certain housing, education and health programs
 is one of the main sources of revenue for Aadhaar. According to a cost
 benefit analysis study done by the National Institute of Public Finance and
 Policy (NIPFP) in 2012, the investment on the Aadhaar project would provide a
 return of as high as 52.85% to the government.




                                                                                  33
     2.	 Implementation of NADRA in Pakistan

     Pakistan is an example of an Advanced country with a sound business model
     that meets the above critical success factors. Pakistan established the National
     Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) in 2000.

     §§ NADRA operates on a chargeback model, whereby it charges a fee
        to the government and other organizations for services provided. For
        example, banks are charged around 35 rupees each time they request
        NADRA to authenticate an individual when they open an account. With
        around 55 million such transactions that leverage NADRA’s systems and
        generate income, NADRA has become financially self-sustaining.
     §§ NADRA competes for projects both within and outside of Pakistan. Income
        from foreign projects amounted to USD $17.6m in 2013, which was
        reinvested back into the corporation’s operations and infrastructure. In this
        way, NADRA has been able to operate without a regular budget from
        the Pakistan government for a number of years. NADRA has delivered
        projects for Kenya, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and also for the
        UNHCR (Biometric Refugee Registration System).
     An underlying assumption of the pay-per-transaction business model is that
     the benefits of registering for a national ID are clear and convincing to the
     population encouraging them to register and assert their identity to access
     various services.

 Public-Private Partnerships (PPP):

 PPPs can enable governments, particularly those lacking in-house technology
 expertise, to deploy and sustain modern ID systems. This model involves
 financing from various private sources, in some combination of equity and private
 debt. The ratios depend on negotiations between lenders and shareholders.

 ðð The private contractor leverages the value of the ID system to introduce
    a fee system based on authentication requests raised by private companies
    (financial sector, tourism, travel agencies, etc.) or public sector. It would be a
    good practice to decrease the fees in this model by leveraging savings from
    fraud mitigation, subsidies and grants scheme optimization.
 Chargeback models have immediate effect after implementation, while policy
 efficiency increases over time, saving substantial public funds. Governments
 may also decide to mix these two options to decrease costs to residents, and to
 introduce a variable fee structure allowing free national ID cards for marginalized
 populations.



34
The legal form of the contract used to support the chosen business model will
depend on four factors:

§§ Available public funding
§§ In-house expertise and resources
§§ Overall estimated costs
§§ Risks and ethics issues related to transferring management of the ID system
   to a private company
In conclusion, both procurement options have unique benefits. The PPP remains
a powerful operational instrument, but to use it, countries must address ethical
issues and transparency limitations first. For example, Governments could invest
in the SPV equities to increase their level of control.




                                                                               35
                 ID4D INTEGRATION TECHNOLOGY

 T  echnology options for integration across the country categories were
    developed from the model shown in Figure 1: ID4D Integration Model in
 the Benchmarking Report. Vital events (such as birth, death, marriage, divorce
 and adoption) and the institutional stakeholders responsible for registration of
 these events (for instance, social protection institutions, courts and electoral
 commissions) are captured at the top of the diagram. These functional components
 are envisioned as integrated with back-end technical components (including
 foundational registries, vital statistics and credential issuance).

 HIGHLY INTEGRATED IDENTIFICATION REFERENCE MODEL
 The model depicted in Figure 1: ID4D Integration Model serves as a target for
 countries as they move to integrate their existing registries into a holistic framework
 supported by the foundational registries. The model logically groups external
 stakeholder organizations separately from country-specific identity technologies
 that will serve as the infrastructure for delivering services to residents.

 Key components of the model are defined below. Additional details are provided in
 Annex 2: ID4D Integration Model.

 §§ Functional registries – systems developed for specific applications (elections,
    tax, social protection, pensions)
 §§ Law enforcement integration – integration with local, national, regional and
    international policing agencies to strengthen national security
 §§ Other country integration – integration with neighboring countries to form a
    regional identity system that can address matters of policing, national security
    and servicing of migrant populations
 §§ Residents and private institutions – resident and private institution access
    to the government’s foundational registries; residents include citizens and non-
    citizens (such as refugees), who may seek (and be eligible for) benefits
 §§ ID4D integration – a top-level integration layer, with standardized services that
    orchestrate all transactions processed in the foundational identity management
    system(s)
 §§ National identity – universal, multi-purpose system capable of supporting all
    legal identity needs across applications
 §§ Civil registration – legal registry of all births and deaths that occur in the
    country as well as during foreign missions


36
§§ Vital statistics – data mart of vital events (birth, death, marriage, divorce,
   adoption) gathered from various functional registries.
§§ Credential issuance – creation of a token (national ID card, voter ID,
   ePassport) used by individuals to affirm their identity
The model can be used to develop a country-specific integration strategy and
roadmap linking existing components in a scalable, methodical way. These
topics are covered in the next section of the study, Strategy and Roadmap for
Implementation.

ID4D INTEGRATION LAYER
ID4D integration is achieved through a lightweight abstraction layer that orchestrates
all transactions (e.g., enroll identity, retrieve information, and authenticate identity)
within the Identity ecosystem. This layer serves as a gateway between institutions’
registries, the foundational registry(ies), and other stakeholders (e.g., the public).
The intent of the integration layer is that there are no direct links between any of
the databases. Rather, the integration layer serves as the common link between
all registries.

It is important to note that the civil registry serves as the foundation for the Unique
Identity System, but there is no direct connection shown on the reference model
since this interaction occurs through the integration layer. An example of the
linkage is upon birth, a request is received by the civil registry to create a record
for the subject, but no Unique ID is established until a biometric enrollment is
processed by the Unique Identity System. Once the Unique ID is created for
this record, it is provided to the civil registry through the use of pre-determined
secondary identifiers (e.g., name, DOB, record ID).

Similarly, the vital statistics registry utilizes the ID4D Integration Layer for data
operations – that is, to extract requisite data exposed by the registry(ies).

The ID4D Integration Layer, as described in more detail below, is used as a
means to standardize the interchange between each functional registry and each
foundational registry. This is achieved by Service-Enabling each registry through
an ID4D integration Adapter so that each functional and foundational registry
‘speaks’ the same language.

The ID4D Integration Layer Architecture – that is, what the ID4D Integration
Adapters do and how they do it, is detailed in the Technology Options section.

Stakeholders interact using a standardized ID4D Integration architecture
responsible for common management of all underlying information exchanges.
As such, this layer acts as an abstraction layer for all compliant stakeholder



                                                                                        37
 subsystems and is responsible for dynamically processing the requests, receiving
 the transactions, dispatching services, and managing any temporary or persistent
 data in the foundational system(s).

 The ID4D Integration Layer consists of a series of adapters, depicted in Figure 2
 below, and underlying monitoring and configuration components.

 DESIGN PRINCIPLES
 An effective ID4D integration layer is based on the following design principles,
 which are indicative (not prescriptive):

 §§ Standards based – leveraging RESTful or SOAP / XML standards
 §§ Open source – using open-source technologies where possible
 §§ Secure – encrypting data at rest and in transit; supporting certificate verification
    and non-repudiation
 §§ Modular – allowing for scalability and high availability by having redundant
    modules and avoiding a single point of failure
 §§ Decentralized – having the bulk of the ID4D integration logic reside in ID4D
    integration adapters

The central elements of the ID4D Integration Layer are limited to:

    1.	 Monitoring – Transactional information (no data) available for reporting
        and dashboarding

    2.	 Service Registry – Component in charge of providing the list of services
        available for each registry that is integrated

    3.	 External Integration – Certification                    Authority      integration   for
        authentication, where applicable

The bulk of the logic in the ID4D Integration Layer resides in the ID4D Integration
Adapters, which is described in the following section and depicted in Figure 3
below.

                                       Regystry Adapter


The core components of the ID4D Integration Layer Adapter are:

§§ Message queue client – a third-party client library that implements commercial
   off-the-shelf (COTS) message-oriented middleware.
§§ Message consumer – listener of inbound messages of the message queue
   broker.
§§ Broker connection – aids in connecting to the message queue broker and
   maintains connection details in a configuration file.
§§ Gateway manager – coordinates components of the ID4D integration layer
   adapter and pushes response back to the outbound message queue.


                                                                                               39
 §§ Data parser/transformer – is responsible for input payload parsing and for
    constructing the response message; uses certain utilities for decoding and
    transforming.
 §§ Logger – handles all logging required during processing (time stamping,
    transaction, message, reference ID, function call, parameters, results). Log
    levels are maintained and enabled via a separate configuration file.
 §§ Registry adapter – handles registry-specific data access.

 For information on specific technology options and a general process for technology
 selection, see the Technology Options section.

 At a high level, ID4D integration adapter logic flows through the following steps:

     1.	 De-queue inbound messages from the message queue.

     2.	 Log the messages and reception/processing times in the data store
         for service-level agreement (SLA) measurements and further analytics.
         Logging happens at each processing step, to ensure that steps and
         results are captured.

     3.	 Decode the messages to understand the function to be performed and to
         verify integrity of the message.

     4.	 If required by the function, gather biographic and/or biometric data
         required to perform the function from the back end.

     5.	 Call the registry for the result.

     6.	 When the registry returns the result, package the result, conforming to the
         Interface Control Document (ICD) into a response message. Place this
         message in the message queue.

     7.	 Log transaction times and results for further auditing.

 TECHNOLOGY OPTIONS
 The ID4D Integration Layer Adapter will be a hybrid of custom-developed and
 commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products – as shown in Table 8. The technology
 stack for the ID4D Integration Layer will be defined based on stakeholder-specific
 requirements. As a result, key considerations for evaluating and selecting COTS
 products include the following.

 §§ Current stakeholder technologies in place and level of interest in maintaining,
    enhancing/updating or replacing these technologies


40
§§ Requirements
    §§    Performance, scalability and availability – Modular, redundant queue
          infrastructure will allow for scaling to meet throughput demands and will
          avoid a single point of failure.
    §§    Network infrastructure restrictions – End-to-end communications
          infrastructure, along with specific firewall rules (such as port utilization), will
          be identified and included in the ICD for information exchange.
    §§    Security by design –Security requirements will be agreed to and
          documented in the ICD, and role-based access will be enforced by the
          service provider (such as a registry).

            ADDITIONAL INTEGRATION APPROACHES
 The ID4D Integration model supports other integration approaches given the
 modular nature of the architecture. The Centralized model described above can
 be adapted to accommodate Regional, Federated, or Hybrid models as well.

 Regional

 Once a country has accomplished its ID4D integration objectives and has an
 appropriate foundational ID system in place, it may consider integration at a
 regional level, linking its system with those of neighboring countries. The data
 exchanged will depend on policy and could be limited to biometric information, to
 exclude of biographic data, in order realize cost savings resulting from common
 Identity Services (e.g., de-duplication, verification). Owing to the sensitive nature
 of data sharing beyond country borders, data is encrypted such that only parties
 with the corresponding keys may access the information. Alternatively, personally
 identifiable information is not exchanged; extra-jurisdictional systems (acting as
 identity service providers) only provide a means to verify a citizen’s claim of identity
 to a third party (the service provider). The sections below describe two examples
 of this approach to regional identity integration.

 Federated

 In this model, each partner country has its own functional registries but offers
 partners the ability to federate biometrics-based and / or biographics-based
 searches against each other’s identity systems. This will enable agencies to more
 accurately identify migration, fraud, and illegal activities of persons in their domain.

 Hybrid

 This approach combines elements of the previously described integration
 approaches.

Project STORK (Secure idenTities acrOss boRders linKed)16
Project STORK was established as a European e-ID interoperability platform that lets citizens
access electronic information across borders by using their national e-ID for authentication.
Initiated in 2007, the project involves 14 EU member states. Cross-border user authentica-
tion was tested through five pilot projects that used existing government services in mem-
ber states. The expectation is that additional service providers will connect to the platform,
increasing the number of cross-border services available to European users (such as those
seeking to obtain university papers without needing to do so in person). Users enter their
personal data using their national e-ID, and the STORK platform obtains the required authen-
tication from the issuing government.
The STORK platform identifies users who are in a session with a service provider, and sends
this data to the service. While the service provider may request various forms of data, us-
ers control the data that is sent. Users’ explicit consent is required before data can be sent
to the service provider. This user-centric approach meets the legislative requirements of the
countries involved, which mandated concrete measures to guarantee protection of citizens’
fundamental rights. Building on the success and results of STORK, the STORK 2.0 project has
introduced four new pilots.

     X-Road EU17
     Estonia’s integration platform, X-Road, is described in Estonia (and shown in Figure 18) is the
     heart of the nation’s eGovernment offerings. X-Road EU (depicted in Figure 5) uses the same
     architecture to also serve cross-border functions not served by existing regional initiatives. It
     does so by using web services to allow different public-sector information systems to exchange
     data safely and according to predefined standards. The proven X-Road core technology used
     by Estonia since 2002 was the basis of X-Road EU. In the X-Road EU model, encrypted data is
     directly transferred through secure servers, ensuring that data is exchanged only with relevant
     parties. The center stores only audit log information about the data transfer, not the data itself.
     The central server also handles certification management, including checking integrity of the
     secure servers’ logs. X-Road EU enables owners of any two (or more) information systems to
     communicate with one another in a repeatable, scalable way and fosters speedy integration.
     X-Road EU therefore serves as a model for regional integration, especially where there is no
     agreed-upon approach for organizational data exchange.

STRATEGY AND ROADMAP
 FOR IMPLEMENTATION
                           STRATEGY OVERVIEW
 The high-level strategy for ID4D integration is a phased approach starting with
 existing registries and corresponding data sets and providing a means to service-
 enable them in order to achieve integration through shared services.

 The roadmap offers ID4D Integration guidance for each country category in order
 to provide stakeholders with secure and efficient access to information.



                          HIGH-LEVEL STRATEGY
 The ID4D integration strategy places unique identity at the center of disparate
 government ministries and agencies, enabling government functions to share
 information more efficiently, securely, and cost effectively. Thus, it also creates a
 more resident-centric approach to facilitating access to government services while
 also reducing both exploitation and systems redundancy.

 The ID4D Integration strategy consists of three modular phases, as shown in
 Figure 6.

 Phase 1 begins with conducting a country-specific assessment to understand
 the existing state of integration between the functional and foundational registries.
 Once current state is understood, plans are made to establish a time-phased
 integration timeline for the country’s registries – ideally starting with those that are
 most achievable, impactful, and of highest priority to residents. Once initial plans
 for integration are defined, ensure the Governing Body is in place. This Governing
 Body will ultimately sign-off on technology decisions and confirm the pre-requisites
 are in place (funding via an appropriate business model for the country and political
 support). The architecture of the integration approach is tailored to country-specific
 needs, paving the way for the technology selection process. In regions where
 communications infrastructure is limited, the technical solution should consider an
 offline operational capability in which transactions are stored and then forwarded
 when connectivity is available.

 Phase 2 includes execution of an initial expansion to validate the decisions made
 in Phase 1. Specifically, the effectiveness of the Governing Body, the technology
 choices (data model, security and so forth), and the integration timeline are
 validated based on this lower scale (Pilot) implementation exercise. The output of
 Phase 2 is an updated timeline for integration based on learnings from this phase.

   KPIs will measure improvement over time (such as # registries integrated, % population coverage, %
   marginalized covered, transaction volumes (de-duplicate, verify))




Phase 3 (onwards) includes the production scale integration of the registries
accordingly to the refined plan from Phase 2. Given some countries may have
a number of registries left to integrate, Phase 3 would be repeated until target
integration levels are achieved.

In every phase, effective change management and communication/outreach are
critical for successful uptake of services by residents.

The following best practices can help ensure successful passage through the
phases. Note that having a strong foundation for integration is critical in ensuring
success for the country’s identification ecosystem.


                                                                                                         47
 §§ Regulation – Integration of information sources, especially when the
    information spans jurisdictions, may require data sharing and/or data access
    legislation and corresponding ID4D Integration Model information technology
    to enforce such regulations
 §§ Data Protection – In conjunction with data sharing policies, data protection
    that governs how data is to be protected as a result of the integration process
    will need to be accommodated through ID4D Integration Model information
    technology
 §§ Exchange Definition – Whether through national or international standards
    (e.g., National Information Exchange Model or NIEM) or through bi-lateral
    agreements (i.e., Interface Control Documents or ICDs), what information is
    exchanged and how it is exchanged must be defined
 §§ Service Discovery – the ID4D Integration Model is built using Service Oriented
    Architecture patterns in which integration is achieved through exposing and
    consuming services
 The Exchange Definition is at the heart of the ID4D Integration strategy. It provides
 a means of integrating various repositories so that government and private sector
 stakeholders can efficiently access data that they are authorized to receive.

 The overall strategy for building out ID4D Integration technology is transposable
 to every context; however, the roadmap to achieve the desired result differs based
 on the characteristics of the target environment, which have been categorized
 into three areas. The ID4D Integration Roadmap for each is provided in the next
 section.

GREENFIELD INTEGRATION
As described in the Benchmarking Report, a Greenfield country has rudimentary
or no registry integration (either directly, through custom interchanges, or through
an SOA). Services are not contemplated, and it is likely that no public-facing
presentation capability exists. Speedy integration of a national ID infrastructure
(such as the country’s foundational registry) into the identity system is critical.

As shown in Figure 7, a Greenfield country will aim to improve its civil registry
as a first priority, then strengthen integration across all registries by introducing a
Unique Identity System (such as a national ID).

      High Integration            Medium Integration        Low Integration




Registries or functionalities that are to be integrated using the ID4D Integration
model will need to be service-enabled. This is typically done through an adapter
which brokers queries between a registry (database) and the requestor – directly or
through a security layer. The adapter queries the database using a language native
to the database (e.g. SQL) to retrieve the information requested and then creates
an ID4D Integration compliant message in SOAP/XML or RESTful JSON format.

The integration process necessitates that both the provider(s) and the consumer(s)
of information agree on the content and mechanism by which information is
exchanged. This is established and maintained through a Service-Enablement
Governance Process. Key steps are outlined below, in which stakeholders
and ICT organizations come to an agreement on what, and how, information is
integrated/shared. As stated above, this is typically formalized in an Interface
Control Document (ICD) through national standards such as the National
Information Exchange Model (NIEM), and international standards (ISO 19794-X for

INTERMEDIATE INTEGRATION
As shown in the roadmap in Figure 8 below, an Intermediate country may have
some registry integration through direct, custom interchanges, but likely not
services enabled through an SOA.

Such countries will aim to improve integration of such registries using the ID4D
integration layer, based on a common service catalog.

      High Integration          Medium Integration        Low Integration




These countries have likely established ICDs and achieved service-enablement.
However, depending on their circumstances, they may not have portal integration
of services, whereby access to information by government agencies, businesses
and/or the public is done through self-service portals in which registries follow
ID4D integration patterns.

Countries can choose from multiple portal technologies available for the
presentation layer – not just from big players such as IBM and Oracle, but also
from open-source suppliers like Apache and Red Hat / JBoss. As the portal is the
“front door” to the integrated national ICT, role-based user provisioning is essential.
Typical roles include General Population, Commercial, Public Servant and Public
Servant Supervisor.

ADVANCED INTEGRATION
An Advanced country will have registry integration through an SOA and will seek to
expand its service catalog, extend its messaging layer and expand its stakeholder
base, as shown in Figure 9.

Estonia is categorized as Advanced and has provided integration services used
throughout the nation. That being said, the Estonia integration model requires

    received the first time, even if there is acknowledgement that the message was
    received.
 §§ High-availability – Integration is achieved through modularity to avoid single
    points of failure. Redundancy and fail-over mechanisms should be considered.
 §§ Publish / subscribe – The integration layer typically supports point-to-point
    registry integration as defined in an ICD. Advanced countries may wish to offer
    a means for stakeholders to subscribe to a registry (or entity therein) such that
    when the registry owner Creates, Updates or Deletes the entity, that action is
    published and all subscribers are informed in near real-time. This mechanism
    can be part of the integration layer – the advantage is that the impact of code
    modifications to registry owners is minimized; the disadvantage is that the
    integration layer becomes more complex.
 §§ Role-based access control – The registry owner defines who may access
    what information in the registry. This is typically enforced through an identity
    and access management mechanism at the registry. However, it could be
    established at the integration layer through the service-enablement governance
    process.

                    MONITORING AND EVALUATION
Countries can measure their ID4D integration progress for effectiveness, by
assessing factors related to coverage, integration level, cost and integration
performance, among others. Figure 10 shows a scorecard that nations can use to
track these aspects of program effectiveness.

The intent and description of the 4 main scorecard categories are as follows:

    1.	 Coverage & Growth – Measures the ID4D system’s coverage of the
        country’s population. Important for assessing inclusion of hard-to-access
        populations as well.


                                                                                          53
     2.	 Level of Integration – Measures the number of registries, services and
         portals that have been integrated (such as passport services, social
         security and food or fuel subsidies).

     3.	 Cost Benefits – Measures ongoing savings. Over time, economies
         of scale can help lower in average E2E cost per user. Additionally,
         governments may operate with fewer costs, thanks to more efficient
         distribution of benefits and services (including the ability to cut off excess
         payments such as ghost payrolls).

     4.	 Integration Performance – Provides key performance indicators (KPIs)
         for the system’s technical performance. KPIs suggested in the scorecard
         are summary indicators, but countries can choose to measure a large
         variety of performance and service-related SLAs, as defined below.

 Performance Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

 By using industry standard Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) methods, countries
 can monitor the performance effectiveness of their systems. Countries can utilize
 open-source software to analyze their ID4D Integration layer messages for:

     •	   Transaction volumes
     •	   Transaction types
     •	   Response times
     •	   End-to-end process timing
     •	   Error log / error type and severity

 Performance-based Service Level Agreements, such as those listed above are
 monitored through the ID4D integration layer, where message queues manage
 discrete transactions. Performance metrics should include baseline characteristics
 such as CPU usage, memory usage, response time, transaction volume, etc.

 ID4D Integration performance can be further analyzed by time of day, day of week,
 etc., by registry, and by requestor. With this type of information, it becomes much
 easier to identify bottle necks and to adjust accordingly and to measure success.

 Service SLAs

 The following metrics are typical service availability level agreements that could
 apply to ID4D Integration services and corresponding systems. Each commitment
 is listed along with a brief description:

     1.	 Service hours: days of the week and hours per day that each defined


54
    service is scheduled to be available to end users, subject to adjustment
    for mutually agreed upon excusable downtime, or hours during which the
    team has committed to provide the services

2.	 Service availability: minimum agreed availability level for the service
    component. This is the average amount of time each month the defined
    service is available to end users (expressed as a percentage).

3.	 Scheduled downtime: hours during which the service is routinely
    scheduled to be unavailable to end users. For identity applications,
    this typically represents nightly downtime to perform batch processing,
    system back-ups and other tasks. During these times, the system may be
    accessible to end users. However, the operations team has the option of
    making the service unavailable and does not measure or report

4.	 Measurement period: time during which service level is measured

5.	 Target definition: criteria determining whether a service is available




                                                                             55
                                 CONCLUSION

 T   he report stresses that digital identification is a vital component to any country
     identification ecosystem. Providing unique identification services to stakeholder
 entities in a standards-based, secure manner will increase information exchange
 and decrease costs through process automation and self-service capabilities.
 The study recommends that digital identities, and the corresponding Unique
 Identification System, should be kept separate from specific registries, applications
 and use cases; the ID4D Integration Model will provide the means to associate
 Unique IDs with the corresponding registry(ies) without ‘hard-coding’ the identity
 information with any specific registry or application.

 Countries, regardless of their maturity with respect to digital identity, will benefit
 from standardized integration service offerings in multiple ways, including:

     1.	 Lower Total Cost of Ownership: ID4D Integrated services allow
         stakeholders to access information directly, without, manual processing
         of requests

     2.	 Fraud Reduction: Services offered through the ID4D Integration layer
         are authenticated and audited reducing both internal fraud (e.g., leakage)
         and external fraud (e.g., identity spoofing)

     3.	 Security: The ID4D Integration framework support secure data
         interchange and, when PKI is incorporated, allows for additional measures
         such as non-repudiation and certificate revocation

     4.	 Facilitation: Stakeholders, including the public, can easily and securely
         access ID4D Integrated services

     5.	 Interoperability: Domestic stakeholders along with regional and
         international partners can more efficiently exchange information through
         ID4D Integration; this includes both civil and criminal information 

 Finally, it is envisioned that through the use of distributed, secure, identification
 services, global initiatives such as ID4D can help achieve the Sustainable
 Development Goal of “providing legal identity for all, including birth registration, by
 2030.”

                                   CONCEPTS
 The ability to uniquely identify people is an essential part of establishing a trusted
 (secure) foundation for both public and private interchanges. Unique identification
 begins with interactions where identity claims are made, often biographic in nature,
 and is enhanced through the use of biometric identifiers, typically when applying
 for an identity credential. Each identity event helps to build a stronger view of
 the identity over time, where the ‘true’ identity emerges as depicted in Figure 11
 below.


                          Figure 11: Emergent Identity Concept




 Multi-factor authentication is a means to establish one’s identity; in the security
 context, the term three-factor authentication is synonymous with strong
 authentication where the three factors are something you have (e.g., ID card),
 something you know (e.g., PIN), and something you are (e.g., biometric identifier).
 Two other dimensions add to the strength of the authentication: what you do (e.g.,
 how you move your mouse) and where you do it (e.g., geo location) as described
 in Figure 12 which follows.

Biometric identifiers are the root of a unique identity, which is a key enabler in the
digital identification process; as such, the quality of the biometric samples enrolled
is fundamental to the effective operations of a Unique Identity System. The quality
of biometric samples used to authenticate an identity claim are important as well
although slightly less critical because only a one-to-one comparison is required
versus a one-to-many (where many may be in the 10s of millions).

                                INTRODUCTION
 The ID4D Integration Model is shown in Figure 13. Vital events (e.g., birth, death,
 marriage, divorce, adoption) and the institutional stakeholders responsible for
 registration of these events (e.g., social protection institutions, courts, electoral
 commissions) are captured at the top of the diagram. These functional components
 are envisioned to be integrated with the backend technical components (i.e.
 foundational registries, vital statistics, and credential issuance).



              HIGHLY INTEGRATED IDENTIFICATION
                      REFERENCE MODEL
 The Highly Integrated Identification Reference Model serves as a target for
 countries as they move to the next phase of integration of their existing registries
 into a holistic framework that is supported by the foundational registries. It logically
 groups external stakeholder organizations separately from country-specific identity
 technologies that will serve as the backbone infrastructure to deliver the functional
 services to the end users (e.g. residents).

 Key components of the Highly Integrated Identification Reference Model are
 defined in Table 10, along with further context within each component.

 The Highly Integrated Identification Reference Model can be used to develop a
 country specific integration roadmap showing how to link existing components in
 a scalable, methodical way. Further discussion on the ID4D integration layer, both
 architecture and key features, is provided herein. The strategy and roadmap for
 integration are covered in the next section of this report, Strategy and Roadmap
 for Implementation.

                                       INTRODUCTION
 This Compendium contains 15 case studies, conducted as part of the ID4D
 Integration Approach study, with the objective to uncover, understand and
 benchmark the different trends observed in different countries around the world.
 As an addendum to the main report, this Compendium is comprised of 12
 benchmarked countries’ profiles and 3 in-depth analyses.

 All the countries were placed into each of the country categories – “Advanced”,
 “Intermediate”, or “Greenfield” – because they provide good examples for the level
 of national identification maturity within each category. The below table provides a
 high level overview of the attributes of each category:

     Category       Description of Category
                     An “advanced” country is defined as a nation that has the majority of the features
     Category 1:     that encompass a highly integrated state, but may be lacking maturity in a few of
     Advanced        them. They will have strong foundational registries and an integrated framework,
                     and generally have specific improvement plans to address their weaker points.

                     An “intermediate” country is defined as one that has taken measurable steps to
                     develop a digital ID system, but still has some significant improvements to make
                     in order to ensure that the system is scalable and can be integrated with existing
     Category 2:     disparate registries. It will either have a foundational database (registry) in place,
     Intermediate    or have efforts in progress to strengthen and/or digitize one. It typically will require
                     improvements in its networking infrastructure and community outreach strategy
                     in order to ensure that access to a national ID is possible for the majority of its
                     population.

                     A “greenfield” country is defined as country which has rudimentary or no registry
     Category 3:     integration either directly, through custom interchanges, or through an SOA. These
     Greenfield      countries have the most room for improvement and typically have a “blank slate”
                     to start a digital ID program.

 The Benchmarked Countries were analyzed in less depth than the Studied
 Countries. The focus of the analysis was on their current state registration
 landscape and key challenges. Like the Studied Countries, only the country’s main
 registry systems and their corresponding registration processes were analyzed.

 The twelve Benchmarked Countries covered in the assessment are organized by
 category and ordered as follows:

The three “Studied Countries” of interest in this particular assessment are the
following:

          13.	 Guinea - Greenfield           15.	 Botswana - Advanced
          14.	 Rwanda - Intermediate

The following standard parameters were addressed for each country:

    1.	 Maturity Assessment: Greenfield / Intermediate / Advanced
    2.	 Registry Assessment
    3.	 Legal Framework
    4.	 Institutional Structures
    5.	 Identification Processes
    6.	 Current Challenges

In-depth research was conducted to fully understand each studied country’s current
state identification landscape – including main registry systems, legal protections,
governing bodies, and registration processes. Only the country’s main registry
systems and their corresponding registration processes were analyzed because
these are the most critical for the citizen’s identity architecture. Furthermore, this
exercise with the studied countries has served to validate the Highly Integrated
Identification Reference Model for each country category by covering the key
concepts with the country delegations. In addition, in the three studied countries –
Guinea, Rwanda and Botswana – the existing challenges with the current system
were defined and an action plan suggested in order for the country to reach its next
level of integration. However, the recommendations and subsequent action plans
are specific to each country and encapsulate technology, process, and institutions
in one integrated plan.

MATURITY ASSESSMENT
Categorization: Greenfield

REGISTRY ASSESSMENT
Guinea has three basic registries currently in place: Birth Registry, Election Registry,
and e-Passports. The registries are not integrated with each other or highly used by
Guinea’s population. Of the three, the Election Registry has the highest usage and
includes biometric and biographic data, making it the most “complete” registration
system in Guinea.

Guinea developed a strategy for building a foundational national identification
system in 2011 by leveraging its Election Register. This Election Register underwent
one major overhaul after Guinea switched solution vendors and contracted
Waymark to update its original register to include more comprehensive biometrics
(10 fingerprints instead of the original 4 from the first iteration of the register).
Although Guinea intended for the electoral data to become integrated with the
national ID register, its plans were put on hold after the Election Register became
mired in political controversy (it was disputed that the pockets of people enrolled
were biased toward one political party). As of 2015, Guinea has again switched
contractors (using an open bidding process to select Gemalto) and intends to
have this company update the Election Register once again in time for the 2015
elections.

 LEGAL FRAMEWORK
 Guinea lacks any data protection laws and has no independent data protection
 authority. Each state ministry is responsible for regulating its own data privacy.
 Its government authorities have access to personal data, but there are no laws
 governing this access. While it does have a civil code requiring birth and death
 registration, participation remains low.18

 Article 159 of Civil Code:   2008           This law mandates that a child’s birth be reported
 Birth Registration                          either by parents, a doctor, or a midwife. Once
                                             reported, a birth certificate is to be provided im-
                                             mediately.

 Failure to Register Birth                   months’ imprisonment and a fine of 300 Guinean
                                             francs, or 1 of the 2.


INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES
The Election Register is owned by the Independent National Electoral Commission
(CENI), which is a separate organization set up in 2012 to manage the national
elections.

The Ministry of Communication & New Information Technologies is responsible
for implementing/improving ICT solutions across all of the government sectors. It,
however, does not have ownership of any particular registry. As such, it does not
have the appropriate influence or authority to mandate digitization of any ministry’s
registries – including the civil registry.

Guinea’s civil registry system is centrally owned by the Direction National de l’Etat
Civil (DNEC), an arm of the Ministry of Territorial Administration & Decentralization,
but is in reality managed by local governments. This results in little to no uniformity in
the way that each district’s civil registrars are maintained. The DNEC is responsible
for the technical and administrative aspects of the CR system, but is severely
underfunded and understaffed.19

IDENTIFICATION PROCESSES
Birth Registration

Birth registration is done in person at any of Guinea’s 348 local offices. Upon
registration, a paper birth certificate is issued. The birth record is kept at the local
precinct (on paper) and not synchronized with information from any of the other
offices.

 Election Register

 Persons of voting age register themselves at any of the mobile enrollment stations
 set up prior to an election. At registration, a voter’s fingerprints and face are
 captured. AFIS is then used after all of the captures are completed to de-duplicate
 the data.

 CURRENT CHALLENGES
 Guinea lacks an option for using an existing foundational registry for its national
 due to its paper-based and ineffective civil registry. Its existing institutional structure
 does not allow for effective data sharing between registries or a unified approach
 to future data integration (should the national ID system go into effect). Its starting
 base for a national registry, the Election Register, has been marred by political
 controversy and is a continuous point of contention; as a result, each election
 since 2008 has seen a re-do of the Register using a new contractor.

 INTEGRATION MODEL AND ROADMAP
 Guinea has an opportunity to utilize data already captured as part of its Election
 Register to springboard it into a viable national register. In order to facilitate a
 successful migration to a national ID system, Guinea should complete the following
 activities which are highlighted in Figure 14:

     1.	 Establish a governing body to oversee the roll-out of the national ID system
          (currently, the CENI -Elections Commission is responsible for the Election
          Register, which is the “nest egg” from which the national system will be
          built). This governing body should be independent of functional ministries
          and be given the authority to work across ministries to accomplish its
          tasks.

     2.	 Kick off the process for establishing the adequate data protection and
         e-transaction laws such that, at latest, legislation in place by the time a
         national register is established.

     3.	 Assuming that conversion of existing paper-based birth registry data to
         an actual database is not feasible, consider building the foundational
         database of a national registry utilizing data from the Electoral Register.

     4.	 It is not known at the moment what percentage of biometric captures in
         the Election Register are of high quality versus those that would need to
         be re-taken. For the latest iteration of the Electoral Register, consider re-
         capturing the data of each registrant again to ensure that it is of sufficient
         NIST Fingerprint Image Quality (NFIQ) and ICAO compliant quality for face
         photos. This will minimize error matching rates in the future.


76
5.	 Additionally, it is recommended that there be a multimodal approach to
    capturing biometrics from users (e.g. fingerprints, face, iris). This will be
    helpful in the event that a registrant is unable to provide viable biometrics
    of a particular type (for instance, a face and iris scan will be the sole
    identifiers if registrants have prints that cannot be captured).

6.	 From a government standpoint, establish a plan for addressing the
    registration of non-citizens. One recommendation would be to register
    the entire population (whether a citizen or not) and have undeclared
    people/ noncitizens receive a separate type of designation in the registry.
    This would allow everyone to be included in the registry, but would mean
    that inclusion in the registry does NOT automatically entitle a person to
    citizens’ benefits.

7.	 Ensure that the existing e-passports data is interoperable with the
    technology implemented for the latest Electoral Register (Sagem ID
    database). If not, consider migrating the data to an alternate database
    technology to accomplish this task (especially since e-passport
    participation is still low, and any technology switches would be less
    costly done as upfront as possible). For any future registry improvements,
    ensure that the chosen technology is interoperable with the databases in
    existence.

8.	 Develop a plan for enrolling and updating children, whose biometric data
    is subject to change as they get older. Consider capturing an iris and face
    scan, and modify the data capture such that the parents’ ID information
    is linked to the child’s. For children, consider a more frequent biometric
    capture given their biometric features change rapidly in those years. For
    example, several countries employ a passport renewal policy for adults
    that requires renewal every 10 years and for children it is every 5 years.

9.	 Use the enrollment kits originally used for election registration for the
    national ID registration (similar to the Aadhaar initiative in India). Guinea
    already has over 5000 kits, and can develop a plan to reach its entire
    population by:

     a.	 Deploying the enrollment kits to easy-access municipal locations
         (e.g. post offices, schools)

     b.	 Setting up mobile stations in hard-to-access rural areas

10.	 In order to incentivize the population to register, link the registration to a
     benefit.

MATURITY ASSESSMENT

REGISTRY ASSESSMENT
Rwanda has a national ID program for adults 16+, and is using the data collected
for it to eventually modernize its National Population Registry. Its current civil
registry system is still paper-based, and issues physical birth and death certificates
to its citizens.

There is a degree of interlinkage between the functional and foundational systems,
as the National ID (which captures biometric data) is used to authenticate identity
across several services (e.g. social security and tax registration) and enable a
national mandatory mobile SIM card registration program. National IDs also
enable Rwandans to travel anywhere in Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya, per the EAC
Common Market Protocol. Rwanda has plans to issue an e-Passport in the future,
which will also capture some biometric data in addition to the biographic data.

Efforts are underway to further modernize civil registration and provide a digitized
identification system for children under 16 years of age. These activities are a
key priority as part of the second National Strategy for Development of Statistics
(NSDS2).

LEGAL FRAMEWORK
Rwanda has passed laws in regards to access to information and defining the
legality of electronic transactions. However, it also grants exceptions when it
comes to surveilling its population over matters related to national security. In
2013, Rwanda updated its 40/2008 Interception of Communications law to allow
relevant security organizations to apply for interception permits. In general though,
Rwanda has passed a number of laws that provide basic data protection and
privacy to its users.20

 Legal/Policy Instrument      Year   Description
 Law No. 03/2013: Access to   2013   Prohibits the publication of information by both public and
 Information                         private bodies if it interferes with the privacy of an individual
                                     and is not of public interest
 Law No. 18/2010: Relating    2010   Establishes the legality of electronic transactions, and
 to Electronic Messages,             electronic messages and protects against unauthorized access
 Electronic Signatures and           of information / access with intent to commit crimes.
 Electronic Transactions
 No. 48/2008: Interception    2008   Prohibits the surveillance of any data or voice communications
 of Communications                   for which the user has no knowledge of or has not given
                                     permission to do so
 Birth Registration Law       2008   Stipulates that all children born in the country be registered
                                     within 15-30 days after birth and issued with a birth
                                     registration certificate. Violators are subject to fines.

 This model allows for all of the various government interests to play a role in the
 direction and scope of the national ID, and gives NIDA the appropriate influence in
 all government functions.

 IDENTIFICATION PROCESSES
 National ID

 Citizens interested in a national ID card must register in person at a local
 designated office (those abroad can register at the NIDA headquarters). At the
 time of registration, biometric and biographic data is captured. 21Those who are
 over the age of 16 receive an ID card within one month of application. At this time,
 children under 16 are not issued an ID card, though they may apply for one and
 receive an 8-digit application number. This application number is used once the
 child turns of age to generate a national ID number (which is 16 digits).

 Birth Certificate

 To obtain birth certificate, a child’s parents must go to a physical civil registry office,
 present proof of ID, and submit a claim for a certificate. The birth certificate must
 be signed by the Executive Secretary of the sector prior to issuance. To date, these
 birth records are not entered into a database, but kept as a physical record only.

CURRENT CHALLENGES
Rwanda has integrated its national ID system with several other functional registries
at this point, but still does not have a strong foundational database (civil registry)
from which to baseline its enrollment. Without strong birth or death data, it:

    1.	 Is hard to verify birth dates even during national ID enrollment, and

    2.	 Will become a problem in the future when users of the national ID card
        pass away and their data across systems has to be updated accordingly.

A second major challenge is the fact that Rwanda’s national ID system currently
only covers citizens 16 and older. There is not a clear plan as of yet to enroll
children, and a plan needs to be put in place to register them, even if the majority
of their benefits do not apply until adulthood. There is the additional factor of
deciding which biometric data to collect for these children, since fingerprints and
irises develop through adulthood and, if collected up front, would need to be re-
collected at a later time.

Rwanda’s next main focus should be to (1) improve and digitize its civil registry
system, and (2) develop a plan to enroll children under 16.

INTEGRATION MODEL AND ROADMAP
For its next national ID iteration, Rwanda should focus on its current challenges
as well as work to expand the national ID to encompass additional government
functions. The list that follows, as highlighted in Figure 15, describes the suggested
actions for Rwanda:

    1.	 Expand the storage capacity and robustness of the national ID registry to
        include civil registry data. In this way, Rwanda can digitize its civil registry
        utilizing biographic and biometric data already captured as part of its
        national ID campaign.

    2.	 Digitize its birth and death registries, and consider issuing a national ID
        number at the time of birth certificate issuance.

    3.	 Make death registration a required component for burial (to essentially
        mandate registration participation), and integrate this registration with the
        national ID registry. It is important that Rwanda has a reliable method of
        archiving data for deceased participants such that services related to the
        archived citizen can be stopped or modified.

    4.	 While the national ID card is used as a form of authentication for other
        services (e.g. voting, social security), there is no registry linkage between



                                                                                       83
         the NID database and other functional databases. These systems should
         be integrated to allow better integration so that ID verification can take
         place at the time of service issuance.

     5.	 Consider increasing the accuracy of the national ID system by expanding
         the capture of fingerprints for the national ID card from 2 fingerprints to
         10. Ensure that these fingerprints are of sufficient NIST Fingerprint Image
         Quality (NFIQ).

     6.	 There is currently a stop-gap method for providing children under 16 with
         IDs (using Application # as a temporary ID until the child reaches 16).
         There is no biometric data captured for these children. Rwanda should
         consider developing a program to enroll all children (e.g. via schools),
         capture at minimum a face image, and to map these national ID accounts
         to those of their parents. The national ID database will likely need to be
         modified to allow capture of these additional fields.

 REGISTRY ASSESSMENT
 Botswana has a national ID system (the Omang) that is completely integrated
 with its digitized birth and death registry system (BDRS). The BDRS and national
 registration share one registrar. A unique ID number is issued at birth and is used
 across various government registries. Data transfer is automated and changes
 made at the regional office level are transferred to a central office in real time.
 Botswana is noted for having an integrated system that is able to update every
 registry upon issuance of a person’s death certificate, so that services across
 sectors can be stopped for the deceased individual.22

 Citizens use the Omang card as identification to access the following public
 services, entitlements, and benefits: social assistance, social insurance, driver’s
 license, voting, education, health, and passport issuance. Although biometrics
 (2 thumb prints are captured during registration), the current Omang card is not
 a Smart Card. However, the national ID number is mapped within each of the
 functional databases for verification and transaction history. Botswana intends to
 migrate to the issuance of Smart Cards starting in 2016.

 Botswana also collects biometric information as part of its e-passport registration.
 In that process, all 10 fingerprints are collected using AFIS technologies.

LEGAL FRAMEWORK
Botswana’s Omang system derives its mandate from a number of laws. The
National Registration Act (1986) requires that all Motswana on or over the age
of 16 must apply for a national ID. The Births and Deaths Registration Act (1969)
requires that all births and deaths be registered within 60 and 30 days, respectively.
Failure to register in time results in a fine.

Despite a fairly robust national ID system, Botswana does not have a comprehensive
data protection law in place. It has had freedom of information, data protection,
and electronic transaction bills drafted in recent years, but none have passed to
date.23 Botswana hopes to pass these bills as part of its next steps in furthering its
national ID system.

 It is not a governing agency that sits above the other ministries, but the Ministry is
 responsible for civil registration, citizenship, and migration, making it easier for civil
 registration and the Omang system to integrate with each other.

 REGISTRATION PROCESSES
 National ID - Omang

 All persons born in Botswana are issued a birth registration and an Omang number.
 Citizens are issued a 9-digit number, and non-citizens are issued a 7-digit one.
 This ID stays with the person throughout life. Adults who are 16 and older are
 required by law to apply to receive a physical Omang card, which is a Smart Card
 that contains biographic and biometric (2 thumb prints) data of the holder. This
 card is then used for identity and verification purposes across multiple government

 Birth certificates are generated digitally. Registration is easier if the birth is done
 in a hospital, as the doctor/midwife can automatically file for one. In remote areas
 in which births are done at home, the government has rolled out a “remote area

development program” in which it partners with district commissioners in rural
communities to have parents register their children.

CURRENT CHALLENGES
Although Botswana’s Omang card has been established for over 10 years and is a
fairly mature program, it still faces a number of challenges:

    1.	 Botswana does not have any passed data privacy, e-transaction, or right
        to information laws, despite having an immense database of citizens’
        information.

    2.	 It is still not considered a complete registry – many residents delay
        registration, which undermines the data integrity of the system and
        reduces citizens’ access to public services.

    3.	 There are still many unreported historical deaths, meaning that the
        government is unable to close the loop on a number of Omang IDs.

    4.	 There have been issues with counterfeit documents, and in recent years
        an investigation unit has been established to combat these issues.

INTEGRATION MODEL AND ROADMAP
In order to address the issues listed above and to continue to improve the services
that the Omang card can provide, Botswana should consider completing the
actions which follow as depicted in Figure 17:

    1.	 Prioritize the passage of the bills that remain open regarding data
        protection, e-transaction, and right to information. This will be especially
        important if Botswana intends to expand its national ID program to link to
        private corporate systems (e.g. banking).

    2.	 There is still approximately 28% of the population that is still not in its BDRS,
        which includes people in both urban and rural areas. 24The government
        should set up an outreach program in the cities (public campaign) and
        consider customizing a plan to reach non-citizens (e.g. migrants) through
        incentivized programs.

    3.	 In order to counter fraud and counterfeit IDs, Botswana should consider
        mandating that all Omang card registrants provide 10 fingerprints instead

                                                                                        89
         of the original 2. This will not only make de-duplication easier, but reduce
         drastically reduce any error matching rates. The Ministry of Labour &
         Home Affairs should also take caution to ensure that the fingerprints
         captured are of sufficient NIST Fingerprint Image Quality (NFIQ). It should
         be noted that e-Passport holders already have to provide 10 fingerprints,
         so it is possible to leverage some of this passport data for the overall
         national registry.

     4.	 Botswana likely has already considered the idea of expanding its Omang
         ID system to be integrated with key private institutions, like banks. It
         should develop a business plan to determine the cost of operating a
         central repository to support this, and consider having this development
         partially funded by collecting nominal transaction fees from subscribers.
         This would provide a sustainable income from which the government
         could use to maintain its growing databases.

     5.	 In order to improve the cross-border sharing of information, Botswana
         should set up bilateral agreements with its bordering countries to define
         an interoperable framework for purposes such as outside-of-country
         births/deaths, and persons of interest / watch lists.

REGISTRY ASSESSMENT
Estonia has established a comprehensive identification system, with two
foundational systems as its backbone: the National Population Register and
the National ID system. It has linked these foundational registry systems with a
variety of economic, social and political applications via the ‘X-Road’ middleware
(architecture shown in Figure 18). A variety of other state systems depend on the
data contained in the National Population Register for their services. For example,
when applications are received for childbirth allowances, study allowances or
concession public transport tickets, the relevant data is extracted from the National
Population Register without the need to complete additional documentation.
Meanwhile, the National e-ID Card is the primary form of identification used to
authenticate to services from voting and tax to even online banking and shopping.
The card contains a PIN, digital signature and encryption features to enable secure
authentication.

The uptake of the foundational systems is exemplary (100% coverage of birth and
death registration) and the considerable level of integration with other public and
private e-services makes Estonia’s identification system one that other countries
aspire to.

 LEGAL FRAMEWORK
 Estonia has a number of instruments in place that provide for the creation and
 maintenance of a national population register, the security and protection of
 the personal data contained therein, and the process to request and receive
 access to information stored in government databases. Furthermore, its current
 legal framework also facilitates the high level of interoperability between various
 government services that is a strong point of the Estonian identification system; for
 example, through rendering digital signatures legally binding, establishing central
 ICT governance, and providing for the maintenance of common infrastructure
 such as middleware, networks and document exchange.

Legal/Policy Instrument        Year   Descriptiona
Public Information Act         2000   The Act covers State and Local Agencies, legal persons in public
                                      law and private entities that are conducting public duties (e.g.
                                      educational, health care, social or other public services). Any
                                      person may make a request for information and the holder
                                      of information must respond within five working days. The
                                      entities are also required to ensure that the information is
                                      not “outdated, inaccurate or misleading.” In addition, email
                                      requests must be treated as official requests for information.

                                      sensitive personal data with the Data Protection Inspectorate.
                                      The Act also allows individuals to obtain and correct records
                                      containing their personal data.
Population Register Act        2000   The Act provides for the composition of data in the population
                                      register, the procedure for its introduction and maintenance,
                                      processing of data and access, entry of data on residence and
                                      exercise of supervision over the maintenance of the registerb.
Electronic Communications      2004   The Act creates the necessary conditions to promote the
Act                                   development of electronic communications networks and
                                      communications services while ensuring the protection of the
                                      interests of users of such services

 INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES
 The Ministry of the Interior administers and develops the National Population
 Register, as well as National ID Card and ePassport programs. ePassports are
 administered by the Police and Border Guard within the Ministry.

 The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications is responsible
 for the coordination of State ICT systems, as well as ICT strategic planning,
 setting priorities and ensuring financing for these, creating cooperation networks
 while ensuring their functionality, drafting IT legislation, as well as elaborating IT
 standards. It is also responsible for the development and operation of the shared
 components of Estonia’s national eGovernment infrastructure (i.e. the e-services
 portal, the middleware system X-Road, the network EEBone, the administration
 system RIHA and the electronic document exchange centre).

 The Data Protection Inspectorate (DPI) is an independent Agency placed
 under the authority of the Ministry of Justice ((it was formerly placed under the
 authority of the Ministry of the Interior). The DPI supervises the legality of the
 processing of personal data, and enforces the Personal Data Protection Act and
 Public Information Act.

 IDENTIFICATION PROCESSES
 Birth Registration

 The child’s birth is registered on the basis of application by the parent at the Vital
 Statistics Office within the first month of the child’s life, does not involve any state
 fees. The official prepares an entry in the birth register and issues, if desired, a
 birth certificate. To register a birth abroad in the Population Register, documents
 that have been translated and certified must be submitted to the Vital Statistics
 Office. The State and Local Government Offices pull the data from the Population
 Registry, and so it is not necessary to present the birth certificate to any other
 office.

 The following documents are submitted to register a birth:

 §§ application for registering childbirth;
 §§ medical agency’s certificate regarding the childbirth;
 §§ identity documents certifying the identity of parents;
 §§ marriage document if it has not been entered into a register (if the birth is
    registered by one of the parents, it must be accompanied by an application by
    the other parent regarding the desired name of the child);
 §§ application for accepting paternity submitted in person or in notarized form.

National Population Register

Updates can be made to a citizen’s National Population Register record in any of
the following ways25:

§§ via a Population Register employee at the local government unit
§§ by using the Population Register e-services in the state portal (ID card required)
§§ by post
§§ via e-mail in digitally signed form (ID-card required)

National ID Card / ePassport26

The service points of the Police and Border Guard Board (within the Ministry of
the Interior) deal with applications for and issuing of identity documents for the
first time. Submission of the application, paying the state fee and photo/biometric
data collection all occurs on the spot. Conversely, replacement or renewals of
identification documents can be initiated via email with digital signature, or via post.

When applying for an identity document for the first time, the following must be
submitted:

§§ application in the required form;
§§ identity document;
§§ documents that substantiate that the applicant holds Estonian citizenship
   (where applicable) and copies of these documents;

  All residents over 15 years of age have ID cards, which are used extensively across
  services such as health care, online banking, shopping, signing contracts, as tram
  tickets, to vote, and more27.

  CURRENT CHALLENGES
  Estonia’s existing implementation meets a wide variety of its needs, but there are
  a few technological considerations that should be mentioned:

  §§ The registry provides general organizational access, but does not allow for
     role-based access control (this was not part of the original architecture)
  §§ It does not allow for a subscription / notification capability to its stakeholders
  §§ Built on a standard protocol, but all of the data models are customized to each
     stakeholder’s requirements.

MATURITY ASSESSMENT
Categorization: Advanced

REGISTRY ASSESSMENT
Portugal’s identification system centers around a national ID called a Citizen
Card, which combines and replaces five different ID cards into one secure smart
card solution. The card combines five different forms of identification including
civil identification, taxation, voting, social security and healthcare cards. The goal
behind consolidating multiple functional registries into one card was to simplify
the way that Portuguese citizens interact with the government, and to embrace
the new digital age by moving to electronic transactions and advanced biometric
authentication.

The Citizen Card is extremely integrated with other registries and utilized by 99.7%
of Portugal’s population28. The back of the card contains numbers for the five
forms of identification it replaces. Additionally, the card has a chip with facial and
digital biometric29 that enables citizens to use their fingerprint for identification and
provide their signature electronically.

  LEGAL FRAMEWORK
  Portugal’s constitution includes a strict provision for data protection and privacy.
  This becomes a legal barrier when new programs are introduced to change or
  update the system. Additionally, Portugal is part of the EU and has to abide by any
  relevant EU regulations.

  In general, data protection and privacy is well integrated into Portugal’s legal code,
  and privacy laws are enforced.

INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES
The main agency in charge of implementing and managing the Citizen Card is
the Agency for Public Reform. However, implementation of the card required
communication between all Ministries whose cards were replaced – the Ministries
Finance, Health, Social Security, Internal Administration and Justice.30

On an ongoing legal basis, the Comissão Nacional de Protecção de Dados
(CNPD) is the governing body responsible with supervising and monitoring
compliance with the laws and regulations in the area of personal data protection,
with “strict respect for human rights and the fundamental freedoms and guarantees
enshrined in the Constitution and the law” The CNPD is responsible for the Data
Protection Act and the use of computerized data clause in Portugal’s Constitution.31

  IDENTIFICATION PROCESSES32
  Citizen card and e-ID can be used for most e-Services. The Card contains a
  smart chip that stores a fingerprint for national identification purposes, along
  with electronic signature capabilities. Citizens enter a pin code to the card, which
  generates a digital signature that can be used to access secure government
  services portals.

  Portugal’s goal is to be the world leader in digital security and make e-government
  services customer centric. In the past 5 years, the Portuguese government has
  undergone many effective initiatives to make the Citizen Card more user friendly
  and digitally accessible. In country, the government provides “Citizen Shops”
  which contain many information stations whose role is to provide information at the
  request of users. Concurrently, public services and information is getting moved
  online on national eGovernment portals. For example, a national electronic one-
  stop shop, called The Entrepreneur’s Desk, enables businesses to access 462
  government services, over 130 of which can be completed completely online.
  Additionally, a new integrated citizen’s portal was launched in 2006 to improve
  citizen e-access.

  CURRENT CHALLENGES
  Portugal’s civil and national registration systems are fairly well integrated. An area
  where Portugal could progress is by executing on the next level of the Secure idenTity
  acrOss boRders linKed (STORK) program for inter-European ID authentication.
  STORK is currently in pilot phase, but moving the pilot to implementation would be
  advantageous for offering the next generation of electronic services.

  Problems faced in the STORK pilot that will need to be addressing moving forward
  include:

  §§ System integration with legacy systems and standardization across countries
  §§ Need for a strong governance model and ongoing operational management
  §§ Ensure that the proper data protection laws are in place for all countries
     involved33

MATURITY ASSESSMENT
Categorization: Advanced
REGISTRY ASSESSMENT
Belgium’s civil registration and identification systems are well-established and have
succeeded in covering an extremely high proportion (if not all) of the population.
The two main foundational registries are the National Population Register, which
has close to a 100% population registration rate and has effectively replaced the
need for a census34, and the National e-ID Card, which is mandatory for all residents
over the age of 12 and must be carried at all times. It has been suggested that
one of the reasons that these foundational programs have been so successful
with respect to population coverage is because pre-existing programs (such as
the previous ID card and the Crossroads Bank for Social Security) had already
introduced citizens to the concepts of civil registration and the use of a single
identity credential to access a range of public services35. A level of trust between
citizens and government had already been established in this respect.
A unique identification number is issued to each Belgian citizen called the National
Registration Number or RRN, which corresponds to their record in the National
Registry. The RRN is integrated by default on the e-ID, as the RRN was already
being used as a means of identification by different administrative services prior
to the development of the new e-ID card36. At present, over 600 online services
are currently offered by the government that leverage the e-ID card and National
Registry data. However, there are some services that remain separate and not
integrated due to process or privacy concerns. For instance, the integration of
drivers license into the e-ID was rejected as citizens must carry their e-ID cards
at all times, which would render the police unable to confiscate drivers licenses in
case of a severe driving offence. Also, the government decided against integration
of the SIS social security card into the e-ID as, although technically possible, it was
considered to be too significant of a risk to personal privacy and anticipated to be
politically unpopular37.

  Another notable feature of Belgium’s system compared to other countries in
  the Advanced category is that biometric data in the form of fingerprints and
  iris scans is not collected. One reason was that the cost of implementing the
  necessary scanning equipment, processes and software would have been too
  high considering that the National Register and unique RRN already existed and
  worked well, with strong central data management. Another reason was again the
  perceived political backlash that might follow such an idea38.

  LEGAL FRAMEWORK39
  Belgium has taken quite a stringent approach to data protection and privacy, with
  the establishment of the Commission for the Protection of Privacy (CPP). The
  CPP imposes a rigorous authorization process whenever an entity seeks to use or
  develop services based on access to personal identification data. This has come
  with certain challenges, such as the unwillingness of some private entities to invest
  in the development of services that integrate with the National Register or e-ID due
  to this rigorous CPP process.

  Alongside its privacy and data protection framework, Belgium has instruments
  that allow for the access of public information, as well as the collection of data in a
  simplified, harmonized and integrated manner.

§§ Organization of federal, regional and European elections
Commission for the Protection of Privacy (CPP)41 was established in order
to supervise the use and the exchange of personal data. A number of sectoral
committees within the CPP are required to authorize all exchanges of personal data,
regardless of whether the requests originate from the government, administration
or private sector. This means that organizations or entities seeking to use the e-ID
or develop services based on the e-ID need to first request permission from the
Privacy Commission.

  IDENTIFICATION PROCESSES
  Birth registration

  According to Belgian law, the birth of a child in Belgium must be registered within
  15 days at the Town Hall (Maison communale/Stadhuis) of the place of birth. To
  register the birth the following are needed:

  §§ A medical certificate issued by the hospital or medical practitioner
  §§ The parents’ marriage certificate, if there is one, or a parent certificate for the
     father
  §§ Both parents’ ID cards
  In return parents are provided with various forms which they can then use to apply
  for benefits.

  National Register

  Through an online application called ‘My Folder’ accessible from the e-government
  website, individuals can view the information held about them in the National
  Register. If they find any error in this data, they can report it via the same application42.

  e-ID card43

  Applicants are required to:

  §§ Report in person to the Registry Office of their principal place of residence
  §§ Present a recent passport photo and their current identity card (or the
     replacement certificate from the police if it has been lost or stolen)
  §§ Pay a fee of 10-15 Euros (the price may vary from one municipality to another
     as each municipality is entitled to charge an extra local tax. Some municipalities
     do not charge for the eID at all)
  The waiting time for a new card is three to four weeks, after which the indidiual will
  receive a letter stating that their new eID is ready to collect from their local Registry
  Office. When collecting their new identity card, they must return the old card (or the
  replacement certificate from the police). The eID is valid for ten years, and towards
  the end of this period, the invidual will automatically receive a notification in the mail
  to apply for a new card.

Kids ID44

For Kids-ID application with the municipality, an adult is required to:

§§ Exercise parental authority over the child
§§ Accompany the child to the municipal Registry Office
§§ Provide a recent photo of the child
The waiting period for obtaining a Kids-ID is three weeks, although this can be
expedited for a fee.

CURRENT CHALLENGES45
Some of the current challenges faced by Belgium include the following:

§§ Relatively low uptake of the multiple uses of the e-ID:

          over 600 online services that can be leveraged with the e-ID, including
          applications such as “Police on the Web” (allows citizens to interact
          with local police to report crime) and online transactions using the digital
          certificate and signature features. However, reported usage of e-IDs is
          relatively low, potentially due to the additional hardware and software
          required to make use of these features (e.g. card readers, software to
          support digital signing etc.). It has been suggested that these applications
          are not user-friendly for some individuals who may not be as technologically
          literate as others.
    •	    Federal Token still used: Also some users are still using the Federal
          Token, which is a personal card with 24 unique codes securing access
          to e-government services without the need for additional hardware or
          software. The concept of the Federal Token was introduced in 2003 as
          an intermediate solution for providing citizens access to e-ID services
          and applications without the e-ID. However, although almost all citizens
          possess an e-ID a large group still prefers the use the Federal Token
          instead of buying or using a card reader.
    •	    Low uptake of digital signature: existing order forms for online
          transactions are still considered binding. Private companies consider
          therefore that there is no stringent need to change the existing online

          transaction structures by introducing the process of authentication via
          the e-ID or a legally binding signature via the e-signature. The financial
          input for doing so is seen as too high compared to the possible return on
          investment in terms of higher legal security.
  §§ Extensive processes designed to protect privacy limits private sector
     innovation: very few private organizations develop or implement e-ID based
     services or online e-ID data capturing features. The necessary effort to
     navigate the authorization process mandated by the CPP is considered too
     high compared to the return on investment.
  §§ Federated governance structure has led to piecemeal development
     of services: Belgium is a Federal Constitutional Monarchy where specific
     competencies are dispersed across three governmental levels. The Federal
     Government cannot influence or oblige regional governments to implement
     specific applications. Each governmental entity develops applications
     according to its need and financial means. This has resulted in a somewhat
     scattered landscape of initiatives and networks, with different parts of Belgium
     offering different services. However, this level of localization within a nationally
     coordinated system may also be viewed as a strength, as the services offered
     in each area may be those that are most relevant to residents of that area.
  §§ Low levels of innovation leveraging identity services: innovation on the
     platform enabled by the e-ID and National Registry requires participation on the
     part of both the citizens consuming the services, as well as the government and
     private entities developing the services. Increasing this participation through
     stronger communication and advocacy, easy-to-use hardware and software
     add-ons, and easily navigable privacy processes for the private sector may
     foster a higher level of innovation than Belgium has seen to date.

REGISTRY ASSESSMENT
Pakistan’s foundational national population database is managed by the National
Database & Registration Authority (NADRA), and covers approximately 98% of the
entire population. It is the single source of truth for identification data, and is linked
to a Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) which acts as the nation’s primary
form of identity verification. It is also linked to the Civil Registration Management
System (CRMS), which allows for electronic records to be created for vital events
such as births, deaths, marriages and divorces.

Registration for the National Database was technically voluntary, but it was
established as a prerequisite for accessing a number of other services such as
obtaining passports and utilities connections. These requirements made it very
difficult to refrain from enrolling and compelled citizens to register46. Biometric data,
namely the ten fingerprints and facial images, are collected during the registration
process and are also stored on the CNIC chip (‘match on card’). The biometric
and Automatic Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) technology employed by
NADRA enabled full de-duplication of the national database and greatly reduced
the prevalence of dual identities and identity theft. Additionally, NADRA’s data
collection and management processes are compliant with international standards
such as ICAO and ISO47 enabling greater interoperability – for instance, the CNIC
can be used as a valid travel document as it is ICAO compliant.

NADRA has employed an exemplary business and service delivery model that has
enabled it to achieve a high coverage of the population in a financially self-sustaining
way. The Government of Pakistan initially loaned NADRA some seed money to
enable it to become financially independent. NADRA operates on chargeback
model, whereby it charges a fee to the government and other organizations for
identity services provided. For example, banks are charged around 35 rupees
each time they request NADRA to authenticate an individual when they open an
account. With around 55 million such transactions that leverage NADRA’s systems

  and generate income, NADRA has become financially self-sustaining. NADRA also
  competes for projects both within and outside of Pakistan. Income from foreign
  projects amounted to USD $17.6m in 2013, which was reinvested back into the
  corporation’s operations and infrastructure. In this way, NADRA has been able to
  operate without a regular budget from the Pakistan government for a number of
  years48.

  LEGAL FRAMEWORK
  Although Pakistan has established a central database that holds personal and
  biometric data on close to 100% of its citizens, it does not yet have an official data
  privacy law49. The current legal framework does not provide for data controllers, data
  protection officers, nor a national data protection authority50. So far, the protection
  of personal data collected for the NADRA National Database has largely relied on
  the robust data management practices of NADRA itself51. Although Pakistan has
  ratified international treaties that recognize privacy as a fundamental human right,
  and its Constitution recognizes it as an inviolable right, the current legal framework
  does not yet enable the true spirit of these instruments to be enforced52.

  Pakistan has passed legal instruments that provide for Freedom of Information at
  a federal and provincial level, and a draft bill to enable the government to address
  electronic crimes is to be tabled later in 2015.

INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES
National Database & Registration Authority (NADRA) is a division of the
Ministry of the Interior (MOI) but is an independent corporate body. NADRA
Technologies Limited is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission of
Pakistan, and is wholly owned by NADRA. Although it sits within the MOI, it operates
autonomously of the government with respect to finance and management (as
provided for by the NADRA Ordinance), and receives no government funding. By
virtue of his post, the chairman of NADRA is also the registrar general of Pakistan.53
NADRA is responsible for registration of the national population and issuance of
identity cards54.

Electoral Commission of Pakistan (ECP) manages the voter registry, which
used to be maintained through door-to-door re-verification exercises based on
the previous electoral roll. In the most recent elections, the NADRA database was
used initially as a source for identification data on the population eligible to vote,
with re-verification by the Electoral Commission carried out after the initial lists

  were compiled. For the next elections, the Electoral Commission may leverage the
  NADRA National Database for biometric voter identity verification55.

  IDENTIFICATION PROCESSES
  Birth registration56

  Informants present in person to the Union Council, fill out a form, and provide their
  identification. The Union Council issues the birth certificate and creates a record
  in the NADRA National Database, using the computers and software provided by
  NADRA. This process must be completed within 2 months of the child being born.

  The process for late registration is more complex, requiring two affidavits and
  the presentation of the child to the District Health Officer (DHO). The DHO then
  issues a letter to the concerned Union Council authorizing the late entry. Once
  this process has been completed, the informant can go to the Union Council for
  registration per the usual process.

  NADRA mobile birth registration57

  NADRA developed a program with NGOs and the telecom sector in Pakistan to
  develop a mobile application to facilitate preregistration. Pakistan has a high density
  of mobile phone users, and any midwife or parents can use the mobile application
  to pre-register a birth in the NADRA National Database. NADRA’s infrastructure,
  such as mobile vans, can then be mobilized to go and register the child and take
  this record to the Union Council.

  ID card (CNIC)58

  §§ CNIC applicant must present in person to a registration center and produce
     proof of identity (one of the following documents): Birth Certificate, old NIC,
     Matriculation Certificate, CNICs of immediate/blood relatives, or Citizenship
     certificate issued by MOI
  §§ Data Acquisition occurs at Data Acquisition Unit (DAU) and photo, fingerprint
     and signature captured
  §§ Data is automatically checked for deduplication and then uploaded to NADRA
     Data Warehouse

  Death certificate                                 50

Increasing registration in remote or marginalized populations

NADRA employed a number of creative outreach methods to dramatically increase
the coverage of the National Database:

§§ Combination of static registration centers, mobile vans and semi-mobile units
   that could all transmit data back to the centralized database
§§ Mobile registration vans with women drivers sent into hujiras (areas reserved for
   women) or areas ruled by warlords, as well as incentivizing women to register
   by offering grants from the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP).
§§ Registration with NADRA and ownership of an ID card were established as pre-
   requisites to participating in programs such as BISP, and to signing up for a
   passport. This means that if women wanted to embark on their hajj pilgrimage,
   they would need a passport and therefore need to be registered with NADRA.
§§ Introduced motorcycle registration units to complete registration in remote
   areas that were beyond the reach of mobile vans. Hired hikers, mountaineers
   and skiers to proceed into the mountain areas and communicate with the
   communities there.

  CURRENT CHALLENGES
  Some of the current challenges faced by NADRA include:

  §§ Collection of service fees from the government in return for identity services
     that have been provided by NADRA. The Government of Pakistan currently
     owe NADRA billions of rupees in unpaid fees60.
  §§ There are many potential future applications that could leverage NADRA to
     increase transparency in the dealings between citizens and government (e.g.
     justice system). However, in some cases, there are entities with more to gain
     from lack of transparency that might seek to block progress61.
  §§ The lack of data protection and privacy laws is a notable gap in Pakistan’s legal
     framework, considering the amount of personal (including biometric) data is
     held by the government. It may consider establishing a privacy commission or
     a national data protection authority.

MATURITY ASSESSMENT
Categorization: Intermediate

REGISTRY ASSESSMENT
Kenya has three foundational identity systems in additional to numerous functional
programs covering services such as voting, social security, compulsory health
insurance, tax and immigration. The Integrated Population Registration System
(IPRS), launched in 2015, is designed to be the central repository of all identification
data, linking the functional systems with the main foundational registries. The IPRS
consists of two parts: 1) the National Population Register component will contain
data on all Kenyan citizens and aliens, and 2) a unique 11-digit PIN assigned to
a person’s record will act as a reference for all transactions involving that person.
Their digital file will be continually updated with digital copies of documents
attributable to that individual over their lifetime (e.g. National ID, NSSF card, NHIF
card, marriage certificates, driving license, passport). The IPRS allows updating of
information by various agencies within the legal framework that is in place. Data is
accessible to these authorized agencies via web portal, SMS or email.

Integration of the IPRS with a range of functional services is currently underway
– data relating to approximately 57% of the population has been entered into
the registry from the existing primary registration databases (CRVS, National ID
register, immigration/refugee departments). Kenya aims to have all remaining
agencies integrated into the IPRS by 2016. In terms of eGovernment, online
application functionality is already available via the eCitizen portal for business
registry, marriage certificates, passport applications, visas and title searches, with
birth/death certificate application functionality to be made available soon.

The primary form of authentication for services is the National ID Card, with the new
e-ID card incorporating biometric data as well as biographical data. The National
ID Card is also a pre-requisite to create an account for the M-Pesa money transfer
platform, which is being increasingly used to process transactions between
individuals and government agencies in Kenya (e.g. NSSF , NHIF ). Additionally, a
KRA PIN is also required to authenticate to some services (Tax and NSSF).

LEGAL FRAMEWORK62
Kenya has a number of legal instruments in place that establish the compulsory
nature of birth and death registration, protect the right to privacy and security of
personal data, enable the public to access information contained in government
databases and have any personal information corrected, and finally facilitate the
use of technology in key public activities.

Some of the challenges that Kenya has faced in this space include a number of
cases identified by the immigration ministry where foreigners had illegally acquired
documents (IDs and passports) through corrupt officials63. Another concern for
Kenya is the rise of cybercrime and cost to the nation each year as a result. The
government has taken preventative action in the form of introducing Public Key
Infrastructure for digital certification of online transactions, establishing a national
Computer Incident Response Coordination Centre, and developing a National
Cyber Security Strategy64.

  IDENTIFICATION PROCESSES71
  Birth registration72

  §§ Notification: Local registration agent completes details on an official registration
     form which includes a perforated stub which is the ‘notification slip’. This slip
     and the original notification is given to the parents or relative, while the local
     agent retains the carbon copy of the notification. The completed form can
     be considered ‘pre-registration’ until legal registration is completed. For home
     births, the notification process is completed with the assistant chief of the sub-
     county where the child was born. For children born in medical institutions, the
     institution handles the notification process73.
  §§ Legal registration: The local registration agent submits the completed form
     to the Civil Registry Office (CRO) to be legally recognised and recorded,
     followed by the generation of a personal identification code. This constitutes
     legal registration. The newborn’s parents or relative then produce the proof of
     notification to the CRO, the notification slip is matched with the registration in
     the system, and a birth certificate is issued.
  §§ Fees: The birth registration process must commence within three months of
     birth. Notification and registration are both free within that period. After that
     time, a penalty of 150 Kenyan Shillings is applied.

  ‘MOVE-IT’ birth notification

  The MOVE-IT (Monitoring of Vital Events through Technology) program is the result
  of a partnership between the Civil Registration Department and the Ministry of
  Health. Community health workers are equipped with software that allows them
  to report vital events, along with their location, to the local sub-chief by using their
  mobile phone. The workers, who are often volunteers, are paid a small allowance
  as an incentive to complete these notifications. The system reflects the vital event
  information in a central electronic database as well as a real-time dashboard,
  which shows the number of birth notifications that have been notified via SMS
  per county and sub-county. This provides a useful baseline against which the
  registration activities of chiefs/assistant chiefs in a particular county can be tracked

and checked for compliance. This means that after SMS notification is received,
if chiefs/sub-chiefs delay birth registration for any reason, it will show up on the
system. A similar RapidSMS birth notification system is also used in Nigeria.

Integrated Population Registry System (IPRS)74

§§ Following legal registration of a newborn, birth certificate data is entered into
   the IPRS system by the CRO.
§§ Each time a new record is created in the IPRS, a unique 11-digit PIN is allocated
   to the record. This acts as the individual’s unique identifier for life.
§§ This electronic record will continually be updated with information and digital
   copies of documents obtained throughout the course of the individual’s life via
   the integration with other government agencies (e.g. primary and secondary
   school certificates, national identity card, drivers license, passport, etc.)
§§ Currently the main function of the IPRS is to perform identity verification
   services, although it does not yet charge a fee for these services

National ID Card75

§§ The application must present in person to the District Office with proof of age,
   names and place of birth, and a completed application form signed by the
   chief or assistant chief of the sublocation within their District
§§ District Officer signs the application form
§§ Fingerprints and a passport size photograph of the applicant are taken and
   sent with the form to the National Registration Bureau for the creation of the
   national identity card
§§ The applicant is provided with a temporary card that they can use until their
   National ID Card arrives (waiting time of up to two months)
§§ After two months has elapsed, the applicant returns to the District Office to
   collect their National ID Card

CURRENT CHALLENGES
Registration is reliant upon community-based notification, but there is often
lack of awareness or belief that registration is not necessary. Also, some Civil
Registration Offices (CRO) lack the necessary infrastructure and capacity (i.e.

  internet connectivity, installation of software, training/support) and often there are
  too few CROs to provide timely and quality services to the districts they are tasked
  to cover76.

  Apart from manual registration at CROs, online registration has been enabled
  for marriages, new businesses, land and re-issuance of drivers’ licenses, via the
  eCitizen portal, as well as for social security via the NSSF website. Birth/death
  registration functionality is planned to be delivered in the future as part of the
  eCitizen portal, which may help to alleviate some of the capacity issues currently
  faced by the CROs77. However, while part of the process can be completed online
  through the portal, there are still manual steps that must be taken afterwards. For
  example, after applying for the renewal of a drivers’ license online, the applicant
  must still produce a printout of the renewal slip to the government office in order to
  obtain their new license. Additionally, the eCitizen portal did not receive an official
  launch – as a result, the public is still relatively unaware of the initiative. When
  applicants visit Huduma centers for various procedures, they are directed by staff
  to log in to the portal and access the relevant services online, which is when they
  come to know about the online system.

  To improve the level of community engagement and notification rates for vital
  events, Kenya is leveraging mobile technology as part of the MOVE-IT program.
  When text messages are sent by health workers to local authorities to notify of a
  vital event, the authorities know to kick off the registration process78. However, the
  uptake of this program is still quite low to date, indicating that perhaps incentives
  and better communication may be required.

  Other challenges include the following:

  §§ CRVS
      •	   Duplicate registrations occur due to immature search functionality
      •	   Low registration in vulnerable and border populations
      •	   Cause of death data is not optimally captured
      •	   Paper-based bound volumes of data are still in the process of being
           digitized. However, the digital repository is not structured as a relational
           database.

   •	   Yet to be linked with Kenyan embassies to facilitate passport renewal of
        citizens living abroad
   •	   Can only verify authenticity of credentials, rather than verify identity of
        individuals based on biometric scanning and comparison
   •	   Contains a large amount of personal data that would be of commercial
        value and interest to a variety of entities, but is currently not adequately
        protected by the existing legal framework (i.e. requires data protection
        legislation)
§§ National ID
   •	   Delays in kicking off registration for new Smart ID Cards in 2015
   •	   Registration on-site at enrolment centres is required in order to provide
        biometric data
   •	   AFIS system can currently only compare ink prints with stored ink images
        – cannot compare digitally scanned prints with stored images of ink prints

  MATURITY ASSESSMENT
  Categorization: Intermediate

  REGISTRY ASSESSMENT
  Mexico has several parallel registration systems, from civil registration, to a
  national ID, to a voter registration card. Though all are used, the voting registry
  has the largest coverage of the population and has therefore become more of a
  foundational registry than a functional one79 In fact, the voter ID is so widespread
  that it has become an acceptable way for citizens to identify themselves. It is not
  uncommon for a voter ID card to be used to open a bank account, travel by air,
  and purchase alcohol. What started two decades ago as a way to catch fraudulent
  voters, the voter ID card has become the country’s preferred credential.80

  The birth registry in Mexico captures 93% of births, however, an estimated 7 to 10
  million of Mexico’s 122 million population still remain unregistered. The registration
  process requires several forms of identification, such as a certificate of live birth,
  each parent’s birth certificate, a marriage certificate, and sometimes a fee, all of
  which can inhibit marginalized sectors of the population from registering. 81

  Mexico’s national identification system utilizes the CURP (Clave Única de Registro
  de Población), a national ID with 18 alphanumeric characters. The characters
  are built methodically, with the first few letters aligning with the individual’s name,
  two aligning with date of birth, one aligning with gender, and other coding for
  the remaining elements. The CURP is required for tax filings, starting a business,
  enrolling in education, membership in government-run health services, passport
  applications, and other government services. 82

  The CURP is not fully integrated with the population, as it is not required for
  children under 18 years of age, so Mexico started issuing biometric IDs in the form
  of Personal Identity Cards for Minors, and National Citizen ID Cards for people

over 18 years of age, in 2010. 83 These cards collect biometric data such as iris
images, fingerprints, a photograph, and a signature, which has served as a point
of contention recently because of the high amount of data collection. The National
Citizen Registry and National Youth Registry will integrated for form the National
Population Registry. This form of biometric identification is very well integrated and
used by all units of public administration.84 85

LEGAL FRAMEWORK
The right to free and universal birth registration was recently passed in 2014. A year
later, the challenge currently faced by the Mexican government is setting up the
proper procedures and rules to enforce the new public policy.86 Birth registration
is mandatory under Civil Code for each of Mexico’s 32 states 87 The CULP is
regarded as the official national ID, however, obtaining a national ID (CURP) is not
mandatory by law.

Mexico passed a data protection law in 2010 that is fairly comprehensive. Voting
laws in Mexico are set by the federal government and not individual states.88

The collection of biometric data for Mexico’s new identity card has been
controversial. In collecting youth biometrics, concerns have surfaced in collecting
so much data, as there are currently no legal protections regulating the use of iris
images in Mexico.89

  INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES
  The government entity in charge of civil registration in Mexico is the National
  Registry of Population and Personal Identification’s General Office
  (RENAPO). All civil registration is handled separately by state. In addition to
  Mexico’s government office, there are many NGOs and nonprofits in Mexico
  helping with registration. For example, Be Foundation is a nonprofit organization
  currently working to eliminate non-registration of births in Mexico.90

  The Office of Immigration (INM) processes the CURP number. Government
  immigration offices are scattered throughout the country as to be more accessible




  90	 (Migration Policy)



136
to the Mexican population. The INM must collaborate with other offices, as CURP
numbers are required to apply for many other forms of identification and public
service.

The National Electorate Institute / Insituto Nacional Electoral (INE) is in
charge of managing federal elections as well as issuing election cards. Because
voter ID cards have functionally become more of a national ID system, the INE may
have to step into more of a far reaching, national registration role in the future.

For the true functional registries, the Mexican Institute of Social Security issues
the social security card to every working Mexican citizen, and the RFC is issued by
the Mexican Treasury.

IDENTIFICATION PROCESSES
Birth registration

A birth certificate will either be issued following registration or through a separate
application. All children must be registered within 6 months regardless of place
of birth. For institutional births, a physician or midwife provides a “certificate of
live birth” that parents present along with other required forms, like parents birth
certificates and their marriage certificate, to the office of the civil registrar where the
child was born. If the child is born at home, the same process applies.91

The fact that a certificate of live birth, both parents birth certificates, and a marriage
certificate are necessary affects many marginalized sectors of the population,
including but not limited to street births, single parent families, refugee or nomad
births, children of migrants, and others. Additionally, holes in the process, from
inconsistent implementation of the birth registration law, to disregard by parents,
can lead to non-registration. Failing to register a birth can lead to large fines or
judicial action.92

Birth registration is free in 16 states and costs vary in other states. In poor areas,
this can serve as a barrier for registration. Initial registration fees are US$12 but late
fees can be an additional US$30.

CURP

To register for a CURP, citizens must visit the nearest government office or civil
registry in person. Mexicans both residing in Mexico and living elsewhere should

                                                                                          137
  enroll for a CURP when 18 years old and older. Registration requires a birth
  certificate and official identification (e.g., passport, voter ID, proof of residence,
  etc.). 93 The card used to be printed on green paper but now it is printed on black
  and white paper and laminated. Both forms are acceptable.94

  Once obtained, the CURP can be accessed electronically anytime. To check the
  CURP number or print a copy, citizens can go online to and enter name and birth
  data and access their record.95

  National Identity Card (Youth and Citizen)

  To obtain a national identity card, people attend an enrollment office (or mobile unit)
  with a birth certificate and CURP card if applicable. The individual’s authentication
  is carried out via the CURP database and the civil registration database. A variety
  of biometrics are collected (face photo, 10 fingerprint biometrics, 2 iris images, a
  digital signature, and a scan of CURP or birth certificate).96

  Electoral Card

  To enroll in the electoral register for the first time, it is required to have Mexican
  citizenship and to be 18 years old or older. Citizens can enroll at a polling station
  or agency service center and must renew every 10 years. Obtaining a card is
  considered relatively easy – cards are free and hundreds of issuing agencies exist
  across Mexico.97

  CURRENT CHALLENGES
  Mexico has made significant progress with its registration but still faces a number
  of challenges:

  §§ The requirements and process for birth registration affects many marginalized
     groups and leads to increased non-registration
  §§ Half of states (16) charge for birth registration, and segments of the population
     are unable to pay
  §§ Failing to register a birth is associated with large fines, yet the groups of people
     who are unregistered are usually effected by poverty

§§ Registration is often very uneven between states - Chiapas and Guerrero have
   less than half of births under the age of one registered. Coincidentally, these
   states are some of the poorest regions in Mexico98
§§ CURP cards are sometimes printed at home and improper paper is flimsy and
   easily damaged or lost
§§ CURP is not issued at birth or mandated by law, leading to decreased utilization
§§ The usage of the Voter ID as the preferred method of identification excludes
   all children under 18 from participating in Mexico’s most widespread national
   registry

  MATURITY ASSESSMENT
  Categorization: Intermediate

  REGISTRY ASSESSMENT
  Nigeria has two foundational registries – the civil registration system to record vital
  events, as well as the national identity management system. The national identity
  management system consists of the following components:

  §§ National Identification Number (NIN) System
  §§ National Identity Database (NIDB)
  §§ Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS)
  §§ Identity Authentication and Verification
  The system incorporates standardized data capture processes in compliance with
  international data standards (ISO, ICAO, IEEE), and implements deduplication
  processes prior to the inclusion of the data. Biometric data is collected as part of
  the registration for the NIN – namely ten fingerprints, iris scan and photograph. The
  primary credential that is issued as a result of this process is a biometric General
  Multi-Purpose Card (or electronic ID card) that can be used to authenticate an
  individual’s identity across a number of public and private services. The card
  was developed in liaison with MasterCard, with Prepaid MasterCard functionality
  included in the e-ID. Fingerprint data is also stored locally within the card itself
  rather than in a central data, enabling ‘match on card’ functionality and increasing
  security99.

  Following the launch of the NIN registration in 2014, about 15% of the adult
  population has been registered. Civil registration of vital events is still relatively low,
  with only 42% of births registered. The national identification management system
  is planned to be integrated with a number of public and private services, and
  eventually with the civil registration system as well.

  LEGAL FRAMEWORK
  Nigeria’s current legal framework provides for a civil registration system, allows for
  freedom of information held by the government, provides for a national population
  registry and mandates that the National Identification Number (NIN) be used as a
  basis for a number of services. However, it lacks legal instruments that support
  personal data protection and privacy, as well as those that would facilitate the
  secure electronic transmission of data (although with regards to the latter, bills have
  been drafted in the past to this end). It has been suggested that in conjunction
  with the review and update of Nigeria’s Data Protection and Privacy Laws, an
  independent regulatory body should be established to protect and enforce these
  rights100.

  IDENTIFICATION PROCESSES
  Birth registration105

  §§ Institutional births: hospital registers the birth with the NPC
  §§ Home births: parents obtain a sworn affidavit from their local government,
     stating that the child was born in that local government area. The sworn
     affidavit can then be taken to the NPC.
  §§ NPC issues a standard birth certificate
  §§ There are several locations at which birth registration takes place, including
     NPC registration centres, NPC offices at the local government headquarters,
     NPC desks in hospitals and health centres
  §§ No fee is charged if registration is completed within 60 days of the birth
  RapidSMS notification by NPC registrars106

  §§ Since January 2011 the NPC has been implementing decentralized monitoring
     using the mobile-phone based platform RapidSMS. The system was piloted
     in 2010 in 19 states, which included 382 local government areas and 1,582
     registration centres.
  §§ Presently, RapidSMS reporting is available across all 774 local government
     areas nationwide, processes more than 6,215 SMS messages per month, and
     automatically compiles data into an electronic repository of results that can be
     viewed via an online dashboard. Data is available per registration center, per
     state, per gender, and per age group.
  §§ Each Registrar has his/her unique ID and reports the number of birth registration
     cases every fortnight. Those reported cases are all updated on the RapidSMS
     dashboard which is accessible over the web and visible/monitored by all levels
     of government. This helps to identify disparities in service delivery and facilitate
     prompt, evidence-based responses to areas where birth registration levels
     are low.

Retrospective birth registration107

Individuals born prior to 1992 may also obtain an NPC birth certificate. When
registering with the NPC, such individuals must present a sworn affidavit from
their local government and must undergo an interview prior to being issued a birth
certificate.

National Identification Number (NIN)108

§§ Option 1: applicant can visit the official website of NIMC (http://www.nimc.
   gov.ng) and pre-enrol online by filing the online Enrolment Form and print out a
   summary sheet that has a 2D Barcode. It is important to note that the Online
   Pre-Enrolment an initial step in the Enrolment process. The enrolment is only
   completed after the applicant gets his or her biometric data (finger prints,
   headshot photograph and signature) captured and processed by an Enrolment
   Officer at an Enrolment Centre
§§ Option 2: applicant presents in person to an Enrolment Centre or Mobile
   Enrolment Centre and fill an Enrolment Form (hard copy). The completed form
   is handed over to the Enrolment Office who in turn captures the biometric data
   of the applicant and processes the data in the completed enrolment form
§§ Application receives an SMS notification that their E-ID card is ready, after
   which they can collect it from the enrolment centre

CURRENT CHALLENGES109
Some of the challenges with the current systems include the following:

§§ Poor coverage in registration of vital events
§§ Bureaucratic inefficiency
§§ Poor data management
§§ Stakeholder engagement and feedback systems not mature
§§ Poor public awareness and apathy to civic responsibilities among the population
§§ Legal framework lacks the instruments and institutions to protect personal data

  Opportunities for improvement:

  §§ Stronger collaboration with other relevant government agencies
  §§ There is a current practice of having a registration desk or focal persons at
     major hospitals which could be extended to all maternity centers and registered
     Traditional Births Attendants (TBAs)
  §§ Increase use of mobile registration systems. This may be applicable in remote
     areas where access to registration centers is difficult (e.g. build further on the
     existing use of RapidSMS)
  §§ Involvement of community and religious leaders in advocating the importance
     of civil registration
  §§ Improved training for death certification by physicians and proper use of ICD
     coding standards
  UNICEF predicts that births in Nigeria will account for 10% of the total births in the
  world by 2050110. This is a strong case for change to uplift the current CRVS, and
  fortunately there seems to be a high level of political will to improve the system111.

MATURITY ASSESSMENT
Categorization: Greenfield

REGISTRY ASSESSMENT112
Sierra Leone currently has four functional identity programs and one foundational
civil registry program, overseen by a number of different government agencies.
Each program operates within its own mandate as a result of piecemeal legislation
that has developed over time. The processes and technology that support each
registry are also unique, and have not been designed to facilitate interlinkage
between the systems. For example, data standards relating to identification differ
for each registry.

At present, biographical data relating to just over half of Sierra Leone’s population
of 6.09 million people has been captured in the foundational system, with a rate
of approximately 400,000 new registrations being completed each year. Biometric
data is captured as part of the National ID card registration process (6 fingerprints),
as well as for Social Security (6 fingerprints) and voting registration (10 fingerprints),
but is not captured as part of the foundational registry. Currently, there is no
process for information from the various functional registries to be integrated into a
central data repository. However, there are plans to establish an Integrated National
Civil Registration System (INCRS) which would act as the central foundation
registry for the country, be managed by the National Registration Secretariat, and
be constituted by integrating data from the two principal functional registries: the
NEC voter registry and the NASSIT social security registry.

The Government of Sierra Leone has articulated a clear intention to consolidate its
registry systems, which will require funding, infrastructure, and a strong governance
model.

LEGAL FRAMEWORK
Sierra Leone currently has legal instruments that provide for the compulsory
registration of all citizens and residents, as well as the right of those individuals
to access government information. With respect to data protection and privacy,
aside from the protections enshrined in the Constitution and despite the intentions
captured as part of an ECOWAS supplementary act (to which Sierra Leone was a
signatory in 2010), there is still no comprehensive national data protection law, nor
has an independent data protection authority been established as yet. Additionally,
the need has been called out for a law to establish digital identity as a legally valid
form of identification, as well as an information and communication technology
(ICT) Act to support privacy and data protection related to electronic data113.

  INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES114
  National Registration Secretariat (NRS) is currently a semi-autonomous
  division within the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MOIA) that was established to conduct
  mandatory registration and issue national identity cards. Future plans for the NRS
  involve establishing it as the autonomous central authority for digital identification,
  reporting to the President’s office and governed by a Board constituted by
  stakeholder representatives. NRS would work with agencies such as the NEC
  and NASSIT to establish and maintain a central digital identity registry, issue birth/
  death/marriage/adoption certifications, issue ID credentials and provide identity
  services to other public and private entities.

  National Election Commission (NEC) is responsible for voter registration and
  organizing elections. In 2012, the NEC conducted a registration drive that resulted
  in the capture of identification information (including biometrics) of 2.7 million
  people.

  National Social Security Insurance and Trust (NASSIT), within the Ministry
  of Labor and Social Security (MLSS), is responsible for issuing social security
  numbers to working individuals (who contribute to the scheme during employment)
  and beneficiaries (who receive benefits upon retirement).

  Birth & Death Bureau, within the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS),
  manages birth and death registrations in Sierra Leone.

IDENTIFICATION PROCESSES115
Birth registration

The birth registration process is free of charge, entirely paper-based, and is
conducted in a decentralized manner across 14 districts around the nation.
Registration is completed at Peripheral Health Units (PHU), which are district
health management clinics. Every four years, the records at the PHUs are collected
and archived centrally at the Birth and Death Bureau. Doubts have been raised by
several other agencies with regards to the reliability of the birth certificates, given
the manual paper-based nature of the process. However, it is recognized that a lot
of valuable data resides in these registries that would require conversion into digital
form to support the proposed INCRS.

Passports

Passport issuance can be quite a costly and lengthy process, involving vetting and
investigation that can take anywhere between ten minutes and one week. Biometric
data is not collected as part of the process – a birth certificate must be used as
proof of identification. In light of the concerns around reliability of birth registration
data (as it is a manual and paper-based process), using birth certificates as a basis
for issuing passports then also calls into question the reliability of the resulting
passports.

MOIA captures data on passports electronically, meaning that the passport registry
is already in the form of a digital database that can be queried.

CURRENT CHALLENGES116
Below are some of the challenges currently facing the system:

§§ Little or no coverage of some remote populated areas
§§ Data capture process is paper-based, not electronic
§§ Date of birth data is verified against paper-based birth certificates
§§ Captured data undergoes minimal checks for accuracy

  §§ Lack of central data repository or master data management for identification
     data (i.e. few de-duplication processes in place at point of entry; lack of uniform
     standards-based approach)
  §§ No data maintenance processes – i.e. former records are not retrospectively
     digitized, and current database at risk of going obsolete without plan for regular
     updates
  §§ A primary ID has not yet been identified to enable multiple functional registries
     to be linked to the foundational registry using a primary key
  §§ Incomplete ID documentation and gaps/inconsistencies in identification data
     often cause delays in the provision of important functional services such as
     social security
  §§ Biometric data is captured for primary social security members only, and not
     dependents or proxies
  A critical success factor in Sierra Leone’s next steps will be digitizing the birth/
  death registry and verifying the data, as the information contained in the paper
  certificates (e.g. DOB) is currently used as a basis when including an individual into
  the other functional registries.

MATURITY ASSESSMENT
Categorization: Greenfield

REGISTRY ASSESSMENT117
Liberia has no foundational identity program as yet (although it is planned), and has
five main functional identity programs run by different agencies that use various
standards and processes. The functional programs provide useful services though
are specific to the individual needs of each government agency. At present, there
exists a civil registry for births and deaths, a passport program, a HR/payroll
system for civil service, a social security program, and a driver’s license system.
Interoperability across these programs is not facilitated as yet.

LEGAL FRAMEWORK
Through its recent National Identity Registration (NIR) law, Liberia has provided
for a digital identification system, a governing entity to administer and maintain
it, and refers to existing privacy protections in the Liberian Constitution as well as
recently enacted Freedom of Information laws. Although the law is explicit about
the need to control access to biometric information which is collected or used for
identification purposes, there is no dedicated legal instrument yet that protects
personal data nor right to privacy. The NIR law also currently does not define
digital identity as a legally recognized category, though it defines biometric identity
as a digital construct of identity. The law is silent on how the digital identity is to
be used or asserted, i.e. through online identity services or smartcards. The legal
framework around electronic communications is yet to be developed to protect
against

      National Identification      2011 Provides for digital identification, and calls for the setup of
      Registry Act                      a National Identification Registry (NIR) to be responsible for
                                        issuing a biometric-based identification card to each citizen and
                                        resident. The law recognizes that a reliable and effective system
                                        for identifying people in Liberia is essential for rule of law and
                                        for social planning, including the efficient delivery of services.
                                        The new law repeals PRC Decree #65, which was passed in 1981
                                        and represented the first national effort to implement a national
                                        identification system in Liberia.
                                           The NIR Act of 2011 also calls to ensure that the collection and
                                           issuance of data about people are done in conformity with the
                                           freedom of information laws of Liberia and do not infringe upon
                                           the rights to privacy guaranteed by the country’s constitution.

  INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES118
  Board of Registrars (BOR), headed by the Minister of Internal Affairs, has been
  set up as a governing body and has convened multiple times to define the strategic
  and operational priorities of the NIR. The BOR consists of the following members:

  §§ Minister of Internal Affairs (Chair of the Board)
  §§ Director General of Liberia Institute of Statistics & Geo-Information Services
     (LISGIS)
  §§ Minister of Health and Social Welfare
  §§ Minister of Justice

National Identification Registry (NIR) is planned to serve as an autonomous
entity within the executive branch of the government, and would be empowered
to operate as a legal entity with the full rights to transact. NIR’s functions are
stipulated to be:

§§ Establish, maintain, administer, and implement the National Biometric Identifi-
   cation System of Liberia
§§ Design, implement and provision for the technology infrastructure and related
   processes
§§ Collect, organize, store, secure, and manage access to data, including bio-
   metric data
§§ Establish the adequacy of information provided by applicants for biometric
   identification cards per the law
§§ Issue a biometric citizen identification card to citizens and residents
§§ Issue a social security number (SSN), as part of the biometric citizen identifica-
   tion card, to serve as a unique identifier and the primary government-approved
   identity number
According to the NIR Act of 2011, the NIR is to be financed by legislative
appropriations made through the national budget, without precluding the NIR from
seeking and accepting assistance, donations, and/or grants from other person or
institutions. Currently, no budget is allocated for the setup of NIR.

The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) operates a civil register to
record births and deaths in Liberia.

Since 2007, the Bureau of Passports and Visas at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA), has been using biometrics to issue passports to citizens in Liberia. Since
2009, the Civil Service Agency (CSA) has been operating a biometric-based
electronic register to improve human resource management within government.

IDENTIFICATION PROCESSES119
Birth registration

Since 2011, the civil register has been partly decentralized to improve the
efficacy of information collected at birth. Prior to 2011, birth registration had to be
conducted at the office of MOHSW in Monrovia. Since people in rural areas had

  difficulty traveling to Monrovia, birth registration was low. Starting in 2011, the GOL
  has established 14 birth registration centers (as registrars) in different counties of
  Liberia and maintains a central registrar at the MOHSW office in Monrovia.

  §§ At the time of birth (irrespective of whether the birth takes place in a community
     or at a county health clinic), a birth notification form is filled out in triplicates.
     Parents keep one copy of the birth notification form, and the other two copies
     are sent to the district registrar officer
  §§ The district registrar records the birth, transmits the information to the elec-
     tronic database at MOHSW, and issues a birth certificate to the facility where
     the child was born
  §§ A parent can claim the birth certificate by presenting a copy of the birth notifi-
     cation form
  MOHSW has spent considerable effort to create awareness for the need of early
  birth registration. It has developed midwife birth facilities at the county health
  clinics, and is offering birth registration for free:

  Passport120

  §§ Ten fingerprints are collected using scanners at any of the 5 Ministry of Foreign

  §§ Fingerprints are sent to an Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS)
     within MOFA
  §§ At AFIS, the fingerprints are checked against an electronic database of people
     to whom MOFA has previously issued passports. If a match is found, the
     request for passport is seen as a duplicate and a possible fraudulent attempt.
     Otherwise, MOFA reviews issuing a passport, based on the validity of additional
     information provided. Deduplication occurs.
  §§ Waiting time for the passport is 7 days

Future: National biometric ID Card (not implemented)

Residents will be entitled to obtain a biometric national identification card if they
submit following information:

(a) a birth certificate; (b) fingerprints; (c) photograph; (d) proof of citizenship
of parents; (e) date of birth; (f) place of birth; (g) gender; (h) color of skin, hair,
and eyes; and (i) any other information deemed necessary to verify citizenship.
Based on the information provided, a citizen would be issued a biometric citizen
identification card bearing a SSN, and a resident would be issued a biometric
resident identification card.

CURRENT CHALLENGES121
§§ Multiplicity of systems: five functional digital identity programs are being oper-
   ated under different government agencies in Liberia, with interoperability not
   facilitated as yet. A person can hold several identity artefacts
§§ Duplication of information in registries and the presence of false records (e.g.
   ghost civil service workers)
§§ No primary identification credential in place
§§ Voter re-registration must be completed for each election cycle without the
   ability to leverage a central foundational ID registry
§§ Legal framework around data protection, privacy and electronic data transmis-
   sion is underdeveloped
§§ Currently no funding or business model planned or set up for the NIR
§§ Passport fraud attempts occur on a daily basis, yet the penalty is not enforced

  REGISTRY ASSESSMENT
  High poverty and inequality between rich and poor are hurdles for Djibouti in
  developing an integrated identification system122. However, it has started a digital
  ID program in an effort to identify the poor, known as the Carte d’Identification
  Nationale, Numerique (Digital National Identity Card). Djibouti also started its “Social
  Registry” program in 2012, which has the ability to contribute to the development
  of a national registry in the future.

  The Social Register program targets poor households in Djibouti. Its goal is
  to identify and register households considered to be poor or vulnerable and
  subsequently provide assistance to households in need. The registration process
  is twofold – first, individual people are registered in the Identity Registration System
  (IRS) and issued unique identification numbers, and secondly, individuals are
  grouped into households for the Social Register (SR). Individuals must be invited
  to join the program in order to visit community offices and enroll. Both biographic
  and biometric data is collected for the IRS. A Proxy Means Test (PMT) generates
  a household poverty score to be stored in SR database – households below a
  certain score receive assistance.123

  Hosting over 23,000 refugees124, Djibouti faces an additional registration problem
  with the high number of refugees who reside in camps inside its borders. The UN
  refugee agency launched a program in 2009 to assist Djibouti register its refugee
  population and issue ID cards. The cards give refugees security and access to
  basic services125. However, the UNHCR announced in 2015 that it will not be able
  to assist in joint registration of refugees unless sufficient resources are provided by
  Djibouti.126

  LEGAL FRAMEWORK
  Freedom House gave Djibouti a press status of “Not Free” in 2014. The legal and
  media environment is very restrictive and many laws that would support a national
  identification system are not in place.127

  Djibouti does not have any laws guaranteeing access to public information. It also
  does not have any data protection laws.128 The lack of a sufficient legal framework
  and legal protection will be a barrier that will need to be overcome with the
  implementation of a national ID system.

  INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES
  The SESN (Secrétariat d’État de la Solidarité Nationale) is in charge of social
  protection in Djibouti and therefore in charge of the Social Register program. The
  SESN has 8 local enrollment centers with 2 stations per location, and one SESN
  Central Facility that houses the database and information systems. However, the
  program may be moved under the Population Directorate of the Ministry of Interior
  in the future.129

IDENTIFICATION PROCESSES
Identity Registration System

To enroll individuals in the Identity Registration System, people are invited to visit
an enrollment station at a community office. Biometric and biographic data is
collected and de-duplicated using an Automated Biometric Identification System
(ABIS).

Social Register

For the Social Register program, households can be registered at community
offices or from a house-to-house social survey via Open Data Kit on an Android
tablet. A door-to-door campaign is conducted to find target households and
individuals, the electronic survey is conducted, then the information is uploaded
into the SR Management Information System (MIS). If any updates are necessary,
the community office accesses the data portal and changes are recorded in the
web application. 130

The data is aggregated and each household’s poverty status is determined based
on surveys and socio-economic data. Households are assigned a poverty score
and assessed against other factors to determine eligibility for the program. To
determine household scores, each person in the household is assigned a UID.
Then, each UID is linked to the proper household through data manipulation and
management modules. The system configuration, including the ABIS for the IRS
and MIS for the SR are thought to be transferrable to a new national ID system in
the future. 131

Refugee Registration

Djibouti has experienced significant movement across its borders in recent years.
Djiboutian people move away from the unfavorable conditions such as drought
and instability, while refugees from other countries, mainly Somalia, seek asylum in
Djibouti. The influx of refugees poses a new registration problem. UNHCR is taking
active measures in Djibouti to screen and register its refugees, even issuing identity
cards to adults132. Identification helps refugees to access basic services in refugee
camps, including being able to identify themselves in front of police to resist arrest

  and theoretically to obtain employment.133

  CURRENT CHALLENGES
  Djibouti has made headway with the Social Register, but still faces a number of
  challenges in developing a national ID system:

  §§ Djibouti’s large poor population is a major barrier to identification, as it currently
     costs $11 to get an ID134
  §§ Names in Djibouti are very similar, leading to authentication and de-duplication
     challenges135
  §§ For house-to-house enrollment, there is oftentimes no internet in rural areas
     and data must be collected offline, leading to possible data loss136
  §§ Currently the Identity Registration System is only open to a subset of the popu-
     lation – individuals must be invited to go to enrollment centers and register137
  §§ Enrollment could be more accessible – there exist only 8 enrollment centers
     across all of Djibouti
  §§ Djibouti has a large nomad population which nullifies house-to-house registra-
     tion138
  §§ The Djibouti government still faces an ongoing problem with registering ref-
     ugees – the UNHCR is largely spearheading the registration of the refugee
     population139
  §§ Djibouti does not have the foundational laws in place to implement a national
     ID system
  §§ Djibouti does not have a law to guarantee access to public information which
     leads to numerous conflicts with the media140
  §§ There are no data protection or privacy laws141

MATURITY ASSESSMENT
Categorization: Greenfield

REGISTRY ASSESSMENT
Laos does not currently have accurate data on births, deaths, and vitals events
because it does not possess a centralized electronic civil registration and vital
statistics (CRVS) system, but announced at the Ministerial Conference on CRVS
in 2013 that it will be taking urgent measures to register vital events. The Laos
government is seeking assistance internally as well as development agencies like
the World Bank to provide support in finalizing and executing on a strategic plan to
implement a national civil registration system. The current registry assessment has
been completed and a high-level strategic plan drafted – now Laos is looking for
guidance to make the plan more detailed, effective, and actionable.

Other projects currently underway in Laos, such as the Lao PDR Health
Governance and Nutrition Development Project, rely on a functioning birth registry
and are therefore interested in the successful implementation of such a program.
Additionally, The Family Management and Grass Roots Development Department
of the MPS is in the midst of implementing an Electronic Identification Card (e-ID)
program, which would also benefit from a functioning CRVS system. An ideal plan
will effectively link the e-ID program with the new CRVS system.

Detailed aspects of the target CRVS system, such as what data will be captured
or how the system will integrate with public and private services, have not yet been
determined.142

  LEGAL FRAMEWORK143
  It is still unknown if Laos has the necessary laws in place to implement a new civil
  registration system. The Laos Ministry of Justice has requested assistance from
  the World Bank in assessing whether its existing laws are adequate, by way of
  benchmarking Laos laws against other country’s data privacy laws.

  Laos has three main laws pertaining to registration that are laid out in the table
  below. These laws establish citizen’s basic rights and requirements for registering
  vital events. The statistics law establishes standards for reporting such events.




  143	 (World Bank, 2015)



166
Laos does not have any data protection or privacy laws in place, which is a potential
inhibitor to implementing a highly integrated CRVS system.

If new laws are required, the Ministry responsible for enacting them has not yet been
determined. The key activities of passing legislation and enforcing the subsequent
laws falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), Ministry of Home
Affairs (MOHA) and Ministry of Public Security (MPS). If new laws and process are
implemented, clear roles and responsibilities will have to be established for each
of the stated Ministries to avoid duplication of work and ensure a smooth civil
registration process.

Legal/Policy Instrument             Year      Description
Family Law                          1990      The People’s Supreme Assembly of Lao PDR passed this
No 07/90/SPA                                  law on the subject of workers with family responsibilities.
                                              The law “provides equal rights for men and women under
                                              family law”a. Establishes stipulations of first name, last

  INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES
  The Laos Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) is currently in charge of carrying out
  family registration centrally144, while district heads are responsible for enforcing the
  law in individual districts. MOHA has been assigned the task of developing a civil
  registration system database in the near future. MOHA is currently in the process
  of writing a strategic plan outlining how the CRVS system will be implemented and
  specifying which digital architecture that will be necessary for successful execution,
  although the plan is very high-level right now.145

  Other governing bodies supporting the CRVS implementation are the Ministry
  of Health (MOH), Ministry of Justice (MOJ), Ministry of Public Security
  (MPS), Ministry of Planning and Investment, Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
  Vientiane Provincial Health Office, and Vientiane Provincial Hospital.146
  MPS is responsible for issuing the family books and MOH is responsible for issuing
  birth notification.147 Other development agencies involved in the effort are WHO,
  UNICEF, Plan International and the Government of Korea.

  The Ministry of Public Security registers births and deaths in the main record
  system and is also in charge of implementing Laos’ Electronic Identification card
  (e-ID).

  In general, the roles and responsibilities of the ministries involved are not clearly
  delineated, which leads to duplicative efforts and coordination challenges. For
  example, MOHA was split off of the MPS in 2011 and work is often shared and not
  clearly separated. Determining which ministries are in charge of which activities will
  be necessary for a successful implementation and ongoing operation of integrated
  CRVS and e-ID systems.

  IDENTIFICATION PROCESSES
  Birth Registration148

  The Ministry of Public Security (MPS) is in charge of registering births in their
  district’s main record system. The registration process differs based on the child’s
  birth location. For institutional births, parents are given a notification form which




  144	 (UN Statistics)
  145	 (World Bank, 2015)

  147	 (UNstats)
  148	 (World Bank, 2015)



168
they must then take to their Village Chief for recording in the ‘Village Family Book’.
Parents will also record an institutional birth in their own ‘Family Book’. Both types
of family books serve as legal instruments. For parents to obtain a birth certificate
for a home birth, they must first visit a district MOHA office to obtain a birth
certificate application. The application requires three witness’ signature and also
must be sent to the Village Chief for recording in the ‘Village Family Book’ and for
official certification. Once all of the signatures are obtained, the form is sent back
to the MOHA office where the birth is registered in the main record system of the
district and a birth certificate is issued. Birth information is captured in individual
Family Books and data from various books is not aggregated in a central place.

Death Registration149

The death registration process for institutional and non-institutional deaths is
similar to the birth registration process outlined above. Deaths must be submitted
to the Village Chief in order for a death certificate to be issued. 150 Cause of death
is a field on the death certificate, though the field is often inaccurate and non-
standardized. Laos is currently implementing a system to record cause of death in
institutions using standard language and coding, in an effort to increase coverage
and registration of medically-certified deaths.

All in all, the registration process is not well understood and also fairly inaccessible to
the population. Higher registration rates are associated with higher income, urban
villages, and 80% or more of the Laotian population lives in poor, rural areas. Laos’
small population, underdeveloped modes of transportation, the inaccessibility of
registration services, and lack of understanding of its necessity leads to very low
registration rates, some of the lowest in Southeast Asia.151

CURRENT CHALLENGES
Laos faces a large number of challenges in implementing comprehensive
identification programs. Existing registries have low utilization, are inaccurate, or
do not exist. In order to move forward with registering vital events, Laos will have to
confront the current challenges it faces with the system. These challenges include
the following:

§§ Laos does not have a clear plan for moving forward to implement a new CRVS
   system – the strategic plan drafted by MOHA is not comprehensive or sub-

  §§ The digital architecture and system requirements for a new CRVS database

  §§ Ministries are not clear on roles and responsibilities, with unclear ownership
     and occasional duplication of efforts. The lack of organization only be exasper-
     ated by the rollout of a new program152
  §§ The overall registration process is not well understood by the population153
  §§ Lack of clear procedures for birth registrations
  §§ Vital event registration is not very accessible. Registration is often restrained to
     urban centers, while 80% of Laos’ population lives in rural areas and modes of
     transportation / roads are not reliable.
  §§ Death registration is low and has historically not been well documented154.
     Cause of death is often inaccurate and non-standardized, which yields inexact
     mortality statistics and makes diseases and other health concerns hard to
     track
  §§ It is unclear if Laos’ existing laws pertaining to registration and citizen’s access
     to information are adequate, or if they need to be amended in the context of a
     new electronic CRVS system
  §§ No data protection laws are currently in place to protect citizen’s private data

REGISTRY ASSESSMENT
India has established a comprehensive identification system, with two foundational
systems as its backbone: the National Population Register (NPR) and the National
ID system (i.e. Aadhaar). It has linked the Aadhaar foundational registry with a
variety of social and financial applications via the UID Architecture (shown in
Figure 19: India’s UID Architecture). The data contained in the NPR is meant
to be a registry of residents that includes biographic data, biometric data, and the
UID Number once de-duplicated against the UID system. Meanwhile, the Unique
ID (UID) Number (or 12-digit Aadhaar number) is the primary form of identification
used to authenticate to services from food subsidies to rural employment schemes.
The NPR is considering the issuance of a Resident Identity Card, a smart card
containing the UID number for those over 18 years of age.

The uptake of the foundational system in a matter of 5 years is substantial (69%
coverage in UID, or 863M enrolled), making it the largest biometric system in the
world. The level of integration with other public and private e-services is currently
limited, and expected to increase as the UID platform is an open API allowing any
agency to build an application to integrate with the identity system.

LEGAL FRAMEWORK
India’s data protection laws were recently established (2008) and are just the first
step in establishing a robust legal framework for data privacy.

UIDAI is operating under an executive order issued on January 28, 2009 given
the National Identification Authority of India (NIAI) has not yet passed. There has
been a turf war between India’s UID and NPR programs due to the lack of clear
jurisdiction for these initiatives.

INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES
Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)

UIDAI is a Cabinet Committee that was constituted on October 22, 2009 to oversee
the objectives of the UID program. Headed by the Prime Minister, it consists of



                                                                                                            173
  ministers from across the government to handle all functions relating to UIDAI
  including organization, planning, policies, funding, etc.

  Ministry of Home Affairs

  The Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner within the Ministry
  of Home Affairs is responsible for conducting the census every 10 years. This
  organization was also responsible for creating statistics on population statistics
  including Vital Statistics and Census. This is the same organization that also
  responsible for the registration of births and deaths.

  IDENTIFICATION PROCESSES
  Birth Registration

  The child’s birth is registered with the concerned local authorities (and varies
  by state) within 21 days of its occurrence by filling out the form required by the
  Registrar. A birth certificate is then issue after verification with the actual records of
  the concerned hospital. If a birth is not registered within 21 days, a birth certificate
  is issued once police have verified the details.



  Update National Population Register

  Data is collected for the National Population Register in a two-phased approach155:

  Phase 1: biographic collection:

  §§ via a Population Register employee that visits each household in the country
     and canvasses a questionnaire
  §§ if citizen misses the initial visit, they are required to provide required information
     at designated NPR Centers
  Phase 2: biometric collection:

  §§ citizen goes to the local camps setup by Population Register employees to
     collect biometrics (fingerprints, face, irises)
  §§ if citizen misses the camps, they are required to provide required information
     at designated NPR Centers
  Once data is collected, the data is printed and displayed in the local area for



  155	 (Estonia, 2015)



174
review by the public at large and scrutinized by local officials. Local government
officials deal with claims and objections by way of a grievance/redress mechanism.
Once all claims have been deal with and corrected, the local officials digitally sign
the data which is then sent to the highly secure Central database for permanent
storage. A mechanism to update data in the registry is not currently in place, but is
being formulated. Resident Identity Cards are being issued to residents of coastal
villages, and being considered for all residents over the age of 18.

UID Number156

The resident goes to the local Registrar’s office to provide the following basic
information (along with proof of identity and proof of address):

§§ Name
§§ DOB
§§ Gender
§§ Father’s/Husband’s/Guardian’s name and UID number (optional for adult
   residents)
§§ Mother’s/Wife’s/Guardian’s name and UID number (optional for adult residents)
§§ Introducer’s name and UID number (when resident lacks documentation)
§§ Address
§§ 10 fingerprints, photograph, and both iris scans

The Registrar sends the applicant’s data to the central ID repository for de-
duplication. If the resident data is unique, a Unique ID (UID) Number will be
generated and the number (printed on laminated paper) is mailed to the resident.
Optionally, the resident can look up their UID Number using the enrollment number
provided by the Registrar at the time of enrollment. This UID Number can then be
used to assert identity and claim benefits/services at public and private institutions
that have established themselves as authentication user agency.

CURRENT CHALLENGES
India has leapfrogged its previously weak identity infrastructure to a robust identity
platform for authentication, but there are some challenges:

§§ The lack of a comprehensive legal framework continues to impact the UID




156	 (Police and Border Guard Board, 2015)



                                                                                     175
      program as legislation supporting UIDAI has not yet passed in Parliament,
      though enrollments continue. Governments should set national ID programs
      up in a way that works across all government agencies from a budgetary and
      legal authority standpoint. Also clarifying the role of enrollment agencies from
      that of authentication agencies, and having a legal framework for data sharing
      (to law enforcement or other organizations).
      •	   There were conflicts between NPR and UID since both programs collect
           biometrics, but they are currently operating separately – NPR is considered
           relevant as a registry for national security, and UID for issuing a number
           that can be used to authenticate residents for benefits/services.
  §§ The UID System enrolls children starting at the age of 5 (due to the instability
     of biometrics in children), and requires their biometrics to be updated every 5
     years until the age of 18. Birth registrations are not captured in the UID System,
     but are vital events that must be logged properly in the National Population
     Register.
  §§ Continued integration of India’s social programs to the UID system, including
     ePassports and the Voting system, will allow it to mature its identity ecosystem.
