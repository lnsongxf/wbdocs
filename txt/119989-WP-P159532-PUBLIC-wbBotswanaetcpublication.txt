       Box 1. The Joint Preparation of this Report
       This report was prepared under the guidance of a regional advisory group of government officials from the
       Ministries of Education and examination bodies in Botswana, Lesotho, and Zambia. The World Bank team is
       grateful for the guidance, data, case studies, analysis and recommendations of their national colleagues facilitat-
       ed through six meetings, as well as for the organization of school visits.

       The selection of Botswana, Lesotho, and Zambia for this joint study was based upon expressions of interest from
       the countries, the shared challenges of youth unemployment, on-going policy dialogues, and World Bank in-
       vestments in secondary education. As such, this report and associated discussions enhances the Bank’s financial
       support to the countries.

       The report draws on a series of World Bank reports on youth unemployment, demographics, employment and
       job diagnostics, as well as regional skills studies.

       This overview builds upon three detailed background studies. One cross-country report on instructional practices
       and curriculum by the New Jersey Center for Teaching and Learning (USA), and three country-case studies on the
       structure and assessment of secondary education in Botswana, Lesotho, and Zambia, respectively. In addition,
       a case-study on technical and vocational education and training (TVET) in Lesotho was carried out for exploring
       needed reforms in the provision of vocational skills to school leavers.

       Box 2. 
              Educational Systems
       When examined (see table below), there are some differences in the educational systems of the three countries
       that affect the quality of education and skills development. Some of which include:

       •	    Enrollment: There is a higher enrollment in primary education than in secondary schools across all three
             countries. With a lower population rate than the other two countries, Botswana, has a higher rate of enroll-
             ment in both primary and secondary education. With the higher population rate, the out-of-school children
             as a percentage of the school-age population in Zambia is at a high of 28% while in Botswana and Lesotho
             it is 7% and 14% respectively.

       •	    Transition: The transition rate from primary education to secondary education in Botswana is higher than the
             other 2 countries, with Zambia having fewer students transitioning to secondary education.

       •	    Learning outcomes: The SACMEQ mathematics scores, with a total of 700, shows that all three countries
             are above average with Botswana’s average score higher than those of Lesotho and Zambia. The stu-
             dent-to-teacher ratio is lower in Botswana, with fewer students to a teacher.

       Despite the differences, all three countries face the similar challenge of a steady bulging secondary school en-
       rollment and continued unemployment of secondary education graduates.

          Mega-Trends Changing Labor Market Demand and Hence “What

          Constitutes A Well-Prepared Graduate?”

   rapidly changing the demand for skills, and presenting both opportunities and challenges for skills development
   policies:

   i.	   Population shifts. First, the region’s potential demographic dividend engendered by lower fertility rates
         will leave more resources to invest in early childhood development and education. If increased resources
         are successfully invested, younger and larger cohorts of skilled workers will rapidly increase the share of
         skilled workers. However, larger cohorts of students will require increased funding for the expansion of the
         education system. The second significant population is occurring through urbanization. More urban youth
         can facilitate a better match between workers and jobs as well as agglomeration effects, but also eliminates
         agriculture as a default source of employment. Rapid urbanization increases risks associated with urban un-
         employment and political unrest.
   ii.	 New technologies such as digitalization and broader technological and organizational change can increase
                                                                                                  skill occupations and
         the risk of “jobs polarization” in the form of faster rising employment in high-­and low-­
                                         skilled occupations. In this context, returns to investment in ICT and critical

   iii.	 The integration of Africa into shifting global value chains. Production in both manufacturing and services
         takes place in interlocked global value chains. This is likely to increase the demand for skills, but also require
         closer coordination between education institutions and firms. It may also create mismatches in the supply
         of, and demand for skills as Africa increasingly integrates and African firms tap into newly developed higher
               added and export-­
         value-­                intensive activities.

       Box 4. What are 21st Century Skills? Key Concepts
       This report analyzes education and skills using the skills categorization called 21st century skills. Specifically, these
       skills can be defined as transferable, core skill groups that represent essential functional and enabling knowledge,
       skills, and attitudes that are required in the 21st century workplace: The nine 21st century skills categories are:

       Foundational academic competencies. These skills are learning outcomes traditionally associated with basic
       education:

       •	    Graduates read and write at a level required for the workplace or postsecondary education.
       •	    Graduates listen and speak (communicate) in a way that allows for continual learning, evaluation and ef-
             fective verbal communication in a variety of media.
       •	    Graduates perform basic mathematical computations and choose appropriate mathematical techniques
             to solve practical problems.

       Thinking skills. These are cognitive skills and learning outcomes related to Bloom’s taxonomy of cognitive learn-
       ing domains discussed in education literature and is correlated with IQ) Bloom 1956):

       •	    Graduates solve problems by recognizing them, using reasoning, and devising and implementing logical
             plans.
       •	    Graduates will learn effectively.
       •	    Graduates use technology effectively by selecting, applying, and troubleshooting technology.
       •	    Graduates will think creatively and take initiative and demonstrate entrepreneurial skills.

                      emotional skills (personality traits). These includes skills often referred to as attitudes or gener-
       Personal socio-­
       ic employability skills or soft skills and are closely related to the ‘Big Five’ personality traits outlined in psychology
       literature {Heckman and Krautz 2015):

       •	                                    management, including accurate self-­
             Graduates will demonstrate self-­                                   assessments, responsibility, perse-
             verance, goal setting, and will display integrity and honesty.
       •	    Graduates will work well in teams, including with men and women from diverse backgrounds and will show
             sociability and empathy.

       In addition to these 21st century skills, this report refers to technical (vocational) skills as those abilities needed
       to carry out one’s job, such as a plumber’s ability to repair a water leak, or a worker’s ability to operate a machine
       in a factory.

       The above competencies are core of many curriculum standards (such as the International Baccalaureate and
       the US Common Core standards), education evaluations, such as PISA by OECD, and economic reports from the
       World Bank.

     To understand status across the three countries over a short period, instructional rounds were adopted. The
     approach enables a comparison of instructional practices across classrooms. The instructional rounds process

     Box 6. Shanghai Key Success Factors
     The results of the last international PISA tests indicate that Shanghai is one of the top performing education
     systems in the world. The key educational factors underlying its success are: (i) teaching and learning philosophy;
     (ii) teachers’ subject knowledge; (iii) curricular organization; (iv) textbooks, teacher guides, and practice books;
     (v) pedagogical practices; and (vi) teacher policies including teaching and group research.

     The pedagogy in Shanghai is based on: (i) structured lesson plans: a review of previous lesson, the introduction
     of new knowledge points, modelling of problems, student practice, and homework; (ii) multiple approaches for
     analyzing and teaching each knowledge point; (iii) practice and drill to memorize basics; (iv) taking small steps to
     solve a complex problem; (v) ongoing classroom assessment; and (vi) homework and involving parents.

     With regards to classroom interactions:

     •	    Teachers are encouraged to: (i) ask questions, elicit and listen to answers, (ii) use discovery strategies, and
           (iii) provide interpretation and feedback.
     •	    Students are discouraged from: (i) being left to explore entirely on their own, and (ii) being passive in the
           learning environment. Good practices include: answering questions in class, exploring, and actively collab-
           orating with peers.

   Box 8. Curriculum and Assessment
   A review of all available curricula and assessment materials in Botswana, Lesotho and Zambia was undertaken.
   The stated learning objectives of secondary education curricula and the skills to be assessed were compared
   against the list of 21st century skills. A qualitative evaluation of whether the development of 21st century skills
   was included as a learning objective was included in the review of curricula. A similar qualitative evaluation was
   applied to assessment packages to assess the extent to which the assessments evaluated a student’s demonstra-
   tion of 21st century skills.

   The Scores range from a 1 (not evident) to 4 (extremely evident) for each skill.

   PBL projects require students to apply knowledge to address authentic problems, work productively with other
   people, learn about new topics independently, communicate effectively in written, oral, and visual forms, and
   deliver meaningful results.

   The essential elements of PBL are:

   •	   Key Knowledge, Understanding, and Skills—knowing what you want students to acquire;
   •	   Challenging Problem or Question—the core of the project: engage without intimidation (creates a real need
        to know something);
   •	   Sustained Inquiry—An extended process of asking questions, finding resources, and applying information;
   •	                     world context, tasks and tools, quality standards, or impact;

   •	   Student Voice & Choice—Students make decisions, including how they work and what they create;
   •	   Reflection—Students reflect on learning, the effectiveness of their inquiry, the quality of their work, and
        obstacles;
   •	   Critique & Revision—Students receive and use feedback to improve their process and products (formative
        evaluation); and

   The failure of a one-­         all approach to secondary education equally applies to gender. There are at least two
                             fits-­
   outcomes where there are important gender differences:

   i.	                  represented in secondary education in Botswana and Lesotho. In Botswana and Lesotho in

         2015, girls’ enrollment in secondary education exceeded enrollment of boys by eight and 15 percent, respec-
         tively. In Zambia, girls’ enrollment is 5 percent lower than that of boys, but the gap is closing. As in the rest of
         the world, the number of girls in secondary education in Zambia is also likely to exceed that of boys in due
         time. Interviews with teachers and head teachers in the three countries suggest that the instruction methods
         and school culture do not allow for inclusion of boys with lots of energy. Therefore, some boys disconnect
         in class, can become distractions for others’ learning, learn little, stay away, and do not complete primary or
         secondary school.
   ii.	 Girls are more likely to drop out more than boys due to early marriage and teen pregnancies. In Zambia in
         2015, girls’ dropout rate for secondary education was almost four times higher than boys. The main reason
         is early marriage and teen pregnancy. In Botswana in 2012, a girl was 40 percent more likely to drop out. The

     Box 12. Lesotho TVET Key Issues
     TVET institutions: there are 93 Secondary Technical schools which offer basic education in, among others, Metal
     and Woodwork, Home Economics, and Agriculture; 17 Skills Training Centres which offer Lower Basic Education to
     disadvantaged groups such as retrenched mineworkers and school leavers; as well as 29 Vocational and Technical
                                            secondary school leavers, five of which offer mostly post-Cambridge Overseas
     Institutes aimed at junior-­and senior-­
                                                                                                          7 and post-ju-
     Schooling Certificate programs, with some junior secondary courses, while others offer post standard-­
     nior secondary courses. These institutions are owned by multiple stakeholders: 46 percent by private providers, 24
     percent by community and 22 percent by churches, and eight percent by the government. The total enrollment at
     registered TVET institutions was 4,223 students in 2014 with predominance of female (54 percent). TVET institutions
     are present only in seven districts but most of students are in Maseru (45 percent), Leribe (20 percent), and Mohale’s
     Hoek (18 percent). There are 49 TVET programs across these institutions. The largest is for carpentry and joinery at
     18.9 percent, followed by Bricklaying and Plastering at 15 percent and then Sewing and Tailoring at 13.2 percent.

     Key challenges: (i) the mismatch between the skills demands of the Lesotho economy and the skills being pro-
     duced by the TVET system is exacerbated by the absence of a structured participation of other government min-
     istries and the private sector in the planning and governance of TVET. In addition, very limited data availability
     on key aspects makes deeper analysis and planning difficult. It is not possible to determine quantitatively specific
     skill demands per industry sector, disaggregated into job types for example; (ii) the demand for student places
     significantly exceeds institutional capacity and the National Qualification Framework remains a work in progress
     and does not yet provide meaningful learning pathways for TVET, (iii) the TVET systemic management structure
                                 resourced and is responsible for several functions making governance and oversight
     assured by the TVD is under-­
     of the TVET sector compromised; (iv) total government funding for TVET is fragmented across multiple Ministries,
     with no structured mechanisms in place to coordinate or prioritize spending, and is too low to achieve desired
     outcomes. In addition, TVET institutions are underfunded to deliver skilled graduates.
