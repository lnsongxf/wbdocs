  Abstract
  Gender-based wage discrimination is a highly researched                           proficiency and complexity of on-the-job computer tasks
  area of labor economics. However, most studies on this                            to proxy cognitive skills, and personality and behavioral
  topic have focused on schooling and paid limited atten-                           measures to proxy for noncognitive skills in wage decom-

I.           Introduction

             Women’s participation in the labor force has increased significantly throughout the world
over the past 25 years (Duflo, 2012). Despite this, research shows that systematic gender gaps
in wages and productivity persist across both developed and developing countries (Blau and
Kahn, 2000; Jarrell and Stanley, 2003; Terrell, 1992). Ensuring parity in male-female labor
outcomes is not only a matter of equity but also one of smart economics and efficiency (Doepke,
Tertilt, and Voena, 2014; Duflo, 2012). The 2012 World Development Report, Gender Equality
and Development, notes that eliminating gender discrimination against female workers could
increase productivity by 25 to 40 percent (World Bank, 2012). Moreover, removing barriers faced
by women in the labor market has implications for the next generation as well as for the inclusivity
and representativeness of institutions and development policies (Hallward-Dreimeier and Gajigo,
2013).

             Gender wage discrimination is a well-researched area and one that has been examined
using a variety of estimation techniques. Previous studies on this topic have used various worker
characteristics such as age, experience, education, occupation, and industry of employment in
predicting male-female wages. 4 However, while recent research in labor economics has
documented the critical role of skills, broadly defined, in predicting key life outcomes, including
the associations between skills and earnings (Hanushek et al., 2013; Heckman and Kautz, 2011),
the mechanisms through which cognitive and noncognitive skills are related to wages have
received limited attention,5 and most of the research has been conducted in countries belonging
to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Further, few studies
have applied these skills measures to examine earnings differences between men and women.

             This study aims to conduct a comparative analysis across seven low- and middle-income
countries, examining the gender wage gap in these countries using data from the STEP Skills
Measurement surveys. It is the first study to use measures of cognitive and noncognitive skills in
wage decomposition analysis in this set of countries. The multi-dimensional conceptualization of
skills in the STEP survey data offers a broader definition of human capital and thereby allows us
to explore the potential role of other dimensions of human capital in understanding the gender
wage gap.


																																																								
4 Additionally, the structure of the labor market and women’s legal (property) rights have also been examined in

gender wage discrimination research (Blau and Kahn, 2003; Doepke, Tertilt, and Voena, 2011).
5 Mueller and Plug (2006) hypothesize that personality can either directly (through productivity differences) or

indirectly (through occupational segregation) affect gender differences in earnings. Further, personality differences
can also affect occupational choices and thus lead to differences in wages.


                                                                                                                        4
                                                 	

       It is known that occupational segregation can cause wage gaps, but the determinants of
occupational segregation are not well established (Cobb-Clark and Tan, 2009). Using
noncognitive and cognitive skills in gender decomposition analysis could potentially provide
information on whether these skills measures are related to how women sort into different
occupations. For example, it could be hypothesized that women with certain personality traits are
more likely to opt to enter (and succeed in) male-dominated occupations than women with a
different personality makeup. Overall, findings from this study can provide new insights for
gender-focused development and economic policies.

       Using schooling and skills measures in wage decompositions across seven countries, the
study finds that years of completed education explain the bulk of the gender gap in wages.
Cognitive and noncognitive skills differentially affect men’s and women’s earnings, and the effect
of these skills varies along the wage distribution. These findings are not consistent across all of
the countries examined, however, highlighting the need for context-specific studies to further
explore correlates of wages among men and women in these environments.

       The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section II provides a brief review of the
literature on gender wage gaps, highlighting work using skills measures beyond schooling. In
Section III, we discuss the methods used, and follow with a description of the data in Section IV.
Results are presented in Section V, and Section VI provides conclusions.

II.    Literature Review

       The human capital theory and the theory of competitive labor markets predict that workers
with the same productive characteristics and skills (or endowments) will be paid the same wage
(Becker, 1975; Schultz, 1991). However, often workers who have the same education, training,
and experience but who belong to different groups may receive substantially different wages.
These differences in wages (generally thought of as discrimination) are explained by the theory
of labor market discrimination. The topic of gender wage discrimination is among the most
researched in labor economics. In this section we discuss selected findings from this extensive
literature on gender wage gaps, highlighting those studies carried out in low- and middle-income
countries – with a focus on evidence from the countries included in this paper—and using
measures of skills beyond educational attainment alone.

       While most of the research on this topic comes from the OECD countries, several studies
have focused on countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, as well as transitional economies in
Eastern Europe. Among these studies, Liu (2004), Pham and Reilly (2007), and Pierre (2012)



                                                                                                 5
                                                 	

examined gender wage gaps in Vietnam between 1993 and 2009, Ganguli and Terrell (2005)
used data from Ukraine to examine the earnings differentials between men and women during
the 1986 to 2003 period, and Badel and Peña (2010) used survey data from 2006 to estimate
gender wage differences in Colombia. All of these studies find that women’s earnings are
significantly lower than those of men, men earning up to 30 percent more than women in these
countries. The authors note that education and experience account for a small proportion of the
estimated wage gap, and that the bulk of the gap is attributed to differential returns to education
and skills for men and women. Three of these studies use quantile regression-based
decomposition methods, allowing researchers to examine wage differentials at different points of
the wage distribution. In the case of Colombia, Badel and Peña (2010) found that women at the
top and bottom of the wage distribution are those primarily affected by differences in returns to
endowments or skills. For Ukraine, the gaps are widest at the top end of the wage distribution,
while the opposite is true in Vietnam, where the wage gaps decrease as one moves along the
distribution from bottom to top.

       A limited set of studies on gender wage discrimination examines the contribution of
cognitive and noncognitive skills in explaining the gender wage gap (Fortin, 2008; Mueller and
Plug, 2006; Nordman, Sarr, and Sharma, 2014; Nyhus and Pons, 2012; Sakellariou, 2012; and
Semykina and Linz, 2007). Most of these studies are based on data from OECD countries. To our
knowledge, Nordman, Sarr, and Sharma (2014) present the only available evidence for
developing countries. They used matched employer-employee data from Bangladesh to examine
discrimination in male-female wages, and found that, when controlling for educational attainment,
the mean wage gap is about 8 percent. The mean wage gap reduces marginally when cognitive
and noncognitive skills are added to the model. Examining the wage gaps at different points of
the wage distribution, they found that the gap in Bangladesh is wider at the bottom end of the
distribution and that cognitive and noncognitive skills explain about 88 percent of the gap at the
upper end of the wage distribution and about 69 percent at the bottom of the distribution.

       Mueller and Plug (2006) and Fortin (2008) provide evidence for the United States. Mueller
and Plug used data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, and although they found significantly
strong associations between their measure of cognitive skills (IQ) and earnings (especially for
men), they found no gender differences in responses to cognitive skills. For noncognitive skills,
they report that about 3 percent of the gender gap is explained by differences in, and returns to,
personality traits. Fortin’s study examined the effect of noncognitive skills—self-esteem, locus of
control, the importance of money/work, and the importance of people/family—using data from two



                                                                                                 6
                                                   	

longitudinal surveys in the United States. Her results indicate that differences in these
noncognitive traits explain about 8 percent of the wage gap. Similar results have been reported
for the Netherlands, where adding the factor of personality was found to reduce the gender wage
gap from 75 percent to 63 percent (Nyhus and Pons, 2012); and for Russia, where the authors
found that the noncognitive skills used (locus of control and challenge-affiliation) explain about 8
percent of the gender wage gap (Semykina and Linz, 2007). Sakellariou (2012) used data from
the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) for Norway, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, and the
Czech Republic to examine whether cognitive skills matter in gender wage decomposition
analysis. His results indicate that using the IALS score underestimates the effect of cognitive skills
on earnings, but when cognitive skills are specified in terms of origin (i.e., acquired at school or
outside of school), the size of the unexplained component changes substantially in Finland,
Hungary, and the Czech Republic, with differing patterns in the different countries.

III.     Methodological Approach

         As a first step toward decomposing earnings differentials, we express earnings as a
function of observed characteristics. In our first set of empirical examinations, we use the
approach popularized by Mincer (1974); the standard wage function includes experience and
schooling. We add a dummy variable for type of employment to this standard formulation in order
to control for differences among workers:
                                                                             (1)

         In the equation above,     indicates (log) hourly earnings and Observed Characteristics
represents a vector of variables that includes years of potential experience calculated as (Age –
Years of education – 6), completed years of education, and a dummy variable for self-employed
workers (wage workers serve as the reference group). The above equation can be estimated
separately for men and women to get estimates of returns to schooling for men and women,
respectively.

       We add skills measures to the model above to estimate the association between skills and
earnings, controlling for completed years of education. The resultant model is expressed as
follows:
                                                            	    ,           (2)

where Skills represents scores on each of the selected personality traits that are used to estimate
noncognitive skills’ associations with earnings. The standardized score on the reading proficiency
assessment is then added to estimate the association between cognitive skills and earnings,



                                                                                                    7
                                                  	

controlling for schooling and noncognitive skills. Finally, binary variables indicating complexity of
computer use are added to the model to estimate the relationship between cognitive skills, as
measured by computer skills, and earnings, controlling for schooling, noncognitive skills and
cognitive skills measured by reading proficiency scores.

    Based on the approach popularized by Blinder (1973) and Oaxaca (1973), the mean earnings
differential between men and women is then decomposed as shown below. Here, men are treated
as the reference group (i.e., we assume that in the absence of discrimination, the male earnings
structure would be observed). The decomposition equation is thus written as:

                                                                                                     .
                                                                                  (3)
    The mean earnings differential between men and women is expressed as a function of the
average observed characteristics of men and women (X) and the average skills of men and
women. The last two terms on the right-hand side provide a measure of the gender earnings gap
due to differences in returns to observed characteristics and skills.

    In order to get around problems incurred from the choice of reference group (or non-
discriminatory wage structure), we follow a variant of the Blinder-Oaxaca method—the general
                                                                              ∗         ∗
decomposition method from Neumark (1988). In the equation below,	                 and       are estimated
using the weighted average of the wage structures of men and women (from a pooled sample of
men and women) and represent the returns to observed characteristics and skills under no
discrimination. The unexplained component of the gender earnings differential is given by the
terms in the box brackets.
                                ∗                        ∗                ∗                   ∗


                         ∗                   ∗
       	                                                                          (4)


    In our second set of empirical examinations, we focus on the role of occupation. Here, in
addition to potential experience, type of employment and completed years of education,
occupation dummies are included in the vector of Observed Characteristics in equations (1) and
(2). Interaction terms between occupation and type of employment are also included. This
formulation is then followed as noted above, where the role of skills is examined, controlling for
characteristics, occupation, and schooling. Neumark’s (1988) method is used to decompose
earnings differentials between men and women.




                                                                                                         8
                                                                               	

             Based on findings from the literature on substantial differences in gender wage gaps along
the wage distribution, we also adopt a quantile decomposition framework. Quantile regression
provides a richer characterization of the data, allowing us to consider the impact of a covariate on
the entire distribution of hourly earnings, not merely its conditional mean, and thus provides a
deeper understanding of existing wage differentials. For decompositions based on quantile
regression methods, we use the method proposed by Machado and Mata (2005), whereby the
conditional earnings distribution6 is estimated using quantile regression separately for men and
women at specific quantiles. For each gender group, the quantile function is expressed using the
following linear specification:

                                                                   ,       ,           	       	 ∈ 0,1 ,

where, w denotes log earnings and the group subscript g includes both genders (m, f). X is a
vector of covariates (including observed characteristics and skills measures) for individual i and
    is a vector of coefficients estimated at different quantiles . The quantile regression coefficients
are interpreted as the returns to different observed characteristics and skills at specific quantiles
of the earnings distribution. It is assumed that all quantiles of w, conditional on X, are linear in X.

          Instead of using the simulation-based technique proposed by Machado and Mata (2005) to
estimate the unconditional earnings distribution function, we use the procedure from Melly (2006),
which is computationally less intense but is shown to be numerically identical when the number
of simulations goes to infinity. Melly’s procedure7 integrates the conditional distribution function
over a range of covariates, then inverts the unconditional distribution function to obtain
unconditional quantiles. The counterfactual for women using observed characteristics and the
skills profile of women and the male wage structure is expressed as:

                                                               ,       ′   ,       .
The decomposition of earnings gaps of the unconditional quantile functions between men and
women is then given by:

                                                           ,                               ,   ,
where the first term on the right-hand side represents the quantile endowment effects or the
effect of characteristics and skills, and the second term represents the effects of coefficients.

             The issue of self-selection or general endogeneity leading to biased results is a concern
in this and most decomposition analysis. Men and women could follow different decision-making

covariates X.

                                                                                                                            9
                                                                  	

patterns that inform their decisions whether to enter the labor market or to self-select into specific
occupations. Self-selection has been found to have a significant impact on wage estimates and
estimates of the pay gap (Belbo et al., 2003). Thus, we adopt Heckman’s (1979) method to correct
for selection bias. However, the selection correction method is used only in the case of the mean
decomposition analysis and not for the quantile decompositions discussed above. Selection
correction within decomposition techniques, in general, can be problematic and is more complex
in the context of quantile decompositions.8

             As a first step in applying the selection correction method proposed by Heckman, a probit
model predicting labor force participation is estimated:
                                                                            ∗
                                                             ;	       1         0.

In this equation,                  is a vector of instruments that includes number of children below age 6 in the
household and number of shocks experienced in childhood. The predicted probabilities from this
selection equation are then used to compute the selectivity term, which is added to the wage
equation as an additional explanatory variable.


IV.          Data

             The data for this study come from the STEP Skill Measurement surveys. These data were
collected in 2012 and 2013 in seven countries—Armenia, Bolivia, Colombia, Georgia, Kenya,
Ukraine, and Vietnam.9 The household survey gathers information from urban adults between the
ages of 15 and 64. The survey provides various measures of cognitive and noncognitive skills
that are the focus of this paper (see Pierre et al. (2014) for a detailed description of the skills
measures included in the STEP surveys). The STEP surveys provide a direct, objective measure
of reading proficiency skills,10 using an assessment scored on the same scale as the OECD’s
PIAAC (Program for International Assessment of Adult Competencies). The scores on this
assessment range from 0 to 500 and span six levels of proficiency.11

             In addition to the reading proficiency assessment, we use a self-reported measure of
complexity of computer use on the job as a second proxy for cognitive skills. Respondents report

																																																								
8 Sensitivity to the choice of estimator (Belbo et al., 2003) or use of a semi-parametric approach using power series
approximation for the selection term (Buchinsky, 1998) are some of the complexities encountered in correcting for
selection within decomposition analysis.
9 Surveys were also conducted in Ghana, Lao PDR, Macedonia, Sri Lanka, and the Yunnan Province of China. Data

for these countries do not meet the requirements for this paper, since the surveys did not include direct measurement
of reading proficiency skills.
10 STEP also provides indirect measures of reading, writing, and mathematics skills, which are not used in this paper.
11 Interpretation of score levels can be found in Pierre et al., 2014, p.83.




                                                                                                                   10
                                                           	

the frequency with which they use computers at work—never, a couple of times a week, or more
than three times per week—followed by a description of the computer-related tasks required in
their job. These computer tasks are used to define binary variables indicating different levels of
complexity of computer use on the job. Four levels of complexity have been defined: level 1
includes using browser-based tasks (for example, use of email and Internet); level 2 involves use
of basic Microsoft Office functions like the word processor, presentations, and graphics; level 3
involves use of basic programming tasks (involving spreadsheets and databases); and level 4
captures advanced programming tasks (for instance, designing websites, using computer-aided
software, programming software, and/or managing networks).

             Noncognitive skills measures in the STEP surveys come from self-reported responses to
various items measuring personality traits and behaviors. The personality traits include the Big
Five traits—openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and emotional stability
(which is the obverse of neuroticism)—grit, and behaviors such as decision-making. 12 Items
measuring these traits and behaviors are rated on a four-point Likert scale from “Almost never” to
“Almost always.”

             The STEP household surveys include extensive modules on education and employment
history that provide information on educational and labor market outcomes. Further, the
household roster of the survey gathers information on several individual and household
characteristics used in this study. These include information on the number of children in the
household, the marital status of the respondent, and retrospective information on the economic
status of the household when the respondent was 15 years of age. The Appendix includes
descriptive statistics on some of these key variables.

Analytic Sample

             To address the research questions posed in this study, the analytic sample for each
country was limited to wage workers and self-employed adults between ages 25 and 64 who were
in full-time employment. The self-employed group constitutes a large proportion of the sample in
the countries examined in this paper (see Table 1) and is included in the analytic sample to enable
policy-relevant inferences. The age range was selected to include adults mostly likely to have
completed their education and who were below retirement age. Those currently enrolled in an
educational or training program were excluded from the sample. Observations missing

																																																								
12 The STEP surveys also gather information on preferences through measures of risk preference and hostile

attribution bias. These are not used in the current analysis.


                                                                                                             11
                                                             	

information on the skills measures used in this study were also removed from the sample. In
keeping with standard practice, individuals reporting zero earnings were assigned a small value
of 0.0001 before this was transformed to the logarithmic scale.13 Finally, both individuals in the
top 1 percent of the earnings distribution and employers were excluded from the sample to avoid
potential outliers and to minimize bias due to measurement error in earnings. The total proportion
of missing data comprised less than 0.05 percent of the sample for each country. The resulting
sample size for each country includes between 480 and 1,400 men and women.

Descriptive Statistics

             We begin by comparing men and women, by country, on key variables of interest. As
mentioned before, the sample includes a substantial number of self-employed workers in full-time
employment. Table 1 shows that among men and women both, a larger proportion report being
employed in wage work than in self-employment. More women than men belong to the self-
employed group in Vietnam and Kenya. The opposite is true in Armenia and Ukraine, where a
larger proportion of men than women are self-employed.

             Average hourly earnings for men and women are presented in Table 2. There is
substantial variation in the earnings distributions across all countries, which is also evident in
graphs of the earnings distributions (see Figure A1 in the Appendix). The distributions for most
countries skew to the left, indicating that the average earnings in these countries are below the
median. Women, on average, earn less than their male counterparts across the board. This

difference in hourly earnings is statistically significant in six of the countries, with the exception of
Kenya, where the mean hourly wage for men is US$2.58 and for women is US$2.50 (2011 PPP-
adjusted US dollars). The small wage differences in Kenya have been documented by previous
research (Schultz, 1991) and are explained by the greater involvement of women in market
production. For countries other than Kenya, the raw (unadjusted) wage gap ranges from 22
percent in Vietnam to 39 percent in Armenia.14 In Kenya, where the difference in the average
wages of men and women is not significant, the wage gap is a modest 3 percent.

             We examine the unconditional wage gap at different percentiles of the distribution. These
are presented in Figures 1, 2, and 3. The distributions show substantial variation throughout the
wage distribution. Further, the pattern is not systematic across countries. In Bolivia and Kenya we
observe higher gaps at lower ends of the wage distribution, whereas in Armenia and Colombia
we find the biggest gaps at the top of the wage distribution, implying that women do well in the
labor market up to a point, beyond which their prospects and growth are limited (Albrecht,
Bjorklund, and Vroman, 2003). In Ukraine, the second and fourth quartiles of the wage distribution
show the biggest gaps. These patterns will be further explored in the decomposition analysis.




																																																								
14It must be noted that the observed wage gap is for the urban population only and could be an over- or
underestimate of the overall wage gap in the country.

       Gender differences in educational attainment and skills, our primary explanatory variables
for the gender wage gap, are presented in Tables 3 through 6. With regard to educational
attainment, we find that in countries other than those in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region
(namely, Armenia, Georgia, and Ukraine), women show lower educational attainment than men.
Although these differences are small in magnitude, they are statistically significant. These
differences in endowments are likely to translate into higher average wages among men.

       Cognitive skills, as measured by scores on the reading proficiency assessment, also show
that men, on average, have slightly higher scores than women (except in Georgia and Ukraine,

men and women are statistically significant across some of the countries except Ukraine,
Armenia, and Georgia. Research in psychology has also found that differences in cognitive
abilities between gender groups might not be statistically significant but might show statistically
significant differences in the case of groups defined by race or ethnicity (Hough and Oswald,
2000).

         As mentioned previously, we also use a second measure of cognitive skills: complexity of
computer use on the job. In Table 5, we present the proportion of men and women in the analytic
sample who use computers on the job. In most countries, less than half of men and women use
computers on the job. In Kenya, 22 percent of women and 28 percent of men reported using
computers. In Ukraine, Georgia, and Armenia, 41 percent of men reported using computers. In
Bolivia, the proportion of men using computers at work is slightly higher, at 43 percent, while in
Colombia and Vietnam it is under 40 percent. The highest proportion of women reporting using
computers on the job is in the ECA countries (55 percent in Georgia, 48 percent in Armenia, and
45 percent in Ukraine). The latter countries are also the ones where the proportion of women
using computers on the job is higher than the proportion of men doing so. The difference in the
proportions between men and women is not statistically significant in Armenia and Colombia.

       Looking at the distribution of men and women by the complexity of computer-related tasks
that they engage in on the job (see Table 6), we find that in Armenia, Colombia, Georgia, Ukraine,
and Vietnam, the largest proportions belong to the group using MS Office applications. The
associated tasks are word processing, making presentations, and using basic graphic
applications. In Bolivia and Kenya, the largest proportion of men and women are found using
advanced programming tasks on the job (22 percent of men and 16 percent of women in Bolivia,
and 14 percent of men and 8 percent of women in Kenya).

       With regard to noncognitive skills, we find limited variation among men and women across
average scores on the Big Five personality traits, grit, and decision-making. The average scores
and standard deviations are presented in Table 7. While there are some differences in average



                                                                                                   17
                                                 	

scores across countries, the differences between men and women within countries is small.
However, these seemingly small differences are statistically significant in several cases. For
instance, in the ECA countries, we find that men and women show significant differences with
regard to conscientiousness (women show higher average scores), extraversion (women score
higher), and emotional stability (women’s scores are higher in Armenia and Georgia but not in
Ukraine). Gender differences in emotional stability (or neuroticism) are observed across all seven
countries, with women showing higher emotional stability scores than men. Scores on decision-
making are significantly different in five of the seven countries (here again, women have higher
average scores), while gender differences in “openness to experience” are observed only in
Colombia, Kenya, and Vietnam, where men score higher than their female counterparts.

are slightly younger, except in Armenia and Georgia. With regard to the distribution of men and
women across three broad groups of occupations—high-skilled white-collar jobs, low-skilled
white-collar jobs, and blue-collar jobs—we find that a larger proportion of men than women report
working in blue-collar jobs. In Colombia and Ukraine, about 50 percent of the male sample is in
blue-collar occupations. The distribution of men and women in white-collar jobs varies by country.
In Armenia, Georgia, and Ukraine, a larger proportion of men and women are in high-skilled white-
collar occupations than in low-skilled white-collar occupations. In Colombia, Kenya, and Vietnam,
we find that a larger share of men and women are in low-skilled white-collar jobs than in high-
skilled white-collar jobs.


V.           Results

             We begin by reporting findings from the mean decomposition analysis for two sets of
equations: one set without controlling for occupation and the other with occupation controls
added. Assuming that there is occupational segregation in our sample of countries, the first
specification without occupational controls provides the “true” gender wage gap. When controlling
for occupation, we expect that occupation partially mediates the relationship between skills and
earnings. As mentioned above, we use the Heckman selection correction method for these mean
decompositions. Results are reported by country. Then, we discuss results from the quantile-
based decomposition analysis separately for each country in our sample.

Mean Decomposition Analysis with Selection Correction
             In order to decompose the wage gap between men and women into the part explained by
observed differences in characteristics and the returns to these characteristics, we begin with
mean decompositions using the pooled method from Neumark (1988) and Heckman’s selection
correction method. 15 The contributions to the gender wage gap of observed characteristics
(experience and type of employment) and schooling are estimated first. Building on this model,
we subsequently add skills measures in four separate steps. The results are reported in Table 8.
Panel A of Table 8 shows results when schooling is included in the model, controlling for potential
experience and type of employment. In Panel B we add noncognitive skills. Cognitive skills as
measured by reading proficiency scores and complexity of computer use on the job are added in

paper but are discussed in the Results section and are available upon request.

Note: The dependent variable is the log hourly earnings. Controls include potential experience, the
quadratic of experience, and type of employment. The sample includes 25- to 64-year-old women in self-
employment or wage work. Noncognitive skill scores and reading proficiency scores are standardized with
mean 0 and SD = 1. Binary variables indicate complexity of computer use at work where the reference
category is ‘No computer use on the job’. Highlighted cells indicate statistical significance at the 1% level

                                                                                                          22
                                                   	

       We find that with schooling, controlling for experience and type of employment, the
difference in male-female earnings tips in favor of males in Bolivia, Georgia, and Ukraine (the total
earnings difference ranges from 0.44 in Colombia to 0.99 in Georgia). Without selection
correction, however, we find wages favoring males across all countries with differences ranging
from 0.15 to 0.45. Differences in educational attainment between men and women explain about
13 percent of the earnings gap in Bolivia and a staggering 70 percent of the earnings differential
in Vietnam. In the ECA countries (Armenia, Georgia and Ukraine) we find that schooling does not
explain differentials in the wages of men and women. This follows from the high average
educational attainment among men and women in these countries (see Table 3).

       In Panel B, the addition of noncognitive skills scores increases the total difference in the
earnings of men and women in Bolivia and Georgia. Differences in men and women’s
noncognitive skills (emotional stability, specifically) accounts for an additional 3 percent of the
wage gap in Bolivia, controlling for schooling and other observed characteristics. The role of
noncognitive skills in Ukraine indicates that differences in personality traits (specifically,
extraversion, emotional stability, and conscientiousness) are associated with gender differences
in earnings. In Vietnam, noncognitive skills over-explain the wage gap, as seen in Panel A of
Table 8.

       The role of cognitive skills in explaining the gender wage gap, controlling for experience,
education, and personality, is examined using reading proficiency scores (Panel C, Table 8) and
computer use on the job (Panel D, Table 8). For reading proficiency scores we find that the wage
gap, although still favoring males, is slightly smaller in Bolivia. The differences in cognitive skill
endowments are significant in Bolivia, Vietnam, and Kenya but do not significantly explain the
gender wage gaps in these countries over and above schooling and noncognitive skills. In
contrast to these findings, Nordman et al. (2014) found that adding cognitive skills to the model
reduces the unexplained portion of the wage gap by 2 percent in Bangladesh. The measure of
cognitive skills used in their study is self-reported, and not a direct assessment of reading
proficiency skills like the one available in the STEP data.

       For our second measure of cognitive skills—complexity of computer use at work—we find
that the estimated wage gap shrinks significantly in Bolivia and Georgia but increases in Armenia
and Kenya when computer skills are added to the model. The addition of computer skills, along
with schooling, noncognitive skills, and reading proficiency scores, explains an additional 3
percent of the unexplained wage gap in Bolivia but shows no effect in other countries.

             At each stage of the estimation we find substantial differences in the gender wage gap
when comparing estimates corrected for selection bias with uncorrected estimates across most
countries. Correcting for selection increases the estimated wage gap across all specifications in
Bolivia and Georgia, whereas in the other countries it reduces the gap.

             Next, the results presented above are compared to estimates where dummy variables for
occupation are included in the specification. Two binary variables defining broad occupational
groups are added: for high-skill white-collar occupations and for low-skill white-collar occupations.
The reference category is blue-collar occupations. This specification allows us to explore the role
of skills in the sorting of men and women into different occupations. We present these results in
Table 9. These results, like the ones reported above, correct for selection bias.16 It must be noted
that results for Armenia are not reported in Table 9 as the small sample size does not support
reliable estimates. The panels in Table 9 are as specified—Panel A includes control variables
(including occupation dummies) and schooling, followed by the addition of noncognitive skills in
Panel B and cognitive skills in Panels C and D. Detailed estimates are presented in Table A3 in
the Appendix.

        Controlling for occupation in the wage models reveals interesting patterns in the
decompositions as compared to those reported in Table 8. We find that accounting for experience,
type of employment and occupational group, the gender wage gap in Colombia is now statistically
significant and favors males (0.30). In Bolivia and Ukraine, however, the inclusion of occupation
controls renders male-female differences in wages insignificant and smaller in magnitude.

        Compared to the previous specification, with occupation and other controls in the model,
differences in educational endowments are significant only in Kenya and favor women. We also
find that when occupation is included in the model, the proportion of the gender wage gap
explained by differences in schooling goes down (by about 2 percent) in Kenya, Colombia, Bolivia,
and Vietnam. We also find significant effects for low-skill white-collar occupations, favoring men,
in Ukraine and Georgia, controlling for schooling, potential experience, and type of employment.

        When noncognitive skills are added to the model, we find that the differences between the
earnings of men and women increase slightly in Bolivia, Ukraine, Vietnam, Georgia and Kenya.
The difference in noncognitive skills endowments between men and women, controlling for
occupation, are statistically significant in Bolivia and Vietnam. In Bolivia, emotional stability
explains about 4 percent of the gender wage gap, and in Vietnam openness to experience and
emotional stability matter. We also find significant effects for low-skill white-collar occupations in
Ukraine, Georgia, and Vietnam, even after noncognitive skills are included in the model.
Schooling continues to explain the bulk of the gender wage gaps in Vietnam but is no longer
significant in other countries.

        With regard to cognitive skills, although we note differences in the role of reading
proficiency scores depending on whether occupation is accounted for, the addition of cognitive
skills beyond schooling and noncognitive skills does not substantially explain the wage gap. The
effect of personality continues to be significant in Vietnam, and the role of low-skill white-collar
occupations continues to matter in Ukraine, Georgia, and Vietnam. Differences in educational
attainment significantly explain the gender wage gap in Vietnam and Kenya.
        The inclusion of complexity of computer use increases differences in earnings between
men and women (favoring men) in Ukraine, Georgia, and Kenya. We find a small significant effect

of computer skills favoring women in Georgia and men in Kenya. In this fully specified model we
find that belonging to low-skill white-collar occupations continues to favor men in Bolivia, Ukraine,
Georgia, and Vietnam. Further, schooling plays a substantial and significant role in explaining the
gender wage gap in Vietnam and Kenya. With regard to noncognitive skills, we see that in
Vietnam, when all other observed characteristics and skills are accounted for, openness to
experience and emotional stability matter for earnings.

             Overall, we find evidence for the role of noncognitive skills in Ukraine and Vietnam and for
the role of cognitive skills in Georgia and Kenya in explaining earnings differences between men
and women.

Quantile Decomposition Analysis

             Given our findings from the descriptive analysis, we also estimate quantile regression-
based decompositions using the male coefficients, implying the effect of earnings for women if
they had been paid like men. We estimate log earnings at the 10th, 30th, 50th, 70th, and 90th
percentiles separately for each country. Selected results are reported in Table 10, and detailed
results are included in Tables A.4 through A.10 in the Appendix.17
             Looking at Table 10, our findings for the differences in earnings in each country in turn
support some of the findings from the descriptive analysis, namely the “sticky floor” pattern in
Bolivia, Colombia, Kenya, and Vietnam, where the wage gaps are higher at the bottom of the
wage distribution, and the “glass ceiling” effect in Armenia, Georgia, and Ukraine, where the wage
gaps are higher at higher percentiles of the wage distribution. These patterns are also evident in
the coefficient estimates in Appendix Tables A.4 through A.10. The share of the coefficients in
countries depicting the sticky floor phenomenon decreases from the bottom to the top of the
distribution, while in countries with the glass ceiling pattern the coefficients go up as one moves
along the wage distribution.
             The three columns in Table 10 show an estimate of the conditional wage gap and the
proportion explained by differences in observed endowments at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles
under three conditions: when educational attainment, potential experience, and occupational
controls are used; when reading proficiency scores are added to the model with controls and


																																																								
17 In the Appendix, the first column in Tables A.4 – A.10 (“Difference”) shows the wage gap, the second column
(“Characteristics”) indicates the contribution of male and female differences in endowments such as schooling and
skills, and the third column (“Coefficients”) shows the proportion unexplained by differences in the characteristics of
men and women. Panel A includes the usual control variables. In Panel B we add educational attainment, followed by
reading proficiency scores in Panel C, computer skills in Panel D, and noncognitive skills scores in Panel E.


                                                                                                                    27
                                                  	

schooling; and when noncognitive skills are added to the model, including all controls, schooling,
and cognitive skills.

       In the case of Armenia, we find that under the three conditions presented, the unexplained
portion of the wage gap declines from 0.81 to 0.69 for those at the 10th percentile when education
and skills measures are added to the model. Schooling explains about 9 percent of the wage gap,
over and above what is explained by potential experience and occupational status (about 20
percent). There is no change when cognitive and noncognitive skills are added to the model.

       We find a greater reduction in the unexplained portion of the gap in Bolivia—over 30
percent—when all of the relevant variables are included in the model. Schooling and our control
variables account for about 12 percent of the gap at the 10th percentile, 18 percent of it at the 50th
percentile, and 25 percent of it at the 90th percentile. Cognitive skills explain an additional 10
percent of the wage gap at the 10th percentile and about 5 percent of it at the 50th percentile.
When noncognitive skills are added to the model, the unexplained gap further decreases by 12
percent at the bottom of the wage distribution and by about 10 percent at the median and 90th
percentile.

       The wage gap in Kenya is about 0.34 at the 10th percentile and is not significant at either
the 50th or 90th percentile. As in Armenia, schooling explains most of the gender wage gap in our
model (nearly 20 percent). The addition of noncognitive and cognitive skills does not further
reduce the unexplained portion of the wage gap.

       Similar results for schooling are observed in Vietnam, where the wage gap is highest at
the bottom of the distribution. Differences in educational attainment explain about 14 percent of
the wage gap at the 10th percentile, 18 percent of it at the median wage, and about 17 percent at
the top end of the wage distribution. We find that cognitive skills matter for women at the 50th
percentile and reduce the unexplained portion of the wage gap by 5 percent. We also find
evidence for the role of noncognitive skills in explaining gender wage gaps in Vietnam. The
reduction in the wage gap when noncognitive skills are added to the model is substantial. It ranges
from 3 percent at the 10th percentile to 6 percent and 11 percent at the 50th and 90th percentiles,
respectively.

       Our results for Colombia, Georgia, and Ukraine are not in line with the findings for the
countries noted above. We find some effect of schooling in reducing the unexplained portion of
the gender earnings gap at the bottom of the wage distribution in Colombia (by 4 percent).

However, the addition of skills measures does not further explain male-female differences in
wages.

VI.    Conclusions

       In this paper we have used a unique set of surveys measuring cognitive and noncognitive
skills in low- and middle-income countries to examine differences in earnings between men and
women. Focusing on seven low- and middle-income countries (Armenia, Bolivia, Colombia,
Georgia, Kenya, Ukraine, and Vietnam), our objective was to determine if these newly available
skills measures could explain the gender wage gap beyond what is explained by traditional
measures of schooling and experience. While gender wage discrimination has been extensively
studied in various contexts, our use of measures capturing different dimensions of human capital
extends what we know about the gender wage gap in developing contexts and contributes to our
understanding of the role of cognitive and noncognitive skills in research related to labor market
outcomes. The findings from this paper are summarized next.

       Mean decompositions with and without occupation controls can be indicative of the role of
sorting in earnings differences between men and women. Controlling for occupation, we find that
in Vietnam, openness to experience and emotional stability are important factors in explaining
gender wage gaps. Our decomposition results indicate that men receive a reward for scoring
higher, on average, on openness and emotional stability traits. The sorting argument would
suggest that men sort into occupations that require the appearance of more openness and
emotional stability. Controlling for occupation, however, we can infer that sorting perhaps does
not explain the entire difference between men’s and women’s returns to noncognitive skills in
Vietnam. Mueller and Plug (2006) found similar results for men with lower agreeableness scores
than women in the United States, and Nyhus and Pons (2005) found that emotional stability
scores positively affect wage setting for women. Our mean decompositions also show some
evidence for the influence of cognitive skills in Georgia and Kenya.

       Findings from the quantile decompositions indicate that the wage gap follows a “sticky
floor” pattern in the Latin American countries as well as Kenya and Vietnam but follows a “glass
ceiling” effect in the ECA countries. Previous research has also found evidence for the glass
ceiling effect in transitional economies, and this pattern has been observed in Vietnam (Pham
and Reilly, 2007). Further, our results indicate that schooling matters, across countries, in
explaining differences in earnings between men and women. In some countries, schooling
explains a larger share of the wage gap at the top end of the wage distribution (Bolivia and
Vietnam) while in others education and skills are found to matter more at the lower end of the
wage distribution (Kenya and Armenia).




                                                                                               30
                                                  	

       The results discussed here have some important implications. First, education remains a
crucial building block for success in the labor market. While measures of cognitive and
noncognitive skill add incremental predictive power, the bulk of the gender wage gap is explained
by differences in educational attainment. Policy makers therefore need to focus on ensuring
school completion and on improving the quality of learning outcomes in school.

       Second, the role of noncognitive skills, although modest in explaining gender-based wage
differences, is notable. In the absence of discrete measures of occupational characteristics and
sample-size limitations, the results highlighted in this paper can be considered an upper-bound
on the role of noncognitive skills in explaining gender differences in earnings. Using other
measures of occupational characteristics will not only enable a better understanding of the role of
sorting in male-female wage differences but also enable examination of the extent to which skills
determine occupational segregation.

       Third, based on the results we observe for cognitive skills associated with the use of
computers and technology-driven shifts in the demand for skills, students must develop
information and communication technology (ICT) skills to be successful in today’s economy.
Research shows that women are less likely to work in ICT occupations than men (World Bank,
2016). This is in part due to lower participation of girls in science, technology, engineering, and
math (STEM) fields (Dasgupta and Stout, 2014; Smith, 2010). Policies and programs focusing on
creating appropriate learning environments for girls’ participation in STEM should be encouraged.

       Fourth, our results show that a substantial portion of the wage gap (over 60 percent in
most countries) remains unexplained after controlling for schooling and additional measures of
cognitive and noncognitive skills. The literature discusses several other factors (sex segregation
in occupations, women’s nonrandom selection in fields of work, wage setting institutions, and so
on) that are beyond the scope of this paper but must be explored in further research (Olivetti and
Petrongolo, 2008; Terrell, 1992).

       Finally, future research on this topic must replicate these analyses in the same and other
contexts with larger sample sizes and more reliable measures of noncognitive skills in order to
validate and extend the findings reported here.

Note. The dependent variable is the log of hourly earnings. Controls include potential experience,
squared term for experience, and type of employment. Reading proficiency scores and
noncognitive skills scores are standardized with mean=0 and SD=1. The reference category for
binary variables indicating complexity of computer use at work is ‘No computer use on the job’.
The sample includes 25- to 64-year-olds (both men and women) in self-employment or wage
work. Highlighted cells indicate statistical significance at the 1% level or lower.
