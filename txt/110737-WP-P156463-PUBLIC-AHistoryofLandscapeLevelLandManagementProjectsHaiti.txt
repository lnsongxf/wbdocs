Overall there is immense ecological diversity in Haiti,
which results from the peculiarities of a landscape where most of the land area is in mountain.
Agriculture is affected by the extreme variations in rainfall, variable soil types, differences in
temperature according to altitude, and a mix of rugged highlands, fertile river bottom-lands and
coastal pains. When the effects of these ecological variations are mediated through the prevailing
social structure, they have a bearing on development potential and an understanding of production
relations in Haitian economy.

A watershed is formed by all those lands that shed water into a stream;
it can be a few acres that shed water into a ravine or creek; or it can be millions of acres that drain
into rivers, such as the Nile and Mississippi. Watershed management is the management of the
lands, animals and people of a watershed so as to achieve the maximum benefits to man, while
conserving the soil, forests, range and the water itself.

BOX 1. Conceptual Definitions of ‘Landscape-level Land Management’ and ‘Watershed Management’
Here and throughout this report we define landscape-level land management approaches in Haiti as
attempts to address the interrelated human and ecological vulnerabilities noted above, in the context
of large land management projects executed at the landscape level, which focus on improving or
introducing new livelihood strategies that ostensibly improve the lives of project beneficiaries.This report
distinguishes watershed management as a variant of landscape-level land management approaches—
increasingly embraced in the case of Haiti as the appropriate locus of project execution—and delineated
by varied conceptual and operational definitions of what constitutes a watershed.

Proceeding from the logic that development initiatives seek to improve the lives of project
beneficiaries, an understanding of the drivers of ecological degradation in Haiti is paramount
and should be a first step for future research or landscape-level management project
identification, preparation, and implementation.

to a country that does not exceed 300 kilometers

Since new roads were constructed off of existing
arterial highways, their construction opened up
many of the more remote locations in Haiti. These
new roads reversed the historical phenomenon of
just a few accessible areas targeted for agriculture
and charcoal production, and original charcoal
producing areas experienced significantly less
pressure than in former decades.
   Toward the end of the 20th century, almost
all land area of Haiti had been dedicated to
agricultural production (crops and livestock).
Today, there is hardly any parcel of land that is
not being dedicated to some kind of productive
use, profoundly influencing the current state of
the environment of Haiti (Tarter 2015b), with
agricultural production commonly being the
primary objective with sizable integration of
trees and woody vegetation.

     THE CURRENT CONDITION OF THE RURAL ENVIRONMENT OF HAITI

Centuries of deforestation in Haiti have played out on an overwhelmingly mountainous
terrain that receives seasonal rains and torrential downpours from frequent tropical storms
and hurricanes. Exacerbated and accelerated by the exposed agricultural fields of a densely
populated rural countryside, deforestation and alluvial soil erosion have produced predictable
environmental consequences: the loss of topsoil, decreasing soil fertility, overall agricultural
decline, and rural out-migration. A less-predictable consequence of deforestation was the
widespread encroachment of exotic tree and shrub species, to collectively cover approximately
3/4ths of Haiti’s land surface by approximately 2010 (Tarter 2015b; Churches et al.
2014;White et al. 2013).

   While the permanent rivers and streams of
Haiti are spring-fed through a vast network of
aquifers, it must be recognized that the aquifers
themselves are recharged by rainfall capture
(Swartley and Toussaint 2006). Rain falls variably
in Haiti, with precipitation driven by the north-
eastern trade winds.
   With the exception of the slowly flowing
Artibonite—the country’s largest river—many
rivers in Haiti are both short and swiftly flowing.
Vegetative cover and arboreal root systems in
some watersheds prevent rapid runoff, and allow
the rainfall to percolate through the limestone
substratum that represents some 80% of Haiti’s
underlying land formation (Swartley and
Toussaint 2006).
   In contrast, rain in denuded watersheds rapidly
descends into streams and rivers and ultimately
leaves the watershed with a reduced rate of
percolation into aquifers.This trend is reflected in
the 15% of the country that is composed of plains
and valleys but which contains approximately
85% of Haiti’s available groundwater (Knowles et
al. 1999: 14).The remaining 15% of groundwater
is found in mountainous areas and comes from
springs that originate from multiple aquifer types,
including karstic, fractured, low permeability, and
indigenous aquifers (Knowles et al. 1999: 15-17).
   By 1978, 12 of the 30 major watersheds
in Haiti were completely deforested, and by
1985, the most forested watershed supported
only 37% arboreal coverage, and was expected
to be entirely deforested by 2042 if trends
continued (Ehrlich 1985: 28-31). Overall the
ability of aquifers to recharge has decreased with
deforestation to the point where the water table
now fluctuates seasonally by up to 15 meters
in many parts of the country (Knowles et al.
1999). Freshwater is nevertheless still available
locally from varied aquifers, including fractured
limestones, sandstones, conglomerates, and schist
aquifers (Knowles et al. 1999: 17).

   hectares (Zuvekas), though most Haitian farmers own
   several different plots of land.

6.	 Planners should ensure the incorporation
     and participation of actors, stakeholders,
     and beneficiaries from multiple levels and
     sectors of society, in processes of project
     identification, formation, and execution.
7.	 Planners should listen to project beneficiaries
     as a first step, rather than employing strictly
     command-and-control approaches based
     on a priori assumptions of appropriate
     technologies or behavioral changes suggested
     by outside experts.
8.	 Project planners should take the necessary
     time to align the nomenclature, goals,
     objectives, and visions of different actors,
     stakeholders, and beneficiaries to ensure the
     clarity and harmony necessary for shared
     communication, understanding, trust, and
     ultimately project success.
9.	 Ensuring local and national government
     participation in watershed management
     in Haiti requires methods for addressing
     the challenges inherent in the overlap
     between political boundaries and watershed
     delineations.
10.	 Planners should recognize that there is vast
     ecological and social heterogeneity across
     landscapes in Haiti, and work to produce
     policies that recognize these differences
     rather than promoting activities that attempt
     to minimize them.
11.	 Planners should recognize and work to
     mitigate the fact that effective landscape-
     level land management projects typically
     require longer than the 5-year cycles that
     typically characterize donor contributions
     and project timelines.
