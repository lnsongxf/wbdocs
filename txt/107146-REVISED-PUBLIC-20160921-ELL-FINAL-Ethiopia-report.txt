The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry



               Executive Summary
        I.          Introduction

        Ethiopia is home to significant and diverse mineral resources, including deposits of over 40
        coloured gemstone varieties; of these, opals are the most significant in terms of trade.

        Opal was first discovered in Ethiopia in the mid-1990s, in the Shewa Province. These opals
        were soon discovered to be of a poor quality when compared to Australian opal, which had
        dominated the market for over a century. However, in 2008, a second large-scale discovery
        of opal was made in North Wello Delanta—a white opal variety with a beautiful play-of-
        colour and broad colour variations. Wello opal, as it would come to be known, was found
        to rival, and in some cases surpass, Australian opal in terms of quality. Wello opal’s
        characteristics quickly saw a marked increase in opal exports out of Ethiopia to major
        manufacturing and consumer markets, including India, China, Europe and the USA.

        The vast majority of coloured gemstone mining in Ethiopia, and around the world, is
        performed by miners in the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector; workers who are
        defined by their predominate use of rudimentary technology, such as picks and shovels, to
        mine for minerals that are typically found in shallow (alluvial) deposits.1 In Ethiopia, opal
        mining is performed solely by the ASM sector. In North Wello Delanta, for example, it is a
        source of employment for 3,800 (registered) ASM workers, according to official
        government figures.

        In 2013, Ethiopia’s Ministry of Mines, Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoMPNG) proposed
        the introduction of a law that would prevent the export of rough opals out of country; all
        opals would instead have to be cut and polished prior to export. This was motivated by the
        recognition that the export of rough opal to be manufactured overseas was limiting
        growth opportunities in the domestic lapidary sector, and undermining the Ministry’s
        goal to build Ethiopia’s foreign currency reserves at a faster pace. However, this proposed
        law was ultimately withdrawn because of the following:

                    -   The inability of many exporters to access the necessary finance to establish

                    -   A lack of recognition of the fact that Ethiopia simply did not have enough people

                       to external lapidaries, and thus maintain their previous export levels;3

                   -   A lack of recognition of how much time is required to develop high-level
                       lapidary skills, particularly when they have to be internationally competitive
                       against doyens of this practice, like India;4

                   -   A lack of recognition of the fact that the lapidary skills that did exist in the
                       country when the law was introduced, which were primarily products of training
                       provided in the Amhara region, were not of a high enough calibre to compete
                       with countries like India. This meant that the comparatively poorly cut stones
                       coming out of Ethiopia would not have been well received on the international
                       market, and thus would have commanded lower prices anyway (a problem that
                       is still occurring, as this report will show);5

                   -   The fact that the government was not doing enough to nurture the development
                       of domestic lapidary businesses either prior to the law’s introduction, or in its
                       direct aftermath;6 and

                   -   A lack of recognition of the law’s creation of a huge incentive to simply
                       smuggle rough opals out of Ethiopia’s porous borders—a practice that the
                       government is still struggling to control.7

        After the proposed law was dropped, exporters were subsequently required to export a
        minimum of 10% of their opal as cut and polished and a maximum of 90% as rough.
        Between 2013 and 2015, this was gradually increased to 20:80, and then to 40:60, where it
        resides now.

        II.        Purpose of the study:

        Having recognised the importance of the coloured gemstones sector for the inclusive

               -   Which features of the industry and its governance are either improving or
                   limiting its commercial success, and why; and
               -   The key ‘lessons learned’ from what other gemstone producing countries
                   around the world have done to commercialise this industry, and how they could
                   be constructively applied to the Ethiopian context.

        A clearer understanding of the commercial realities of this sector and how it is governed
        will improve the Ethiopian government’s ability to it realise its objectives under the
        Second Growth and Transformation Plan (‘GTP-2’) for this important industry. While this
        study focussed primarily on the opal industry, given its dominance in Ethiopia’s coloured
        gemstone sector, these recommendations are largely relevant to all of the 40-plus
        gemstone varieties mined in the country.

        The MoMPNG may use these recommendations to help inform the development of
        Ethiopia’s coloured gemstone sector. The recommendations could also inform other
        research (including that which has been suggested in this report) into options for
        developing the gemstone sector to ensure that it has a resilient future. This information
        could form the basis of a new strategic plan for the sustainable development of the sector,
        which should be drafted in consultation with all relevant industry stakeholders. It is also
        recommended that the Ministry’s five-year plan for the mining industry be revised
        accordingly.

        III.   Methodology:

        The methodology used for this study included semi-structured interviews and site visits in
        Ethiopia and abroad, and document analyses and expert reviews. Case studies of seven
        other gemstone-producing countries, including Afghanistan, Australia, Brazil, Madagascar,
        Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Tanzania, were also conducted to identify the ways in which they
        have worked to establish functional coloured gemstone industries and improve their
        commercialisation. This study was limited by a short timeframe. In recognition of this,
        many of the recommendations that have arisen out of the study’s findings include calls
        for further research into specific issues.

        IV.    Findings

        The findings of this research indicate that the Ethiopian coloured gemstone sector has
        enormous potential, but its growth and efficiency are being constrained by numerous
        challenges throughout the supply chain. The country case studies also found that lessons
        can be learned from how these countries have realised, or struggled to realise, their
        coloured gemstone sector goals.

        Below is a summary of a selection of the study’s findings on Ethiopia’s coloured
        gemstone sector (the findings from the country case studies are detailed in Chapter 5):

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


              1. Gemstone Supply Chain:

                  -   The typical supply chain of gemstones in Ethiopia as reported to the researchers
                      is Miners’ Association—Broker—Lapidary—Exporter (the latter two stages are
                      often encapsulated in a vertically integrated company). This is likely to be a
                      contracted version of what actually exists,8 excluding the additional trading that
                      typically takes place between miners and miners’ cooperatives, miners’
                      cooperatives and brokers, and brokers and lapidaries/exporters.9

                  -   Miners: Opal miners see their lack of mining tools and equipment as their
                      biggest challenge, which they prioritize above receiving additional training in
                      mining techniques. They also expressed concerns about exposure to significant
                      health and safety risks. The miners reported being self-financing in the majority
                      of cases, and bore their own business risks.

                  -   Brokers: Some rough opal brokers expressed a desire to also trade cut and
                      polished opal, which is currently prohibited by law. Brokers were also reported as
                      often making inflated profits due to the following factors in the upstream sector
                      of the supply chain: (i) asymmetric information about the true value of the rough
                      (miners often lack basic knowledge about what they are selling);10 (ii) extreme
                      poverty amongst miners (the mining motivation is often survival, not profit);11
                      and (iii) the existence of a buyers’ market, due to the over-supply of opal.

                  -   Lapidaries: To operate a lapidary legally in Addis Ababa, one must be a citizen of
                      Ethiopia and obtain the necessary licence from the MoMPNG. Licenced lapidary
                      holders are by law allowed to buy gemstone cutting and polishing machinery
                      duty-free; however, this law needs to be communicated more effectively by the
                      government to the lapidary operators. In contrast to the ease with which
                      lapidaries can meet legal requirements, setting up an operational lapidary
                      business was reported as being extremely challenging. The most commonly

                       reported challenge was finding sufficiently trained staff for cutting and polishing
                       gemstones, and then further training them in order to bring their skill levels up
                       to an internationally competitive standard. The second most commonly
                       mentioned challenge raised by interviewees in relation to establishing a
                       successful lapidary business was accessing the necessary finance.

                   -   Lapidary Training Centres: Originally, seven lapidary training centres were
                       established in the Amhara Region in 2009, each embedded in the local
                       Polytechnical Colleges. However, in the past three years, the Kombolcha
                       Polytechnical College has been the only one offering this type of training. There
                       is a lack of qualified (Ethiopian) teachers with the necessary practical experience
                       and skills to teach lapidary courses in gemstone cutting and polishing. The
                       employability of the lapidary training graduates also remains a challenge. Budget
                       constraints also affect the lapidary college.

                   -   The lapidary training conducted by the Polytechnical Colleges has resulted in
                       some encouraging developments. The three lapidaries interviewed in Kombolcha
                       and Delanta stated that they had traded gemstones illegally previously, but
                       decided to register and formalise their lapidary businesses after receiving short-
                       term training in the Polytechnical Colleges in Kombolcha and Bahir Dar
                       respectively.

                   -   Exporters: The main challenge cited by exporters was that the MoMPNG has set
                       a minimum exporting price for rough opal (depending on its weight, and
                       perceived size, colour and quality—attributes that are assessed by the MoMPNG),
                       which has the following impacts on the market:

                          The minimum export price is often too high—far above what is commanded
                           on the international market;

                          Because of the high prices often put on lower quality goods, for most
                           exporters it is only profitable to export the highest quality opal (at least
                           formally), which means that there is almost no (formal) market demand for
                           the lower quality material; and

                          Since high quality opal makes up only approximately 1% of total production,
                           a large proportion of opal is rejected by buyers, or sold through illegal
                           channels.12

                   -   Exporters also lamented the scale of gemstone smuggling and tax evasion by
                       other industry stakeholders, which impacts their ability to flourish.

                    -   Some exporters claimed to find it extremely difficult to access the necessary
                        financing to grow their businesses.

                    -   Exporters also argued that the presence of very large, internationally funded
                        exporters reduces competition in the industry and makes it difficult for smaller
                        companies to operate.

               2. Governance:

                    -   The achievement of the MoMPNG’s goals for the mining sector, as outlined in
                        its five-year plan released in January 2015, will require the addressing of capacity
                        constraints, as well as coordination issues.

                    -   The MoMPNG faces challenges in enforcing licensing requirements, and
                        managing gemstone smuggling due, in part, to a high staff attrition rate.
                        Smuggled gemstones have the following adverse impacts on the market for
                        Ethiopian gemstones:

                           The market is flooded with Ethiopian gemstones, especially opal, which
                            reduces their value;

                           Local traders observe (at international trade fairs) international sellers of
                            Ethiopian opal pricing it more cheaply than they can, because they have not
                            had to incur costs associated with legitimate business operations (taxes,
                            licences, minimum wages, etc.); and

                           Smuggled gemstones are more likely to eventually have undisclosed
                            treatments (smoking, dyeing, heating) applied to them, which give Ethiopian
                            opal a bad reputation on the international market.13

               3. Gemstone Markets:

                    International Markets:

                    -   Demand is increasing for Ethiopian opal, and the largest buyers are from China
                        and the USA. However, misinformation is being spread about Wello opals on the
                        internet, which incorrectly states that it has the same characteristics as Shewa
                        opal. This is contributing to the lower prices commanded by Wello opal on the
                        international market.

                    -   The most commonly reported problem faced by those buying opals directly from
                        Ethiopia was the government’s 40:60 rule for exporting polished and rough

        13   This link can be ascribed to the fact that if you’re willing to break one law, you’re also likely to be willing
        to break other laws and/or social contracts (i.e. the requirement/expectation to disclose gem treatments prior
        to sale).

                      opals.14 The quality of opal cutting and polishing in Ethiopia is not up to the
                      standards of some international traders, and so this rule places a burden on
                      them to buy poorly cut stones at a higher price when they could be cutting and
                      polishing in their own facilities and getting better results.

                  -   In relation to local Ethiopians working in lapidary, some Indian traders said they
                      have cutting facilities in Ethiopia, but because of the poor skills of the locals they
                      must send cutters from Jaipur to do some of the work. They thus view the 40:60
                      rule as forcing them to spend money on inferior cutting when they have access
                      to better cutters outside the country.

                  -   The Ethiopian government places much emphasis on the size of the rough or cut
                      stones, without considering other key factors that determine their quality, i.e.
                      their ‘play-of-colour’ and opacity, and, in the case of fire opals, their clarity.
                      This means that the government’s valuations are often too high—far above
                      actual market prices.

                  -   The export process in Ethiopia is unappealing; foreign currency must be
                      transferred into a specified account in Ethiopia before the export process can
                      begin. Currently, the bank advice expires within one year, so if the stones are not
                      exported within that time, the money cannot be transferred back to its country
                      of origin, nor can it be used to export stones after the expiration date.

              4. Domestic Market:

                  -   Some of the lapidaries and exporters interviewed in Ethiopia argued that the
                      domestic market for their gemstones is almost non-existent. The meagre usage
                      of coloured gemstones in Ethiopia’s own jewellery sector was witnessed first -
                      hand by the study’s researchers.

                  -   There are two main issues at play here: a lack of domestic skills in relation to
                      jewellery manufacturing, and a lack of domestic knowledge regarding natural
                      gemstones (those found both within Ethiopia and without) amongst both
                      consumers and retailers.

        V.      Recommendations:

        Based on the study’s complete findings (which can be found in the main body of the
        report), a set of recommendations was developed for the MoMPNG’s consideration.
        These are summarised below, under relevant themes. They have also been labelled in terms
        of short-to-medium or long-term strategy; recommendations falling under the former
        category are appropriate for an immediate action plan, while those under the latter are
        suited to a more extended time horizon.

             1. Support for gemstone miners

                    Short-to-medium term:

                -   Train gemstone miners to use commercially sensitive mining techniques;

                -   Offer Operational Health and Safety (OH&S) and safe mining practices training
                    to gemstone miners; and

                -   Educate gemstone miners about the value and characteristics of opal (and other
                    gemstones)

                    Long-term:

                -   Provide adequate business training for any future gemstone mining cooperatives
                    to educate the miners about how to build resilience into their activities, and help
                    them to mine and commercialise more productively.

             2. Support for exporters and lapidaries

                    Short-to-medium term:

                -   Research how best to improve access to financing for smaller lapidaries and
                    exporters to increase their viability and competitiveness; and

                -   Develop a strong marketing plan that communicates the attributes of natural
                    Ethiopian opal, with the goal to educate domestic and international consumers

                    Long-term:

                -   Promote and assist exporters in selling cut and polished stones directly to global
                    markets like the US and Europe, once lapidary skills reach an internationally
                    competitive standard;

                -   Possibly also oversee the development of certain specialisms that give the sector
                    a cutting edge over established ‘do-it-all’ competitors;

                -   Provide more support in creating international market access, market linkages,
                    and developing marketing and sales skills within the lapidary and export sectors;
                    and

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


               -   Integrate lapidary/gemstone cutting and polishing training with small business
                   development initiatives and training (e.g. business management, financial and
                   accounting skills, etc.).

            3. Cutting and polishing training


                   Short-to-medium term:

               -   Encourage close collaboration between existing lapidary training centres and the
                   gemstone industry, particularly the downstream;

               -   Work with lapidaries and exporters to create and improve domestic cutting and
                   polishing skills (perhaps by subsidising in-house training programmes);

               -   Allow gemstone brokers to trade in cut and polished stones, thus improving
                   access to the market for trained lapidaries and reducing the appeal of the black
                   market for such stones; and

               -   Increase funding to lapidary training institutes, in order to supply sufficient
                   quantities of rough for the students to practice on, thus increasing the currently
                   minimal numbers of highly trained cutters and polishers entering the market

                   Long-term:

               -   Introduce a ‘train the trainer’ model, which has proven to be a valuable long -
                   term strategy in other countries;

               -   Encourage training schools to teach students to cut for beauty instead of weight,
                   thus shifting focus to technique, in turn improving the quality of their cutting
                   and polishing; and

               -   Support training centres that they cannot self-fund, concentrating on the skills
                   development goal of the programme, not the profits.

            4. Supporting the jewellery industry


                   Short-to-medium term:

               -   Conduct further research into the jewellery making stage of the gemstone
                   supply chain in Ethiopia, to illuminate its potential and the challenges that are
                   preventing its steady growth;

               -   Engage with lapidaries attempting to build domestic demand for jewellery set
                   with Ethiopian gemstones;

               -   Analyse domestic consumer attitudes (locals, tourists, expats) towards jewellery
                   set with gemstones, to identify why this style of jewellery is currently so rare in

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


                   the domestic market and how that could be changed moving forward;

               -   Pinpoint the unique ‘story’ that Ethiopian jewellery has, which could be used
                   to help market it internationally; and

               -   Engage meaningfully with all key supply chain actors in the industry, from miners
                   to jewellers, to establish this provenance

                   Long-term:

               -   Research whether locally produced gold could be used in designs for further
                   value adding.

            5. Gemstone marketing


                   Short-to-medium term:

               -   Market Ethiopian opal internationally, to foster demand, improve global sales
                   and permanently address/disprove residual concerns about its stability, quality
                   and value; and

               -   Allocate a sufficient budget, or consider other sources of funding, in order to
                   realise the proposed gemstone marketing centre detailed in the Ministry’s five-
                   year plan.

                   Long-term:

               -   Consider international branding of one high-end iconic stone, such as opal, and
                   thus enhance the overall image of the gems and jewellery sector.

            6. Illegal activities


                   Short-to-medium term:

               -   Research illegal gemstone supply chains in Ethiopia, to ascertain the typical
                   structure and common actors, their geographical profile, the loopholes (and
                   vulnerable actors [miners, underpaid officials, etc.]) they exploit, and what
                   motivates people to engage in this illegal trade; and

               -   Tackle illegal lapidary businesses, which are limiting economic growth and
                   undermining legitimate operators, potentially forcing them out of business

                   Long-term:

               -   Develop an appropriate framework for systematically addressing illegal
                   gemstone supply chains in Ethiopia, based on the abovementioned research;

               -   Seek to use diplomatic channels to require improved customs control at the

                       point of import in India;

                   -   Encourage its neighbours, particularly Kenya and Djibouti, to exercise vigilance
                       with regards to the export of opal, which neither of these two countries mine
                       domestically; and

                   -   Explore the utility of a implementing a nation-wide supply chain quality
                       assurance mechanism, like MineralCare15.

              7. Taxes and export prices


                       Short-to-medium term:

                   -   Introduce market-based incentives in order to reduce the size of Ethiopia’s
                       gemstone black market;

                   -   Reconsider its policy of minimum export prices for rough opal, in order to
                       disincentivise engagement in the black market for lower quality gemstones;

                   -   Seek input from key supply chain actors to enable a stronger degree of industry
                       buy-in for such changes; and

                   -   Review the 40:60 rule, in cooperation with stakeholders, to ascertain whether,
                       and to what extent, it is incentivising smuggling.

                       Long-term:

                   -   Explore options for removing import taxes on rough stones, in order to provide
                       additional material for the infant domestic cutting and polishing sector, and
                       reduce its reliance on domestically produced stones.

              8. Infrastructure


                       Short-to-medium term:

                   -   Consult with all major industry stakeholders to determine the key desired
                       features and functions of said gemmological institute; and

                   -   Encourage partnerships with the private sector to help link trained lapidaries in
                       this region to buyers, and improve the calibre of training on offer (by identifying
                       key areas of weakness from a private sector perspective)

                       Long-term:

                   -   Ensure that the MMVCDD tries to utilise the existing cutting and polishing, bead

               -   Improve major arterial roads in Ethiopia, to increase the efficiency of
                   transportation between mines and major trading hubs.

            9. Governance


                   Short-to-medium term:

               -   Study the challenges associated with staff retention in the Ministry, and explore
                   how they could be addressed

                   Long-term:

               -   Address the dearth of knowledge of the coloured gemstones industry within the
                   Ministry;

               -   Undertake a facilitating rather than a steering role in the industry, working in
                   close collaboration with all relevant representatives of the private sector; and

               -   Establish a national authority responsible for the regulation, supervision and
                   promotion of the whole gemstone and jewellery sector.

            10. Policy


                   Short-to-medium term:

               -   Build a domestic cutting and polishing sector by first focussing on lower value
                   gemstones, where skill levels do not need to be as high and the barriers of entry
                   are low; and

               -   Focus efforts and support where domestic processing, cutting, polishing or
                   jewellery making is already happening (including in the private sector), and
                   where skills can be ‘upgraded’ instead of being built from scratch.

                   Long-term:

               -   Embed any activities designed to develop cutting and polishing training into a
                   larger strategy or policy;

               -   Consider ‘softer’ policies differentiated by gemstone types, values and
                   markets (i.e. tax reduction on export of cut gemstones) as alternatives to a ban
                   on the export of rough gemstones, until/unless it can be implemented gradually
                   and partially (based on existing skill levels and market needs), concurrent with
                   the development of a domestic cutting and polishing industry;

               -   Initiate a wider macro-economic strategy and activities, since a domestic cutting

                   and polishing industry cannot be built through a sole focus on lapidary training
                   activities; and

               -   Embed donor funded activities in a larger economic or sectorial strategy by the
                   government, and receive committed and long-term support and guidance by the
                   government.

        This study demonstrates that Ethiopia’s coloured gemstone industry, when effectively
        governed and supported, has the potential to make an important contribution to the
        state’s economic growth and social development. The key challenges currently
        undermining     this   potential   are    explored       in    this   report,   along   with     practical
        recommendations              as    to        how             they      could       be          addressed.

             Ethiopia is a land-locked federal republic located in Eastern Africa, sharing its borders
             with numerous conflict-affected states, including Eritrea, Somalia and South Sudan.
             Despite the region’s instability, Ethiopia’s economy has seen significant expansion
             in the past ten years, during which GDP growth averaged the impressive double-digit
             figure of 10.8% per annum.17 Ethiopia remains, however, an emerging economy; its
             GDP per capita is among the lowest in the world at only USD1600,18 and 30% of its

             gemstones,         including     emerald,      tourmaline,           opal,   aquamarine,   jasper,   agate,
             chrysoprase, peridot and amethyst.21 While it is one of the few countries in the world
             to have this diversity of gemstone deposits within its borders, the calibre of many of
             its coloured gems tends to be at the lower end of the scale; only a few deposits
             produce stones that can compete with those of known international industry leaders,
             one of those being opal.22

             The vast majority of coloured gemstone mining around the world is performed by
             miners in the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector; workers who are defined
             by their predominate use of rudimentary technology, such as picks and shovels, to
             mine for minerals that are typically found in shallow (alluvial) deposits. 23 The
             coloured gemstone mining taking place in Ethiopia is no different, with ASM
             controlling production. For example, government figures report that there are 3,800
             ASM workers involved in opal mining in the region of North Wello Delanta, out of
             which 3,668 are male and 132 are female.24 Ethiopia is known to be the second
             largest producer of opal in the world, next to Australia. In 2012 and 2011, Australia
             produced an estimated USD41 million and USD40 million of rough opal
             respectively.25

             Figures from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimate that in 2012
             Ethiopia produced 14,000kgs of opal, and 13,839kgs in 2011. It attributes 750kgs of

             production in 2012 to one ASM location alone, Wegel Tena. 26 Official figures
             provided by the Ministry of Mines, Petroleum and Natural Gas (hereafter Ministry of
             Mines, or MoMPNG) state that 194.53kgs of value-added opal was exported out of
             Ethiopia in the 2014-2015 financial year.27 Based on a conservative estimate of opal
             production levels for this period being the same as 2012—14,000kgs, and accounting
             for the standard opal cutting and polishing attrition rate of two-thirds, these figures
             would suggest that the government’s 40:60 rule on opal exports, which requires
             40% of total exports to be cut and polished domestically, is not being met. Based on
             these figures, only 4.8% of the opal that was mined in Ethiopia in the 2014-2015
             financial year was cut and polished in the country prior to export—a deficit of more
             than 35%. Furthermore, as the government states that 4545kgs of opal were
             exported out of Ethiopia in 2014-2015,28 this suggests that almost two-thirds of the
             country’s opal is not going through official export challenges. These gaps can likely
             be explained by two problems plaguing the industry: the scale of rough opal
             smuggling that is said to take place in East Africa; and the significant financing and
             capacity issues faced by lapidaries operating in Ethiopia. These challenges will be
             examined in depth in this report.

             Opal was first discovered in Ethiopia in the mid-1990s, in the Shewa Province. The
             scale of the deposit and the rough’s pretty play-of-colour meant that it quickly
             received international attention, and the gem was soon available on global markets.
             At the same time, efforts were made to determine the nature of Shewa opal, and,
             ultimately, whether or not it could compete with the beautiful, robust, and hitherto
             dominant, Australian opal. Analyses performed by the Gemological Institute of
             America (GIA) found that, unlike Australian opal, Shewa opal was hydrophane
             (porous), and more prone to cracking and ‘crazing’—where opals develop
             multiple cracks that can grow over time.29 It was relatively unstable and extremely
             difficult to cut and polish, and set into jewellery. Unsurprisingly, reports began
             trickling in of customers around the world returning jewellery set with Shewa opal
             because the stone/s had suddenly cracked, or changed colour after exposure to
             water.30 Therefore, despite the beauty of the stone, it fell out of favour with many,

             but by no means all, international buyers. The dominance of Australian opal
             remained unchallenged.

             In 2008, a second large-scale discovery of opal was made in North Wello Delanta—a
             white opal variety with a beautiful play-of-colour and broad colour variations. It was
             automatically assumed by many that Wello opal would have the same characteristics
             as Shewa opal. However, it is important to note that an analysis performed by the
             GIA on a large sample of Wello opal found that 35% of the stones tested had no
             hydrophane characteristics. This demonstrates that hydrophaneity is not uniform for
             Ethiopian opal, as many critics of the stone tend to argue (see the Australia case
             study in Chapter 5 for further analysis of this issue). The GIA also found that the
             samples were very strong, being able to withstand falls from considerable heights.
             The authors of the GIA study wrote that from their own extensive experience with
             Wello opal, it crazed in only a very small minority of cases; it was seen in only three
             stones out of the 3,000 they had personally sold.31 Wello opal was thus seen to be
             extremely robust—more robust than many of the Australian opals tested, for
             example.32

             International buyers responded quickly to this new discovery and the GIA’s
             authority on the opal’s quality. Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s main gemstone trading
             hub, was soon visited by gem traders from around the world who were looking to
             establish a supply of this gem for their cutting and polishing factories in India, China
             and elsewhere.         33   Opal quickly became Ethiopia’s largest gemstone export,
             accounting for more than 90% of all gems exported out of the country (by value).34
             Demand quickly grew in the primary market of the US, and also in Europe, China and
             Japan.

             In January 2013, the MoMPNG declared that it would be banning the export of rough
             opal from the commencement of the fiscal year 2013/2014; all gemstone exporters
             from that point onwards would have to cut and polish rough opal prior to export.35
             This proposed law, despite appearing to have come out of nowhere for some, was
             the result of strong lobbying carried out by the members of a committee that had

             been established within the MoMPNG in the previous year. This committee had
             members from both the public and private sectors, including MoMPNG officials, and
             large-scale gemstone exporters. They were brought together by a shared belief that
             Ethiopia was effectively sacrificing potential economic development by allowing
             rough opal to be exported out of the country to major gemstone manufacturing
             hubs, like India, China and Thailand, to be cut and polished, and sold onto the
             international market. To these committee members, every kilo of exported rough
             represented a loss of potential value adding, and in turn, job creation in Ethiopia.36

             The lower price garnered for rough on the international market also meant that
             exporting rough opal, as opposed to the more expensive polished opal, was
             preventing Ethiopia from building its foreign currency reserves at a faster pace. This
             latter point was of particular significance to the MoMPNG, whose advertised
             mandate includes working to ensure that Ethiopia’s minerals industry increases by
             tenfold (from 2015) its contribution to the nation’s foreign currency reserves by
             2020 to 2023 (see Figure 237).

             The law was thus designed to bring about a swift end to the exporting of value
             adding business opportunities by indirectly forcing exporters to cut and polish their
             rough inside Ethiopia, whether by establishing their own lapidary businesses, or out-
             sourcing the job to independent lapidaries. The proposed law was, however, delayed
             indefinitely in August 2013 as officials became concerned that gemstone exports
             would plummet were it introduced.38 The short-lived nature of the proposed law, and
             the serious impact it would likely have had on the ASM sector 39 and official
             gemstone exports, was a product of several things, including:

                       The inability of many exporters to access the necessary finance to establish
                        robust lapidary businesses;40
                       A lack of recognition of the fact that Ethiopia simply did not have enough
                        people trained in gemstone lapidary to provide exporters with the necessary
                        workforce to establish functional lapidary businesses, or out-source large
                        volumes of rough to external lapidaries, and thus maintain their previous
                        export levels;41
                       A lack of recognition of how much time is required to develop high-level
                        lapidary skills, particularly when they have to be internationally competitive
                        against doyens of this practice, like India;42
                       A lack of recognition of the fact that the lapidary skills that did exist in the
                        country when the law was introduced, which were primarily products of
                        training provided in the Amhara region, were not of a high enough calibre to
                        compete with countries like India. This meant that the comparatively poorly
                        cut stones coming out of Ethiopia would not have been well received on the
                        international market, and thus would have commanded lower prices anyway (a
                        problem that is still occurring, as this report will show);43
                       The fact that the government was not doing enough to nurture the
                        development of domestic lapidary businesses either prior to the law’s
                        introduction, or in its direct aftermath;44 and


             38   Araya, E. 2013, August 4.
             39   Some members of ASM sector would have likely found it extremely challenging to sell their output, as
             exporters struggled to meet the requirement for cutting and polishing and in turn reduced their
             purchases of rough.

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


                       A lack of recognition of the law’s creation of a huge incentive to simply
                        smuggle rough opals out of Ethiopia’s porous borders—a practice that the
                        government is still struggling to control.45

             Therefore, while the introduction of the law was motivated by a desire to encourage
             the organic development of a domestic gemstone cutting and polishing industry that
             could add value to Ethiopia’s opals prior to export, it lacked the necessary planning
             and associated institutional capacity building to enable this industry to properly
             establish itself and thrive.

             After the proposed law was dropped, exporters were subsequently required to export
             a minimum of 10% of their opal as cut and polished and a maximum of 90% as
             rough. Between 2013 and 2015, this was gradually increased to 20:80, and then to
             40:60, where it resides now (hereafter referred to as the 40:60 rule). Thus, the
             government is still keen on promoting domestic value adding for Ethiopia’s opal
             exports, but understands that capacity to do this will take time to develop.46 (Table 1
             shows the volumes of Ethiopia’s recent cut and polished opal exports).

             Table 1 Total exports of cut and polished opal financial years 2013-1547


                                         Polished opal
                                         Year               Kg                 USD million
                                         2013/14            114.457            2.49
                                         2014/15            194.52             4.827



             Opinions are mixed, however, on the efficacy of the 40:60 rule; some stakeholders
             believe it encourages domestic beneficiation,48 whereas others argue it simply further
             incentivises rough opal smuggling, which is estimated to be greater than official
             exports.49 As this report will show, the costs of setting up a lapidary business and
             finding adequately skilled cutters and polishers remain significant hurdles for
             exporters to overcome. It is simply more profitable to smuggle rough to major

             manufacturing hubs like Jaipur, India where skilled labour already exists in
             abundance—no investment thus has to be made in hiring and training staff, or
             buying the necessary equipment. The suggested scale of gemstone smuggling has
             also no doubt been enabled by the government’s abovementioned lack of capacity
             in the policing of its borders. 50 (See the supply chain and international market
             analyses in Chapters 2 and 4 respectively for further analysis of these important
             issues).

             Gemstones other than opal are also mined by the ASM sector in Ethiopia, which
             produced almost 58,000kgs of these gems in 2014/15.51 Based on these figures, and
             the estimated number of miners in the opal sector, the non-opal ASM sector is likely
             to be greater than 15,000 people (accounting for the lower prices that are typically
             commanded for the high volume, low value gems like jasper, agate, etc., which will
             attract fewer people to the industry). Table 2 shows government figures for opal and
             non-opal gemstone exports over the past five years, indicating that they have grown
             significantly during that time.

             exports out of Africa totalled approximately USD152 million.54 While this figure is
             likely to have grown, 55 Ethiopia is nonetheless a significant player in the African
             coloured gemstone industry today.

                    1.2. Purpose of Report

             This scoping study of Ethiopia’s coloured gemstones industry was commissioned by
             The World Bank to shed light on the following:

                       The present state of the industry, primarily in commercial and social
                        development terms;
                       Which features of the industry and its governance are either improving or
                        limiting its commercial success, and why; and
                       The key ‘lessons learned’ from what other gemstone producing countries
                        around the world have done to commercialise this industry, and how they
                        could be constructively applied to the Ethiopian context.

             The study was motivated by The World Bank’s recognition of the MoMPNG’s
             desire to further develop its coloured gemstone sector, and the five-year plan it
             launched in January 2015 with that goal in mind. A clearer understanding of the
             commercial realities of this sector and how it is governed will improve The World
             Bank’s ability to potentially work with the MoMPNG to help it realise its objectives
             for this important industry.

             This report’s case study analyses of Afghanistan, Australia, Brazil, Madagascar,
             Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Tanzania identify the ways in which these countries have
             worked to establish functional coloured gemstone industries and improve their
             commercialisation. Like Ethiopia, some of those countries are developing, while
             others have long histories of strong economic performance. Positive and negative
             lessons can be learnt from these case studies in terms of how these countries have
             realised, or struggled to realise, their goals, and both are valuable for illuminating the
             path that Ethiopia could potentially take.

             The World Bank and the MoMPNG may use this study to help inform the
             development of Ethiopia’s coloured gemstone sector. It may also be used to inform
             a larger study into options for developing Ethiopia’s gemstone sector, noting the
             relatively small size of this study. This report provides as much information as is
             reasonably possible within time and budgetary limitations, but importantly, where it

             55   Particularly given the success of Gemfields’ operations in Africa, and the growing demand for
             coloured gemstones globally.

             cannot fill an information gap, it gives a view on what measures could be taken to fill
             noted information gaps in any subsequent research projects.

                1.3. Research approach / methodology

             The methodology used for this study included document analyses, semi-structured
             interviews, site visits and expert reviews.

             Relevant laws, government-provided statistics, previous studies, and journal and
             newspaper articles were consulted for background information on Ethiopia’s
             coloured gemstone industry. Semi-structured interviews were carried out in person
             with gem traders in Bangkok and Hong Kong; government officials, lapidary license
             holders, and gem exporters in Addis Ababa; and government officials, the Dean of
             the Kombolcha Polytechnical College responsible for lapidary training and lapidary
             training graduates, opal brokers and miners in the Amhara Region (Kombolcha,
             Dessie and Delanta). The goal of these interviews was to gain insights into the nature
             of the current operating environment in Ethiopia’s coloured gemstones sector, and
             the government’s policies and plans for this industry (Table 3 demonstrates the
             stakeholder mapping process utilised in the research planning stage).

             In total, the following number of Ethiopian gemstone industry stakeholders were
             formally interviewed in person: two government officials from the MoMPNG; eight
             lapidary licence holders/exporters in Addis Ababa; 13 Ethiopian opal traders in
             Bangkok and Hong Kong; one broker in Delanta, two lapidarists in Delanta, one
             lapidarist in Kombolcha, one government official in Dessie, two government officials
             in Delanta, plus a group of ca. 15-20 opal miners in Delanta. The researchers also
             discussed Ethiopia’s coloured gemstones industry with numerous experts from civil
             society and the private sector to gather background information and additional
             insights.

             In addition, tours of the main jewellery district in Addis Ababa, and a field visit to the
             lapidary training facilities in Kombolcha, as well as an opal mine site and lapidary
             businesses in Delanta were carried out to observe the type of jewellery being sold to
             the local market, and the state and operation of the mines and training facilities.

             The questions developed by the researchers sought to determine the following:

                       The numbers involved in this industry in Ethiopia;
                       The thought that goes into, and the motivations behind, the government’s
                        regulation of, and plans for, this sector;
                       The realities of the business opportunity in the downstream gemstone sector;
                       The quality of, and motivations behind, value-addition that occurs in-state,
                        and who performs it; and
                       What lapidaries and exporters would like to see changed at macro and micro
                        levels to aid in the growth of their businesses.

             All interviews were triangulated and anonymised (to promote frank and full
             disclosures) and de-identified as required (to protect study participants). In instances

             where researchers were not able not triangulate statements made by interviewees,
             but those statements were nonetheless believed to contain relevant insights into the
             gemstone industry in Ethiopia, they have been clearly presented in this report as
             being attributable to only one interviewee. They should be viewed through that lens.

             The country case studies (Afghanistan, Australia, Brazil, Madagascar, Nigeria, Sri
             Lanka, Tanzania) were chosen on account of each country’s experience with
             domestic gemstone production, and associated beneficiation efforts. They shed light
             on the experiences of other states in relation to the promotion of domestic
             gemstones, the development of necessary skills and capacity within domestic
             gemstones manufacturing industries, and how long that process can take, and the
             common challenges associated with the growth of such industries. Each of the
             country case studies was either written by a country expert, or reviewed by one prior
             to publication. Country experts from these countries were also consulted during the
             research stage.

                    1.3.1. Scope

             This study’s focus is largely on the downstream sector of Ethiopia’s gemstone
             supply chain, including lapidaries and exporters. It briefly explores the upstream
             mining sector, the symbiotic relationship between upstream and downstream, and
             how that inter-dependency is currently functioning. It also examines the MoMPNG,
             the ministry responsible for the licencing of exporters and lapiadries, and the Sub-
             Regional Mining Bureaus of the South Wollo Zone and the Delanta Woreda. Given
             the prominent role that opals have in Ethiopia’s gem industry they are the focus of
             the study and the state’s other gemstones feature only briefly in the analysis.
             Nonetheless, the study’s findings in relation to opal are largely applicable to other
             gemstones    produced     in   the   country,      and     the   issues   surrounding   their
             commercialisation.

             The study’s examination of the development path that other nation-states have
             pursued to maximise value from their opal sector (Australia) and coloured gemstone
             sector (Afghanistan, Brazil, Madagascar, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Tanzania) is designed to
             provide examples for Ethiopia on actions it could take to help foster the
             development of a resilient coloured gemstone industry.

             2. Commercial Situational Analysis

                   2.1. Supply Chain

             The typical supply chain of gemstones in Ethiopia as reported to the researchers is
             Miners’ Association—Broker—Lapidary—Exporter (the latter two stages are often
             encapsulated in a vertically integrated company). This is likely to be a contracted
             version of what actually exists; excluding the additional trading that typically takes
             place between the miners and the miners’ cooperatives, the miners’ cooperatives
             and the brokers, and the brokers and the lapidaries/exporters. 56 Miners are also
             known to sell direct to exporters who set up temporary buying offices near mine sites
             and surrounding towns, so creating even shorter supply chains.57 Opal mine locations
             include Dima Shenga, Gelbate, Koke Weha, Minch, Beskea Giorgia and Alehuwat.

             The profits made on rough by traders and brokers can be enormous. For example, it
             was reported by one exporter that traders and brokers would regularly buy a kilo of
             rough opal from miners or miners’ associations for ETB2000 (USD95) and would sell
             in Addis Ababa for ETB80000 (USD3800)—a gross profit of 3900%.58 It is important to
             note that this was only one interviewee that reported such inflated profits, however
             researchers were often told that miners are severely underpaid by brokers. Although
             transporting the rough to Addis Ababa can take up to three days due to the very
             poor quality of the roads (a trip that should take no more than eight hours),59 this
             burden alone does not account for the brokers’ alleged inflated profits. Instead,
             they are likely to be enabled by the existence of the following in the upstream sector
             of the supply chain:

                   1. Asymmetric information about the true value of the rough;60
                   2. Poverty (the mining motivation is often survival, not profit);61 and
                   3. A buyers’ market, due to the over-supply of opal.

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


             To elaborate, researchers found that the miners often do not know the true value of
             what they are selling, and their poverty and the abundance of opal on the market do
             not afford them the luxury of demanding larger payments—buyers can always go
             elsewhere to find cheaper rough. (This is in direct contrast to the situation in opal
             mining communities in Australia, as is explored in Chapter 5). The struggles
             experienced by the ASM sector and their limited knowledge of what they are selling
             will be further explored below. The issue of the oversupply of opal will be analysed in
             the sections of this report that examine gemstone smuggling out of Ethiopia
             (Chapters 2, 3 and 4), and the role of large companies in gemstone buying, cutting
             and polishing, and exporting (Chapters 2 and 4).

             Ethiopia’s key trading and exporting hub is Addis Ababa, which, on account of the
             40:60 rule, is also the country’s main cutting and polishing area. According to
             government records, to date the MoMPNG has issued 203 precious mineral export
             competence certificates. The Amhara region is the second largest lapidary hub; to
             date, 68 and 20 lapidary licenses have been issued by the MoMPNG and Amhara
             regional mining bureau, respectively. 70 opal brokerage licenses have also been
             issued by Amhara regional mining development bureau.62

                   2.2. Value Chain and Commercial Challenges

                        2.2.1. Overview

             The gemstone value chain in Ethiopia begins at the miners, who add value by
             extracting the minerals from the ground, and washing and sorting them. Researchers
             were told by one exporter in Addis Ababa that the way in which miners mine the
             opal, using shovels and picks, breaks the rough into smaller pieces that are worth
             less; thus, they require training on the use of commercially sensitive mining
             techniques.63 However, one gem trader in Asia argued that the miners are getting
             better at identifying quality rough. 64 (This issue will be explored further in the
             recommendations at the end of this chapter.) The traders and brokers add value by
             further sorting the rough, and transporting it to buying hubs, like Addis Ababa. The
             lapidary centres add value by sorting, and cutting and polishing, while the exporters
             further sort both polished and rough, find markets for the gemstones, and ship them
             internationally. All of the exporters with whom researchers spoke had their own
             lapidary factory; however, it is also common for exporters to buy cut and polished

             (The threats posed to the industry by illegal [unlicensed] lapidary workshops will be
             explored below).

             Jewellery manufacturing that includes the use of Ethiopian gemstones is currently
             limited in Ethiopia; the majority of jewellery stores sell gold and silver jewellery that is
             not set with gemstones. However, the small number of jewellers that do work with
             Ethiopian gemstones add value by setting them in silver and gold pieces, for sale
             locally or internationally. The majority of added value in the form of jewellery
             manufacturing takes place in India, China and Thailand, where Ethiopia’s gemstones
             are set in gold or silver, and sometimes in cheaper metals, such as stainless steel and
             amalgamated tin, before being sold on the international market.

             The following analyses the coloured gemstone value chain (with a particular focus on
             opal), and the commercial potential thereof, as assessed by the study’s researchers
             during their time in Ethiopia.

                       2.2.2. Miners65

             One opal mine site close to Delanta was visited to get an indicative view of opal
             production as the basis of value addition further down the supply chain. The mine
             site is operated legally by a cooperative, which was founded and formalised in 2012.
             It started with 350 members, and has grown to 430 members today. The large
             majority of members, if not all, are inhabitants of Delanta (all of them male).

             The mine is situated in the side of a steep mountain wall, at an elevation of around
             2,800 meters above sea level. It is accessible from Delanta by a 30-45 minute walk
             along a small mountain path. The cooperative currently operates 25 tunnels, dug
             horizontally into the mountain wall. Each tunnel is worked by a team of 10 members
             and can be up to 100 meters long. It takes the miners around two years to dig a
             tunnel that long. The miners use very basic, non-mechanised tools such as shovels
             and small picks. There is no degree of mechanisation, as not even generators or
             pumps/fans (for oxygen and fresh air) are used. All tools are self-made.

             The miners see their lack of mining tools and equipment as their biggest challenge
             and stated that first and foremost, they need more and better equipment and
             technology, rather than training. They also mentioned that they expose themselves
             to high risks, such as tunnel collapses, and would like to improve their situation in
             terms of health and safety.

             65   The information presented here is based on a focus group with around 20 miners of a cooperative at
             their mine site.

             The miner teams work on their own money and business risk; if they do not find any
             opal, they go without payment. According to them, they do not receive pre-financing
             either from the brokers or the cooperative. This creates difficulties especially for the
             period when the miners remove the overburden, which takes an investment of
             around ETB10,000-15,000 (USD468-702) according to the miners. They usually use
             the money from previous sales to open new tunnels. The cooperative is apparently
             not used as a savings mechanism, and the miners state that they do not benefit from
             the cooperative structure except that it allows them to operate legally and receive
             receipts for their sales. They also mentioned that there were issues with the
             cooperative management, which result from the Government’s current plan to
             transit the cooperatives into SMEs. (The government stated in its review of this report
             that it is working to establish these cooperatives as a means of “creating a system
             to manage and control illegal mining activities.” Recommendations for further
             research into the efficacy of this model are explored at the end of this chapter.)

             The miners state that production is currently not as good as it used to be, and that
             they have to advance deeper and deeper into the mountain to find the mineralised
             layer. The accessed deposits appear now to have been almost depleted, but when
             the miners started, they were able to produce around 2-3kg of rough opal (of various
             qualities) per tunnel per month (a total of ca. 50-75kg per month). The miners have
             started looking for a new site and stated that they know of a mine with good
             production in the vicinity, but that this site is operated informally, and by people
             from a neighbouring area who do not allow them to mine there.

             When the miners find opal, the team leader collects the stones and takes them to the
             cooperative’s office in Delanta. Once the rough is sold on to brokers in Delanta, the
             team leader distributes the proceeds according to his team members’ shares. The
             miners usually conduct basic sorting before selling the rough. They stated that they
             assess the quality of the opals by sorting them according to colour and size (no other
             features like play-of-colour, clarity, weight, or hydrophaneity were mentioned). The
             miners did not seem to find that they get unfair prices for their products, and stated
             that their situation is better since there are some legal brokers (they did not say
             whether this is related to their financial situation or other factors). However, this
             could simply be a case of their not recognising that they are being exploited. The
             Mining Bureau Coordinator of the South Wollo Zone stated that miners often lack
             the knowledge of what they are selling and thus do not earn good prices.

             Furthermore, he argued that brokers and exporters typically hold most of the
             bargaining power in trading relationships.66

                        2.2.3. Gemstone Brokers67

             There have been encouraging developments in the trading segment of the industry
             in the last few years, as a number of gemstone brokers have decided to formalise
             their businesses. The trader interviewed in Delanta stated that he had worked illegally
             before, but decided to get a license when the government introduced this possibility
             six years ago. The broker buys and sells only rough gemstones, as the brokerage
             license only allows trade in rough. This seems to be a gap in the legal framework; this
             licencing restriction forces lapidaries to sell their product directly to the exporters in
             Addis, which is far from their business location.

             The broker interviewed is not pre-financed by exporters or other traders, and uses his
             own capital to buy the rough. He stated that he travels to Addis twice a month to sell
             his stones. His business seems to be going well, and the government benefits from it
             too: the broker indicated that he paid ETB270,000 income tax in 2013, and
             ETB200,000 in 2014. Given that the Ethiopian income tax is a maximum of 35%, the
             broker’s yearly income could be at least ETB771,429 (USD36,735), a figure that is
             well above the national average of USD1,600.68

             Nevertheless, the broker mentioned several challenges that are hindering the growth
             of his business. Firstly, the MoMPNG has set a minimum exporting price for rough
             opal (depending on its weight, and perceived size, colour and quality—attributes that
             are assessed by the MoMPNG), which has the following impacts on the market:

                       The minimum export price is often too high—far above what is commanded
                        on the international market;
                       Because of the high prices often put on lower quality goods, for most
                        exporters it is only profitable to export the highest quality opal (at least
                        formally), which means that there is almost no (formal) market demand for the
                        lower quality material; and
                       Since high quality opal makes up only approximately 1% of total production, a
                        large proportion of opal is rejected by buyers, or sold through illegal channels.

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


             These issues can result in wasted market potential. It is thus unsurprising that the
             MoMPNG’s opal pricing policy was a common grievance raised by various supply
             chain actors during the study, including brokers, exporters, and international gem
             traders (buyers), the latter two of which will be explored in greater detail below.

             A second challenge for brokers is the taxation requirements, and tax evasion by other
             industry stakeholders. According to the broker, opal miners often do not put the
             correct price on the receipt when they make a sale, because taxes are leveraged
             based on the figures contained in their receipts. This will leave the broker with a
             much higher profit on paper than he actually makes, which in turn means he has to
             pay more taxes. For example, if he buys rough opal from the miners for ETB70,000,
             they might give him a receipt for ETB20,000. When he then sells the rough to the
             exporter for ETB90,000, he will have made a profit of ETB70,000 on paper (while in
             reality it is only ETB20,000), on which he is required to pay taxes. The broker argued
             that there was not much he could do about this; refusing to engage with the miner/s
             who use these tactics would likely mean that they would just sell their rough to other
             brokers (who mostly operate illegally), restricting his market access.

             It could be the case that in relation to the illegal sector, it is a buyer’s market, as
             they are freer to operate without the necessary paperwork. For brokers trying to act
             legally, it is a seller’s market, as miners can always go elsewhere (i.e. sell to people
             who do not demand accurate receipts). This broker also admitted that this is the
             reason why he often sells to exporters without a receipt, in an arrangement where
             the exporter agrees not to issue a receipt, in return for a 10% reduction of the sale
             price to the broker. This is an issue that needs to be addressed urgently, as it appears
             to force even legal actors into illegality. This will be further explored in the
             recommendations.

             Another challenge for brokers is competition from illegal traders and brokers, who
             appear to account for the majority of actors in the segment of the supply chain.
             Lastly, the broker faces difficulties in cash flow, as he often sells to exporters on
             credit and they apparently do not pay him back in time. In the broker’s view, this is
             an issue of trust. He explains that most of the exporters in Addis are Indian (and are
             well-financed) and that he cannot sell to Ethiopian exporters (whom he would
             implicitly trust more to pay him back on time).

                    2.2.4. Lapidary training centres: Kombolcha

             Originally, seven lapidary training centres were established in the Amhara Region in
             2009, each embedded in the local Polytechnical Colleges. According to the Dean of
             the Kombolcha Polytechnical College, however, all the other colleges have stopped

             running lapidary courses, and in the past three years, the Kombolcha Polytechnical
             College has been the only one offering this type of training. The College in
             Kombolcha provides vocational education on 10 different professions to a total of
             2,000 students taught by 150 teachers.

             Since lapidary training in Kombolcha was established in 2009, a total of 300 students
             have graduated. The training includes two types of courses: a standard course with
             three levels that takes up to 1.5 years to complete, provided to students who are
             selected on a competitive basis; and a short-term course which is designed to
             provide around 30-45 days of vocational training for the unemployed in order to
             facilitate their entry into the labour market. The short-term course is operated by the
             Ministry for Small- and Medium-Scale Enterprises, which also allocates course to the
             short-term students.

             The curriculum for the Standard Course includes the following modules:

                   Acquiring and identifying gemstones (based on physical properties)
                   Operating basic machines and equipment
                   Gemstone slabbing
                   Gemstone tumbling
                   Gemstone polishing
                   Cabochon making
                   Bead making
                   Faceting
                   The students would graduate by finishing a final project (e.g. the cutting of a
                    specific shape) and presenting on it.

             The lapidary workshop at the Kombolcha College fits approximately 40 students and
             is equipped with basic cutting and grinding machines, as well as polishing machines
             with three types of polishing blades. The polishing machines and blades are
             imported, while some of the cutting machines are produced by the College’s own
             machinery and mechanics department. Significant value addition to the overall
             economy can come from enhancing both the forward links, like cutting and
             polishing, and the backward links, like the domestic production of equipment and
             technology (both for mining and for lapidary). This needs to be regarded as a long-
             term process, as the machinery and technology needs to be fit for purpose and
             continuously improved upon to reach internationally competitive levels.

             The lapidary training at the Kombolcha Polytechnical College is currently not
             operational because the current teacher ‘fell sick’, which could not be confirmed.
             The training had been provided by only one teacher—one of the biggest challenges

             has been finding qualified teachers for such courses. The TVT is currently trying to
             find a replacement for the previous teacher, but this recruitment process is not
             without difficulties. When the lapidary courses were established at the Polytechnical
             Colleges, the teachers were recruited from universities, often with an academic
             background in related subjects such as geology, physics, and geography. They were
             then given an introductory lapidary course in Bahir Dar, the Amara regional capital,
             which they had to pass in order to become teachers at the Colleges. This highlights
             the bigger challenge of a lack of qualified (Ethiopian) teachers with the necessary
             practical experience and skills to teach lapidary courses in gemstone cutting and
             polishing. This will be further explored in the recommendations at the end of this
             chapter.

             The employability of the lapidary training graduates remains a challenge. According
             to the Dean of the Kombolcha Polytechnical College, a few of the 300 graduates have
             opened their own lapidary businesses in their home regions after finishing the
             training course, but detailed statistics on post-training employment rates are not
             available. The South Wollo Zone Mining Bureau Coordinator stated that after
             graduating from the lapidary training, some of the graduates had tried to formalise
             and establish their business, but did not have enough finance to build a business,
             acquire opal or other semi-precious stones, and continue working in this
             profession.69 However, over the past few years, the Dean of the Polytechnical College
             has noted an increase in demand for the lapidary graduates, which he ascribes to the
             Government’s 40:60 rule, which may have resulted in some of the graduates finding
             employment with the Addis based exporters (though statistics or evidence of this are
             not available).

             Another significant challenge for the Kombolcha Polytechnical College and its
             lapidary training courses is budget constraints, 70 which manifests itself in several
             ways. First, the lapidary training centre is not able to acquire the necessary high
             quality machines and technology. Second, it does not have the financial means (nor
             the knowledge and networks) to acquire the necessary training materials, as opal is
             too expensive. Therefore the training centre is forced to use semi-precious and low-
             value stones for the training, which in turn means that the students do not acquire

                  The budget for the Polytechnical College is allocated by the Regional Government. Within the College,
             70


             there is no clear percentage allocated to each of the professions (according to the Dean, it is done
             ‘based on need’). For the lapidary training, there is a cost-sharing arrangement with the students of
             the long-term course; they pay ETB40 per month for their training. Short-term students do not pay fees
             for the course.

             skills in cutting and polishing opal, which is more precarious and difficult to handle
             than other stones. This means, in effect, that the training currently provided does not
             build the skills necessary to aid in the realisation of the government’s 40:60 policy
             in the opal sector. How these problems could be overcome is explored in the
             recommendations at the end of this chapter.

                       2.2.5. Lapidaries and Exporters

                           2.2.5.1.    Addis Ababa

             To meet the legal requirements for establishing a lapidary business in Addis Ababa,
             one must be a citizen of Ethiopia and obtain the necessary licence from the
             MoMPNG. This is a relatively simple process, according to all interviewees. Licenced
             lapidary holders are by law allowed to buy gemstone cutting and polishing
             machinery duty-free. However, three of the lapidaries researchers interviewed did not
             seem to be aware of this allowance. This could be because they had not taken the
             time to make themselves familiar with the laws that govern their sector, or that they
             were not actually in possession of a lapidary licence and were operating illegally, and
             were thus unable to access this tax break. Either way, this incentive is perhaps not
             being communicated effectively by the government, to ensure that established legal
             businesses are better able to grow, and illegal operators recognise the financial
             benefits of formalisation. Regardless of whether or not they had utilised this tax
             break, all of the lapidary licence holders with whom the researchers spoke about
             machinery said that the costs of such equipment were very high, averaging USD4,000
             per piece.71

             It is important to note that foreigners who nominally export gemstones legally are
             usually married to Ethiopian citizens who actually hold the required licences to
             export the goods. A less common practice is foreigners ‘leasing’ export licences
             from Ethiopian citizens.

             In contrast to the ease with which lapidaries can meet legal requirements, setting up
             an operational lapidary business was reported as being extremely challenging by all
             interviewees. The most commonly reported challenge was finding sufficiently trained
             staff for cutting and polishing gemstones, and then further training them in order to
             bring their skill levels up to an internationally competitive standard. It was a common
             complaint of interviewees that the cutters and polishers they have hired are not
             producing to a high enough standard, even though the majority have received
             training in the Amhara region’s gemstone cutting and polishing training centres.

             In relation to the business challenges that they have experienced, two lapidary
             licence holders said that their international customers had complained about the
             poor quality of the cutting and polishing performed on the stones they had bought.
             Some of their customers had even gone so far as to re-cut and polish the goods they
             bought prior to re-sale on the international market.73 (This issue was reinforced in
             interviews with traders in Hong Kong and Bangkok, several of whom complained
             about the quality of finished gemstones coming out of Ethiopia, the fact that they
             often had to recut them, and how they would prefer to simply cut and polish rough

             opal in their own factories in India). 74 When cutting and polishing is sub-par
             international buyers typically want to pay less for the stones; they may be more
             difficult to sell on the market, or if they wish to have them re-cut they must incur
             additional costs. This can result in financial losses for the exporter. The impact of this
             can be exacerbated if buyers want to renegotiate prices after the sale has been
             completed (and they have seen the sub-par gemstones). Considering the current
             foreign currency requirements for international sales (as further explored below), this
             can put lapidaries/exporters in a difficult financial situation.

             The MoMPNG has identified “market access problems for value added gemstones
             which can affect the export earning (sic)” as a key challenge in its five-year plan for
             the minerals sector.75 It is unclear, however, as to whether this refers to the limited
             market access that can be caused by sub-par value adding, or the challenge of
             finding new international buyers for cut and polished gemstones to replace former
             rough customers. Regardless, the MoMPNG does not outline a specific plan to
             overcome these market access problems, but, as abovementioned, does speak of its
             desire to establish a gemstone training institute. This issue will be further explored in
             the recommendations at the end of this chapter.

             The second most commonly mentioned challenge raised by interviewees in relation
             to establishing a successful lapidary business was accessing the necessary finance.76
             This is required in order to: i) buy sufficient rough to cut and polish; ii) buy the
             required machinery, such as cutting and polishing wheels, bead drilling machines,
             and faceting machines; and iii) hire international cutting and polishing trainers,
             especially from Jaipur, India, to teach their staff how to manufacture stones to an
             internationally competitive standard.

             The issue of being able to afford to buy enough rough underpins two major
             problems faced by some lapidaries in Ethiopia. Firstly, if they cannot afford to buy
             enough rough they cannot provide their cutters and polishers with sufficient
             gemstones to practice on and thus improve their skill levels. As the case study on the
             Australian opal industry will show, the key to developing capacity to cut and polish
             opal to a high standard is having a large enough volume to practice on: quantity is
             key. Thus, lapidary licence holders who struggle to access financing can also struggle
             to improve the quality of the cut and polished gemstones they sell to clients. In turn,

                                                                                                                   24

             unless they can find a client who is happy to consistently buy sub-par goods, they
             will likely find it challenging to maintain steady relationships with international
             buyers. And secondly, if lapidaries cannot afford to buy regular parcels of rough to
             manufacture, they cannot provide clients—whether international or local—with a
             reliable source of goods. This is not conducive to fostering strong client relationships,
             or promoting business growth.

             Another issue associated with accessing sufficient rough was raised by both
             lapidaries and exporters in Addis Ababa, and one gem trader in Asia. They explained
             that larger exporters operating in Ethiopia often enjoy an advantage as they are
             typically from large, established companies in India and have no problem accessing
             sufficient financing.77 This means that they not only can afford to buy more rough,
             but also more of the higher quality rough. Smaller companies and sole traders
             without this financial freedom can thus find it harder to establish relationships with
             brokers        and     secure     steady      supplies        of     rough.   This   issue   can    also
             prevent/disincentivise the entry of new businesses into the industry, in turn limiting
             competition and further bolstering the larger exporters’ grip on the industry.78

             Further exacerbating this problem is the fact that some exporters fund expeditions to
             mine sites to buy straight from the miners.79 This not only reduces their costs of
             business (by taking middlemen out of the supply chain) and further increases their
             buying power, but it also gives them better access to sources of rough. The
             dominance of select exporters was also argued by some interviewees to be the key
             reason why so much value adding is ‘exported’ out of Ethiopia to places like
             Jaipur, India.80 The impact this is also argued to have on the prevalence of treatments
             made to Ethiopian opals will be discussed below.

             Another financing issue that threatens the improvement of staff skill levels is the cost
             of hiring international trainers to improve cutting and polishing techniques. If
             lapidaries choose to bring in foreign trainers, they have to ask the MoMPNG to
             provide a letter of support to assist with the approval of the trainers’ visas and work
             permits. All interviewees who have brought in international trainers said that the
             MoMPNG was very helpful in that regard. These international experts usually train
             staff at the lapidaries for two or three months at a time. Two of the lapidary owners

             argued that this amount of time was sufficient for bringing their staff’s cutting and
             polishing skills up to an international standard, 81 whereas one other argued that
             reaching that level of expertise would be an extremely long process, requiring up to
             10 years of on-the-job training.82 Regardless, bringing in international trainers is an
             expense that several of the lapidaries interviewed for this study could not afford.

             The high costs of cutting and polishing machinery also both limits the number of
             staff that lapidaries can hire, and their ability to expand their product offerings.83 In
             relation to the first point, some interviewees spoke of a desire to hire more staff, but
             acknowledged that their inability to provide them with machinery would make this
             growth impossible. 84 This suggests that labour costs are a secondary concern to
             these businesses, demonstrating that the inability to buy the necessary machinery is
             potentially the key factor hindering job creation in the industry. In relation to the
             second point, the majority of lapidaries interviewed made minor variations on one
             style of polished gemstone: an oval-shaped cabochon that can be created with a
             standard cutting and polishing wheel. Their inability to buy other machinery, such as
             faceting machines or bead drilling machines, means that their product offerings are
             not very diverse. This impacts their ability to not only reach a broader international
             market, but also provide goods for the lower-end domestic market. Gemstones that
             are made into beads are typically of a lower quality, which is important to smaller
             lapidaries in Ethiopia for two key reasons: the rough is in turn cheaper to buy, and
             the potential domestic market is larger for cheaper bead jewellery (necklaces,
             bracelets) than it is for silver or gold jewellery set with larger cut and polished
             gemstones.

             Gem treatments carried out within Ethiopia were said to be rare by all of the
             exporters and lapidaries with whom researchers spoke. Researchers witnessed only
             one case of gem treatments taking place, which was the heating of polished opal
             under a lamp to enhance the stones’ colour (see Figure 4).

             It was argued by several interviewees that there simply does not exist within Ethiopia
             the skills, expertise or technology required to treat gemstones on any meaningful
             scale. Instead, the gem treatments are typically carried out in India, the most

             common being opal dyeing. (The fact that hydrophane opal is often highly
             absorptive makes it more likely to hold gem treatments such as dyeing).85



             It was argued by numerous stakeholders that these treatments are very bad for the
             reputation of Ethiopia’s opal industry on the whole. When consumers buy opals
             that have undisclosed treatments and the colour fades, Ethiopian opals are
             consequently eschewed en masse by buyers. However, it was also argued that the
             market is becoming more aware of this issue, which is forcing Indian traders to
             change tactics. As buyers become more diligent in checking for undisclosed
             treatments and avoiding dyed stones, some Indian traders have realised the short-
             term nature of their behaviour and have reverted to selling natural, untreated stones
             only. This alleged change in behaviour amongst some Indian traders could not be

                                                                            international buyers or Australian

                                                                            undisclosed     opal        treatments     are
                                                                            rare, while the latter said they were
                                                                            still common for Ethiopian goods.
                                                                            Nonetheless, it would seem logical

             It was argued by three of the exporters with whom researchers spoke that the level
             of control exerted by certain exporters over the gemstones industry in Ethiopia is a
             key reason why gemstone treatments are so prolific, and why the industry is
             struggling to flourish domestically.87 Two exporters said that these exporters exercise
             a ‘monopoly’,88 which is defined in economics as the dominance of one firm over

             an entire industry.89 However, in reality what these exporters are describing is more
             like an oligopolistic industry structure, in which multiple large firms in an industry are
             sizeable enough that their individual actions can significantly affect the viability of
             their competitors.90 In the case of the opal industry in Ethiopia, if large firms choose
             to smuggle gemstones, buy from unlicensed lapidaries, or sell opals with undisclosed
             gem treatments, their scale means that their actions will have a significant negative
             impact on the financial resilience of their competitors who choose to play by the
             rules. However, it is also important to note that even if all of the largest gem
             exporters in Ethiopia operated legally their financial strength would mean that they
             would still dominate the industry.

             If the government is unable to adequately disincentivise illegal conduct by enforcing
             relevant laws, the scales will arguably be further tipped towards incentivising illegal
             business conduct in Ethiopia’s coloured gemstones industry—companies who obey
             the law will find it increasingly difficult to remain competitive whilst doing so. One
             trader interviewed in Asia argued that violations of the 40:60 rule via gemstone
             smuggling could ultimately force the “good guys” to go underground with their
             exports, as they are rendered unable to compete while operating legally. 91 For
             example, one exporter in Ethiopia argued that unless the industry is more fairly
             balanced in favour of local companies, he will be forced to either go bankrupt and
             close down, or engage in illegal activity like some of his peers in order to remain
             competitive.92 Another gem trader in Asia argued that the 40:60 rule was making it
             difficult for his company to operate legally in Ethiopia. 93 The dominance of well-
             funded exporters and their impact on the industry will be further explored in the
             international market analysis in Chapter 4, and in the recommendations at the end of
             this chapter.

             The impact of undisclosed treatments on Ethiopia’s opal sector arguably goes
             beyond dampening consumer interest in the stones; it can also impact the legitimacy
             of black opal deposits apparently discovered in the country. The researchers were
             shown by two gem traders in Addis Ababa what they were told was untreated black
             opal mined in Ethiopia (see Figure 5).94

                                                              ‘fraudulent’ by some international buyers,
                                                              and indeed, some members of Ethiopia’s
                                                              gemstones sector, despite the fact that locally-
                                                              performed treatments are said to be rare. The
                                                              prevalence of undisclosed gemstone treatments
                                                              therefore effectively places a veil of uncertainty
                                                             over      the        whole    industry   in   relation    to

             The scale of exports of Ethiopian gemstones to India, and the subsequent lack of
             control Ethiopia has over how its gemstones are treated and sold, was put forward by
             three exporters as another reason why Ethiopia should develop its capacity to cut
             and polish its stones domestically. They argued that doing so would enable the
             industry to ensure that fewer of its gems are treated (and sold undisclosed as such),
             thus enabling the market to be more confident in Ethiopia’s output.96 This point
             was also made by one Australian opal expert, as will be explored in Chapter 5. This is
             likely true to some degree, given the comparative rarity of gem treatments carried
             out within Ethiopia.

             The lapidary training conducted by the Polytechnical Colleges has resulted in some
             encouraging developments. The three lapidaries interviewed in Kombolcha and
             Delanta stated that they had traded gemstones illegally previously, but decided to
             register and formalise their lapidary businesses after receiving short-term training in
             the Polytechnical Colleges in Kombolcha and Bahir Dar respectively. The lapidary
             based in Kombolcha received a loan of ETB7000 to start up his business (though with
             an interest rate of 16%)97, while those based in Delanta opened their businesses with

             their own capital.98 However, all of them appeared disillusioned and frustrated; their
             progress has not resulted in increased business opportunities, and they seemed to be
             considering going back to their previous illegal activities (though no one stated this
             explicitly).

             One of the lapidaries stated that his motivation for taking the training and entering
             into the legal economy was that he hoped to sell his value-added products (cut and
             polished stones, as well as jewellery with opal set in silver) for a higher price than his
             previous rough production.99 This hope has not been fulfilled to date. As another
             lapidary stated, “I don’t understand why my value-added cut and polished
             products sell for less than rough opal.”100

             There seem to be several reasons for this. The first is that the lapidaries lack the
             finance and capital to acquire high-quality opal (or even any kind of gemstones). One
             lapidary stated that he does not have the finance and the networks to compete
             against traders and buyers who are based in Addis and buy directly from the mines,
             bypassing the local lapidaries in the region. Because of this, he sometimes goes
             without raw materials for 3 months. 101 Two other lapidaries specified that it is
             especially the illicit supply chains from illegal mining sites to illegitimate traders that
             they cannot compete against, as these actors do not have to pay fees and taxes, and
             therefore buy more cheaply.102 (Apparently, the best grade of opal from Delanta can
             fetch up to ETB3,000 per gram.103) The Delanta-based lapidaries usually try to acquire
             their stones directly from the miners, while the Kombolcha-based lapidary acquires
             his gemstones based on trust relationships, by sending friends to the mines without
             pre-financing, and reimbursing them once he has sold his products.104

             Exacerbating the financial challenge is the fact that the lapidaries do not seem to
             have enough knowledge about opals or gemstones to judge their quality. Even
             though gemstone identification is part of the training on offer, the lapidaries in
             Delanta stated that they do not have sufficient skills in identifying and assessing the
             quality of the opals they buy. They felt that this makes them vulnerable to losing out
             on high quality products to Indian traders and exporters.105 One of the lapidaries

             almost went bankrupt because he bought bad quality gemstones from the miners
             without realising, and when he cut and polished it, the stones broke.106

             Although only one lapidary mentioned this, they seem to lack the skills to cut and
             polish gemstones to a high enough quality. 107 As stated above, the training
             programme is currently not able to elevate skills to a competitive level, due to the
             lack of qualified teachers and the use of only semi-precious stones. All of these
             factors result in a low demand for the lapidaries’ products. All of the interviewed
             lapidaries complained that there are no buyers, and one stated that sometimes the
             exporters offer such a cheap price for his products that he cannot even cover the
             costs of his journey to Addis.108

             Most of the time, the lapidaries still try to sell their products to exporters based in
             Addis, who send their representatives to the region to buy opal. They have no fixed
             commercial relationships and sell to whoever provides the best price. 109 The
             Kombolcha-based lapidary stated that he does not really have customers in
             Kombolcha, and that he only makes some sales at exhibitions; he had previously
             been invited by the Amhara Region SME Office to showcase his products in Addis.110
             Organising such trade fairs for regionally based lapidaries in Addis could be a way to
             support them and to create more market demand for their products.

             An additional challenge for the lapidaries is the cost of running a formalised
             business. One needs to be able to prove a capital reserve of ETB100,000 to be eligible
             for a license.111 The license itself costs ETB5,000 (one off) plus the transport costs to
             Bahir Dar 112 , where the Regional office issues the lapidary licenses. Additional
             business costs include ETB2,000-3,5000 per month for rent, electricity and water,113 as
             well as the expenses for the raw material. All three lapidaries invested in their own
             polishing machines (which cost them between ETB16,000 and ETB90,000), mostly
             using their own capital that they had acquired during their previous illegal trading
             activities.114 However, once a machine breaks, especially if it is an imported machine,
             they cannot find anyone with the right skills to fix it.115 To counter this challenge, in

             Kombolcha, the College’s lapidary workshop sometimes lets former graduates use
             its machines (without requiring a fee), and loans the machines to the newly
             established lapidary cooperatives of its graduates.116 Offering the training centres as
             service centres to graduates and local cutters and polishers could be another means
             of support for the industry, as well as a way for the College to regain some of its
             expenses through small fees.

                    2.3. Recommendations

             The following explores the key recommendations that have arisen from this study’s
             findings on Ethiopia’s coloured gemstones supply chain, and the challenges
             associated with value-addition therein. Each set of recommendations has been
             grouped according to its key theme.

             These recommendations are designed to be a starting point for further discussion on
             the issues illuminated above.

             Miners

             It is advised that regional governments take steps to engage miners in programmes
             that educate them about the value and characteristics of opal, and commercially
             sensitive mining techniques. The GIA is in the process of drafting and trialling a
             coloured gemstones handbook for this very purpose, and Ethiopia may be a good
             location for a pilot study. This should be further explored.

             Miners should also receive training on OH&S and safe mining practices, ideally under
             the advisory of qualified mining engineers. Although the miners interviewed for this
             study said that their lack of access to more tools was the key reason for their unsafe
             working conditions, training should also be provided alongside the provision of
             additional tools. The fact that miners may also be reducing the value of the rough by
             breaking it into smaller pieces would also not be addressed by the provision of
             additional tools, which would likely make their mining more destructive.

             The government also has a plan to help organise mining cooperatives into SMEs.
             Further research should be conducted into why the government has chosen this goal,
             what its expected risks and outcomes are, and how it plans to manage these.
             Furthermore, any established mining cooperative would need adequate business
             training on how their form of organisation can help them build resilience into their
             activities, mine more productively, and commercialise effectively.

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


             A potential solution to the challenges with cutting and polishing training could be
             the establishment of a close collaboration between the lapidary training centres and
             the gemstone industry. Given that the Government is determined to continue its
             policy of domestic value addition and enforce its 40:60 rule, exporters ultimately
             benefit from the lapidary training provided by the Polytechnical Colleges and thus
             could be asked to contribute to the building of domestic skills. Such collaboration
             would be in line with the policy of the Polytechnical Colleges, which states that 30%
             of the training should be at the school, while 70% should be acquired directly in the
             industry. However, according to the Dean of the Kombolcha College, the industry is
             usually reluctant to participate in such collaborations. He sees a need for the
             government to create a policy and enforce industry participation and contribution.
             Such arrangements for vocational training are common in many countries, where
             governments require companies to train people in certain professions and in return
             grant them benefits, such as tax reduction. Such arrangements could also be
             implemented by the Ethiopian government. For example, they could be enforced
             through the licensing process- in the process of obtaining a license, an exporter
             would have the option of formally agreeing to contribute (financially or otherwise) to
             domestic lapidary training, and in return receive certain benefits, including a
             reduction in the license fees, or a reduction in export tax.

             Allowing gemstone brokers to trade in cut and polished stones might help improve
             market access for the lapidaries trained and established in the regions, and reduce
             the appeal of trading illegally. This would fuel job creation and develop domestic
             expertise in cut/polished trading. However, it could also make supply chain due
             diligence / controls even harder.

             The struggle of lapidaries to find sufficiently skilled cutting and polishing teachers
             could be overcome via the implementation of a ‘train the trainer’ model. The
             experience of other countries (as will be explored) shows that foreign gemstone
             cutting experts are valuable for helping build capacity in this arena. Indian gemstone
             cutters could be hired to train a first generation of Ethiopian lapidaries, who would
             then in turn train further students at the Polytechnical Colleges. This way, a transfer
             of practical expertise and skill can be ensured, which over time would help Ethiopian
             lapidaries to become competitive internationally. This will require a long-term vision
             and strategy, since experience in other countries has shown that such skills building
             can require up to 25 years to come to fruition.

             Lapidary training institutes require more funding so they can afford to buy sufficient
             rough for students to practice on. This would help to ensure that graduands are
             better trained, and thus more capable of producing goods that would be competitive

             on the international market.              The government also needs to ensure that it is
             considering        the    whole     supply    chain      when       it   establishes   lapidary   training
             programmes. It is inadequate to funnel students into only one part of the industry
             (cutting and polishing) without considering the potential for training brokers/traders,
             or offering additional training to under-skilled lapidaries already working in Addis
             Ababa. There should also be a programme in place for systematising the introduction
             of students to actors downstream, to increase the likelihood of employment, and to
             make it easier to for lapidaries to find trained staff. Further research is required to
             determine how this would function.

             Taxes

             The government may want to reconsider its policy of allocating a minimum export
             price for rough opal, in order to disincentivise engagement in the black market for
             lower quality gemstones, which form the majority of total opal supply. Or
             alternatively, the government could invest in building lapidary skills for the
             manufacture of lower value stones which are more challenging and time consuming
             to work with; the limited availability of these skills is a key reason why cutting and
             polishing these goods overseas (namely, India) is currently so appealing for
             exporters.

             The government should not rely solely upon miners’ invoices in their determination
             of taxes payable. They should instead ensure that all copies of invoices —buyer, seller,
             government—match up, and if they do not, the person/business committing fraud
             should be dealt with in a way that would disincentivise their future engagement in
             such practices.117

             Illegal activities

             The government should regain control of its coloured gemstones industry from
             illegal exporters. Research should be carried out into illegal gemstone supply chains
             in Ethiopia, with the goal to identify their typical structure and common actors, their
             geographical profile, the loopholes (and vulnerable actors [miners, underpaid
             officials, etc.]) they exploit, and what motivates people to engage in this illegal trade.
             This information could then be used to develop an appropriate framework for
             systematically addressing this problem.

             The government needs to tackle illegal lapidary businesses, as they limit economic

             growth (via tax avoidance) and are undermining legitimate operators, which will
             potentially force them out of business. Exporters who are found to do business with
             unlicensed lapidaries should be fined at a level that is significant enough to
             disincentives this conduct. 118 Furthermore, exporters who are found to use illegal
             lapidaries should automatically be investigated for involvement in gemstone
             smuggling, given their established proclivity for breaking the law.

             Support for exporters and lapidaries

             The dominance of certain exporters in Ethiopia’s coloured gemstones industry
             should be addressed to enable the industry as a whole to flourish. Their dominance,
             which is largely enabled by their access to adequate financing, does the following:

                      Reduces competition in the industry (on the aggregate);
                      Increases the exporting of value-addition (and thus jobs); and
                      Arguably increases undisclosed opal treatments, which give Ethiopia’s largest
                       coloured gemstone export an undeserved bad reputation.

             However, it would be wrong to suggest that successful companies should be
             prevented from operating in the industry. They make an important financial
             contribution to the Ethiopian economy. It is instead recommended that research be
             carried out into how best to improve access to financing for smaller lapidaries and
             exporters, to enable their purchasing and manufacturing of rough.

             Lapidary businesses often require better access to finance. Ethiopian businesses are
             continually at a disadvantage compared to their larger, more established
             counterparts as a result of this challenge. Research should be conducted into
             possible funding models for lapidaries, potentially using those trialled by banks for
             the ASM sector for inspiration.119

             It is doubtful that Ethiopia can, in the short-medium term, control the occurrence of
             undisclosed opal treatments. It can, however, engage in better marketing to help
             communicate the attributes of natural Ethiopian opal with the goal to educate
             consumers, as will be further explored in the market analysis in Chapter 4, and in the
             Australian case study in Chapter 5. Nonetheless, it is important to note that if
             Ethiopia can develop sufficient cutting and polishing skills at home, it could
             eventually ‘cut out the middle-man’ (or a reasonable portion thereof) and sell
             directly to international markets like the US and Europe. This would not necessarily

             practice occurs.

             Infrastructure

             Major arterial roads in Ethiopia should be improved to increase the efficiency of
             transportation between mines and major trading hubs, thus reducing costs.

             3. Governance

                    3.1. Government Policy

             The MoMPNG is the key national agency that manages the coloured gemstone
             sector in Ethiopia. It carries out numerous tasks that are designed to govern and/or
             support the gemstone sector, including licencing exporters and lapidaries, pricing
             rough exports, approving visas for foreign trainers (cutting and polishing, and
             jewellery), and promoting Ethiopia’s gemstones to the international market.

             In addition to the 40:60 rule on opal exports, the MoMPNG has taken other steps to
             develop the coloured gemstone sector. In 2014, the Mineral Market and Value Chain
             Development Directorate (MMVCDD) was established within the                           MoMPNG.
             According to literature available on the MoMPNG website, the MMVCDD is tasked
             with developing Ethiopia’s minerals market strategy, and general industry
             development throughout the mineral supply chain. 120 The specifics of how the
             MMVCDD is planning to achieve these goals is lacking in the available literature.
             However, interviews with the MoMPNG shed some light on what the government
             plans to do to fulfil its mandate.

             According to government officials, the key component of the MMVCDD’s minerals
             market strategy for Ethiopia is ensuring that all relevant licences are granted to
             exporters and lapidaries in a timely manner.121 Several of the exporters with whom
             researchers spoke stated that the Ministry’s efficient licensing process was, in their
             experience, the key way in which the government supports the gemstone industry.122
             In addition to fulfilling its legal obligations to the gemstone industry, government
             representatives stated that the MMVCDD is also planning to establish, within the next
             five      to   six    years,   a    gemstone         training/gemmological   institute,   and   a
             gemstone marketing centre, both based in Addis Ababa.123

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


             In January 2015, the MoMPNG released the final draft of its five-year plan for the
             mining sector. In relation to the coloured gemstone industry, this plan includes
             achieving the following by 2020:124

                       Increasing total gemstone exploration from 34km2 to 289km2;
                       Establishing pilot coloured gemstone marketing centres in mining regions to
                        increase investment;
                       Establishing a Gemmology Research Institute;
                       Building a gemstones park (industrial);
                       Supporting stakeholders involved in value-addition, including the ASM sector;
                       Increasing the amount of value-addition for opal; and
                       Doubling the production of gemstones other than opal.

             The budget allocations of government are effective in illuminating where priorities lie
             in the implementation of policy. The best funded of the three goals that are directly
             referenced in the budget is gemstone exploration, which, according to the policy, will
             be assisted by airborne geophysical surveying, among other things. The second best
             funded is the establishment of the Gemmology Research Institute, which has the goal
             of increasing value addition in the country. However, in relation to the gemstone
             marketing centres the MoMPNG wants to establish, a mere ETB25,000 has been
             allocated to the project, or only USD1,200. This is an extremely small amount of
             money to allocate to such a considerable task. When the small budget for the
             gemstone marketing centres was raised with one MoMPNG official, no further
             information could be gleaned as to why this figure is so low. (By point of comparison,
             the Australian Opal Centre in Lightning Ridge, which is not government affiliated, is
             seeking to establish an opal marketing and education centre that it estimates will
             cost up to AUD4,000,000 (ETB61,327,824).125) The specifics of how the MoMPNG will
             realise the goals laid out in the five-year plan are also unclear. No work plan has yet
             been developed.

             In interviews with MoMPNG officials, it was stated that the MoMPNG wants to
             establish the gemmological institute in Addis Ababa as it would enable the training
             of cutters and polishers within the country’s major gemstone trading hub. The
             institute would also potentially enable broader knowledge sharing about gemstones
             within industry and government.126

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


                    3.2. Regional Government and Domestic Beneficiation

             Regional governments also play a role in the management of Ethiopia’s coloured
             gemstone industry, particularly in relation to domestic beneficiation. The Delanta
             Woreda Mining Office’s activities include keeping statistics on the licensees and
             calculating the royalties and taxes that need to be paid—information that is then
             passed on to the customs office. The Mining Office currently does not seem to
             provide extension services or technical support to miners, lapidaries or traders.127

             In general, representatives of the South Wollo Zone and Delanta Woreda Mining
             Offices were found to be much in favour of an increased focus on value addition in
             the gemstone sector. The South Wollo Zone Mining Bureau Coordinator mentioned
             the benefits that this could bring on several levels. It could help curb unemployment
             in the regions, provide revenue for the government and foreign currency for the
             economy, and help to curb illegality in the sector.128

             However, according to the Zone Office Coordinator, the government and the
             administration at the Zone level do not presently place much emphasis on value
             addition or the gemstone sector in general.129 Delanta is currently the only Woreda
             where the administration works specifically on gemstones,130 and there is a need for
             clear guidance across the government to prioritise the gemstone sector and value
             addition.131 This may be the reason why the Mining Bureaus do not currently provide
             many services in relation to value addition, other than issuing licenses. In the Amhara
             Region, there are currently 18 lapidary licenses (16 of which issued by the Regional
             Mining Office in Bahir Dar, two issued by the central Government), 46 licensed
             brokers, and 28 licensed opal mining cooperatives.132

             On the level of the Zone, the Mining Bureau’s mandate also includes administrating
             the Woreda level Mining Bureaus (which are responsible for work on the ground), the
             organisation of training for Woreda level officials (e.g. regarding geology, mining
             techniques, etc.), and supervising the mining sector (e.g. ensuring that mining is
             done according to regulations.) 133 The Zone Bureau Coordinator is aware of the
             challenges faced by the lapidary training centres at the Polytechnical College in
             Kombolcha and its graduates, particularly their need for finance to establish a

             business and acquire rough gemstones. He states that his Bureau is currently in
             discussion with the Polytechnical College to not only provide technical training (e.g.
             cutting and polishing), but also to support the students and graduates further, by
             training them in business management skills, money saving, etc. 134 This is a
             suggestion worth considering, but it is not clear how far advanced these discussions
             are.

                    3.3. Key Challenges

             In interviews, the MoMPNG spoke about its challenges enforcing licensing
             requirements, and managing gemstone smuggling (which it has previously said is
             occurring at a high rate135).136 The main reason given for the first of these difficulties
             was the very high rate of attrition within the Ministry’s staff; it was claimed that
             highly skilled staff (i.e. those with degrees in relevant fields) often stay in the job for
             only two to three months. The key reason they leave was said to be the poor rates of
             pay available within the public sector, which cannot compete with private sector pay
             scales. As a consequence, the MoMPNG sometimes finds itself unable to hold onto
             skilled staff, and any training provided to staff in relation to the gemstone sector is
             lost when they leave. This is also linked to a complaint made by several exporters
             that the MoMPNG would be better able to help develop the coloured gemstones
             industry if it had more staff who were trained in industry specifics.137 This issue will be
             further explored below.

             Ethiopia’s expansive and relatively porous borders were reported as being in part
             responsible for the high rates of smuggling across borders into Kenya and
             Djibouti.138 Several of the stakeholders spoken to during this research lamented the
             scale of gemstone smuggling out of Ethiopia. It was argued by three stakeholders
             that more gemstones are smuggled out of Ethiopia than are legally exported.139 One
             interviewee said that he had been told by his contacts in India that 10 tonnes of

             rough opal that had been smuggled out of Ethiopia in the previous week alone had
             just arrived in Jaipur.140

             The exporters who held the view that gemstone smuggling is prolific in Ethiopia
             argued that this practice is extremely harmful to their own businesses, as it has the
             following commercial impacts:141

                       The market is flooded with Ethiopian gemstones, especially opal, which
                        reduces their value;
                       They observe (at international trade fairs) international traders of Ethiopian
                        opal who can sell it more cheaply than they can, because they have not had to
                        incur costs associated with legitimate business operations (taxes, licences,
                        minimum wages, etc.); and
                       Smuggled gemstones are more likely to eventually have undisclosed
                        treatments (smoking, dyeing, heating) applied to them, which give Ethiopian
                        opal a bad reputation in the international market.142

             The MoMPNG argued that the main way it is seeking to combat gemstone
             smuggling is through an awareness-raising campaign at the mine level. The
             MoMPNG is going into ASM communities and telling miners that their mineral assets
             are extremely valuable, and once they are lost they cannot be replaced. This message
             is designed to encourage miners to sell to legitimate buyers. 143 However, it is
             questionable to as whether a message that requires a long-term economic outlook,
             and has potentially nationalist inclinations, can act as an effective incentive within
             impoverished mining communities in which a casino and/or hand-to-mouth
             mentality often reign(s) supreme.144 Miners also may not be able to properly identify
             legitimate traders and/or brokers, and doing so would not necessarily prevent these
             middlemen from selling the goods they have bought to smugglers anyway.
             Furthermore, our research suggests that some licenced exporters also smuggle rough
             (or ‘lease’ their licences out to people who do), so it is questionable as to whether
             this approach could have any meaningful impact on current levels of smuggling. This

             The Zone and Woreda level Mining Bureaus both face similar challenges in
             implementing their mandate. This includes mainly the lack of human, financial and
             logistical resources. The Offices do not have the personnel and the means of
             transport to supervise the sector effectively, and often they are unable to travel to
             mine sites or hold meetings with stakeholders on the ground.145 In addition, they
             have difficulties providing technical support to their stakeholders in the sector, as
             they lack knowledge and capacity themselves. Both Offices stated a need for training
             and capacity building of officials in terms of geology, mining techniques,
             identification and valuation of gemstones, or the topic of value addition in general.146

             An additional challenge faced by both Woreda and Zone level Mining Offices is the
             continued presence of illegal mining and trading activities in the gemstone sector.
             They have difficulties monitoring and controlling these activities, since valuable
             gemstones are easily hidden, transported and smuggled out of the country.147 The
             regional government representatives see a great need in tighter control of the sector
             and the supply chain, and suggest that better market linkages should be created
             between legal miners, brokers and exporters.148

                    3.4. Recommendations

             The following explores key recommendations that have arisen from this study’s
             findings on Ethiopia’s coloured gemstones supply chain, and the challenges
             associated with value-addition therein. Each set of recommendations has been
             grouped according to its key theme.
             These recommendations are designed to be a starting point for further discussion on
             the issues illuminated above.
             Gemmological institute
             Given the goal of the MMVCDD, it is advised to utilise the existing cutting and
             polishing, bead drilling and faceting machinery in lapidary training institutes in the
             Amhara region (and beyond), the vast majority of which is currently lying idle.
             Partnerships with the private sector should also be explored to help link trained
             lapidaries in this region to buyers, and improve the calibre of training on offer (by
             identifying key areas of weakness from a private sector perspective).

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


             Given the high rate of attrition within the MoMPNG it is advised that efforts also be
             made to study the challenges associated with staff retention, and explore how they
             could be addressed. Analysing the disparities between pay scales at the MoMPNG
             and those for comparable jobs within the private sector could be a key starting point.
             Surveying staff to identify key areas of workplace satisfaction and dissatisfaction is
             also important. There may be ways of improving staff retention without having to
             compete with the private sector’s pay scales. Indeed, it is unusual for governments
             to compete with the pay scales of the private sector; staff retention is often facilitated
             by offering a better work/life balance (compared to the private sector), subsidised
             tertiary study and additional training. The workplace culture of the MoMPNG should
             also be assessed as part of this study.

             The dearth of knowledge of the coloured gemstones industry within the MoMPNG
             also needs to be addressed as a matter of priority. An efficient way of building this
             capacity (and arguably improving staff retention) would be to organise a knowledge
             sharing partnership with the relevant government department of a country that is
             also a large-scale coloured gemstone producer (potential countries for consideration
             are explored in the case study analyses in Chapter 5). One or two week training
             seminars for relevant MoMPNG staff could be held by gemstone industry and
             governance experts from the country in question. In order to ensure the longevity of
             this training and its future replication, senior staff at the MoMPNG could also be
             trained in delivering such training, utilising a standard “train the trainer” model.

             Budget allocations for five-year plan

             The proposed gemstone marketing centre detailed in the MoMPNG’s five-year plan
             does not yet have sufficient budget allocation to see it successfully realised.
             However, as will be further explored in the Australian case study, it is vital for the
             government to effectively market Ethiopian opal to international and domestic
             markets, to ensure not only that its properties are understood by gem labs and
             consumers, but also that its presence on the market (demand) is not ephemeral. It is
             therefore advised that the government consider other sources of funding for this
             goal, or responsibly re-allocate funding from other projects detailed in the five-year
             plan.

             Illegal activities

             The scale of smuggling and tax avoidance within the industry demonstrates a need
             for serious scrutiny of coloured gemstone supply chains within Ethiopia. It is advised
             that relevant industry actors start performing due diligence on imports of Ethiopian
             opal in line with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


             Due Diligence Guidance (OECD DDG), particularly in relation to tax avoidance. The
             improved supply chain transparency and accountability would help to disincentivise
             these practices.

             Given the key role of India in the manufacture of Ethiopian opal, the dominance of
             Indian exporters and the high rates of gemstone smuggling, the government should
             seek to use diplomatic channels between the Indian government to encourage the
             state to require improved customs control at the point of import to monitor the
             legality of stones. If a parcel of Ethiopian opal does not have a valid export certificate
             from the Ethiopian government (and the Ethiopian government only) it should be
             refused entry into India. Likewise, the government of Ethiopia should encourage its
             neighbours, particularly Kenya and Djibouti, to exercise vigilance with regards to the
             export of opal, which neither of these two countries mine domestically. Akin to India,
             these exports should only be allowed if a valid export certificate from the Ethiopian
             government can be furnished. As previously argued, a reduction in the incentive to
             smuggle gemstone would also likely occur if the government’s minimum export
             prices for rough were more in line with market realities (further research would be
             required to determine what these prices should be). It is also advisable that the
             government review the 40:60 rule in cooperation with stakeholders to determine if
             the requirement to cut and polish 40% of exports is too high, and thus also
             incentivising smuggling. Both of these points will be further explored in Chapter 4.

             It is also advised that the government explore the utility of a implementing a nation-
             wide supply chain quality assurance mechanism, like MineralCare, 149 which can
             enable due diligence on all transactions, including Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and
             Know-Your-Product (KYP) measures, so enhancing legality, formality, revenues, and
             responsible business practices.

             4. Markets
             The following considers the international and domestic markets for Ethiopia’s opal
             and other coloured gemstones, and the challenges faced by the key players therein.
             It closes with an overview of recommendations as to how Ethiopia can better market
             its coloured gemstones both domestically and internationally.

                4.1. International Market

             To collect information on the international market for Ethiopia’s opals and the
             experiences of international buyers in sourcing from, and manufacturing in, Ethiopia,
             semi-structured interviews were conducted with opal exhibitors at the Bangkok Gems
             & Jewelry Fair (September 10-13, 2015) and the Hong Kong Jewellery & Gem Show
             (September 16-18, 2015).

             Several of the interviewees said that they are directly involved in opal mining in
             Ethiopia, and are thus vertically integrated examples of companies operating in this
             sector. Others travel to Ethiopia to sit in opal brokerage offices and buy from local
             miners who stop in to sell their rough. Others simply buy direct from dealers in Jaipur
             who have their own cutting facilities in India. The dominance of Jaipur as an opal
             manufacturing and trading hub is also supported by the study’s interviews with
             Ethiopian exporters.

                    4.1.1. Demand

             All of the traders interviewed for this study said that demand is increasing for
             Ethiopian opal, and the largest buyers are from China and the US. The economic
             slowdown in China is presently a concern, but the US market is bolstered by the
             television shopping networks that advertise and sell a lot of Ethiopian opal. Some of
             the traders said that they see Europe as a growing market for Ethiopian opal, but
             many felt that there needs to be more awareness created about the beauty and
             durability of the stone in order to increase global demand. The exporters interviewed
             in Ethiopia largely supported these findings, saying that the US was the largest
             market, followed by China. However, they also regularly spoke of exporting to Japan,
             and countries in Europe, including Germany and Holland.

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


                           4.1.1.1.    Quality and Competitiveness

             Two dealers expressed concern that misinformation about Ethiopian opal had been
             spread online in order to discourage people from buying it.150 Some complained that
             the negative information was also keeping prices down. Despite some people online
             arguing that Ethiopian opal cracks easily and that almost all of it is resin treated
             (without differentiating between Shewa and Wello deposits), none of the traders had
             any resin-treated opal in their showcases, and none had ever seen any in the market.
             One trader commented that the Ethiopian opal is relatively cheap and thus it is not
             feasible to add resin treatment: this process would not increase the value of the
             stone, but merely add additional costs.151 The majority of exhibitors interviewed sell
             natural opal, while some had dyed and smoked opals as well. All treatments were
             disclosed when asked.

             In terms of the marketability of the Ethiopian opal, all of the traders interviewed in
             Hong Kong and Bangkok argued that the stone has great potential. Much of it is
             equally as beautiful as Australian opal. The most appealing characteristics of
             Ethiopian opal are the intense play-of-colour that can be seen in high-quality white
             opals, and the relatively low price point they typically have in comparison to other
             sources in the world. The play-of-colour in Ethiopia’s white opal is particularly
             appealing given that the previously dominant Australian white opal is commonly
             more subdued, and less variable in terms of colour. Australian white opal is not
             hydrophane, which may be a key reason why prices are higher internationally.
             However, it was also argued by a couple of traders that Ethiopian opal is under-
             priced on the international market, given its durability and beauty.152 This is likely due
             to a mix of over-supply, the presence of undeclared treated stones on the market,
             and residual concerns about Shewa opal. What Ethiopia can do to better market its
             opals on the international market will be outlined in the Australian case study in
             Chapter 5, and in the recommendations at the end of this chapter.

                           4.1.1.2.    Key Challenges

             The most commonly reported problem faced by those buying opals directly from
             Ethiopia was the government’s 40:60 rule for exporting polished and rough opals.153
             Most companies interviewed in Hong Kong and Bangkok said the quality of opal
             cutting and polishing in Ethiopia is not up to their standards, and so this rule places a

                                                                                                     46
The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


             burden on them to buy poorly cut stones at a higher price when they could be
             cutting and polishing in their own facilities and getting better results. This aligns with
             abovementioned comments made by some opal lapidaries/exporters in Ethiopia,
             who noted complaints made by international clientele, and the fact that many re-cut
             stones after purchase prior to sale on the international market.

             In relation to local Ethiopians working in lapidary, some Indian traders said they have
             cutting facilities in Ethiopia, but because of the poor skills of the locals they must
             send cutters from Jaipur to do some of the work. They thus view the 40:60 rule as
             forcing them to spend money on inferior cutting when they have access to better
             cutters outside the country. Only a few traders said that they have trained local
             cutters in order to improve their skill level, and they argued that these efforts have
             shown good results. This finding indicates that there can be value in investing in
             training for local cutters and polishers, and further research should be carried out
             into what incentives can be used to encourage more lapidaries to do this. However, it
             was also clear from conversations with traders in Bangkok and Hong Kong that not
             everyone who trades in Ethiopian opal is equipped, or prepared, to establish cutting
             centres in the country. This could be due to the fact that Indian importers fiercely
             defend the retention of Indian jobs, understanding the country’s unemployment
             issues and the importance of this as a priority for diamond manufacturers in
             Gujarat.154

             The Ethiopian government’s role in determining opal export values was also a
             common complaint of the international opal traders interviewed for this study. They
             argued that the government places too much emphasis on the size of the rough or
             cut stones, without considering other key factors that determine their quality, i.e.
             their ‘play-of-colour’ and opacity, and, in the case of fire opals, their clarity.155 This
             means that the government’s valuations are often too high. 156 Interviews with
             exporters in Ethiopia also showed that they often simply wear these losses; if a parcel
             is only worth a fraction of the minimum price at which they must export it, they have
             no option but to comply with the law (or, it can be assumed in some cases, smuggle
             the parcel out of the country). Although one Ethiopian exporter (interviewed in Addis
             Ababa) stated that he had occasional success in negotiating with the government to

             have the value of rough reduced prior to export because of its poor quality (despite
             its size),157 this was not the norm.

             Several traders in Hong Kong and Bangkok also said that the export process in
             Ethiopia is unappealing; foreign currency must be transferred into a specified
             account in Ethiopia before the export process can begin. Currently, the bank advice
             expires within one year, so if the stones are not exported within that time, the money
             cannot be transferred back to its country of origin, nor can it be used to export
             stones after the expiration date. As argued by one trader, the Ethiopian government
             “quotes 3 to 5 times higher than the real value that we buy and send in an official
             bank transfer. If we don’t use the full amount, then we cannot use rest of money
             and cannot send it back to our country either.”158 This process introduces additional
             risk into doing business in Ethiopia. It also likely further incentivises gemstone
             smuggling, as buyers may be inclined to seek relationships with exporters who
             engage in this practice and therefore do not need the formal selling process to be
             respected. Suggestions as to how this process could be simplified to encourage legal
             trading activities will be explored in the recommendations.

             The issue of gemstone smuggling was also raised by one gem trader in Asia who
             exports out of Ethiopia. He argued that the competition from the larger buyers who
             buy rough opals directly from the miners is harmful to his business. He said that
             many of the larger buyers smuggle this rough through Kenya and Djibouti,
             estimating that they export 30% legally and 70% illegally (in other words, only
             roughly 10% of what they export is cut and polished as is legally required,
             representing value-addition and foreign currency losses for the country). He argued
             that the Ethiopian government should do more to help local people like him to
             “build financial capacity”—a point also made by exporters interviewed in Addis
             Ababa, as explored in Chapter 2. He also called for the government to be stricter with
             the larger buyers/exporters, suggesting that there should be more regulations for
             companies buying directly from the mines.159 These issues will be further explored in
             the recommendations.

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


                    4.2. Domestic Market

                        4.2.1. Demand

             Lapidaries and exporters interviewed in Ethiopia sometimes complained that the
             domestic market for their gemstones is almost non-existent.160 The meagre usage of
             coloured gemstones in Ethiopia’s own jewellery sector was witnessed first-hand by
             the study’s researchers. A tour of the main jewellery district in Addis Ababa
             (approximately 40 shops) illuminated three key features of Ethiopia’s jewellery
             industry, as follows:

                    1. There is very little jewellery (approximately <5%) that is set with coloured
                        gemstones of any description, with the majority being just gold or silver (or a
                        mix of the two metals);
                    2. The jewellery is predominately of the filigree, mass-produced, laser soldered
                        variety, which is common in the manufacturing hubs of Hong Kong, China and
                        Thailand;
                    3. When jewellery is set with a coloured gem, it is almost always a cheap, plastic,
                        neon-coloured ‘stone’ that looks almost comically out of place, particularly
                        in 22ct gold.

             In relation to point one, the only shop that sold a notable assortment of jewellery
             with coloured gemstones in the jewellery district had only a single piece that
             contained a gemstone that the owner said had been sourced from Ethiopia (an issue
             that will be further explored below). The majority of the jewellery in this shop was
             also made overseas. In relation to the second point, the dearth of ‘smithery’ skills
             in Ethiopia—jewellery making skills—was lamented by several of the stakeholders
             researchers spoke to, two of whom argued that it would take roughly 10 years for
             Ethiopia to develop sufficient skills in this arena to be able to compete
             internationally.161 Thus, the current preference is to import jewellery that does not
             appear to have much of a local flavour to it.162 The final point about overtly fake
             looking gemstones indicates a couple of different features of Ethiopia’s largely
             imported jewellery culture—that gemstones are rarely, if ever, the ‘hero’ of a piece
             of jewellery, and natural looking, genuine gemstones are either not known about, or
             are not prized above those that are obviously fake.

             161   Interview 10/11/2015b; Interview 12/11/2015b
             162   It must be noted that manufacturing does need to happen in-country for designs to have a ‘local
             favour’, i.e. Ethiopian jewellers could design and outsource manufacturing to cheaper hubs, like India,
             then re-import it. But this is a serious investment, and requires capital and confidence in the market.

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


             There are two main issues at play here: a lack of domestic skills in relation to
             jewellery manufacturing, and a lack of domestic knowledge regarding natural
             gemstones (those found both within Ethiopia and without) amongst both consumers
             and retailers. Three of the lapidaries/exporters with whom researchers spoke said
             that they have taken steps to develop local demand for jewellery set with Ethiopian
             gemstones, and were going about it in one of three ways:163

                    1. By making cheaper jewellery with ‘high volume, low value’ gemstones to
                        appeal to the average employed Ethiopian (such as obsidian, agate,
                        chrysoprase), using local jewellers (see Figure 6 for an example of ‘high
                        volume, low value’ gemstones seen in Addis Ababa);
                    2. By making higher end pieces to appeal to the minority of Ethiopians who have
                        significant discretionary income, and expats and tourists, using local jewellers;
                    3. By doing both of the above to appeal to a broad consumer base.

             These efforts were coupled with a desire to advertise Ethiopia’s gemstones to the
                                                                  local market, in turn educating consumers
                                                                  about their existence and encouraging more
                                                                  jewellers to incorporate them into gold and
                                                                  silver        pieces.     However,          the
                                                                  lapidaries/exporters    admitted   that     they
                                                                  could not afford to pay for this advertising
                                                                  on their own, and were instead relying on
                                                                  word-of-mouth to promote the jewellery.164

                                                                  The      obvious   commercial   necessity     to

                                                                  expats and tourists residing in the country, is

                                                                  functional, well-funded gemstone industry
                                                                  association that can represent and promote
                                                                  the interests of the industry as a whole; a

             advertising for the entire industry, i.e. providing the collective good, particularly if
             he/she is a small-scale operator.165 The government should also be encouraged to
             contribute financially to advertising efforts. This issue will be explored further in the
             case study of the Australian opal industry in Chapter 5, and in the recommendations
             at the end of this chapter. 166

                           4.2.2. Key challenges

             The fact that the lapidaries/exporters foraying into jewellery making were using local
             jewellers also highlights several other challenges confronting Ethiopia’s gemstones
             value chain. Firstly, making the local jewellery industry more open to using natural
             coloured gemstones can arguably only occur to any meaningful degree if better
             jewellery-making skills are developed in the country. Two of the lapidaries/exporters
             interviewed for the study argued that local jewellers do not want to make jewellery
             using gemstones (Ethiopian or otherwise) as that comes with a degree of risk that
             they are not willing to carry; if the stone cracks, chips or shatters while they are
             setting it into a piece of jewellery, the jeweller will incur a loss.167 Breakage of this
             nature can occur with some regularity with gemstones, particularly when those that
             rank lower on the Mohs’ hardness scale of 1-10 (with 1 being talc and 10 being
             diamond), such as emerald (7.5-8), tourmaline (7-7.5) and tanzanite (6.5-7), are not
             skilfully handled.168 Opal has a hardness scale of 5.5-6.5, which means that it can be
             scratched with a knife, and is relatively challenging to set into jewellery.169 Given that
             a minority of Ethiopian opal is hydrophane also means that it can expand when
             retaining (additional) moisture, which makes setting such stones more challenging.
             Therefore, until local jewellers gain the required skills—and thus confidence—to work
             with natural gemstones they will likely continue to largely eschew them. 170



             165   The example of De Beers assuming the costs of advertising generic (unbranded) diamonds on behalf
             of the entire diamond industry from the 1930s-early 2000s was only logical for the company on account
             of its governance of a cartel that controlled up 85% of the world’s diamonds throughout the majority
             of its existence. Control of this magnitude does not reside with any one company in Ethiopia’s
             gemstones sector. It is telling that once De Beers lost this degree of market control it moved away from
             this model of generic industry advertising. See: Bergenstock, D. J. 2004. An Analysis of the International
             Diamond Market. New York, The Edwin Mellen Press; Olson, M. 1971. The Logic of Collective Action:

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


             Another issue at play here is the fact that jewellery set with small gemstones is likely
                                                                         to sell better in Ethiopia as it is typically
                                                                         cheaper than jewellery that is set with
                                                                         larger gemstones. However, jewellery
                                                                         made with small gemstones is often set
                                                                         with     multiple   stones,   and    setting
                                                                         smaller gems requires more intricately
                                                                         detailed work—attributes that increase
                                                                         the     labour   costs   of   making   such
                                                                         jewellery. In contrast, setting large
                                                                         stones is comparatively easy and a
                                                                         single large stone is often all that is
                                                                         needed in a piece of jewellery—both
           Figure 7 Loose Ethiopian fire opals beneath a selection
           of gemstone jewellery made in Addis Ababa
                                                                         features that reduce labour costs. 171
                                                                         This reality therefore places Ethiopia in
             somewhat of a Catch-22 situation: its local market can seldom afford jewellery set
             with large gemstones, but the dearth of necessary jewellery-making skills makes
             working with ‘affordable’ small stones more challenging and expensive (ironically).
             Therefore, for people wanting to make jewellery to sell locally it is currently more
             cost-effective to export small gems to India to be set in jewellery, and then import
             that jewellery back into Ethiopia (as is also the case in Australia, as explored in
             Chapter 5). Combined with the abovementioned preference for jewellery that has
             been mass-produced in Asia, this means that Ethiopia is currently effectively
             exporting the vast majority of jobs associated with jewellery manufacturing. This loss
             of productivity is compounded by the loss in foreign currency that results when
             jewellery is imported from overseas.172 These issues will be further explored in the
             recommendations below.

             One individual who is trying to buck this trend is Manale Dagnew, an Ethiopian
             clothes and jewellery designer. In 2013, Dagnew established the jewellery company
             MANALE, with the goal to sell around the world jewellery made with Ethiopian
             coloured gemstones, by Ethiopian artisans. As her business plan details, the
             business’ social and economic development goals include:173

                       Adding economic value to Ethiopian raw and finished materials; 
                       Bringing the world’s attention to the amazing potential of the Ethiopian
                        gemstone jewellery industry; and

             beneficiation that the 40:60 rule was intended to enable; indeed she advised the

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


             Figure 8 above shows a sample of the MANALE jewellery, which was unique to any of
             the other jewellery seen in Addis Ababa during the research trip. 176

             The appeal of this jewellery, despite it being made with low value, high volume
             gemstones, shows two things:

                    1. Jewellery designers in Ethiopia have a creative talent that is arguably one of
                        the industry’s best assets; and
                    2. Opal should not be considered the ‘hero’ of the Ethiopian gemstone and
                        jewellery industries—other stones are also beautiful and marketable.

             Dagnew’s jewellery business model is
             a      strong     example      of        how     the
             downstream can work to help develop
             the capacity of ASM communities. It
             also shows the potential diversity of
             jewellery        made        with         Ethiopian
             gemstones,         and    how       it    can     be
             manufactured domestically in unique
             Ethiopian designs. These points will be
             further           explored           in          the
             recommendations below.

                    4.3. Recommendations

             The          following       explores            key
             recommendations that have arisen from
             this study’s findings on Ethiopia’s
                                                                     Figure 9 Stones cut and polished by women in ASM
             coloured gemstones supply chain, and

             the challenges associated with value-
             addition therein. Each set of recommendations has been grouped according to its
             key theme.

             These recommendations are designed to be a starting point for further discussion on
             the issues illuminated above.

             Opal marketing

             Interviews with international gem traders showed how well Ethiopian opal is received
             on the international market, on account of its high quality but lower price point
             (compared to Australian opal). Further to the previous recommendation regarding

                                                                                                                    54
The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


             countering misinformation on gemstone treatments, the Ethiopian government is
             encouraged to be more proactive in marketing Ethiopian opal (and its other coloured
             gemstones, including those that are low value) internationally to improve global sales
             and ensure that residual concerns about its stability are addressed once and for all.
             Its failure to concertedly counteract misinformation on the market about its opal has
             no doubt helped give legitimacy to baseless arguments that Shewa and Wello opal
             are essentially the same. The government’s planned market centres, as will be
             explored in the next chapter, could play a role in this marketing.

             Export pricing guidelines

             As previously stated, it is again advised that the MoMPNG review its opal export
             pricing guidelines, as they appear to be significantly out of step with market prices.
             This is likely to incentivise smuggling. It is also advised that the export process be
             simplified to reduce uncertainty (risk) for exporters and international gem traders.
             Export and financing procedures need to be as simple as possible to encourage
             maximum compliance—the current requirements are too onerous. The government
             should seek input during this review process from key supply chain actors to enable
             a stronger degree of industry buy-in (thus arguably reducing the incentive to
             smuggle) and to ensure that the revised export process is practical for the industry to
             implement.

             Supporting the jewellery industry

             Ethiopia’s jewellery making industry is fledgling, but shows potential. It is
             recommended that further research be conducted into this specific stage of the
             gemstone supply chain to illuminate the challenges that are preventing its steady
             growth, and whether locally produced gold could be used in designs for further
             value-addition. A good place to start with this research would be the lapidaries who
             are attempting to build domestic demand for jewellery set with Ethiopian gemstones,
             and Manale Dagnew (and others like her), who is trying to put unique Ethiopian
             jewellery designs onto the world stage.

             At the same time it would be interesting to research domestic consumer attitudes
             (locals, tourists, expats) towards jewellery set with gemstones to identify why this
             style of jewellery is currently so rare in the domestic market, and if (and how) that
             could be changed moving forward. This research could also try to pinpoint the
             unique narrative surrounding Ethiopian gemstones, which could be used to help
             market them internationally. Researching this ‘story’ would require meaningful
             engagement (in-field research) with all key supply chain actors in the industry, from
             miners to exporters, and involve a multimedia collation and articulation thereof.

             5. Country Case Studies of Gemstone Sector Development
             Understanding the approaches of different gem-producing states in promoting the
             development of their coloured gemstone sectors, and the reasons behind their
             successes and/or failures in doing so, sheds some light on what Ethiopia could do to
             maximize its likelihood of supporting and governing a resilient coloured gemstone
             sector.

             The country case studies include i) examinations of the gemstone sectors in
             Afghanistan, Australia, Brazil, Madagascar, Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Tanzania, ii) what
             governments therein have done to promote domestic beneficiation via gemstone
             manufacturing and other added-value activities, iii) whether these efforts and
             succeeded and why/why not, and iv) what key lessons each state can provide to the
             Ethiopian context. The Australian case study will focus specifically on whether the
             state’s globally dominant opal industry has been supported by the government, the
             domestic lapidary sector, and the marketing efforts that have underpinned the
             industry’s international success.

                   5.1. Afghanistan

             Overview

             Afghanistan has seen quite some donor support to building its gemstone and
             jewellery sector over the last few years. There have been several donor-funded
             projects that supported both the industry and the government in moving towards
             higher value addition in country. However, the sector is still in its infancy and the
             domestic gemstone processing and jewellery making activities are not yet able to
             fully compete on an international level.

             Laws, policies, visions

             The government of Afghanistan has recognised that the gem and jewellery sector
             has strategic potential for several reasons:177

                      Domestic entrepreneurs and companies have already entered the space
                       spontaneously themselves, and both raw material supplies and markets exist
                       already within Afghanistan;
                      Many of the skills needed already exist;
                      Technology needs are moderate and can be filled cost-effectively;
                      The sector is labour intensive, its financial barriers to entry are low, and it has a

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


                       strong rural presence.

             In 2014, the Afghan Government developed a 3-year sectorial policy for the
             development of the Afghan gems and jewellery industry, in alignment with the goals
             of its small and medium-scale enterprise (SME) policy. The sectorial policy aims to
             ‘reform and establish the infrastructure to formalize support and positively
             influence the gemstone sector value-chain from mines to markets’. Amongst the
             goals of the plan are increased value addition within Afghanistan, increased
             gemstone processing, cutting and polishing, as well as increased production and sale
             of jewellery.178

             The plan recognises that one of the biggest impediments for the gems and jewellery
             sector currently is uncompetitive royalty rates, taxes, fees and export duties, which
             push most activities in the sector into informality, resulting in a loss of government
             revenue and foreign exchange. 179 Other identified challenges include the lack of
             skilled trainers and experts in cutting, polishing, designing, manufacturing; the lack of
             adequate equipment; the high cost of doing business in Afghanistan generally; and
             inadequate support with regards to training on business management, marketing,
             and sales, as well as limited access to finance.180

             Based on this assessment, the plan includes the following priorities for the
             development of the sector:181

                      Training and technical assistance in gem cutting, polishing and jewellery
                       production;
                      Access to finance to allow for more working capital and investments in
                       facilities and improved equipment;
                      Business development services;
                      International promotion and marketing, including through exhibitions;
                      Partnerships with international companies and organisations, B-2-B assistance;
                      Competitive royalties, taxes and fees; simplified export procedures, temporary
                       duty-free exports;
                      Establishment of a National Gemstones and Jewellery Association.

             In order to implement this Action Plan, a Gemstones and Jewellery Sector Working
             Group was created, comprising of the relevant government agencies, the private
             sector and NGOs. 182

             Institutions and Projects

             There have been several donor-funded initiatives and programmes working with the
             government and the private sector to support the development of a gemstone
             cutting and jewellery sector in Afghanistan.

             1. Turquoise Mountain Institute

             The Turquoise Mountain Institute was established in 2006 through the Turquoise
             Mountain NGO, which has been funded by various donor agencies including the
             Prince’s Charities, the British Council, United States Agency for International
             Development (USAID), Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), and
             others. The Institute is a vocational training centre, training Afghan artisans in
             traditional crafts such as woodwork, calligraphy, ceramics, miniature painting and
             jewellery.183 15 students are trained in each of these crafts every year. Each training
             course lasts for three years and is accredited by the internationally recognised City
             and Guilds Institute. 184

             In the first two years, students work with traditional designs and techniques, whereas
             in the third year they are encouraged to create their own designs. From the
             beginning of the course, students are involved in exhibitions in Kabul and
             internationally, in order to raise their skills to international levels.185 The Institute not
             only teaches craftsmanship, but also trains the students in business skills, including
             computer literacy, business management, and graphic design. 186 Students are
             provided with specialist equipment and workspace, and are connected with
             international markets and retailers, which helps them establish partnerships with
             internationally renowned jewellers such as Pippa Small. 187

             Many of the Institute’s former students have become teachers at the Institute
             themselves, and have established their own businesses and workshops, where they
             also provide work opportunities for new graduates.188

             2. Future Brilliance Afghanistan Organisation (FBAO)

             Future Brilliance Afghanistan Organisation FBAO is an NGO established in 2012 by its
             founder        and    CEO    Sophia   Swire.    The     organisation’s   goal   is   to   develop

             and supporting the creation of employment and market opportunities.189 Through an

             trained 37 semi-skilled lapidaries, 11 of whom are female, and 10 of whom are
             former graduates of Turquoise Mountain Institute.190

             The six-month training included lapidary, jewellery design and jewellery making
             business in Jaipur, India, at the Indian Institute of Gems & Jewellery. 191 The training
             in Jaipur was aimed at exposing the students to international standards, elevating
             their skills to export quality level, and allowing them to build relationships with their
             Indian counterparts. 192 In Jaipur, the students also worked with internationally
             renowned US and UK jewellers to create jewellery collections that would appeal to a
             diversity of customer segments. These collections are now sold under the Aayenda
             jewellery brand, which had been specifically created as a sales and marketing
             platform to bring Afghan jewellery to international markets. 193 In addition to
             craftsmanship, the training also included classes on branding, sales and marketing,
             digital literacy, and English language skills, as well as financial and business
             management skills.194

             Five months after the training, 80% of the students worked in their own workshops
             and businesses, employing others, or were employed themselves as gem cutters and
             jewellery designers. The former students also reported higher incomes, and some of
             them now not only produce jewellery but also create designs for the Aayenda
             brand. 195 Some of the Turquoise Mountain graduates are now also producing
             jewellery for the Aayenda brand, and according to the brand website, international
             orders have so far provided work for 1,200 artisans in Afghanistan, including 300 war
             widows who hand carve lapis lazuli and turquoise beads.196

             3. Gemstone cutting and polishing centres in the Northern Provinces

             With funds from several donors, including the Rupani Foundation, GIZ’s Sustainable
             Economic Development in Northern Afghanistan (NaWi) project, and the Agha Khan
             Foundation, 8 gemstone cutting and polishing centres were established between

             2011 and 2014 across the northern provinces of the country, where gemstone
             processing and jewellery making had been a traditional activity for many years. 197
             These centres were equipped with the necessary tools and equipment to serve as
             service centres for the local SMEs and households involved in jewellery making.
             Through the fees paid by the jewellers for these services, the centres were able to
             become financially independent over time. In addition, the centres were used to
             provide training on gemstone cutting, polishing and jewellery manufacturing, and
             gemmology training, as well as technical training in repair and maintenance of tools
             and equipment. Other capacity building activities also included business plan writing,
             association management and marketing and communication. The project also helped
             set up savings groups, through which the members could pool money and purchase
             materials or tools. By the end of the project, the management of the centres and
             their equipment were handed over to the local Gemstone and Jewellery
             Associations.198

             One year after the end of the project, 6 centres were still operational and used by
             jewellers on a regular basis (2 centres were not operational anymore, due to a
             deteriorating security context and issues around the governance of cooperatives).
             Most recently, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ),
             commissioned and funded by the World Bank for another project, has funded
             additional training activities in some of the centres, focussing mainly on female
             trainees.

             4. Small and Medium Enterprise Development Project (USAID-ASMED)

             The Small and Medium Enterprise Development Project was funded by USAID
             between 2006 and 2012, and included a focus on businesses in the gemstone and
             jewellery sector (amongst others). The programme provided support for investment,
             technology and business development services, and facilitated grants, public-private
             partnerships, the establishment of business associations, as well as technical and
             business trainings (including business development and management skills) in
             partnership with local universities. 199 In the gemstone and jewellery sector this
             included for example a two-month gemstone cutting and polishing course, a
             business skills training course for the students of Turquoise Mountain Institute, a
             training on gemmology, and the provision of gemstone cutting and polishing

             equipment, as well as the organisation of ‘sector meetings’ to coordinate the work
             of government and donors.200

             5. Adam Smith International (ASI) with DFID/World Bank funding

             ASI implemented several short-term consultancy projects in 2009-2011 aimed at
             improving the legal framework for artisanal miners and downstream buyers (gem-
             cutters) of the rocks, including considerations of export issues. Part of their output
             was a coordination group of donor projects which met several times to bring in the
             relevant aspects. Recommendations made to the Ministry of Mines were considered,
             and partly implemented when changes to the mining laws came in; however, many
             issues remained as the self-interests of decision-makers still held sway.

             There was a good degree of donor coordination and cooperation between GIZ/GFA
             Consulting Group (GFA)-Rupani-Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN)-USAID in
             2009-2011, and GIZ-USAID-Future Brilliance in 2011-2014. This resulted, for example,
             in the inclusion of candidates from all projects and programmes to the FBAO training
             courses that were implemented in Jaipur. Despite these initiatives, the large majority
             of gemstone cutting and polishing within Afghanistan is only done with semi-
             precious stones and gemstones of lower value, as the capacities to provide high-
             quality cutting and polishing are still lacking. Therefore, many of Afghanistan’s
             high-value gemstones are still exported (or smuggled) rough to other countries.201

             Lessons learnt / recommendations

                      It could be a good strategy to build a domestic cutting and polishing sector
                       by first focussing on lower value gemstones, where skill levels don’t need to
                       be as high and the barriers of entry are lower. A differentiated strategy may be
                       necessary for export quality, internationally oriented jewellery production, and
                       the gemstone processing and jewellery production destined for local and
                       regional markets.
                      It could be a good strategy to focus efforts and support where domestic
                       processing, cutting, polishing or jewellery making (even if at a very low level)
                       is already happening, and where skills can be ‘upgraded’ ins tead of being
                       built from scratch.
                      Lapidary / gemstone cutting and polishing training needs to be integrated
                       with small business development initiatives and training (e.g. business
                       management, financial and accounting skills, etc), as well as with support in

                    5.2. Australia

             Overview

             Opal has been mined in Australia for over 100 years, exclusively by small-scale
             miners—there are no large-scale companies operating in the upstream sector.

                                                                                        Australian        opal     is    primarily

                                                                                        in New South Wales (NSW);

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry




                                                Opal is culturally important to Australia; it was declared
                                                the country’s national gemstone in 1994. Black opal is
                                                also the state emblem of NSW, with white opal holding the
                                                same position for the state of SA. Although Australia is
                                                home to several notable gemstones, including extremely
                                                        rare pink and red diamonds,206 and blue sapphires,
            Figure 11 Black opal from Lightning         opals     remain          synonymous    with    the     country,
            Ridge, Australia
                                                        particularly for tourists (primarily those from China
             and Japan).207

             Australia has always dominated the global opal market, for the following reasons:208

                       It produces some of the highest quality opal in the world; and
                       It came into being when there were no competitors, either in terms of quality
                        or output.

             In 2012 and 2011, Australia produced an estimated USD41 million and USD40 million
             of opal respectively, making it the world’s largest producer (by known value).209 The
             majority of Australian opal is sold overseas, at major gem trade shows, with a lot of
             trading taking place between exhibitors. Local trade shows in Lightning Ridge and
             Coober Pedy also attract international dealers, but on a smaller scale, and
             international dealers are known to come to the main production centres throughout
             the year to buy directly from the miners. A small number of locals also buy and cut
             opal for re-sale in Australia.210 The key international markets for Australian opal are
             China, Europe, the US and Japan.211

             Despite the beauty and dominance of Australian opals in the global market, and the
             fact that the comparatively low Australian dollar has seen demand increase in the




             206   Australia also originated ‘cognac’ and ‘champagne’ diamonds—coloured diamonds from the
             Argyle mine that were cleverly branded and marketed internationally by Rio Tinto from the early 1990s.

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


             past 18 months,212 the industry at home is not flourishing, whether in mining, cutting
             and polishing, or retail. The following contains an analysis of semi-structured
             interviews held with five Australian opal industry experts in November 2015. It
             explores some of the reasons why the industry is struggling, and what lessons
             Ethiopia can learn from the Australian experience.

             Laws, policies, visions

             The experts interviewed for this study were asked to explain some of the challenges
             that they believe are facing the opal industry in Australia. The identified main
             impediment to growth varied between interviewees, but some common themes
             emerged. Four argued that more exploration is required to identify new deposits, to
             ensure that global markets have a steady supply and more miners are attracted to
             the industry. This would also ensure that much needed marketing efforts could be
             backed up by a reliable supply. However, the scientific and technological
             developments and investments needed for this to take place are beyond the abilities
             of the small-scale miners, and the government has no interest in supporting the
             industry in this manner.213

             The stated reasons why government (state or federal) does not wish to support the
             opal mining industry in Australia included the following:

                    1. The large-scale tax evasion amongst small-scale miners, which compels the

                    4. The lack of data on the number of opal miners in Australia and their annual
                        production levels, meaning that quantifying the industry’s economic
                        contributions     is   impossible      and      promoting   its   development   to   the
                        government is undermined (one study in the late 1990s pegged the export
                        figures at half a billion Australian dollars,217 but no comparable study has been
                        carried out since);218
                    5. It is “not an industry that is going to change the course of Australia’s
                        history”219, unlike large-scale industries like coal, nickel, gold;220
                    6. Production is quite distant from centres of power, and is thus invisible to
                        government;221
                    7. Governments do not receive royalties from opal mining, unlike other
                        commodities like coal, iron ore and gold;222 and
                    8. A general lack of interest in the industry from the government,223 which fails to
                        see its economic and cultural importance. This simply results in it being
                        ignored—“it’s just a bit of a nuisance.”224

             Three of the interviewees also argued that government regulations are a key problem
             stifling mining: “It is a constant battle with government”225; “No government in
             Australia has ever been behind any gemstone resource in Australia from that point of
             view (in relation to favourable regulation)” 226 ; “We can’t compete against
             countries whose governments support their local coloured gemstones industries.”227

             The key complaint from interviewees was the fact that opal-mining laws are not
             differentiated from those governing large-scale mining activities, which dominate
             Australia’s extractives industry.228 In 2011, the NSW state government was advised
             to remove opal mining from the 1992 Mining Act and the Environmental Planning
             and Assessment Act 1979, and create a separate piece of legislation for the industry.
             However, this was rejected by the government in favour of developing “longer term

             proposals for the regulation of opal mining in Lightning Ridge”. 229 Nonetheless,
             small-scale miners simply cannot afford to implement all of the OH&S and
             environmental protection requirements that large-scale companies like BHP Billiton
             and Rio Tinto can.230 Opal miners also have little incentive to do so, as they cannot
             pass those costs onto the market because of international competition from other
             opal sources (namely Ethiopia), and instead must absorb them.231

             Opal cutting and polishing

             In relation to the cutting and polishing of Australian opal, it is common for only the
             high-grade rough to be cut in the country, while the rest is bought by international
             buyers to manufacture overseas (mainly China). 232 This is because it is more
             expensive to cut and polish stones in Australia: “When you can get a stone cut for
             10 or 20 cents in China, but it would cost AUD5 to do it in Australia, and it’s a stone
             you want to sell for AUD10, that’s when overseas options are more appealing.”233
             This is particularly the case for doublets and triplets—low quality goods that are
             much cheaper to manufacture overseas. It was estimated by one interviewee that
             only 5-6% of Australian opal is of a good enough quality to be cut at home, while the
             rest is cut overseas. However, this is also positive for the industry as it means that the
             lower-quality goods can be shifted onto the international market.234

             Despite the industry’s reliance on local cutters for high-value goods, it was argued
             by two interviewees that cutters do not make a good living in Australia 235—they
             struggle to get people to pay for their expertise, as it is not valued, even though it
             should be: “A good cutter can be the difference between a stone selling for
             AUD2,000 or AUD10,000.”236 This suggests that highly trained cutters can have a
             significant impact on the returns earned by lapidaries (which is also supported by the
             experiences of some lapidary/exporters in Ethiopia, as examined in Chapter 2.)

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


             Formal cutting and polishing (and other lapidary) training opportunities do not
             currently exist in Australia. Courses used to be run by Technical and Further
             Education (TAFE) colleges around mining towns in Australia (Coober Pedy), but they
             were not economically viable and were shut down.237 One interviewee who taught
             opal cutting and polishing at a TAFE for 20 years argued that the government gave
             the courses no support whatsoever: “The support from government has been
             appalling.”238 He also argued that the TAFE was very top-heavy in management, and
             when cost cutting had to be made, the first people to go were the teachers. 239
             Nowadays, people learn cutting and polishing informally, typically from friends or
             family.240

             Sometimes two or three day cutting and polishing courses are offered, which are very
             popular, but this time is insufficient to become an expert.241 At the abovementioned
             TAFE courses, each student would study for about 6 months, learning for a few hours
             each day; in that time they could learn to cut and polish proficiently. 242 Two
             interviewees argued that the key elements of becoming a skilled opal cutter are
             having a large volume of stones to practice on, and practicing for a sufficient number
             of hours.243 To ensure students could access sufficient rough to practice on at the
             TAFE course in Coober Pedy, local miners were asked to donate very low-grade opal
             rough to the organisation. This meant that the TAFE never paid for any stones —it
             was argued that if it was required to buy its own stones the course would not have
             survived, due to severe budgetary limitations.244

             It was argued by the interviewee who had taught opal cutting and polishing for 20
             years that opals are very easy stones to work with. Once students are taught to
             properly clean a stone and then ‘read’ it to identify where the strongest play-of-
             colour lies, it then becomes a matter of practicing on the cutting and polishing
             wheels with as many stones as possible—the more you practice, the more efficient
             you get. (This point ties into the aforementioned challenge in Ethiopia of accessing
             sufficient rough with which to train staff). Because opals are so soft compared to
             other stones, it was additionally argued that they are also very easy to cut and

             polish.245 This opinion conflicts with that of Ethiopian lapidaries and exporters, who
             argued that opal is extremely difficult to work with, and sufficient skills can take up to
             ten years to acquire. This difference of opinion is perhaps attributable to the relative
             infancy of Ethiopia’s opal industry.

             The Australian Opal Centre in Lightning Ridge is trying to address the current gap in
             formal opal cutting and polishing training opportunities in the country but is
             struggling to find sufficient funding for doing so. 246 The logical outcome of this
             situation is that the number of formally trained cutters and polishers in Australia will
             fall over time, reducing the value-addition that can take place in the country and
             further normalising the export of rough to international markets for processing.

             The Marketing of Australian Opal

             The marketing of Australian opal internationally has been carried out by well-
             financed people in the industry; they have promoted the stone at some of the
             world’s biggest trade shows, showcasing it to gem dealers and designer jewellers to
             sell the product. The actions of these few have been successful in increasing demand
             for Australian opal on the aggregate.247

             The Australian opal industry relies almost entirely on international buyers for its
             market (tourists, and the international market)—the domestic market for opal is
             extremely small and has been virtually ignored in terms of advertising.248 Indeed, the
             international marketing of opal has been so effective that Australian women would
             likely identify opal as ‘the kind of thing that tourists buy’, not what they
             themselves would covet in a piece of jewellery. This is in part because of the mass-
             produced, tacky way that Australian opal is often showcased to tourists, which is
             often typified by doublets or triplets being set in silver and gold plated Australian
             animal pendants.249

             The failure to advertise opal to Australian consumers is in part due to the industry’s
             atomistic nature—it is dominated by small businesses. Efforts to do so have never
             gained any traction, as the individuals driving these ‘collaborative marketing’
             initiatives ultimately realise that they do not have the time, or the money, to market
             on behalf of the entire industry. They also struggle to agree on a strategy, and do not

             have the necessary marketing expertise: “Opal miners are not necessarily good opal
             marketers”. 250 There is also a lack of demand for opals within the Australian
             jewellery industry, which predominately sells diamond jewellery (in the high-end
             categories): “There’s a few blue stones and green stones and red stones, but
             Australians don’t understand what a coloured gemstone is. We need to get a few
             [high] profile people wearing good opal to highlight it.”251

             However, the lack of exploration taking place, and the exodus of young people out of
             the industry, means that such marketing campaigns could ultimately backfire, as the
             industry may be unable to meet subsequent demand.252 It was argued that Australian
             opal prices are declining because of the decreased supply: “That’s what’s so
             unique about opal—when supply goes down the price does not go up because of
             rarity, it actually goes down as the market moves away from using it, and buyers stop
             coming to Australia.”253 It is possible that opal is a stone that can drop off the radar
             of some international buyers and consumers with relative ease, perhaps because it is
             not as well known or celebrated as the ‘occasion’ stones, such as diamonds,
             emeralds, rubies or sapphires. This again speaks to the importance of strong
             international and domestic marketing campaigns, a point that also applies to the
             Ethiopian context. It also suggests that buyers want reliability in gemstone supplies,
             and an inability to access sufficient goods will reduce the appeal of buying from the
             Australian market.

             The discovery of Ethiopian opal in the mid-1990s was argued by all interviewees to
             have had only a short-term impact on the Australian opal industry: “The novelty of
             low prices and bright colours has worn off.”254 Ethiopian opal was not perceived by
             interviewees to pose a threat to Australian opal, as the consensus was that it is of a
             poorer quality (unstable) and not as beautiful.255 However, the popularity of Wello
             opal on the international market has caused some members of the Australian opal
             industry to take proactive steps to attempt to convince consumers and key
             stakeholders in the global jewellery industry that Australian opal is superior to
             Ethiopian opal. Some of these efforts have included the following:

                        classification, which is a characteristic that afflicts Ethiopian opal more so than
                        Australian. (It is interesting to note that interviewees suggested that
                        hydrophaneity in Ethiopian opal was the norm, which conflicts with the
                        available literature on this issue256);
                       Writing articles for various industry magazines about the differences between
                        Ethiopian and Australian opal;
                       Running Australian opal field tours for international gemmologists and gem
                        labs (GIA) to educate them about the differences between the two varieties
                        (among other things);257
                       Running opal courses (at the Gemmological Association of Australia) that
                        specifically teach students about the “questionable stability of the Ethiopian
                        Opal…”;258 and
                       Encouraging the GIA to teach students about hydrophane opal, which it had
                        not done previously.259

             The proliferation of undisclosed treated Ethiopian opal, particularly that which had
             been dyed to resemble Lightning Ridge black opal, was also a key criticism of
             interviewees. 260 Akin to the aforementioned complaints made by exporters in
             Ethiopia and traders in Asia, one interviewee argued that the dominance of large-
             scale Indian-owned companies in Ethiopia’s opal industry was ruining the industry
             in the country, because of their alleged wide-scale use of undisclosed opal
             treatments. He argued that there must be greater efforts made to ensure treatments
             are disclosed, which will ultimately help Ethiopia regain control over their industry:
             “That’s the only way we can bring the Indians into line. That’s the only way the
             Ethiopians can get better value from their product…Ethiopia could avoid the Indian

             selling methods of just cutting the price and flooding the market, which has pushed
             the price down and caused a massive over-supply.”261

             Lessons learned / Recommendations for Ethiopia

             Overall, the Australian opal industry appears to be working quite hard to ensure that
             Ethiopian opal is widely considered to be different, or if viewed cynically, inferior to
             Australian opal. Nonetheless, these efforts also show how Ethiopian opal could be
             better marketed internationally; similar efforts could be made by stakeholders in the
             Ethiopian opal industry to ensure that the international market is made more aware
             of the fact that the majority of Wello opal is not hydrophane, and that it is among
             the most robust opal in the world. The fact that Ethiopian Wello opal typically
             commands cheaper prices than Australian opal is also an important selling point to
             emphasise.262

             Furthermore:

                       An industry that is organised, harmonious and speaks with one voice is better
                        able to influence government and communicate its development needs;
                       Marketing internationally is extremely important to establishing strong
                        demand;
                       Marketing to tourists not only creates a domestic market for goods, but also
                        arguably seeds international markets when those tourists return home;
                       Training programmes need to be supported by government if they are not
                        self-funding—providing people with skills should be the goal of these
                        programmes, not making profits;
                       Training programmes need to be able to access sufficient quantities of rough
                        to enable students to develop required skill levels, and strong relationships
                        with miners is a good way of achieving this;
                       The government must view the industry as a serious contributor to GDP and
                        support its development accordingly;
                       Tax evasion should be condemned by all industry stakeholders, including
                        miners, lapidaries and exporters, as it is ultimately detrimental to the success
                        of the industry on the whole and the government’s willingness to support its
                        development;
                       Investments should be made in opal exploration to prevent future supply
                        shortages, and opal dropping off the radar of international consumers; and

             262   One interviewee mentioned an advertisement he had once seen in an industry magazine that
             promoted Ethiopian opal as being ‘just as beautiful as Australian opal, but only 30% of the price’.

                       An opal industry can be viable even if only a small percentage of production is
                        cut and polished domestically.

                    5.3. Brazil

             Overview

             In recent years, Brazilian jewellery manufacturing and design has grown to a vibrant
             and internationally acclaimed industry, 263 which was partly helped by domestic
             demand from a growing Brazilian middle class.264 The companies in the gemstone
             sector are mostly small and medium-sized companies265 and have gradually climbed
             up the value chain from gem cutting into finished jewellery, with the help of
             government policies and programmes.266 The success and value addition through
             this industry segment has in turn made domestic gemstone mining and cutting more
             profitable again, which had previously become expensive and internationally
             uncompetitive.267 Now, Brazil’s exports of cut and polished gemstones amount to
             more than double the value of rough gemstone exports. In 2014, rough exports
             amounted to 57 million USD, whereas cut and polished exports hit 131 million
             USD.268

             Laws, policies, visions

             In 2005, the Ministry of Mining and Energy (MME) developed a 20-year plan for the
             gemstone sector 269 as part of the National Mining Plan 2030 (Plano National de
             Mineraçao 2030, PNM 2030)270. The PNM sets out action points towards the strategic
             aim of sustainable mineral production, which also includes value-addition to
             gemstones and the contribution of mining to local development.271

             The 20-year plan for the gems and jewellery sector is based on a thorough
             assessment of the gemstone and jewellery supply chain within Brazil, which includes
             information on production, employment and tax revenue statistics, and value and
             types of exports and domestic consumption, as well as a qualitative and quantitative
             study of the industry, including location and numbers of operators at each step in

             the value chain and each of their challenges and difficulties. It is also based on an
             assessment of international markets and competitors, concluding that if Brazil wants
             to compete with countries like Thailand, India and China, it will need to distinguish its
             jewellery in the design segment of the industry, in order to create a unique image of
             the sector internationally.272

             The 20-year plan goes on to formulate clear macro-level goals and indicators, as well
             as the following strategic activities to reach those:273

                      Training, management and technological development (including capacity
                       building for SMEs, technical consultancy and improvement of quality and
                       productivity at each tier of the chain);
                      Internal trade promotion, including trade shows and displays, as well as
                       integration with the tourism industry;
                      External trade promotion, including support to Brazilian jewellery producers to
                       participate in international fairs, dissemination of information on markets,
                       promotion of high value added exports (including through a Centralised
                       Export Desk that supports exporters), and diversifying export markets to
                       target both traditional and emerging markets;
                      Access to credit, including making the sector a priority for government funded
                       programmes, and supporting the establishment of credit lines to companies in
                       the sector;
                      Reduction of domestic tax burden, including a reduction to zero tax on
                       imports of rough precious stones to ensure competitiveness of exporters of
                       cut stones and to reduce smuggling. This fosters the possibility of a gem
                       trading and lapidary sector that is not reliant upon domestic production and
                       that can access the volumes of stones necessary to develop specialisations for
                       the international market, provide opportunities for training (lots of cheap
                       material needed), and achieve economies of scale. In the Ethiopian context, it
                       may even allow some Ethiopian opal to be reimported for value addition (for
                       example, jewellery making), if changes in the Indian lapidary sector would
                       make that attractive;
                      Strengthening of Local Productive Clusters (further discussed below),
                       including as a priority supporting the various training programmes that
                       industry actors at various supply chain tiers already implement, and fostering
                       internal knowledge exchange.

             Institutions and initiatives

             One of the most important institutions with regards to the promotion of the Brazilian
             gems and jewellery sector is the Brazilian Gems & Jewellery Trade Association (the
             Instituto Brasileiro de gemas e metais preciosos, IBGM), a non-profit organisation
             established in 1977 that acts as a confederation, representing the whole gemstone
             value chain from mining, to jewellery design, manufacturing and retail in Brazil, and
             bringing together national and state-level associations, unions, institutes and
             companies involved in the precious stone and metals industry and trade. 274 The
             IBGM’s goals are to represent the interests and needs of the industries before the
             government, to provide information and training, and to promote the sector locally
             and internationally.275 The IBGM is also Brazil’s representative in international gems
             and jewellery associations, such as the International Confederation of Jewelry (CIBJO)
             and the International Colored Gemstone Association (ICA).

             The IBGM conducts the following services276:

                       Promotional services: Export and trade promotion to increase exports of
                        higher value product and expand exports of selected market segments
                        including faceted gems, jewellery & costume jewellery. This includes direct
                        support to exporters with a focus on priority markets, as well as industry fairs;
                       Technical services: Training, consulting and skills improvement in gemmology,
                        developing          technical   materials,      disseminating   technical    and     market
                        information and analysis;
                       Capacity building services: Capacity building and training courses, workshops,
                        lectures and consulting in the field of gemmology, design, management,
                        technology and marketing.

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


             The IBGM’s long-term Sectorial Project for Support to Gems, Jewellery and
             Costume Jewellery Exports in partnership with APEX-Brazil was one of the first
             government programmes in the sector. It runs since 1998 in various phases and
             includes activities such as awareness raising, training (including on technology),
             product suitability, surveys and market research, promotional material, promotional
             events in Brazil and abroad, and direct promotion of products through fairs and
             exhibitions.278

             IBGM’s activities, particularly the Sectorial Project, seem to be successful. In 2002,
             144 exporting companies were participating in the project, whereas in 1995 it was
             only 35; and the export volume, as well as the destination market diversification, has
             increased (with Brazilian jewellery being exported to 43 countries by 2004). 279

             Industry associations and unions play a very important role in the Brazilian gemstone
             sector. They exist for almost every supply chain tier (from mine to retail, including

             Additionally, universities and technical schools offer practical courses in the
             gemstones and jewellery sector, including on design, lapidary and entrepreneurship.

             of Mines at the University of Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, which for example has also
             taught staff of the Mozambican Gemmology and Cutting Center.282 In addition, some
             of the larger gemstone mining companies, such as the Belmont emerald mine, have
             started cutting a part of their production on their own within Brazil (Belmont cuts

             recent trend in which Brazilian cutters have found a niche in fine-quality emeralds.284

             Local Productive Clusters

             Based on the 20-year plan of the sector, the Brazilian government specifically
             supports localised value addition in the gemstone sector. One of its main initiatives is
             the ‘local productive clusters’ in gemstone producing areas of the country. This
             initiative involves the collaboration of the MME, the Centre of Mineral Technology
             (CETEM), which is part of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, as well
             as SEBRAE.285 The ‘local productive cluster’ initiative focuses on both gemstone
             mining, and gemstone processing and cutting. On the one hand, it aims at legalizing
             informal artisanal mining, supporting ASM in acquiring mining permits and
             organizing themselves into cooperatives, as well as improving labour through safer
             mining techniques and equipment. On the other hand, the initiative also targets the
             local gemstone processing and cutting sector by supporting training on cutting and
             design techniques, and supporting the development of cutting machines, in order to
             increase and improve production.286

             The ‘local productive cluster’ initiative was first tested in two pilot projects in two
             different states (one of which was in an opal producing area in Piaui state, see
             below). After the pilot projects, nine such ‘local productive clusters’ were
             established in additional states and can now be found all over Brazil, each adapting
             its activities and priorities to the local context of the industry. 287

             The Local Productive Cluster in the opal producing area of Pedro II, Piaui state

             In the 1980s, with some government support, the private sector decided to train locals in
             jewellery making in order to add value to the opals mined in the area. The Piaui State
             Development Agency started offering a course for opal cutters, and as a result, the first
             mineral handicraft school was opened in Pedro II. Consequently, gemstone processing
             workshops and jewellery shops were opened in the city, and private actors organised in order
             to hire jewellers from other states to work and teach in Pedro II. The market for cut stones
             and jewels increased locally.288

             However, these activities were later discontinued, and an assessment done in 2005 still found
             very low technological and economic efficiency in the sector. The Local Productive Cluster
             later established in Pedro II largely focussed on formalising artisanal opal mining and
             improving conditions for artisanal miners, but also had a component working on value
             addition. The main activity included the creation of the Pedro II Jewellers and Stone Cutters
             Association in 2004, with the objective of supporting jewellery production and trade. The
             members of the association received training on new production techniques (sometimes
             through the engagement of international jewellery makers as teachers), as well as financing to
             attend jewellery fairs, with the aim of facilitating access to international markets. In addition,
             the association succeeded in encouraging its members to formalise their businesses. This in
             turn helped increase the tax revenues for the state, provided a better oversight of the sector
             by the state, and gave the businesses access to services and opportunities.   289



             The association also succeeded in introducing and disseminating new opal jewellery
             production techniques using small opal fragments. This boosted the demand for small opal
             fragments, which was important for the local mining industry, as large opals had become
             increasingly hard to find in the area. Additionally, it allowed the economic use of stones
             previously considered as waste and tailings. 290

             Lessons learnt / Recommendations for Ethiopia

                       There is a long-term strategy over 20 years, building on activities and
                        achievements already implemented even before that period. A long-term view
                        and strategy for the sector is needed to guide all subsequent activities.
                       The government largely remains in the role of the facilitator, implementing a
                        framework of policies and incentives, and providing targeted support. Within
                        that framework, activities for the promotion of the sector are largely industry-
                        led, with the support of government agencies. Industry and government are

                        working in close collaboration through mutual support and information
                        sharing.
                       There is no ban on the export of rough stones. The government fosters the
                        sector not only through restrictions and legislation, but also active and
                        targeted support to key industry actors.
                       There is a large role for industry associations, and their activities are self-
                        organised      and    self-financed,      but     with    incentives   and     support     from
                        governments. Training in gemstone cutting, lapidary or jewellery making are
                        not done by the government – the government only supports training that is
                        done by industry actors or educational institutions.
                       The activities and support to the gemstone and jewellery sector is integrated
                        into the country’s larger economic strategies and activities, also involving
                        government departments responsible for Trade, Investment, Support to SMEs,
                        etc.
                       Training for lapidary and cutting is only a small piece in the overall strategy.
                        Activities to support the sector are embedded in a bigger macro-economic
                        strategy that also includes export promotion, private sector development /
                        development of SMEs (through training in management for example) etc.

             Overview

             Madagascar has had a long history as a gem producer from its colonial times (1896 –
             1960) up until the present day.292 During the 1920s – 1950s Madagascar was well
             known as a major producer of gem beryl, aquamarine and morganite (pink beryl).
             During the colonial period the French, in particular LaCroix (Geologie de Madagascar
             1923) and Besaire (Geologue, Services des Mines 1934- 1964), explored and mapped
             many of Madagascar’s geological features, and especially its pegmatites. Post-
             independence, explorations for minerals were greatly reduced,293 and following the
             exodus of the French colonists and immigrants in the early 1970s, the island became
             increasingly isolated and unattractive to direct foreign investment.

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


             From 1988 onwards, foreign gem hunters began to return to Madagascar. They were
             few, and what they found was an industry almost entirely artisanal and basic. The
             gems produced in the 1980s and early-mid 1990s were generally of pegmatitic origin
             and featured tourmalines, aquamarines, moonstones, and rose quartz. Other
             gemstones found during this period were amethyst, rock crystal, iolite, and garnet.

             In 1994, sapphires were discovered in Andranondambo, a primary, hard rock deposit
             in the deep south of Madagascar.294 A minor rush ensued. The problem with this
             deposit was its primary nature in a crystalline calcite host rock, which therefore
             required moving a large quantity of very hard rock to release the blue sapphires.
             Furthermore, there was no infrastructure near the mine, roads were bad to
             impassable in the rainy season, and there were no towns within a six hour drive. The
             southern Andranondambo sapphires was of high quality and price, but were very
             difficult to mine in an extremely unpleasant environment. A few international gem
             companies investigated this resource, but abandoned it after a couple years.
             Artisanal miners continue to work the site to this day. An Australian company with
             experience in the sapphire mining business in Australia (Siam Sarl) did acquire several
             of the claims of this sapphire area and built a mine and washing plant.

             In 1996 another sapphire discovery was made in Northern Madagascar near the town
             of Diego Suarez. These sapphires were found in an alluvial setting and were much
             easier to mine. A significant rush, with up to 20,000 miners, descended on the
             Ambondromifehy to seek their fortune in sapphire mining. The Ambondromifehy
             sapphires were of a basaltic nature and not as pleasing a blue colour, or of equal
             transparency, as the southern sapphires; but they were plentiful and easy to mine
             with rudimentary hand tools. An unfortunate problem with the Diego sapphires was
             that they were found around and in the Ankerana National Park and protected area.
             The government of Madagascar attempted to close the area to sapphire mining, but
             lacked the resources (and local will) to enforce a closure.295

             In late 1998 sapphires were discovered in Southern Madagascar, near the village of
             Ilakaka. The initial sapphire diggings were within 200 meters of the main national
             North South highway and 20 km south of a medium sized town. The blue and pink
             sapphires of Ilakaka soon became the talk of the world gemstone industry, and at its
             heyday the Ilakaka-Sakaraha region was producing up to 40% of the world’s gem
             sapphires. The town of Ilakaka had a population of, at most, 40 prior to the sapphire

             discovery. By late 1999 the region held over 100,000 miners, dealers, and others. The
             Ilakaka sapphires were alluvial and found in several layers of gravel at 1, 5, 15, and 25
             meters depth. The Ilakaka sapphires were of extremely good colour quality and
             responded well to heat treatment. Dealers came from all over the world (especially
             Thailand, Sri Lanka and West Africa) to buy these sapphires.

             The government of Madagascar dealt with this rush by withholding all new sapphire
             and ruby mining permits in the unrealised hope that without a formal mining license
             the artisanal miners would simply go back home. The authorities were overwhelmed
             by the rush, and the lack of a formal structure to manage and tax the resource meant
             widespread corruption and informal mechanisms to manage trade ensued. In 1999
             and 2000, the local gendarmes were implicated in several murders and thefts of
             sapphires, and eventually national police authorities were rotated through in the
             hopes that they would be able to enforce the law without being corrupted. The
             Ilakaka fields stretched over 60 km in length down the RN2 (national highway) and
             up to 50 km in width. Over the course of the next 15 years, multiple other hotspots
             were found in the Ilakaka area. Several attempts to mine sapphires industrially were
             begun but no company ever made a long term go of it. Today there are still several
             tens of thousands of sapphire miners in the region, but production is far from the
             1999-2005 peaks (personal observation of the author).

             Ilakaka village and the first sapphire discovery were directly across the road from the
             Isalo National Park. Lessons learned by environmentalists, especially the World
             Wildlife Fund (WWF), led to an enlargement of the park borders and strenuous
             patrolling by park rangers to keep miners out of the national park.              Isalo is
             Madagascar’s most visited park and the local community has had income from the
             park for many years. Unlike the Ankerana Park near Diego where the local
             community did not benefit much from tourism, in Ilakaka the local communities
             worked in partnership with park management and the environmental community to
             preserve the park and keep mining out. Another point of differentiation from
             Ankerana was the fact that, in the Ilakaka, sapphires were found easily, far from the
             park boundaries.296

             In 2000 and 2001, new ruby finds were made in Vatomandry and Andilamena. The
             Andilamena strike was enormous and led to tons of corundum (the sapphire and
             ruby mineral) being exported to Asia, particularly Thailand. The Andilamena material
             was mostly of low to very low quality, but there was a lot of it. A process to clean,

             and then fill, this corundum with a glass substance led to a new product of “glass
             filled ruby” coming on the market. Where polished natural gem ruby of one carat
             sizes may have cost $1000-$2000, the lead glass ruby could be had for a low as
             $5.00/ carat. The material had significant durability issues, but was pretty and, best of
             all, cheap.

             In 2002, a disputed presidential election led to a 7-month crisis that had a serious
             impact on gem trading in Madagascar.

             With no buyers able to come to the mines, the sapphire business plummeted. The
             Andilamena mine was on an old smugglers’ overland route from the coast, and
             material was still able to be purchased and exported from the main port, which was
             under control of the defeated candidate of the presidential election.

             Laws, policies, visions

             When order was restored in late 2002, and with the ex-president in exile in Paris, the
             new President Ravalomanana decided to bring some direction to the ASM and
             mining sector. Working with the World Bank, President Ravalomanana established
             the PGRM (projet de gouverance des resources minerales). The PGRM’s main
             mission was to produce a revised geological map of Madagascar. Additionally, the
             PGRM decided to establish an Institute de Gemmologie de Madagascar (IGM), whose
             objectives were to provide technical assistance for the establishment and direction of
             the IGM, in order to develop a national expertise in gemstones and gem polishing
             and thus improve the added value of Madagascar’s mineral production.

             Institutions and initiatives

             Upon the advice of the GIA, Tom Cushman was selected as an international
             consultant to plan and develop the IGM. The IGM was planned by Projekt Consult as
             a three-part establishment; a gemmology school, a gemstone cutting school and a
             gemstone laboratory. Each of the three parts had a separate schedule, and engaged
             separate expert consultants.

             The gemmology school required a selection of potential teachers who needed to be
             sent for instruction in gemmology (at the start of the project there was only one
             Malagasy gemmologist and she was selected as project coordinator). A curriculum
             needed to be selected, and texts translated into French from English. The
             gemmology school took one and one half years to build; from the approval of the
             work plan, to the opening day of the first gemmology courses taught by Malagasy
             instructors in October 2004.     The gemmology school teaches the Gemmological
             Association of Great Britain course and awards the Fellow of the Gemmological
             Association (FGA) diploma. Working with Gem-A, the IGM instructors co-authored a

             Practical Gemmology text that required only a two-week, rather than eight month,
             course. Practical Gemmology is not only a much lighter course, but also much more
             affordable in both cost and time, than the FGA course.

             The lapidary school opened in December 2004 after the gemmology school was
             established. An international, prize-winning faceter was engaged to write the
             curricula, and teach the first several courses. IGM was fortunate to be able to engage
             a local cutter to work with the international expert, and was able to rent an existing
             factory that had gone bankrupt to use as its first teaching facility. The IGM faceting
             course had three one-month-long modules teaching beginning faceting, advanced
             faceting and faceting instructor.

             The laboratory opened in 2006. The IGM needed to have trained Malagasy
             gemmologists to work in the laboratory, and to develop their expertise in
             gemmology          to   a   high   standard.    An     internationally   recognised   laboratory
             gemmologist was recruited to be the consultant for the development of the
             laboratory.

             A gemmological education project like this had never been done before, and there
             were some who thought the plan too ambitious. The national coordinator of the
             PGRM, Ms Nadine Ranorosoa, believed in the project and the consultant. She gave
             the necessary managerial support to allow the project to develop organically, and
             build from a foundation to a success over the requisite time needed.

             According to the IGM, from 2004 to 2014, 923 people received some gemmological
             instruction. The large majority received training in Practical Gemmology. The FGA
             gemmology classes had from 3 to 14 students in each year’s class. (Breakout
             numbers are not forthcoming from IGM). 68 people (generally school children) took
             the ‘Initiation to Gemmology’ class.297

             830 students received lapidary instruction, but some of them may have been counted
             twice in the case where a novice lapidary took the advanced class.298

             A course in Fashion Jewellery Design and Creation was added in 2007, and 303
             students have taken this course. The laboratory got off to a slow start, but it is now
             issuing over 300 reports per year.299

             The proprietor of the lapidary factory that was the site of the initial IGM lapidary
             course developed a cutting machine manufacturing business, and was the supplier of
             many of the machines used by IGM.

             The quality of gem cutting blossomed with the first graduating class of IGM. The IGM
             students were taught to cut for beauty instead of weight, as had been the traditional
             criteria. When IGM graduates began to sell their wares in the market next to older
             lapidaries, the quality differences were immediately apparent, and after a year there
             were no poorly cut gems available in the Madagascar market. Early graduates of IGM
             lapidary were engaged by foreign investors to work in. and develop, ateliers to cut
             stones in Madagascar. Unfortunately, following the collapse of the gem industry in
             2007- due to the ban on rough exports- all of these workshops closed. There are
             today only a few small shops employing two to four cutters in house for jewellers
             and gem dealers.

             The PGRM had some problems, and to date (2015) the geological map is not
             available. Other parts of the project never quite materialised, or found themselves
             side-lined by subsequent events (small scale grants and gold panning formalization).
             The IGM, however, is still in business, and continues to teach gemmologists and
             lapidaries and issue gemstone certificates. This is especially noteworthy as the World
             Bank funding on which the entire PGRM depended was cut off in early 2009, after a
             coup d’etat.

             In 2007, when Mr. Cushman’s contract with the PGRM came to an end, he became
             the Country director of the Institute for Sustainable Mining (aka Artminers) and was
             able to apply for and receive a grant from the Tiffany & Co. Foundation. The grant
             was to furnish scholarships to the IGM for students that might otherwise not have
             been able to attend. A particular focus of the scholarships was enlisting students
             from towns and villages away from the capital, and furnishing them with tuition and
             the means of sustenance while attending the IGM. The goal was to develop capacity
             in rural areas where stones are found, with the aim of increasing revenues locally.
             The side effect of the grant program was that IGM had a steady income stream
             during the early years of the coup crisis. Artminers received an additional grant from
             the World Bank in 2011.

             Also in 2007, in a council of ministers meeting, the President of Madagascar declared
             that henceforth all unprocessed mineral exports would be prohibited. The export ban
             was shortly later clarified to specify only unprocessed gemstones. Ex post facto,
             several rationalisations for the rough gemstone export prohibition were advanced;
             among them, the need for gemstone cutting factories to be established in
             Madagascar to provide employment and added value to exports. In fact, the export

                                                                                                 83
The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


             ban was as a result of the president losing a court case on the island of Reunion, in
             which a legally exported mineral sample had been demanded to be returned to
             Madagascar. The court in Reunion determined that the specimen (a 500kg emerald
             crystal encrusted rock) 300 had been legally described and exported with royalties
             paid, and should not be seized and returned to the government of Madagascar.

             Outcomes

             The rough export ban had catastrophic consequences for the gemstone industry in
             Madagascar. Initially international buyers believed the ban would be for a short
             while, and the government would adjust the ruling to allow business to continue.
             That did not turn out to be the case. By 2008, the gemstone industry was in complete
             collapse. As the ban on exports held, the dealers from Asia and elsewhere went away.
             With fewer buyers, and the additional risks to capitalisation, the miners began to
             leave the diggings. This led to a gradual but inexorable decrease in the number of
             miners, middlemen and product and service providers in Ilakaka and other gem
             producing areas. A viscous spiral of no buyers-low prices-no miners-no products no
             buyers ensued. Those few buyers and exporters who did stay in Madagascar found
             alternative shipping arrangements that did not involve paying royalties or formal
             declarations, and tax revenues fell off sharply. 2007 gem exports through the
             Ministry of Mines were $30,000,000. 2008 exports through the ministry were
             $300,000. To add insult to injury, the world economic crisis hit at the end of
             2008/early 2009, and the entire gemstone industry suffered enormously. The rough
             export ban was lifted in 2010, but Madagascar has never recovered.

             In 2014, after the return of an elected government, the IGM began to receive a small
             share of the mining royalties that had been written into the mining code but never
             been distributed. The IGM is now attached to the Ministry under the Presidency in
             Charge of Mines and Petrol and is managed by civil servants.

             On a recent visit there were three FGA students, six lapidary students and eight
             Practical Gemmology students. The laboratory had done three reports that week.

             Lessons learnt / Recommendations for Ethiopia

                       Establishing a gemmological institute centralises advanced expertise on
                        gemstones, and cutting and polishing training, thus providing the industry
                        with a focal point for necessary skills development;
                       Teaching lapidary students to cut for beauty instead of weight will force them
                        to concentrate on technique and improve the quality of their cutting and

                        polishing. These stones will thus be more appealing to buyers than larger but
                        poorly cut stones; and
                       Banning rough exports may cripple a domestic coloured gemstones industry,
                        and undermine previous efforts to build capacity in the lapidary sector.

                    5.5. Nigeria

             Overview

             Gemstone mining has long been a part of Nigeria’s history, and is performed
             mainly by artisanal and small-scale miners, the majority of whom operate informally
             or illegally.301 Despite various attempted interventions by the government and the
             World Bank, the lapidary sector in Nigeria remained virtually non-existent, until
             recently in 2009 when an international standard Lapidary was established at the
             Nigeria Institute of Mining and Geoscience (NIMG), Jos for the training of over 500
             cutters within 5 years. Almost no jewellery making takes place in the country.302 High
             levels of rough stone smuggling continue to undermine potential value-addition
             within Nigeria, whilst the unregulated nature of gemstone mining impedes the
             success of programmes designed to engage with the gemstone sector and adding
             value.303

             Laws, policies, visions

             According to a World Bank report, the government of Nigeria has identified the
             creation of a domestic gemstone (and dimension stone) cutting industry as a high
             priority, due to their potential revenue generation and employment creation. 304
             However, there seems to be no formalised policy or guidelines for the gemstone
             processing and jewellery-making sector.

             Institutions and initiatives

             Attempts have been made to develop Nigeria’s gemstone and lapidary sector. In
             2004, the World Bank introduced the Sustainable Management of Mineral Resources
             Program (SMMRP), which, amongst other goals, aimed at adding value to raw gems
             and creating jobs. It injected a $120 million loan into Nigeria’s solid mining sector
             and was scheduled to last until 2010, but an additional two years were approved
             based and no additional financing.305

             Even though value addition in the gemstone sector was not one of the main focuses
             of the SMMRP, the programme included training for gem processing and the
             creation of a gemmological laboratory.306 Through the project, the School of Mines in
             Jos was rehabilitated and expanded, and became the Nigerian Institute of Mining
             and Geosciences in 2005. A lapidary centre, the first of its kind, was established as
             part of this expansion, with up-to-date technology and equipment for the cutting
             and polishing of stones. At this lapidary centre, nine master trainers and 15
             commercial gemstone cutters were trained with the support of the SMMRP.307 This
             was facilitated by the use of foreign trainers, such as the Canada-based gemstone
             cutter and trainer Soosai Prosper.308 The trainees were expected to train a further 500
             gemstone cutters in the 5 years following 2012, but it remains unclear whether this
             has happened.

             The SMMRP also supported the creation of the Gemstone Entrepreneurial
             Association in order to improve organisation and encourage business.309

             In addition, the Nigerian Ministry of Mines and Steel Development (MMSD) started
             working with Nigerian-born jewellery designer Chris Aire in 2010, in order to
             promote Nigerian gemstones and gold. Aire created a jewellery collection that was
             then launched at a celebrity-filled event in Hollywood, with the goal of bringing
             Nigerian jewellery to the world stage and with the hope of stimulating investment in
             the sector.310 The collaboration between the MMSD and the jewellery designer was
             seen as successful, and a representative of the MMSD Department of ASM in Nigeria
             stated that ‘he’s [Chris Aire] brought a high level of focus on the quality of
             Nigerian’s gemstones.’311

             Outcomes

             Overall, Nigeria has experienced very limited success as a result of these initiatives.
             The sector has hardly been developed.312 One of the main challenges that prevent
             the growth of the domestic lapidary and jewellery sector is the continued smuggling
             of gemstones out of the country,313 with an estimated 80% of domestic gemstone

             production leaving the country rough and illegally.314 The government has tried to
             counter this trend by establishing gemstone buying centres, but these have not been
             successful for a range of reasons. For example, buyers have little trust in the
             government (many of them operate informally and buy stones from informal or
             illegal mines, and are therefore avoiding any contact with, or any initiatives by, the
             authorities, for fear of being punished or arrested), and had no commercial incentive
             to sell and buy stones through a government-run programme.315 Thus without any
             regulatory requirements (e.g. a restriction on the export of rough stones, or the
             enforcement of legal trading practices) or commercial incentives (e.g. domestic
             purchasing power and competitive and skilled domestic cutting), gemstones are not
             retained in country, and the lapidary centre at the Jos Mining School remains
             unused.316

             A further challenge is that although lapidary training was provided, it was futile
             without serious investment. The trained cutters had difficulties getting their own
             machinery and shops, which requires a large amount of up-front finance. There
             needed to be investment from the businesses themselves, or financing from another
             source, in order for the training to make a sustainable, long term impact.
             Furthermore, due to the above-mentioned issues, there was no supply of gemstones
             for the cutters to put their training into practice.317 Many of the trained cutters have
             since left, as there was no business to be found in Nigeria.318

             This highlights a larger issue: the training activities and initiatives in value addition
             were implemented through a government-led top-down approach, without the
             participation of the gemstone industry and traders. The widespread informality and
             illegality of the gemstone mining and trading sector exacerbated this, as a
             collaboration and engagement between the government and an essentially informal
             industry was difficult due to legal issues and a lack of trust between the actors.319 A
             crucial factor for the success of such programmes is thus a collaborative approach
             and partnership involving both government and industry in order to foster trust and
             ownership. A bottom-up approach is necessary with the government providing
             support and facilitation, but not management.320

             Lessons learnt / recommendations

                           A thorough understanding of the gemstone sector, especially the
                            commercial incentives in trading and supply chains is necessary before any
                            activities in value-addition can be implemented.
                           Any activity needs to be embedded in a larger strategy or policy to foster
                            the gemstone cutting and jewellery industry, and a conducive environment
                            needs to be created for lapidary training and any other value-adding
                            activities to be successful. This includes regulatory, policy and commercial
                            measures to encourage the formalisation of the gemstone trade and
                            export through the adaption of procedures, requirements and tax regimes.
                           Providing gem cutting and lapidary training is not enough, there needs to
                            be substantial investment (or facilitation of investment) in tools, machinery
                            and technology, as well as a coherent macro-economic policy to fostering
                            cutting and lapidary activities in the long term
                           Top-down, government-led approaches and initiatives are unlikely to be
                            successful. Government needs to take a facilitating rather than a steering
                            role, and work in close collaboration with representatives of the private
                            sector. All parties concerned need to be consulted, and the gemstone and
                            jewellery industry should have a significant role in shaping any policy or
                            activity.
                           Measures should be taken to promote the gemstone and jewellery sector
                            internationally, to ensure there is a demand and interest, which could
                            encourage investment.

                    5.6. Sri Lanka

             Overview

             The gemstone and jewellery sector in Sri Lanka has a long history and is of vital
             importance to the country’s economy, as it provides a large source of employment
             and foreign exchange earnings. While Sri Lanka is a world leader in the production of
             gemstones, its jewellery sector and its potential for value addition in country remains
             underdeveloped to a certain degree. 321 The gem and jewellery sector provides
             employment to around 300,000 people in total (this is perhaps a conservative
             estimate—other sources state up to 650,000 people 322 ), of which an estimated
             105,000 are in mining, 100,000 in manufacturing (gem processing and jewellery

             making, which includes cutters, polishers, jewellery designers, manufacturers and
             craftsmen), and 85,000 in trading (marketing, sales, retail).323

             Sri Lanka’s gem and jewellery market comprises of three segments: the domestic
             (31%), tourist (5%), and export markets (64%). The exports mainly comprise of 4
             categories, ‘gouda’ (unprocessed corundum), polished diamonds, cut and
             polished gemstones, and jewellery, with ‘cut and polished gemstones’ being
             responsible for most value addition.324 In 2013, gem exports comprised 89% of the
             total export earnings in the gems and jewellery sector.325

             Sri Lanka’s gem processing and jewellery industry has benefitted from a long
             history in gem cutting technology, as well as from a well-educated and skilled
             workforce. 326 Cutting and polishing is done both in small, traditional, artisanal
             production units and in modern mass production facilities, which are equipped with
             modern technology. 327 Traditional cutters use rather traditional methods and tools,
             but are highly skilled and experienced, and many high-end sapphires are cut by these
             traditional cutters.328 There is also a growing precision-cutting, as well as re-cutting,
             industry. 329

             Laws, policies, visions

             Sri Lanka has long banned the export of rough gemstones, and all stones must be
             cut and polished domestically before export.

             In 2003, the Government of Sri Lanka launched its economic vision and strategy
             called ‘Regaining Sri Lanka’. One of the main goals of this strategy was
             employment creation and value addition to the country’s export products. In line
             with these goals, the gemstone and jewellery sector was given high priority for
             development.330 Under this strategy, the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB)
             undertook several initiatives and programmes, one of which was the international
             branding of the ‘Ceylon Sapphire’ (described in detail below).331

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


             Since 2009, the jewellery sector has grown, largely due to the economic policies
             implemented by the government. The government has smoothened out customs
             procedures for the export of gems, liberalised import policies on rough gemstones
             and reduced import duties, taxes and fees on gems as well as machinery and
             technology.332 Allowing the industry to import rough gemstones from anywhere in
             the world was a crucial factor in helping the Sri Lankan cutting industry to become
             competitive, as the cutters and jewellers were able to get materials at affordable
             prices.333

             To ease the export procedures, Sri Lanka has created a ‘one stop shop’ in
             Colombo, where all facilities and services necessary for gem and jewellery exports are
             housed under one roof, including: the Customs Department, the National Gem and
             Jewellery         Association’s     (NGJA)       Valuation         Division,   insurance   companies,
             international and local freight forwarders, as well as the Postal Department. 334 In
             addition, the growing tourism industry has also led to growth in the jewellery
             sector.335

             The cutting industry has improved over the years, and the industry is now in need of
             an international standard gem-testing laboratory in order to avoid lengthy shipping
             and increased expenses for sending gems to laboratories in Hong Kong.336 Industry
             experts see the need to build a reputation for the use of genuine stones as one of
             the most important factors in the country’s future strategy, which will require the
             certification of genuine market actors and products, and the strict enforcement of
             rules and regulations. 337 Other significant gaps, in terms of adding further value in
             the sector, are said to be the lack of locally inspired and created designs (rather than
             copies), as well as a lack of skills in displaying, marketing and packaging.338

             Despite the industry’s growth and success in the past few years, the value of
             gemstone and jewellery exports has decreased again since 2012. The industry and
             government had set an export target of 1 billion USD by 2015, but the export value
             of diamonds, gemstones and jewellery actually fell from 558.90 million USD in 2012
             to 381 million USD in 2014.339 Industry experts state that the reasons for this is that

             there is still not enough domestic value addition, and that Sri Lankan lapidaries and
             gem cutting businesses are still underperforming compared to international
             competitors. 340

             The ‘Ceylon Sapphire’ Brand Strategy

             The Ceylon Sapphire Brand strategy, formulated in 2003, was based on a public-private
             partnership between the NGJA, the EDB, and the industry. The two main goals of the strategy
             were to develop Colombo into an international hub for sapphire trading and services, and to
             establish the Ceylon Sapphire brand in international markets. 341 The focus on sapphire was
             chosen in order to widen the market-focus of the gemstone and jewellery exports and to
             distinguish Sri Lanka from low-value mass-producing countries, by developing an up-market
             and branded product. It was intended that the strategy would be a tool to move production
             in the whole gems and jewellery sector towards higher-end sales and corresponding higher
             value addition. 342

             The creation of a hub in Colombo was to include investment in an industry centre that would
             provide services such as gem testing and certification, specialised banking services, internal
             freight forwarding services, technology upgrading and human resources development. In
             addition, the strategy also included an investment package for medium scale export
             companies to help them upgrade their workshops with modern production methods, as well
             as technical assistance in marketing and sales.343

             To implement the strategy, leading jewellery export centres in Colombo were brought
             together to form a marketing and promotion consortium called ‘the Ceylon Sapphire
             Council Ltd’, which entered into partnerships with an international jewellery designer to
             design a ‘Ceylon Sapphire’ jewellery collection destined for international markets. The
             collection was then to be promoted and marketed at international fairs and shows. 344

             Institutions

             The main institution in governing Sri Lanka’s gemstone and jewellery sector is the
             NGJA, established in 1993. It is a government-run institution for the purpose of the
             “development, regulation and promotion of the gem industry and the jewellery
             industry”. 345 The NGJA is the central authority with several regional offices that
             issues licenses to all actors along the gemstone supply chain, including gem mining

             operations, gemstone traders, and lapidaries, as well as gem and jewellery exporters.
             346



             Amongst several other functions, the NGJA is responsible for promoting and
             sponsoring technical training in the gemstone and jewellery industry, with a
             particular focus on heat treatment and gemstone cutting, with the goal to develop
             these sub-sectors. 347 This includes the facilitation of training in technical skills,
             marketing, social responsibility and business administration for all actors along the
             gemstone and jewellery value chain. 348 In addition, the NGJA is responsible for
             pursuing         marketing     opportunities        and     B2B     marketing   platforms   and   the
             development of industry norms in line with international benchmarks. 349

             The NGJA is following a three-pronged strategy to support the gems and jewellery
             sector:350

                       Supply development: This includes supporting and fostering domestic
                        gemstone mining activities in order to build a high quality and high-volume
                        domestic supply. It also includes liberalising input and import policies in order
                        to allow gem material from other countries to be cut and polished within Sri
                        Lanka (thus adding value to raw materials from elsewhere).
                       Demand development: The NGJA participates in some of the key international
                        trade fairs and shows, and organises Sri Lanka pavilions at each of them to
                        showcase Sri Lankan products. The events are targeted based on a market
                        assessment and include India and China (due to their geographical proximity
                        and their status as emerging economies), as well as Turkey and Russia.
                       Support to technical capacity building and training (as described above).

             In 2014, the NGJA announced that it would introduce a new national policy for the
             gem and jewellery industry in 2014, which would aim at providing training for
             industry players and introduce eco-friendly techniques in mining, cutting and
             polishing.351 However, this policy has not yet been elaborated and the government
             recently asked industry to come up with a policy paper first.352

The Commercial Potential of Ethiopia’s Coloured Gemstone Industry


             Industry associations play an important role in promoting the gems and jewellery
             sector in Sri Lanka. The most important industry body is the Sri Lanka Gem &
             Jewellery Association (GJA), which represents the interests of stakeholders along the
             gems and jewellery supply chain, including mining, manufacturing, wholesale and
             retail. The government has mandated GJA with the responsibility of formulating
             industry-level policies to improve productivity and competitiveness of the sector,
             working closely with the NGJA and the EDB. One of GJA’s main goals is to increase
             the sales of gemstone and jewellery products to international markets.353

             The GJA has also worked on human resource development through an associate
             organisation, the Gem and Jewellery Research and Training Institute (GJRTI). The
             GJRTI provides formal vocational training and technical capacity building for the
             sector, including several programmes in: jewellery design, gem cutting and polishing;
             heat treating; gemmology and colour grading; jewellery manufacturing; stone
             setting; and marketing.354 The courses are taught by Sri Lankan and international
             teachers, and the Institute has been supported by donors such as USAID and the EU,
             which has enabled knowledge transfers and skills from the US and EU.355 The industry
             is actively engaged in the activities of the Institute, as it is governed by
             representatives from the industry, which is considered one of the Institute’s biggest
             strengths. 356

             Lessons learnt / Recommendations for Ethiopia

                       International branding of one high-end iconic stone (e.g. opal in Ethiopia)
                        could enhance the image of the whole gems and jewellery sector and move all
                        domestic lapidary, cutting, polishing and jewellery manufacturing activities

                        of the whole gemstone and jewellery sector (from mine to market) allows for a

                    5.7. Tanzania

             Overview

             Since the Tanzanian government restricted the export of rough tanzanite, its most
             valuable and iconic gemstone, there have been several initiatives and activities
             attempting to develop a domestic gemstone lapidary sector. However, the sudden
             regulation also led to challenges and was not entirely effective in bringing about the
             desired value addition in country.

             Laws, policies, visions

             In its Mineral Sector Policy Statement of 2009, the Government of Tanzania included
             the aim of ‘promoting and facilitating value addition activities within the country to
             increase income and employment opportunities.’357

             Subsequently, the Tanzanian government banned the export of rough Tanzanite
             above 1 gram as part of the Mining Act of 2010, in a move to encourage value-
             adding activities in the gemstone sector, and in order to increase government
             revenues and employment creation, requiring the gems to be processed and cut
             within Tanzania.358 The export of other rough gemstones however is still allowed, but
             the government imposes a higher tax on exports of rough stones (5% for rough
             stones exports, 1% for cut stone exports) in order to encourage domestic cutting.359

             Four years after the ban was installed, in 2014, the Government’s policy seemed
             largely ineffective in achieving its goal of retaining value. A large chunk of tanzanite
             was still exported rough to Asia, and Tanzania did not earn sufficient revenue from
             tanzanite. According to newspaper reports, even though the country is the only
             source of this gemstone, it earns only 4.15 % (20.75 million USD export value) of the
             value of the global tanzanite trade (500 million USD per year). In 2012, Jaipur still
             earned 82 million USD from exports of cut and polished tanzanite exports, equivalent
             to what Tanzania earned in four years. 360 In 2014, almost 99.5% of (officially)
             exported tanzanite from Tanzania fell below the threshold of 1 gram and could thus
             be exported rough, which means that less than 1% of tanzanite was cut within the
             country and exported in cut form. 361 According to a calculation by a Tanzanian

             newspaper, the 0.5% of tanzanite processed locally thus only created 119 jobs within
             Tanzania, while around 250,000 people still worked in tanzanite cutting in Jaipur,
             India.362

             The main reason for this policy failure was that at the time of the ban, the domestic
             cutting and polishing industry was in its infancy; few cutting facilities existed within
             the country, and the skills to cut a high-value gemstone like tanzanite did not exist in
             Tanzania. Many traders and exporters criticised the regulation, claiming that there
             were little skills and technical equipment to process and cut the stones
             domestically.363 This led to an incentive for illicit trade, and an increasing amount of
             rough tanzanite was smuggled out of the country.364

             Institutions

             The partial ban of rough tanzanite exports at least encouraged the creation of a
             domestic cutting and polishing industry. The largest tanzanite mining company,
             TanzaniteOne, asked the government for an exemption period to the ban, and a
             staggered approach to allow the company time to establish in-house lapidary and
             cutting operations, and to establish relationships with existing domestic lapidaries.365
             In 2011, TanzaniteOne created a modern lapidary with high-end technology suitable
             to the needs of the company’s clients, and brought in Indians to cut the stones
             within Tanzania.366 By 2012, the company had hired and trained 18 local lapidaries to
             cut stones, and 60-70% of its production was cut on site.367

             These TanzaniteOne-led activities however seem short-lived, as Richland Resources,
             who held 50% of the shares in Tanzanite One (the other 50% are owned by the
             Tanzanian government), sold its shares in the company in 2014, stating that due to
             regulatory uncertainty and other reasons, it was not possible to operate profitably
             anymore. The shares were sold to a British Virgin Island based company called Sky
             Associates Group Ltd; 368 and it is unclear whether this company has continued
             support for building the domestic cutting and polishing industry.

             There were also government and development agency led initiatives to develop the
             polishing and cutting industry in Tanzania. Since 2012, the Tanzanian government, in

             collaboration with the Tanzania Mineral Dealers Association (TAMIDA), has
             developed lapidary training for local women in Arusha.369 The training was financed
             by TAMIDA, which also contributed to the financing of the Tanzania Gemmological
             Centre (below).370

             Since 2011, the World Bank’s Sustainable Management of Mineral Resources
             Programme (SMMRP) has supported the Tanzanian Government to set up a training
             centre for gemstone cutting and polishing (the Tanzania Gemmological Centre in
             Arusha), which aims at building domestic capacity to cut tanzanite and other
             gemstones. 371 One of the goals of the centre is to build the technical skills and
             provide the facilities necessary for successful domestic value addition, 372 including
             through the following activities:373

                       Training and support in value addition and investment in the gemstone sector;
                       Support for the Tanzania International Gem Show;
                       Support to the Centre in building strategic relationships for capacity building
                        and marketing with international training and marketing centres.

             It is only since 2014, 4 years after the ban was enacted, that the Centre has been
             running courses in lapidary, jewellery manufacturing and design taught by experts
             from Sri Lanka.374 The SMMRP aims to have enabled at least 200 people to graduate
             from the Centre’s training courses by 2018.375 In addition, from 2015 onwards, the
             SMMRP also provides technical assistance to the government with regards to the
             development and implementation of a regulatory framework for value addition.376

             In 2013, the Arusha Technical College also introduced a course on lapidary and
             jewellery technology to mitigate the impacts of the export restrictions on rough
             gemstones and increase the number of Tanzanian cutting, polishing and design
             experts. A challenge for the College was the limited number of teachers in this
             area,377 as Tanzania still experienced a shortage in experts in gemstone cutting and
             jewellery making.378 The Technical College was finally able to find an expert that had

             previously been trained at the Southern and Eastern African Mineral Centre (SEAMIC),
             a regional centre based in Dar es Salaam that was established in 1977.379 According
             to media reports, the course was well received with the gemstone industry and
             several graduates managed to find jobs in domestic lapidaries. 380 Other Tanzanian
             graduates of SEMAIC have also established their own lapidary training courses, for
             example the Lapidary Training Centre Ltd in Dar Es Salaam.381

             Gemstone trading companies have also started to invest in building the domestic
             cutting and polishing skills themselves. Sometimes with funds from the government,
             they established lapidaries in Dar Es Salaam and Arusha, and often brought skilled
             cutters from abroad (Sri Lanka, Thailand and Kenya) to teach their workers how to cut
             and polish gemstones.382

             Lessons learnt / Recommendations for Ethiopia

                       A sudden ban on the export of rough gemstones, without an existing
                        domestic cutting and polishing industry, is counterproductive;
                       A ban on the export of rough gemstones is only helpful if implemented
                        gradually and partially (based on existing skill levels and market needs) and if
                        the government at the same time nurtures a domestic cutting and polishing
                        industry. A differentiated approach in line with gemstone types, values and
                        market needs might be necessary;
                       ‘Softer’ policies, other than a ban, might be more effective in fostering a
                        domestic cutting and polishing industry, e.g. tax reduction for the export of
                        cut gemstones;
                       A domestic cutting and polishing industry cannot be built through a sole
                        focus on lapidary training activities; there is a need for wider macro-economic
                        strategy and activities. Support to lapidary training activities needs to be
                        accompanied by wider sectorial ‘carrot and stick policies’, such as an
                        adaption of the taxation regime and the establishment of other incentives to
                        support companies establishing lapidaries, as well as thorough enforcement of
                        any export policy in order to curb smuggling or corruption; and
                       Training in cutting and polishing is only one of the activities that needs to be
                        supported:      other   activities    include       support   and   training   for   SMEs
                        (management, etc), export promotion, marketing, etc.

             6. Summary of Recommendations
             This scoping study of Ethiopia’s coloured gemstones industry was commissioned by
             The World Bank to shed light on the following:

                   The present state of the industry, primarily in economic and development
                    terms;
                   Which features of the industry and its governance are either improving or
                    limiting its commercial development, and why; and
                   The key ‘lessons learned’ from what other gemstone producing countries
                    around the world have done to commercialise this industry, and how they
                    could be constructively applied to the Ethiopian context.

             For ease of reference, the following is a summary of the key recommendations that
             have been made throughout this report, grouped under relevant themes. They are
             for the Ministry of Mines, Petroleum and Natural Gas’s consideration. The
             recommendations have been labelled in terms of short-to-medium or long-term
             strategy; those falling under the former category are appropriate for an immediate
             action plan, while those under the latter are suited to a more extended time horizon.

             While this study focussed primarily on the opal industry, given its dominance in
             Ethiopia’s coloured gemstone sector, these recommendations are largely relevant
             to all of the 40-plus gemstone varieties mined in the country.

             Support for miners

                   Short-to-medium term:
                       o     Train the miners to use commercially sensitive mining techniques;
                       o     Offer Operational Health and Safety (OH&S) and safe mining practices
                             training to the miners; and
                       o     Educate gemstone miners about the value and characteristics of opal
                             (and other gemstones)
                   Long-term:
                       o     Provide adequate business training for any future mining cooperatives
                             to educate the miners about how to build resilience into their activities,
                             and help them mine and commercialise more productively.

             Support for exporters and lapidaries

                   Short-to-medium term:
                       o     Research how best to improve access to financing for smaller lapidaries
                             and exporters to increase their viability and competitiveness; and
                       o     Develop a strong marketing plan that communicates the attributes of

                           natural Ethiopian opal, with the goal to educate domestic and
                           international consumers
                   Long-term:
                       o   Promote and assist exporters in selling cut and polished stones directly
                           to global markets like the US and Europe, once lapidary skills reach an
                           internationally competitive standard;
                       o   Possibly also oversee the development of certain specialisms that give
                           the sector a cutting edge over established ‘do-it-all’ competitors;
                       o   Provide more support in creating international market access, market
                           linkages, and developing marketing and sales skills within the lapidary
                           and export sectors; and
                       o   Integrate lapidary/gemstone cutting and polishing training with small
                           business   development        initiatives    and   training   (e.g.   business
                           management, financial and accounting skills, etc.).

             Cutting and polishing training

                   Short-to-medium term
                       o   Encourage close collaboration between existing lapidary training
                           centres and the gemstone industry, particularly the downstream;
                       o   Work with lapidaries and exporters to create and improve domestic
                           cutting and polishing skills (perhaps by subsidising in-house training
                           programmes);
                       o   Allow gemstone brokers to trade in cut and polished stones, thus
                           improving access to the market for trained lapidaries and reducing the
                           appeal of the black market for such stones; and
                       o   Increase funding to lapidary training institutes, in order to supply
                           sufficient quantities of rough for the students to practice on, thus
                           increasing the currently minimal numbers of highly trained cutters and
                           polishers entering the market
                   Long-term:
                       o   Introduce a ‘train the trainer’ model, which has proven to be a
                           valuable long-term strategy in other countries;
                       o   Encourage training schools to teach students to cut for beauty instead
                           of weight, thus shifting focus to technique, in turn improving the
                           quality of their cutting and polishing; and
                       o   Support training centres that they cannot self-fund, concentrating on
                           the skills development goal of the programme, not the profits.

                         o   Conduct further research into the jewellery making stage of the
                             gemstone supply chain in Ethiopia, to illuminate its potential and the
                             challenges that are preventing its steady growth;
                         o   Engage with lapidaries attempting to build domestic demand for
                             jewellery set with Ethiopian gemstones;
                         o   Analyse domestic consumer attitudes (locals, tourists, expats) towards
                             jewellery set with gemstones, to identify why this style of jewellery is
                             currently so rare in the domestic market and how that could be
                             changed moving forward;
                         o   Pinpoint the unique ‘story’ that Ethiopian jewellery has, which could
                             be used to help market it internationally; and
                         o   Engage meaningfully with all key supply chain actors in the industry,
                             from miners to jewellers, to establish this provenance
                    Long-term:
                         o   Research whether locally produced gold could be used in designs for
                             further value adding.

             Gemstone marketing

                    Short-to-medium term:
                         o   Market Ethiopian opal internationally, to foster demand, improve global
                             sales and permanently address/disprove residual concerns about its
                             stability, quality and value; and
                         o   Allocate a sufficient budget, or consider other sources of funding, in
                             order to realise the proposed gemstone marketing centre detailed in
                             the Ministry’s five-year plan.
                    Long-term:
                         o   Consider international branding of one high-end iconic stone, such as
                             opal, and thus enhance the overall image of the gems and jewellery
                             sector.

             Illegal activities

                    Short-to-medium term:
                         o   Research illegal gemstone supply chains in Ethiopia, to ascertain the
                             typical structure and common actors, their geographical profile, the
                             loopholes (and vulnerable actors [miners, underpaid officials, etc.]) they
                             exploit, and what motivates people to engage in this illegal trade; and
                         o   Tackle illegal lapidary businesses, which are limiting economic growth
                             and undermining legitimate operators, potentially forcing them out of

                       Long-term:
                            o   Develop an appropriate framework for systematically addressing illegal
                                gemstone supply chains in Ethiopia, based on the abovementioned
                                research;
                            o   Seek to use diplomatic channels to require improved customs control
                                at the point of import in India;
                            o   Encourage its neighbours, particularly Kenya and Djibouti, to exercise
                                vigilance with regards to the export of opal, which neither of these two
                                countries mine domestically; and
                            o   Explore the utility of a implementing a nation-wide supply chain quality
                                assurance mechanism, like MineralCare383.

             Taxes and export prices

                       Short-to-medium term:
                            o   Introduce market-based incentives in order to reduce the size of
                                Ethiopia’s gemstone black market;
                            o   Reconsider its policy of minimum export prices for rough opal, in order
                                to disincentivise engagement in the black market for lower quality
                                gemstones;
                            o   Seek input from key supply chain actors to enable a stronger degree of
                                industry buy-in for such changes; and
                            o   Review the 40:60 rule, in cooperation with stakeholders, to ascertain
                                whether, and to what extent, it is incentivising smuggling.
                       Long-term:
                            o   Explore options for removing import taxes on rough stones, in order to
                                provide additional material for the infant domestic cutting and
                                polishing sector, and reduce its reliance on domestically produced
                                stones.

                                desired features and functions of the Ministry’s Mineral Market and
                                Value Chain Development Directorate’s proposed gemmological
                                institute; and

                             lapidaries in this region to buyers, and improve the calibre of training
                             on offer (by identifying key areas of weakness from a private sector
                             perspective)
                     Long-term:
                         o   Ensure that the MMVCDD try to utilise the existing cutting and
                             polishing, bead drilling and faceting machinery in lapidary training
                             institutes in the Amhara region (and beyond), the vast majority of
                             which is currently lying idle; and
                         o   Improve major arterial roads in Ethiopia, to increase the efficiency of
                             transportation between mines and major trading hubs.

             Governance

                     Short-to-medium term:
                         o   Study the challenges associated with staff retention in the Ministry, and
                             explore how they could be addressed
                     Long-term:
                         o   Address the dearth of knowledge of the coloured gemstones industry
                             within the Ministry;
                         o   Undertake a facilitating rather than a steering role in the industry,
                             working in close collaboration with all relevant representatives of the
                             private sector; and
                         o   Establish a national authority responsible for the regulation, supervision
                             and promotion of the whole gemstone and jewellery sector.

             Policy

                     Short-to-medium term:
                         o   Build a domestic cutting and polishing sector by first focussing on
                             lower value gemstones, where skill levels do not need to be as high and
                             the barriers of entry are low; and
                         o   Focus efforts and support where domestic processing, cutting,
                             polishing or jewellery making is already happening (including in the
                             private sector), and where skills can be ‘upgraded’ instead of being
                             built from scratch.
                     Long-term:
                         o   Embed any activities designed to develop cutting and polishing training
                             into a larger strategy or policy;
                         o   Consider ‘softer’ policies differentiated by gemstone types, values
                             and markets (i.e. tax reduction on export of cut gemstones) as
                             alternatives to a ban on the export of rough gemstones, until/unless it

                           can be implemented gradually and partially (based on existing skill
                           levels and market needs), simultaneous with the development of a
                           domestic cutting and polishing industry;
                       o   Initiate a wider macro-economic strategy and activities, since a
                           domestic cutting and polishing industry cannot be built through a sole
                           focus on lapidary training activities; and
                       o   Embed donor funded activities in a larger economic or sectorial
                           strategy by the government, and receive committed and long-term
                           support and guidance by the government.

             The World Bank and the Ministry of Mines, Petroleum and Natural Gas may use the
             recommendations and lessons learned outlined in this report to help inform the
             growth of Ethiopia’s coloured gemstone sector. The recommendations could also
             inform other research (including that which has been suggested in this report) into
             options for developing Ethiopia’s gemstone sector to ensure it has a resilient future.
             This information could form the basis of a new strategic plan for the realisation of
             this goal, which should be drafted in consultation with all relevant industry
             stakeholders. It is also recommended that the MoMPNG’s five-year plan for the
             mining             industry                be               revised      accordingly.
