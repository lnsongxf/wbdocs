Foreword
How can we communicate risk information in a way that leads decision makers to take
concrete actions to reduce risk from adverse natural events? In June 2014, almost a
thousand risk assessment experts and practitioners from around the world gathered
in London to answer this question at the third biennial Understanding Risk (UR)
Forum. Over a five-day period, the UR community— scientists, modellers, economists,
psychologists, disaster risk management practitioners, and policy makers—explored
better ways of “Producing Actionable Information.”


Since UR2010, we have seen new applications and techniques proliferate and a growing community take on the
challenge of understanding disaster risk. These proceedings try to capture the rich discussions that took place during
the Forum. The articles are organized into seven categories that reflect the range of topics covered during the event.
All of the articles explore how to improve the way we provide decision makers with robust, credible, and trusted
information that will be used to build a more resilient future.

Changing risk /uncertainty
The changing drivers of disaster risk—mainly demographics, urbanization, and climate change—increase our uncertainty
about risk, further complicating efforts to assess and communicate it. Discussions were centered on these changing
landscapes and highlighted the need to work together to develop new ways of understanding the evolution of risk and
the potential impacts of climate change.

Data
In the last decade we have seen an explosion in access to and availability of data. Forum participants discussed
actionable use of data and explored the role of technological advances, such as drone technology and data
management systems, in helping us better understand risk, even as risk continues to evolve.

Risk modelling
Modelling disaster risk is central to producing actionable information: modelling can help policy makers quantify and
value the future impact of decisions made today. New multi-hazard risk modelling platforms for open and inclusive
collaboration and ongoing efforts to explore the potential interoperability of existing tools were among the most
striking developments presented at the Forum.

Risk finance and insurance
We learned how Small Island States—among the world’s most vulnerable communities—have used risk assessments to
establish innovative financial protection mechanisms to pool and transfer their risk. Globally, more and more countries
are using risk information to leverage innovative risk financing solutions to protect their fiscal space against disasters
and climate extremes.

Psychology of risk
We took a closer look at games and gameplay as a means of helping decision makers understand the complexities
of probabilities and uncertainty. The Forum explored how understanding the process of decision making can help us
communicate risk information more effectively and develop incentives to modify behavior and promote resilience.

Building resilience
Applying risk information to build community resilience was a core topic of the Forum. Participants discussed exciting
new work to measure resilience, technological innovation to support community participation, and other actions on the
ground.

Partnerships
UR’s main objective is to encourage the creation of atypical partnerships. As in previous years, the Forum provided a
platform for all sorts of communities to interact, discuss issues, and challenge current thinking. I am always impressed
by the number of new partnerships that emerge from the Forum and their ability to promote entirely new ideas on
how we can address disaster risk.

Many activities that took place during the Forum (though not presented in these proceedings) pushed our intellectual
boundaries and inspired us to think about risk in new ways. Among them was our collaboration with 5x15, a cultural
events company that hosted a conversation on risk between a neuroscientist, a former national cricketer, a war
photographer, an Oxford professor, and a Financial Times columnist—challenging the audience to think more creatively
about risk. We encourage you to explore this event and others at www.understandrisk.org.

It goes without saying that an event as rich as UR2014 would not have been possible without the collaboration and
contribution of many individuals and organizations, nor the generous support of our sponsors who enabled us to bring
practitioners from around the globe.

Thank you to everyone for your support. We hope you enjoy the proceedings, and look forward to working with you all
again. See you in 2016!

                                                 Overview

Understanding Risk (UR) is a global community of almost 3,500 experts and practitioners in the field of disaster
risk assessment. Every two years, the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) convenes
the UR Forum—a five-day event to showcase best practices and the latest technical know-how in disaster risk
assessment. The Forum provides organizations with the opportunity to highlight new activities and initiatives,
build new partnerships, and foster advances in the field.

UR2014, the third biennial Forum, was held in London, UK, from June 30 to July 4, 2014. Under the theme
“Producing Actionable Information,” participants explored the creation of risk information for decision making.
Since our first UR Forum in 2010, the UR community has grown exponentially. Attendance at UR2014 was twice
that of the previous UR Forum, held in South Africa. We are confident that future forums will continue to engage
the disaster risk community, fostering the growth of partnerships to spur the advances in risk assessment needed
for achieving sustainable development and building resilience.

       Since the second meeting of the Understanding Risk (UR) Community in Cape Town, South Africa, in July 2012,
       the world has seen hundreds of natural disasters that have caused more than US$1 trillion in losses, the vast
       majority of them uninsured, and affected thousands of lives. Below are some of the largest disasters in terms of
       economic losses and human impact.

                            Interview



                      Q: You participated in the 2012 Understanding Risk Forum
                      when it was held in Cape Town. This year you’ve joined the
                      Forum again, flying all the way to London. Why is it important
                      for you to be part of this Forum?

                      A: We are living in a global village, and certainly natural disasters
                      know no borders. It’s important to share information about how
                      to respond to natural disasters and how to rebuild communities
                      afterward. I’ve come here today to share the Cape Town story. I
                      hope to describe what we are doing, and in particular how we’re
                      catering for a city that has been urbanized at a very rapid pace. We
Patricia de Lille     are the fastest-growing city in South Africa, and we have had to
Mayor of Cape Town,
South Africa          shift our planning to deal with natural disasters.

                      Q: What’s your overriding impression of the Forum?

                      A: I think we’ve got a good combination of the partners that we
                      need in dealing with natural disasters: government, business, NGOs,
                      universities. It’s a good platform for sharing information. As we
                      face new challenges, effective collaboration is key to minimizing the
                      global impact of DRM problems.

                      Q: What do you make of all the representation from other
                      countries?

                      A: The many dozen countries represented show that problems
                      are the same around the world, wherever you have to deal with
                      disasters. The only difference might be the impact or the severity
                      of the disaster. But we all agree about the need to understand risk
                      better.

The OpenDRI Field Guide In 2011 the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) launched the Open Data
for Resilience Initiative (OpenDRI) to bring the philosophies and practices of the global open data movement to bear on the
challenges of reducing vulnerability to natural hazards and the impacts of climate change. In the three years since, OpenDRI has
partnered with governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector in over 25 countries to implement these ideas.
In March of 2014, GFDRR, along with partners from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), United Nations
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), American Red Cross, and United Nations Office for Disaster Risk
Reduction (UNISDR), released the OpenDRI Field Guide, a practical guide that assists those seeking to implement their own open
data projects related to disaster and climate risk management. More information is available at https://www.gfdrr.org/ODRIFG.

Crowdsourcing in Government As part of the session, Dr. Muki Haklay launched a new report, “Crowdsourced Geographic
Information Use in Government.” This publication is the result of a six-month study conducted by University College London
and GFDRR’s OpenDRI. To gain insight into patterns of adoption, successful approaches, and other key issues, the research
team assessed nearly 30 cases of government usage of crowdsourced data. Among the findings of the report are these:

 	 There are some established cases of close collaboration between government and the public, which range from
   land management and biodiversity monitoring to disaster response. These examples demonstrate that successful
   interaction is possible under certain conditions.

 	 Many of the lessons from the early implementation of GIS technology in government hold true for volunteered
   geographical information (VGI) projects and can be used to ensure their successful implementation.

 	 Where governmental data are lacking, the need for suitable data sets can lead to the initiation of VGI projects.

 	 Technical issues are not insurmountable, so these are not the limiting factor in VGI adoption by government.

 	 Organizational practices, regulations, and legal issues such as license conditions are much more likely to restrict VGI
   projects than technical issues.

 	 The acceptance and use of VGI will be influenced by individual, organizational, business model, technical, and
   conceptual factors.

Cat Models
Catastrophe risk models can be divided into four components: hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and loss. The hazard component
is used to characterize the frequency, intensity, and spatial distribution of a peril. In some cases the hazard component can
include secondary perils associated with the primary peril (such as liquefaction and fire following from earthquakes or storm
surge produced by tropical cyclones). A hazard catalog comprises a suite of synthetic events representing plausible scenarios
for a peril. Empirical observations from historical events are combined with theory and expert judgment to form the foundation
for simulating the range of feasible peril events that are collected in the hazard catalog.

Depending on the purpose of a risk analysis, the exposure component may account for people, property, services, livelihoods,
and the environment exposed to a hazard. Typical exposure-related information includes the location and replacement costs
of the exposed assets. More complex risk analyses may require information such as date of construction and structural
characteristics of a building, or socioeconomic data such as age, gender, and income of a population.

The vulnerability component accounts for the response of the exposure to the hazards generated by an event. Vulnerability
functions are used to estimate a variety of phenomena, including damage to structures and their contents, injuries and
fatalities, reductions in a region’s gross domestic product, impacts on agricultural production, and the amount of time required
for rebuilding.

The loss component is used to estimate the monetary impacts and/or loss of life produced by a peril event as well as statistics
such as average annual loss and exceedance probabilities. Models used by the insurance industry also account for insurance-
related factors such as deductibles, limits, quota shares, and layers.

Key Priorities for SIDS
1.	Obtaining risk information to enable better disaster risk management decisions. This priority includes
   investing in the following: underlying exposure, hazard, and historical loss data to inform risk assessments; risk
   information systems to make these data available; and risk analytics so that data can inform decisions by policy
   makers, particularly those concerning core development planning.

2.	Enhancing the resilience of vulnerable communities and SIDS through both soft and hard measures.
   Strengthening resilience and sustainable financial protection requires hard measures, such as the integration of
   risk information in sectoral investments. But it also requires soft measures, such as the establishment of a risk
   management culture, greater awareness of the benefits of investing in prevention and long-term planning, and
   social safety nets between communities.

3.	Integrating disaster and climate risks in fiscal and development planning. SIDS often struggle to gain
   the necessary fiscal space to respond to disasters and maintain development objectives at the same time. They
   need to accurately measure the fiscal impact of disasters and integrate this information in comprehensive fiscal
   risk management together with other contingent liabilities, such as debt and commodity price risk. Insurance of
   public assets and improved public financial management helps achieve fiscal stability. But only the integration of
   risk information in long-term development planning can address the underlying drivers of these risks.

4.	Continuing innovations to meet new challenges. As can be seen in their efforts to develop regional
   sovereign risk pooling initiatives, SIDS have shown both political and technical leadership in addressing disaster
   and climate risks. Continued innovation is needed to face the challenges of the future, which include how to
   better communicate the fiscal impact of risk, how to measure and communicate the benefits of investing in risk
   reduction, and how to better quantify the poverty impacts of disasters and protect the most vulnerable, such as
   through disaster-linked social protection.

5.	Enabling solutions through regional programs. SIDS face unique problems. Regional programs are already
   playing a crucial role in translating an improved understanding of disaster and climate risks into concrete
   solutions. For example, regional programs can help SIDS invest in better risk data. Regional approaches also
   facilitate the sharing of experiences across countries; this enables countries to improve their understanding of
   available instruments for building comprehensive financial protection strategies, instead of relying on individual
   instruments.

Case Studies
In 2013 Arup undertook a project to reduce the risk and strengthen the resilience of Turks and Caicos Islands by improving
the quality of the built environment. Hurricane Ike in 2008 had highlighted the critical influence of both the natural and
manmade environment on the risks posed by natural hazards. According to a United Nations survey, a substantial reason for
the damage sustained was that the building code was out of date. Big gaps also existed in the planning regulations. Both these
issues characterize many small island developing nations globally, but they are capable of quite rapid improvement. In the case
of Turks and Caicos Islands, the project to reduce risk and strengthen resilience sought both to update the building code and
create a road map to address gaps relating to physical planning and environmental sustainability.
Using the International Building Code as a reference, the existing building code was updated. It now reflects local forms of
construction and perceptions of risk, and hence is applicable, accessible, and relevant. The project identified key issues that
could affect the extent to which the code would contribute to reducing risk, and offered simple, practical solutions to the
government.

Decision makers face various challenges and trade-offs in addressing the multiple
management objectives of nature conservation, economic development, and risk
management. Interactive, scenario-based tools help them consider and integrate

Brainstorming on the Uses—and Users—of Technology

When participants in the workshop session voted for their favorite technological innovations, six key ideas bubbled to the
top: the use of virtual reality to better communicate risk and preparedness measures; building on existing “shared economy”
ideas to improve disaster resilience; use of sensors for early warning; community-owned 3-D printers; solar charging of mobile
phones and other appliances; and various uses of civilian drones.
Participants formed five groups (in the end no one joined the 3-D printer group, so this was eliminated) and began to consider
the potential users of the prototypes they were developing; to help them stay focused, each group was presented with a
composite character (based on real people interviewed by the Red Cross in several countries). Groups worked for 45 minutes
to develop their plans and then shared their ideas:
  	 A virtual reality platform that could support risk assessment. It would be geared toward supporting individuals’
    need to access timely information on risks, but would also feed into a wider system where larger patterns could be
    identified.
  	 The use of shared economy systems that exist pre-disaster to offer support post-disaster. These systems
    might include tuition support, skills sharing, incentives, and insurance—all of which are needed in normal times. The shared
    economy systems could then be repurposed during times of disaster.
  	 A system of sensors that could measure noise and alert people to crowds and violence. This would allow people
    to navigate around areas of higher potential for violence. The sensors could be useful in normal times to share traffic
    information, for example, and then convert to violence sensors if circumstances warranted.
  	 A mobile charging solution that could be placed inside a motorcycle helmet with a solar panel on top. The charger
    would encourage motorcycle taxi drivers to wear helmets, and would help them earn money in normal times, because
    passengers would seek them out in order to charge their phones during the ride. During an emergency, the helmet would
    also be available for charging phones to access information and support a community response.
  	 A number of uses for drones. Drones might be used for mapping dangers and services; identifying bodies and sensing
    where people were alive and trapped based on mobile phone signals; and delivery of aid, including SIM cards, power packs,
    and information packs.
