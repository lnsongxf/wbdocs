EXECUTIVE SUMMARY/POLICY NOTE
Overview
The country's vision for agricultural development is "a competitive, sustainable and
technology-based agriculture and fisheries sector." Competitiveness though should not be
simply assumed, but rather demonstrated. The ideal of efficiency implies specialization of an
economy in competitive sub-sectors, whilst relying on international markets to satisfy
demand from other sub-sectors. This is the "comparative advantage" interpretation of
competitiveness. A well-known indicator of comparative advantage is domestic resource cost
(DRC). This study provides updated estimates of DRC for major agricultural commodities in
the Philippines, towards evaluating competitiveness and comparative advantage as a guide for
policy.
Patterns of trade and specialization in Philippine agriculture
The agricultural sub-sectors matching the subject commodities account for 91 % of
agricultural gross value added (Figure 1). The largest single subsector is paddy rice at nearly
a quarter of agricultural GVA; fishing is 16% (of which milk fish is one of the top
commodities); livestock (mostly hogs) account for 13%, and poultry another 10%. Next to
paddy rice, the largest crop share is for banana, followed by corn and coconut. Sugarcane,
mango, and pineapple account for much smaller shares, but the values are still sizable in
absolute terms (64.4 billion pesos, over 1.5 billion dollars.)

A simple measure of competitiveness is revealed comparative advantage (RCA), which relies
entirely on existing patterns of specialization. Based on the RCA measure, the products in
which the country has comparative advantage are: Sugar, Mango, Banana, Pineappk~, and
Coconut oil (Figure 2). Of these the highest RCA is observed for coconut oil, followed by
banana, then pineapple and mango. These are the main agricultural exports of the country.
RCA below unity is observed for the rest, with the lowest observed for hogs, followed by
Maize, then rice. Conversely these are the country's important agricultural commodity
imports.

The DRC measure
The advantage of RCA is that it is readily calculated, and 'easy to understand. However, it
fails to make adjustments due to government interventions due to taxes, subsidies, or
regulations (e.g. import restrictions); revealed patterns of trade may be simply the distorted
outcome of these interventions. The DRCR here calculated as a ratio (DRCR). The thrust of
DRCR is to take the ratio of returns to nontradable domestic factors (namely land, labor, and
capital) to tradable value added (measured as output less tradable inputs). If DRCR < l then
the commodity is produced with comparative advantage; if DRCR > I then domestic
production does not have comparative advantage. DRCR < 1 is equivalent to social
profitability, warranting expansion, conversely, DRCR > 1 is equivalent to loss, warranting
contraction.
When there are distortions, then a distinction can be made between financial DRCR and
economic DRCR, as well as financial and economic profitability. It may be the case that a
commodity is financially profitable (thus explaining apparent competitiveness) but
economically unprofitable (thus not truly competitive under corrected market prices).
Gergely (2010) obtains the DRCR calculations in Figure 2. Only hogs, White maize, and rice
are produced with DRCRs above unity. Tree crops are more profitable than cereals except for
traditional coconut farming. Highest profitability is shown for pineapple, followed by mango.
White maize is unprofitable from an economic perspective, and so is rice. Yellow maize is
close to neutral in terms of the DRCR. Domestic sugar is also socially profitable. For the non-
crop commodities, comparative disadvantage is exhibited by hogs, whereas broilers have a
comparative advantage. Hogs are economically unprofitable due to high domestic prices.
Milkfish has lower DRCR than either hogs or poultry.

Updated estimates of DRCR
This study estimated data using 20 I 2 data. Most of the information is obtained from Bureau
of Agricultural Statistics (BAS) cost and returns data; for commodities in which BAS data is
unavailable, cost and returns are obtained or imputed from other sources. Estimates of DRCR
are summarized in Table I, arranged in descending order of DRCR.

The highest-cost commodities are hogs and broilers, owing to the large discrepancy between
domestic and border price. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted for DRCR in tem1s of a
world price shock of I 0%. The DRCRs of the commodities are mostly unchanged after the
world price shock, except for hogs. Financial DRCR for all of the subject commodities are
below unity, indicating each activity is profitable from the private viewpoint. However as
argued above, economic DRCR is a.better indicator of efficiency as it corrects for price
distortions. The study finds, first of all, that distortions at the level of domestic resources and
tradable input prices are minor. The exception is rice, an importable product which ~:njoys an
expensive yet highly subsidized irrigation service.



                                                                                                                                                 3
Rather than input price policy or subsidy, the major source of distortion is output price
policy. Due to output price distortions, for key importable products economic DRCR is much
larger than financial DRCR. Contrary to the financial DRCR criterion, contraction of rice,
hogs, and chicken at the margin is warranted. Hogs and chicken are protected by a high tariff
(40%). Note the contrast with Gergely (2010), who finds that hogs and broilers are
competitive. Data indicate that in 2012, border price of frozen whole chicken is only 52% of
farmgate price. Likewise border price of frozen hams and cuts (the most comparable
imported version of domestic output at the 6-digit level HS) is 68% of the border price.
However in the case of hogs, a substantial yet plausible increase in world price can reduce
economic DRCR to below unity and make domestic hogs competitive in the world market.
This is due to the dominance oftradable inputs in the cost of producing hogs.
Rice is a special case. The domestic price is propped up above the world price by a national
policy imposing a quantitative restriction on imports. This policy supports a self-sufficiency
target that does not sufficient target as well an affordable price of the key staple. Given the
large share of rice in agriculture GDP, a shift from quantitative restriction to a moderate tariff
may effect a major transformation of the entire sector.
Among the major importables, yellow maize and sugarcane have (at least in 2012) achieved
competitiveness. For the former, as the sub-sector consolidated productivity gains, world
prices have continued to climb, making domestic output a financially viable option for the
livestock and poultry industries. Nevertheless maize continues to be protected by high tariffs,
necessity of which may need to be reviewed.
Likewise despite the presence of high import barriers, the country appears to have a
comparative advantage for sugarcane under current prices. Apparently, the barriers were not
essential to continued growth of the industry, particularly in recent years given the world
sugar price boom. Parenthetically, this suggests that opening up of the sector to foreign
competition - especially in view of the reduction of intra-ASEAN tariffs to 5% - is not
expected to cause significant industry dislocation.
Lastly, for exportable products, divergences between financial and economic DRCR are
small. There is minimal divergence between financial and economic valuation for exportable
products. DRCR estimates are far below unity. Hence, allocation of resources towards
exportables at the margin is justified on efficiency grounds.

    1. INTRODUCTION
    The country's vision for agricultural development is "a competitive, sustainable and
    technology-based agriculture and fisheries sector, driven by productive and progressive
    farmers and fisherfolk, supported by efficient value chains and well-integrated in the
    domestic and international markets, contributing to inclusive growth and poverty reduction."
    Competitiveness though should not be simply assumed, but rather demonstrated. Indeed the
    ideal of efficiency and economic integration implies specialization of an economy in the
    competitive sub-sectors, whilst relying on international markets for the other sub-sectors.
    This is the "comparative advantage" interpretation of competitiveness.
    A straightforward measure of comparative advantage uses existing patterns of specialization
    and trade. However such patterns are subject to government interventions, such as taxes,
    subsidies, and regulations (such as import restrictions), which may well introduce distortions
    in market prices and the resulting specialization. More rigorous measures are needed to
    correct for these distortions. One measure that does make corrections for domestic resource
    cost (DRC). This study provides estimates ofDRC for major agricultural commodities in the
    Philippines, thereby evaluating competitiveness and comparative advantage of these
    commodities.
    This study is part of a World Bank review of major issues in agribusiness in the Philippines
    that aims at (i) strengthening the analytical underpinnings of the current and future portfolio
    of operations of the Bank in the ARD sector of the Philippines, conso Ii dating analytical work
    carried out in the past two to three years and provide critical inputs for project design; and (ii)
    building capacities and developing a common understanding and platform with counterparts
    on how the results of this analysis could inform future policies and programs in the
    agriculture and agribusiness sector of the Philippines. The study updates the last round of
    DRC estimations done by Gergely (2010), and continues work done on agricultural policy
    indicators for the Philippines (see Annex).
    The rest of this report is organized as follows: the methodology for DRC analysis is presented
    in Section 2. A review of commodity profiles and past estimates is provided in Section 3.
    Section 4 presents the results and analysis of applying the DRC method. Section 5
    summarizes and makes recommendations.

    Economic theory posits the undistorted pattern of trade and specialization in the global
    economy is decided by comparative advantage. A common measure of comparative
    advantage is Domestic Resource Cost (DRC). To fix ideas, suppose production uses only
    primary factors, i.e. total output equals value added. Let market prices equal opportunity cost.
    DRC analysis posits that some domestic resources (e.g. labor and land) are nontradable while
    the product is tradable. Consider the replacement of one unit of the imported product by its
    domestic counterpart. DRC is defined as follows:

Assuming the market exchange rate ER is the opportunity cost of a dollar, then DRC <ER
implies comparative advantage: expanding domestic production by a dollar worth of imports
incurs domestic cost lower than the value of a dollar in domestic currency. The reverse holds
when DRC >ER: saving a dollar worth of value added, incurs a higher cost of domestic
resources, compared to the amount of domestic currency saved. The argument works even for
goods that are exported: consider shifting a unit of the commodity from the domestic to the
foreign market. DRC <ER implies that shifting a dollar worth of output to exports, incurs
lower domestic cost, compared to the foreign exchange earned; DRC > ER of course implies
that domestic cost incurred is higher compared to foreign exchange earned.
An indicator that is closely related and perhaps easier to comprehend is the DRC ratio or
DRCR, defined as follows:

        DRCR= DRC
               ER
Hence 0 < DRCR < I implies comparative advantage; in a useful sense, the farther DRCR is
from unity, the greater the degree of comparative advantage. Likewise DRCR > 1 implies
comparative disadvantage; again the farther DRCR is from unity, the greater the degree of
comparative disadvantage. Note that DRCR may be calculated as follows:
        DRCR = cost of nontradable inputs, pesos
                      border price, pesos
The foregoing assumes that output equals value added. In fact most production requires
intermediate goods. Suppose some of the intermediate goods are tradable; hence the above
reasoning needs to be rephrased in terms of value added, that is:
        DRCR = _ _ _ _  co_s_t_o_f_n_o_n_tr_a_d_ab_l_e_i_np_u_t_s,_p_e_s_o_s_ _ __
               border price less tradable intermediate inputs, pesos
Another important simplification is that market prices accurately estimate opportunity cost.
However market prices may diverge from opportunity cost due to distortions; prices that are
corrected for these distortions are called "shadow" or economic prices. Obvious examples are
divergences due to taxes and subsidies. Valuation of costs and benefits using shadow prices
makes the DRCRmore consistent with efficiency. Obviously the adjusted DRCR may not be
consistent with market decisions; for instance, a high tariff may lead to import substitution
even when economic DRCR is above unity.

2.2.    Gergely's approach
Gergely (2010) selected the following commodities for the analysis: rice, maize (yellow and
white), coconut, sugar, banana, pineapple, coconut, hogs, broilers, and milkfish. He
computed DRCR at the wholesale and farmgate level where feasible. Shadow prices were
 computed using border prices adjusted to the wholesale or farmgate level ("import parity
 price"). Production cost data was derived from cost and returns surveys of the Bureau of
·Agricultural Statistics (BAS). For sugar, additional data were obtained from the milling
 association. Bananas used figures from World Bank (2010). Data are mostly national
 averages, except for rice and sugar, where data from the areas with largest production
 (Central Luzon and Negros island, respectively) were used.

                                                                                            6
Two of the commodities are perennial crops (mango and coconut), which requires investment
before harvesting. Annual establishment costs were computed for the non-productive~ period,
discounted to net present value (using 8% discount rate), then annualized over a 20 year
period (average lifetime of the trees).             ·
Other post production costs were derived from agricultural supply chains studies, namely for
corn, rice, hogs, broilers, and banana (from a previous World Bank study). For mango,
pineapple, coconut, coconut, and fish, no data on post-production cost was found, hence
DRCR is calculated at the farmgate level.
According to Gergely, subsidies and taxes are minimal, except for some import dufo~s. as
well as subsidy for rice (mainly for improved seed and irrigation). In his study, only maize,
rice, sugar, hogs, and broilers have economic costs diverging from financial or market costs.
For exportables namely mango, coconut, and pineapple, market farmgate price is the: estimate
of the shadow farmgate price.
Nontradable inputs include: labor costs, land costs, and capital costs, estimated as either
interest on crop loans or opportunity cost of working capital. For cost items where bireakdown
between tradable and nontradable inputs is available (namely transport and processing costs),
share of nontradable cost was imputed based on cost data (even from other countries, as
needed).
Gergely also conducted a sensitivity analysis using the following factors: a 50% decrease of
the irrigation cost (for rice only); a 20% decrease in transport and logistics costs, following
improvement in transport infrastructure; a 20% increase in yields (for crops); a 20% increase
in the feeding efficiency (for animal husbandry); a 20% decrease in the cost of fertilizers and
animal feeds; and a I 0% increase and a 10% decrease in world prices.

2.3.    Approach of this paper
This paper follows Gergely (2010), updated to 2012, with a some key changes:
First, additional comparison is made by computing Revealed Comparative Advantage or RCA.
According to World Bank (2010), RCA is the share of i in the total exports of country j divided by
the share of i in total world exports. RCA> 1 implies a country is more specialized in product i
than the world economy as a whole.
Second, the same information in the DRC analysis is organized as a Policy Analysis Matrix
(PAM), arranged as in Table I (Monke and Pearson, 1989) . The PAM provides a succinct
summary of financial and economic payments to value added and domestic costs. TI1e
analysis is applied to one hectare of land, in case of crops; for animal products, analysis is
conducted for a suitable unit of scale, e.g. 1 hectare of fishpond.

Suppose DRCR > 0. The following hold:

           DRCRjina11cial = D + c < l <=> D < 0

                            H+G
Financial DRCR is below unity if and only if financial profit is negative; conversely,
financial DRCR exceeds unity if and only if financial profit-is positive. This is consistent
with private incentives to reduce output (negative financiai profit) or expand output (positive
financial profit). Likewise, economic DRCR is below unity if and only if social profit is
negative; conversely, economic DRCR is above unity if and only if social profit is positive.
This is consistent with the social criterion for reducing output (negative economic profit) or
expanding output (positive economic profit).
Third, some distortions omitted by Gergely are included. These are taxes on nontradable
inputs, i.e. value added tax (pesticide, fuel) and excise tax (fuel). Gergely also omitted the
distortion in the exchange rate; in this paper the shadow exchange rate is used in the
sensitivity analysis, with an upward adjustment of the market exchange rate by 5%, as
explained in Bautista (2003).
Fourth, for rice and sugar this paper maintains consistency with the treatment of the other
products by using national averages. This is in contrast to Gergely who used the largest
growing regions. In effect his estimates pertain to comparative advantage of these regions
rather than of the country as a whole. The more comprehensive analysis is to disaggregate the
DRCR estimation by region; any implied expansion (contraction) of output would likely
involve areas with the greater (lower) profitability, generally the same areas with higher
(lower) DRCR. As region-specific data becomes available, a better insight on the dynamic re-
allocation of resources across regions can be reached particularly as government removes
from distorting market prices.
Fifth, this paper is limited to the level of primary production: Gergely's approach to include
the wholesale level is more comprehensive. However, data for post-harvest stage is
insufficient - even Gergely resorts to a conversion factor when moving from primary to

                                                                                                   8
    processed stage. In contrast, data for primary production is relatively more abundant. Hence,
    this paper makes calculations at the farmgate level; where relevant, border price is converted
    to a farmgate equivalent using fixed marketing margins and a conversion factor (from
    primary to processed product).

    3. OVERVIEW OF THE SUBJECT COMMODITIES
    The agricultural sub-sectors matching the subject commodities account for 91 % of
    agricultural gross value added (Figure 1). The largest single subsector is paddy rice at nearly
    a quarter of agricultural GVA; fishing is 16% (of which milkfish is one of the top
    commodities); livestock (mostly hogs) account for 13%, and poultry another 10%. Next to
    paddy rice, the largest crop share is for banana, followed by corn and coconut. Sugarcane,
    mango, and pineapple account for much smaller shares, but the values are still sizablle in
    absolute terms (64.4 billion pesos, over 1.5 billion dollars.)

    Trade figures are shown in Table 2. The commodities with the most imports are rice and
    poultry, followed by maize; significant imports (over $1 million) are observed for swine and
    sugar. The biggest exports are observed for coconut oil, followed by bananas and pineapple;
    imports of these commodities are negligible or nil. The Philippines also exports a small
    amount of rice, and a significant amount of sugar (much more than its imports of sugar).

In terms of the RCA measure, the products in which the country has comparative advantage
are: Sugar, Mango, Banana, Pineapple, and Coconut oil (Figure 2). Of these the highest RCA
is observed for coconut oil, followed by banana, then pineapple and mango. RCA below unity
is observed for the rest, with the lowest observed for hogs, followed by Maize, then rice.

Note that the RCA is an imperfect measure of comparative advantage. It is static, i.e. based
on a snapshot of relative specialization over a reference period. A country may be less
specialized in a commodity compared with the rest of the world, but over time still benefit
from expanding production of that commodity. Conversely a country may be more
specialized in a commodity compared with the rest of the world, but over time benefit from
the reduction in output of that commodity. Moreover, RCA does not account for distortions
due to taxes, subsidies, and regulation, unlike the OCR measure which explicitly seeks to
correct for these distortions.
Gergely (2010) obtains the DRCR calculations reported in Figure 3. Only hogs, White maize,
and rice are produced with DRCRs above unity. Tree crops are more profitable than cereals
except for traditional coconut farming. Highest profitability is shown for pineapple, followed
by mango.

    White maize is unprofitable from an economic perspective, as is rice. Yellow maize is close
    to neutral in terms of the DRCR. Domestic sugar is also socially profitable. For the non-crop
    commodities, comparative disadvantage is exhibited by hogs, whereas broilers have a
    comparative advantage. Hogs continue to be economically unprofitable due to high domestic                            f
    prices. Milkfish has lower DRCR than either hogs or poultry.

    4. RICE
     Milled rice is the country's staple food. Production of paddy rice has been consistently
    .increasing at the national level; over the past decade (since 2002), production has been
     growing at a rate of 3.1 % annually, divided evenly between growth in area harvested and
                                                                                                                         I
                                                                                                                         I
                                                                                                                         1

     irrigated paddy rice was 74.4%. Irrigated systems have the edge over rainfed systems both in

     grown more slowly; hence, yield growth has been faster for rainfed systems (0.5 percentage
     points above the average growth). Rice is mostly produced in smallholder systems.

    Government has heavily supported domestic rice production. Budgetary support is
    concentrated on irrigation. Figure 4 presents a historical summary of public expenditures on
    irrigation; from minimal levels in the 1960s, it rose dramatically in the 1970s when the Green
    Revolution was in full swing. Since then investments have fallen; in the 2000s the lc!vel of
    support was only 20- 40% of that in the late 1970s.
    Production has risen mainly as a response to growing domestic demand, which has also
    stimulated imports (Figure 5). In the 2000s the country would intermittently rank as the
    world's top rice importer. The importance of rice in the livelihood of small farmers has been
    used to justify barriers to rice importation. Since 1972, the government has monopolized rice
1   importation under a state enterprise, the National Food Authority (NFA). The NFA sets an

    annual quota, and within it the amount it will directly import; the remainder is allocated for
    private importation (including imports by farmer organizations). This quantitative restriction

(QR) has survived the country's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) by virtue
of a special treatment on rice. Special treatment lapsed in 2012; in the meantime, the
Philippines maintains the QR while its application for extension of special treatment to 2017
is pending before the WTO.

Tariffs are also high: the most favored nation (MFN) rate is 50% out-quota, and 40% in-
quota, the same rate extended to ASEAN exporters. These distortions drive a large wedge
between domestic and foreign price of rice. A simple indicator of the wedge is the nominal
protection rate or NPR, defined as follows:
        NPR =domestic price - border price
                     border price


                                                                                                                                                                                     12
    In the 1970s to mid-1980s, technological change and budgetary support for rice allowed self-
    sufficiency at import parity price; in fact David et al (2012) estimated the NPR to range from
    - 1 to -18%, i.e. domestic prices were below border prices. This is consistent with the
    findings of Herdt and Lacsina (1976) and Unnevehr (1986) which compute a DRCR below
    unity and falling from the 1970s to the early 1980s, as rice production technology improved,
    and the peso depreciated sharply during the 1982-83 financial crisis.
    Figure 6 presents the author's calculations of the NPR for milled rice since 2004. The NPR
    started out low in 2004 to 2007, owing to an expensive dollar (the market exchange rate
    exceeded P50 per dollar) and cheap rice (from $200 per ton, inching up to $300 per ton by
    2007). Briefly the NPR turned negative during the rice price crisis of 2008 (in fact Vietnam
    rice exports disappeared in the early months of the year) when domestic prices rose but not
    commensurate with the surge in the world price. From 2009 onwards the world price
    collapsed (though at $400 - $500 per ton, the world price remains considerably above pre-
    crisis levels). Despite the decline in world price, domestic prices remain elevated, raising the
    NPR in excess of 40%; in 2013, due to the low world price, the NPR approached 50%.

    Notes:
        I.   The domestic price proxy is Metro Manila wholesale price of regular milled rice.
        2.   The border price proxy is FOB Vietnam White Rice 5% broken, adjusted upward by 6% for landed cost
             and P2.00 per kg handling from ship to warehouse, as estimated by Gergely (2010).

    PAM estimates are presented in Table 4. Based on market prices, DRCR is below unity, and
    financial profit is 22 thousand pesos per ha of area harvested. Compared with financial prices,
    tradable inputs incur lower cost under economic prices, with a penalty of of Jess than 300
    pesos per ha; domestic resources however cost much more, implying an implicit transfer of
    about I 0, 700 pesos per ha.
    A much bigger transfer is effected through border policy, which raises domestic rice price far
    in excess of the border price, resulting in a transfer of over 32,000 pesos per ha. Th~: net
    transfer is just under 43,000 pesos. Based on shadow prices, the DRCR is 2.00; that is, 2
    pesos worth of domestic inputs were spent to save on just one peso worth of foreign

Suppose in calculating the economic border price an upward adjustment of as high as 30% is
provided, whereas domestic prices remain the same. This incorporates risk from relying on
imports, supposing that world markets become unreliable. The large risk premium still fails to
justify a domestic sourcing policy fo rice; net transfers still amount to about 33,000 per ha.
The DRCR is now lower at 1.39 (1.33 using the SER), but still far above unity, owing to high
domestic production cost. Table 5 provides a breakdown of cost items.

accounts for a small discrepancy between market and shadow value. By far the bigg~~r
divergence is observed for irrigation, based on the estimated discrepancy reported in David et
al (2012) for 1999, updated to 2012 using the consumer price index; compare this with
Gergely's (20 I 0) estimate of 11,435 per ha in 20 I 0.
Estimation of import parity price is broken down in Table 6. The CIF milled rice is only
Pl 7.10 per kg, or 57% of the domestic wholesale price. After making adjustments, the import
parity price at farm gate is only 48% of the domestic farmgate price. Hence the borde:r control
is making a sizable indirect transfer to domestic rice farmers.

5. MAIZE
Since the mid-1990s, the domestic maize industry has on the whole been expanding (Figure
7), though exhibiting episodic contraction due to unfavorable weather. The two major
varieties are white maize, grown for food, and yellow maize, grown for feed. White maize
production has been fairly stable at around 2 million tons; the increase in overall production
is mostly due to production of the yellow variety.

Imports have been very erratic over the past decade (Figure 8). Annual imports are at low
levels, with peaks up to 288 thousand tons, and in some years drop to nil. Note that the ratio
of domestic production to domestic utilization has averaged 97% since 1990, with a standard
                                                                                                                                                                                                           15
deviation of only 0.03 over the same period. There is a high level of self-sufficiency, which
suggests imports take up the residual when domestic production falls short of utilization.
Indeed the correlation of imports with domestic production is -0.28, and the sum production
plus imports shows a coefficient of variation of0.2, compared to 0.21 for domestic
production only.
Fluctuation of value imported is much lower than that of import quantities, for the simple
reason that when world prices are high (as shown in unit values of imports), quantity
imported tends to drop, and conversely when world prices are high. Since 2009 unit value of
imports have jncreased by 57%.

The increasing trend of world prices is reflected in domestic prices (Figure 9). Farmgate and
wholesale prices for yellow com have been increasing. Note that inflation in the general price
level since 2002 has been 4.8%, and since 2005 has been 5 .1 %; however 2012 farm gate
prices are 19% higher than in 2009, i.e. growth in price has far exceeded that of the CPI. The
wholesale to farmgate margin after 2008 is somewhat higher than in the pre-crisis years (i.e.
P3.10 in the former, Pl.80 in the latter). In proportional terms though the wholesale to
farmgate margins are slightly lower after 2008. The movement has not been. as dramatic for
white com wholesale prices - which are actually lower in 2012 than in 2009 - but white com
farmgate prices are also elevated, being 14% higher in 2012 than in 2009.

    The PAM is presented in Table 7. DRCRs for yellow and white maize are below unity; this
    contrasts with Gergely's findings for white maize. Admittedly figures for white maize are
    much closer to unity compared with yellow maize. This holds whether using financial or
    economic prices. In the case of yellow maize, net transfers are positive due to a border policy
    that keeps the domestic price high; nevertheless yellow maize remains socially profitable.
    Cost details for maize production are shown in Table 8.

Fertilizer and seed cost is much higher for yellow than for white maize, which is
understandable as the latter is more often grown as a subsistence crop. The somewhat higher
cost of pesticide application in White maize is therefore rather puzzling; nevertheless overall
tradable input cost in White maize is only 26% that of Yellow maize. Domestic resources for
yellow maize also cost more, with higher labor cost, and even higher imputed rent for land -
mainly because white corn tends to be planted in. the more marginal areas. There is no large
outlay for irrigation as in dee, nor is a subsidy correction applied to the small irrigation
outlay as this is likely to be drawn from private systems. rhe farmgate price for white maize
is also higher.
Nevertheless profitability is much higher for yellow maize, due to the much higher yield
achieved. Correction applied for the financial price to obtain the economic price (Table 9),
which follows a similar approach as in Table 6, shows a wedge of only 9%; removing
transfers from the net return still results in social profitability.

6. COCONUT
The Philippines is the leading world exporter of coconut oil. Coconut has hundreds of uses;
the predominant utilization is the extraction of coconut oil from the meat, which in dried form
is called copra. Based on BAS data, production of coconut has been on an upward trend,
except for a dip in 2010 - 2011 (Figure 10).

     This was due to the El Nino episode of 2010, which continued to affect coconut yield in
     2011 ; good weather conditions in 2012 contributed to a recovery of output (BAS, 2010, 2011,
l    2012). PCA data in copra equivalent diverges somewhat from BAS data in terms of overall
     trend; what it consistently shows is that exports account for the bulk of domestic production

     DRC estimates are presented for two alternative production systems (Table l 0). First is the
     salt fertilization, the technology being promoted by PCA. Coconut farming is high!~
     profitable from the private and social viewpoint, with quite a low DRCR (even corrected for
     the shadow exchange rate). The other system is no fertilization, the standard practice~ in the
     country, where inputs are concentrated in the harvesting and copra drying stages. The
     divergence between financial and economic value is due only to land tax. Compared with salt
     fertilization, yield is lower, and so are revenues; despite lower costs, DRCR is highe:r.
     Nevertheless DRCR remains far below unity even with the exchange rate correction.

Cost details are found in Table 12 for salt fertilization (with the accompanying Note
describing the no-fertilization system). Tradable inputs are limited to salt and fuel from
hauling; labor is for harvesting, copra drying, weeding, and fertilizer application (by
operator); and capital cost is for working and fixed capital.

The Philippines was the seventh top global producer of sugarcane in 2012; other countries (in
order of decreasing output) are: Brazil, India, China, Thailand, Pakistan, Mexico, USA,
Indonesia, and Australia. Sugarcane output has been on an upward trend over the past decade

 Starting from 21.4 million tons in 2002, by 2012 output had risen by nearly one-third. This
 translates to about 2.2 million tons of raw sugar in 2012. There has been considerabl1~
 fluctuation of output along the trend, with the steepest drop in 2010 due to El Nino.
  Area harvested generally mirrors the change in output, though with less erratic changes,
  reaching 433 thousand ha in 2012, up one-fifth from its level in 2002. Hence, growth has
. been achieved largely by yield increases, which reached 64.5 tons per ha in 2012, compared
  to just under 60 tons/ha in 2002. Compare this with yields in tons per ha from other top ten
  producers (based on FAOStat data), namely: Australia (77), USA (75), Thailand (74), and
  Brazil (71 ); however the country's yield exceeds that oflndonesia (58) and Pakistan (55).
 Import and export trends are shown in Figures 12 and 13. Import quantities and volumes
 range widely, from nearly zero (2007 -2009) to as much as 285,000 tons valued at $186
 million. Peak imports over the past decade occurred in 2010, when domestic production
 faltered due to bad weather. The following year imports plummeted as domestic production
 recovered and world prices soared; unit value of imports averaged $914/ton. This is
 consistent with World Bank (2013), which reports world prices at $570 FOB per ton for raw
 sugar; in 2008 and 2009 prices were respectively $400 and $470 per ton.

Imports are subject to a 50% in-quota tariff (for a minimum access of 64,050 tons); the out-
quota rate is 65%, the highest tariff rate for an agricultUral ~roduct in the country. Imports are
tightly regulated under permit system administered by the Sugar Regulatory Administration
(SRA). Meanwhile exports after 2004 were fairly stable; note that the Philippines enjoys a
quota allocation in the US market. As with imports, exports dropped in 20 I 0, before
recovering sharply during the world price peak of 2011. Exports returned to trend in 20 I 2.
Farmgate prices react to both domestic supply and demand conditions, as well as global
market conditions (Table 13 and Figure 15). Seasonality though is not evident. In 2009
farmgate prices were in the range of 15 to 30 pesos per kg, before soaring to the range of 30
to 50 pesos per kg in 2010, due to tight domestic supply. Since then farmgate prices have
retreated, although remain elevated compared to 2009.

The policy analysis matrix (Table 14) indicates financial profitability of about 20 thousand
pesos per ha and a DRCR of 0.47. Breakdown of cost items is found in Table 15; as the
survey data divide cost by activity type, allocation between tradable and nontradable inputs is
done by an assumed percentage share following Gergely (2010). Valuation based on
economic prices leads to a lower estimate of profitability at 12,500 pesos; the main correction
is for import parity price, estimated as in Table 16.
According to the estimate, the border price equivalent (farmgate level), is only 87% of the
domestic farmgate price. The decline in economic profitability is partly offset by including
taxes on inputs and the land tax. Ultimately DRCR remains below unity, though higher than
financial DRCR; this holds even with adjustment for the shadow exchange rate.

                                                                                                                                                                                       22
The economic profitability of about $300 per ha compares favorably with profitability in
Thailand of about $260, based on 2007 data (Ekasing et al, 2007). Profitability of sugarcane
farming in the Philippines and Thailand contrasts sharply with outcomes in Indonesia, where
milling districts in Java tended to show low or even negative profit even on financial terms
(World Bank, on-going).

8. CARDAVA BANANA
The Philippines is the third top producers of bananas worldwide. The most important variety
of banana grown in the country is Cavendish, which is primarily for export (Figure 16). The
second largest is Cardava banana, accounting for a third of banana output. This variety is
typically used as ingredient for food preparation and processing. The remainder is taken up
by Lacatan variety (and small amounts of other varieties) consumed as table fruit.

Banana exports have been on an upward trend over the past decade, though the most rapid
increase has been observed since 2010 (Figure 17). A sizable chunk of these exports are in the
fonn of banana chips (from cardava), valued at $50 million in 2011(DTI,2012). Export
quantities have been erratic, but also trending upward since 20 I 0, exceeding 2.5 million tons
in 2012.

    Among the crops evaluated so far, banana exhibits the highest profitability at about 147,000
    per ha (Table 17). Economic profitability is even higher, at about 149,000 per ha (the
    divergence due only to taxes). It turns out that DRCR is also the lowest thus far at 0.25
    (economic) to 0.26 (financial), with only a slight correction for the shadow exchange rate.
    Breakdown oftradable and nontradable input costs is shown in Table 18.

Export of fresh pineapple is only about 8 - 11 % of domestic production, though a
considerable quantity of processing does end up as exgorts. (see Figure 18). Since 20.10 fresh
pineapple exports have increased at an annual rate of 120%. Pineapple juice exports became
significant only from the mid-2000s; in 2012 value of exports approached $100 million,
about one-fourth of total export value.

Since 2006 farmgate prices have generally trended upward (Figure 19). The native variety
exhibits the sharpest fluctuation, followed by Formosa (African Queen). After an initial
phase of fairly flat prices, Hawaiian (Smooth Cayenne) has enjoyed rapid price growth,
exceeding 50% in two years.

Financial profitability of pineapple is superior even to that of banana, exceeding P 190,000
(Table 20). While cost of production per ha and farmgate price are comparable with banana,
pineapple output is higher per ha (with a yield of about 40 tons). DRCR is lowest thus far at
O. I 4 (with no appreciable change when adjusted for economic prices and the shadow
exchange rate). Cost details are shown in Table 2 I.

IO.MANGO
The country hit its peak production of mango at I million tons in 2007; since then output has
been falling owing to unfavorable weather. Output is currently ranging below 800 thousand
tons (Table 22). Exports account for only a small share of output, i.e. between 2 to 4%.
Exports quantities have been erratic. By value though exports tripled between 2002 and 20 I I,
hitting $96 million, before tapering off to $71 million tons in 20I2 (Figure 20). Sinc:e 2007,
exports have been tracking the unit values; note though that unit values are capturing both

have generally kept pace with the overall inflation rate, with a growth of around 4% per year

The policy analysis matrix (Table 23) indicates profitability of around 36,000 pesos per ha,
lower than either pineapple or mango, but still relatively higher than cereals and coconut. The
financial DRCR is only 0.54, far below unity. Divergence between financial and economic
prices are small, hence economic DRCR is 0.52 (with almost identical ratios when adjusting
for the shadow exchange rate).

11. HOGS AND BROILERS
Livestock production in the country has been growing consistently over time (Figure 22). The
two main livestock products are hog and chicken; over the past thirty years, output in both
industries has more than tripled. This is consistent with rising domestic demand, dm~ to
population growth and diet diversification as purchasing power of households increases. As
production has generally kept pace with demand, farmgate prices have generally kept pace
with the overall inflation rate (Figure 23).
In the 2000s imports of hog and chicken have been increasing rapidly in value terms, partly
in response to rising domestic demand (Figure 24). Note that chicken is often traded in parts,
whkh creates product variety and the possibility of intra-industry trade. In fact, the country's
exports of chicken (mostly cuts) have also been increasing, approaching $90 million in 2011.

The global meat market has been enjoying a rapid expansion, with exports growing over 40%
in less than ten years. Mounting demand from East Asia will lift pork exports, while Middle
East and Sub-Saharan Africa will be the main driver of broiler meat (USDA, 2013).
Over the past decade, growth of unit value of pork and chicken imports has accelerated
(Figure 25); in addition to demand, rising cost of com-based feed has also been a price
driver. Rising world meat prices has also contributed to the .~hove-mentioned increase in the
value of hog and chicken imports of the country.
Imports of both hogs and chicken are tightly controlled. Tariffs are 40%, with the same in-
quota rate for chicken; the in-quota rate for hogs is 30%. Import permits for pork and
chicken, as with other sensitive commodities (typically with high tariffs), are implicitly
allowed only when the DA deems a local "shortage" is prevailing (David et al, 2011 ).

In the following, data is based mostly on stereotypical information (based on estimates done
by producer service providers in Department of Trade and Industry); the cost structure is
broadly similar to that found in Tanchuling (2007), and Gergely (20 I 0). Based on financial
prices, domestic broiler production is borderline competitive with DRCR of 0.91 (Table 25),
with the ratio slightly lower using the shadow exchange rate. Details of the cost breakdown
are shown in Table 26. On the input side, economic price of feed is adjusted downward by
60%, as implied by the tariff rate on com. Note that this adjustment overstates the distortion
on feed price, as current feed prices already reflect cost-minimizing behavior of live:stock
producers (e.g. switch to feed wheat).
On the other hand, the CIF unit value of whole frozen chicken (in equivalent pesos per kg) is
only 52% that of the farmgate price; use of this value understates the actual divergence
between border and domestic price as farmgate parity must lie below the CIF unit value.
These caveats aside, the net divergence between financial and economic values still exceeds
financial profit, by over 14,000 pesos (for a set of 500 heads). The DRCR therefore is high,
i.e. domestic resources cost 2 pesos for every peso of foreign value added saved. Th is
contrasts sharply with Gergely (2010).

Similar adjustments are made for hogs. As with broilers, there is a small financial profit from
hog production, equivalent to a DRCR almost identical to that of broilers (with or without
adjustment for the shadow exchange rate). The CIF cost of frozen ham shoulders and cuts is
only 68% that of the farmgate price of hogs; using this value, economic revenues are only
52,000 pesos, only slightly higher than even the economic value oftradable inputs. DRCR is
even higher than that of broilers.

12. MILKFISH
Milkfish (Chanos chanos) counts among the top aquaculture fish species in the Philippines
by quantity (Figure 26). It continues to account for about 18% of domestic aquaculture
production, and has been growing fairly rapidly over time (about 5% p.a.), though somewhat
slower than the overall growth of aquaculture (7% p.a.)

The Philippines exports and imports small quantities ofmilkfish; exports are mostly frozen
whole (excluding livers and roes), while imports are mostly live fish for breeding. According
to SPC, the Philippines is the world's major exporter of whole milkfish. 2 Data from DA
(20 I 0) indicate an export value of 4Q.8 million dollars, from just 4,266 tons of exports, or
about $10/kg FOB. Compare this with the retail price of milkfish in the Philippines of Pl 14
per kg ($2.40). The country appears to be a highly competitive producer of milkfish. DRC
estimates confirm t~is (Table 27).

One ha of fishpond yields 41 - 42 thousand pesos of profit (using either financial or
economic prices), corresponding to DRCR of 0.29 to 0.30 (slightly lower using the shadow
exchange rate). Details of cost are provided in Table 28.

13. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Summary and sensitivity analysis
DRCR estimates (both financial and economic) are summarized in Table 29. The second to
last column provides re-estimated DRCR when world prices increase by 10%. The last
column assigns status as to whether the commodity is Importable, Exportable, or Nontraded,
primarily based on RCA. (Sugarcane is italicized owing to the concessionary nature of its
exports to the the USA, the biggest export destination). The assessment of DRC leads to the
following observations. ·

The DRCRs are generally robust to changes in assumptions, as tested by a 10% increase in
border price. The exception is hogs, where the alternative assumption causes a dramatic
improvement in DRCR (sending it below unity). The pattern of DRCRs can be summarized

                                                                                                                     34
as follows:
Financial DRCRfor all of the subject commodities are below unity, indicating each activity
is profitable from the private viewpoint. Note that there are variations in financial DRCR,
with the lowest belonging to exportables such as coconut, banana, pineapple, and milkfish;
for these products, doinestic resource cost is a relatively small proportion of value added (i.e.
gross output net of cost of tractable inputs). However as discussed previously, economic
DRCR is a better indicator of efficiency in resource utilization as it corrects for price
distortions.
Divergence between prices ofdomestic resources and tradable inputs are minor. In
Philippine agriculture, most inputs (fertilizer, feeds, seed, etc.) are not subject to large price
distortions, due to taxes, subsidies, or other regulations. The only exception appears to be for
rice, an importable product which enjoys a highly subsidized irrigation service.
For importable products, economic DRCR is much larger than financial DRCR, with the
exception ofyellow maize. Contrary to the financial DRCR criterion, contraction of rice,
hogs, and broilers at the margin is warranted. The large import-competing commodities in
the country are generally protected by severe import restrictions and taxes, especially rice,
hogs, and broilers. The distortions are severe enough to reverse the prescription indicated by
the financial DRCRs, i.e. based on economic DRCR, production of rice, hogs, and broilers
should decline; reallocation of resources from these sectors is being restrained by
distortionary price policies.
Interestingly, despite the presence of high import barriers, the study finds comparative
advantage for yellow maize and sugarcane in 2012. For the former, productivity gains
domestically have coincided with rising world prices. Meanwhile in the case of sugar, import
barriers appear to be unnecessary for continued growth of the industry, particularly under the
recent world sugar price boom. Parenthetically, this suggests that opening up of the sector to
foreign competition - especially in view of the reduction of intra-A SEAN tariffs to 5% - is
not expected to cause significant industry dislocation.
For exportable products, divergences between financial and economic DRCR are small.
Further expansion of exportables is .warranted. In Philippine agriculture, there are no serious
distortions for agricultural export activities, i.e. there are no significant export taxes or
subsidies, implicit or explicit. Combined with observation 2 above, this leads to a minimal
divergence between financial and economic valuation for exportable products. As a
corollary, allocation of resources towards exportables at the margin is justified based on the
efficiency criterion.

Annex: World Bank-supported        w~rk   on agricultural support in the Philippines
In 2006, the World Bank undertook a global research project in to quantify the changing
extent of distortions to agricultural incentives, covering Asia, Africa, Latin America, and
European transition economies. For study on the Philippines (David, Intal, and Balisacan,
2009) reports that the policy regime placing direct and indirect burden on agricultural had
reversed since the mid-1980s. The shift in protection towards agricultural import-competing
commodities artificially raised their profitability, increased the cost ofland for producing
other crops, and reduced the competitive advantage of exportable agriculture. For rice, the
inefficiency of price intervention policies is amplified by reliance on quantitative trade
restrictions.

In 2008, the World Bank launched a Monitoring and Evaluation of Agricultural Policy
(MEAP) project for the Philippines (David et al, 2012). Following OECD methodology, the
project of the World Bank estimates a set of indicators for monitoring and evaluation of
agricultural policy, namely: producer support (incorporating indirect market support, and
direct input support through irrigation, credit, and land transfer); general services support;
and public expenditures for agriculture. Price policy continues to play the biggest role in
agricultural support. From the 1990s onward, rising protection in favor of agriculture
resulting in expanding producer support. This was further enhanced by increasing budgetary
outlays for agriculture, which was mostly accounted for by irrigation in the 1970s, but in the
past decade has been skewed towards provision of private goods (such as fertilizer and seed
subsidies).
