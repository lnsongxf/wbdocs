     promoting technology diffusion. Most FTAs have provisions      Given that the majority of the MNCs in the high-tech

       Box 2.1: Survey of MNCs in High-tech Sectors

       To gain insight on the effects of CAFTA-DR on investments, production, exports, imports, and costs, we carried out a survey of
       firms in the high-tech sector. The questionnaire was distributed to 200 firms operating in the FTZs in the high-tech sector and
       was administrated online by CINDE during June-August 2013. Out of 200 firms contacted, only 62 (or 31 percent) responded to
       the questionnaire, but one firm was dropped as it was not in the high-tech sector. The response rate is similar to that of other
       enterprise surveys in Costa Rica. Although it is difficult to assess the representativeness of the sample, its distribution across
       sectors is similar to the distribution of firms and FDI across the high-tech sector, suggesting that the firms in the sample can be,
       to a large extent, considered as representative of the high-tech industry.

operations they had at the time of rejection, they would
have been unlikely to make further investments in Costa
Rica. A stable, rather than growing, market was the
estimated impact of the software firm, and a possible
relocation outside Costa Rica of their main raw materials
supplier could have been the consequence for the firm in
the “other manufacture” sector.

Other impacts of CAFTA-DR include effects on
competitiveness and origin of imports. Seven out of
11 firms estimated they were more competitive (or Costa
Rica was more competitive as an investment destination)
as a result of CAFTA-DR: one in the electronics sector, two
in the medical devices sector, and all firms in the services,
software, and “other manufacture” sectors. CAFTA-DR
had no impact in the destination of exports, but it has
had a small impact on the origin of imports. As some
firms try to develop Costa Rica or CAFTA-DR-based supply
chains, this impact could increase over time. All firms in the
electronics, medical devices, and services sectors indicated
that their sectors were growing very quickly, and agreed
that CAFTA-DR was helpful in increasing such growth.
Some of them even identified CAFTA-DR as the decisive
growth factor.

The results of our interviews suggest that CAFTA-DR
was relevant for foreign investors. For most investors
CAFTA-DR has been clearly an important factor in deciding
to set up or to expand operations in Costa Rica. While
CAFTA-DR has not fundamentally altered the economic
conditions under which these firms operate—import

        Box 3.1: Comparing Czech Republic, Uruguay and Poland

        Prior to the introduction of legislative reforms in 1994, the market in Uruguay operated as a monopoly through
        the state-owned Banco de Seguros del Estado (BSE). An exception was in cases where insurers and insurance had been
        grandfathered in from before the introduction of the monopoly, which largely applied to marine and cargo insurance. Once
        liberalized, worker’s compensation, bonds, and health insurance for public sector employees remained in the portfolio of the
        BSE. Compulsory third-party automobile insurance was introduced in 2009.

        Between 1948 and 1989, the Polish insurance sector operated as a monopoly controlled by the state owned PZU
        (domestic business) and WARTA (reinsurance and hard currency insurances). After 1989, these two companies remained
        active in the liberalized market and were partially privatized in 1999.

        In the Czech Republic, the Ceska Pojistovna lost its monopoly in 1989. However it did not see a competitor formed until
        1993; moreover, it did not lose its monopoly statues in aviation until 1997, and retained its monopoly on motor insurance until
        2000.

        Since liberalization in these countries, both life and non-life sectors have grown and developed, and the fledgling
        life insurance sector has been more dynamic. Life insurance as a proportion of total premium has practically doubled in the
        last 15 years, from 12 percent to over 26 percent in Uruguay, and from 34 percent to just under 60 percent in Poland. The non-
        life sector has become less dependent on motor insurance over the same period, from nearly 45 percent of non-life premium to
        40 percent in Uruguay and from 71 percent to 57 percent in Poland, reflecting increased product innovation and diversification
        which better meets the needs of the real economy.

        Although the former monopoly insurers’ shares of the market have fallen steadily, these insurers have seen steady
        growth in premiums every year since liberalization. The exception has been during economic crisis events, and even during
        those crises, premiums fell only marginally. Initially, the BSE wrote around 10 percent of total premium as life insurance and
        90 percent as non-life insurance, similar to the INS. Life insurance has now grown to over 25 percent of the BSE’s gross written
        premium. Over the last 15 years, life insurance premiums for the BSE grew at 17.6 percent per annum and non-life insurance
        premiums grew by 9.7 percent per annum. Life insurance premiums at the two former monopoly insurers in Poland have grown
        by 10.1 percent per annum over the last 15 years, and total premiums grew by 6.5 percent per annum.

that this transition will not occur until December 2017.
The sooner operators roll out 4G services, the higher the
benefits will be for consumers and businesses.

Infrastructure sharing and municipal permits

When Claro and Telefónica started building their
networks, they were delayed due to the slow process of
obtaining construction permits from municipalities. The
Sala IV decision and the recent loss of a court case by
several municipalities90 provide reason to hope that this
problem will be solved soon. However, as operators roll
out 4G in the future, they will probably need to build
more towers, and they may encounter delays again. Also,
fixed-line operators and cable TV companies need to use
ducts and poles to lay fiber. Therefore, this issue has to be
resolved. One option is to enforce infrastructure sharing
as stated in the law.91 The recent case of TIGO against
JASEC was resolved favorably, as SUTEL forced JASEC to
rent its poles to the company. This precedent may help
solve future disputes between new entrants and existing
operators over towers, buildings, poles, or ducts sharing,
as these elements of the network become critical to
deploy new networks.

Universal service and FONATEL

FONATEL effectiveness needs to be improved to
expand access for disadvantaged communities and
individuals. FONATEL is finally initiating the program to
invest the universal service fund resources to extend service
to un-connected communities, schools, health centers,
day care centers and other public community centers in
rural areas of Costa Rica. However, it has taken a long
time, partly due to the lengthy government procedures
established by law. The coordination between FONATEL
and the Ministries of Education, Health, and others has
not been very effective, and as a result FONATEL has
only funded Internet access, leaving to the ministries the
financing of computers, local area networks, and the

     When examining CCSS investments in medicines by
     type some interesting trends emerged. First, the gap
     between CCSS investments in national and foreign generic
     medicines has grown since 2009 (Figure 5.6). Furthermore,
     investments in innovative and biologic/biotechnology
     medicines are also growing. It is not possible to determine
     from the data whether CCSS purchases in medicines have
     shifted from national to foreign markets.

     In summary, the IP provisions with CAFTA-DR did not
     diminish the country’s ability to get medicines to ensure
     the health of the Costa Rican population. The decision to
     add medicines to the CCSS Official Medicine List depends
     on specific procedures regarding its efficacy and safety
     rather than with the IP provisions in CAFTA-DR.
