This paper synthesizes the findings of a global stocktaking on community-driven development
(CDD) and youth. The exercise was supported by a grant financed by the Trust Fund for Environ-
mental and Socially Sustainable Development (TFESSD) to reduce inequities and enhance inclu-
sion for youth empowerment and employment initiatives in CDD operations. The call by the
TFESSD in fiscal year 2012 was for proposals that were aimed at promoting equality of outcomes,
equality of opportunity, and social inclusion through World Bank Group-led activities in all sec-
tors. In response, focal points for the CDD approach in the Social Development (SDV), Social
Protection, and Rural Development departments jointly developed a proposal targeting youth,
an agenda relevant to all three sectors. In addition to the global stocktake, complementary
outputs also funded by the grant include country-level reports on overall youth development
policies and initiatives in three target countries (Sierra Leone, Kenya, and Nigeria), knowledge
exchange workshops on CDD and youth, and operational activities in requesting countries in
the Africa Region. Findings and lessons from this fieldwork have been incorporated in this paper.

The study was conducted by Sarah G. Adam and Kaori Oshima (SDV). Janmejay Singh (the first
task team leader), Sean Bradley (the leader for the CDD and Social Resilience cluster, SDV) and
Susan Wong (sector manager, SDV) provided overall guidance for the study. Support and advice
were also offered by Helene Grandvoinnet and Margaret Arnold (SDV). Gracie Ochieng provided
excellent administrative support, and Laura Johnson assisted the team with editorial and design
work. Research assistants for the country-level reports, Robert Sam-Kpakra (Sierra Leone), Ger-
trude Kopiyo (Kenya), and Bolarin Omonona (Nigeria), contributed by enriching the report with
lessons from the field.

The global stocktaking exercise was made possible with invaluable insights and resources shared
by a number of colleagues working across sectors and regions. The authors would particularly

Executive Summary

Young people—between the ages of 15 to 35 years old—today comprise approximately one-
third of the world’s population. This large, growing, and vital demographic group presents both
enormous potential and a fundamental challenge as young people play increasingly important
roles in economic growth, development, and stability. Many of the world’s youth face com-
mon difficulties, including a lack of quality education, low literacy levels, engagement in risky
behaviors with significant health consequences, high and increasing rates of unemployment,
limited access to economic resources, the breakdown of traditional social support systems, and
minimal influence on decision making. These barriers make youth vulnerable to exclusion from
the benefits of growth, slowing poverty alleviation, increasing inequality, and contributing to
a growing sense of alienation and frustration. Engaging youth more directly and giving them a
voice in development activities are vital to achieving the World Bank Group’s twin goals of end-
ing extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity for all people.

Community-driven development (CDD)—an approach emphasizing local control over planning
and investment resources—offers important advantages for engaging young people. The World
Bank’s portfolio of CDD projects provides a rich repository of experiences of how this approach
is being adapted to enhance the inclusion of young people. This study captures global examples
of CDD projects targeting youth in an attempt to inform and improve the design and implemen-
tation of CDD operations with positive outcomes for young people.

The study draws from a universe of over 60 active, planned, or recently closed CDD youth
projects across all regions in which the Bank operates. Significant diversity exists among these
projects in terms of the extent of youth focus; size, scale, and scope; contexts and conditions
to which they respond; and objectives and desired outcomes. Youth engagement is examined
through three interlinked dimensions of youth development: (1) endowments or the accumula-
tion of human capital assets; (2) employment and economic opportunities; and (3) empower-
ment, encompassing the concepts of participation, voice, and agency. The framework links each
dimension to a domain of inclusion—services, markets, and spaces—within which individuals
and groups take part in society. The stocktake reveals that CDD projects are contributing in
significant and innovative ways to the youth development agenda in all three spheres, and offers
reflections and opportunities for each dimension.

Improving endowments. Where public goods that specifically target youth are financed (e.g.,
school dormitories, scholarships to secondary schools, and reproductive health services), CDD
operations are improving the human capital endowments of young people by tailoring interven-
tions responsive to the priorities of youth.

                      •	   These investments expand access (particularly in education and health) and broadly sat-
                           isfy beneficiaries. Reaching young adults requires specific additions to the menu of eligible
                           investments (e.g., construction of secondary schools, cash grants or scholarships for older
                           students, and life skills training or counseling programs). Priorities identified by youth reveal
                           preferences for recreational and other communal activities and spaces.
                      •	   The differences in relative priorities between community-wide and youth groups highlights
                           a distinction and possible tension between the value of investments in basic education and
                           health and those that enhance interaction through more recreationally-focused activities.
                           Youth may need to be guided to help them make informed decisions that can meaningfully
                           enhance their human capital assets over the long term.
                      •	   Sports- and recreation-related investments are supported based on assumed causal links to
                           youth empowerment and/or reducing potential violence. However, evidence in support of
                           these links is scarce.
                      •	   Reaching youth requires concerted efforts and adjustments both during the preparatory
                           phase to understand youth constraints and priorities and throughout the subproject cycle.
                           The inclusion of youth-specific indicators and the monitoring of outcomes through benefi-
                           ciary feedback or stakeholder workshops are also important.
                      •	   CDD youth project teams focusing on increasing access to and utilization of services and
                           infrastructure should anticipate demands for investments that increase income and earn-
                           ings. Employment and livelihood-related activities have been incorporated in some projects,
                           and they are also being implemented through complementary initiatives. Projects should
                           clearly communicate their objectives and scope, including limitations, to ensure an under-
                           standing of and rationale for eligible investments.

                      Increasing economic opportunities. By addressing individual, labor market, and financial con-
                      straints, CDD projects are increasing the employability and employment opportunities of young
                      people. In contexts with strong private sectors, comprehensive employment services programs
                      are training and placing significant numbers of youth in salaried jobs. Demand-driven entrepre-
                      neurship promotion programs are yielding promising economic results.

                      •	   Projects supporting livelihoods or economic opportunities implement programs in four
                           main categories: skills training, entrepreneurship promotion, subsidized employment, and
                           employment services. In almost every case, CDD interventions are combining elements of
                           two or more types of activities to improve results.
                      •	   These initiatives are effectively using elements of the CDD approach to improve youth
                           outcomes, including the delivery of private benefits through a participatory communal
                           mechanism, community and self-targeting, mobilization of broad community support and
                           complementary inputs, and direct control of resources by project beneficiaries. Project
                           teams consistently report that these features add significant value by minimizing risk, con-
                           tributing to cost-effectiveness, ensuring buy-in, and enhancing sustainability.
                      •	   CDD employment-related investments are reaching a wide cross-section of youth with dif-
                           ferent education endowments, experiences, interests, and aspirations. Understanding these
                           differences and consciously tailoring programs to distinct categories of youth, including by
                           gender, would increase their effectiveness.
                                                                                                        Executive Summary • xi




•	   Livelihoods programs are very successful in South Asia, but project teams in other regions
     have identified challenges mainly due to limited or lack of required technical and private-
     sector expertise in CDD project implementing units. Experience in areas such as Tamil Nadu
     or Andhra Pradesh demonstrates the importance of assessing markets and of value-chain
     analysis to identify types of viable investments. CDD project and related technical teams
     must guide youth, while still respecting the demand-driven principle, so that funds can be
     applied to economically sustainable activities. Technical advice helps expand youth vision
     beyond typical activities to those that are potentially more economically viable.
•	   Task teams emphasize the need for continued and evolving capacity-building programs for
     young people. Programs that involve private goods should start with essential life skills, basic
     financial management, and related business skills, and add savings and investment skills as the
     program moves forward. Experience suggests that livelihood initiatives require a dedicated
     support team in the field to continue to provide capacity-building training and guidance,
     making project operations more complicated and labor intensive but offering enormous
     potential.
•	   Evidence on the effectiveness of youth employment-related initiatives is emerging. The
     rigorous impact evaluation of the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund’s Youth Opportuni-
     ties Program offers valuable learning. The South Asian employment services model has been
     adapted and adopted by many countries in the region, providing a rich set of experiences
     from which to extract lessons, including isolating features adapted to each context. A com-
     parative assessment of the South Asia CDD job placement portfolio would enhance learning
     and advance replication outside the region.

Enhancing empowerment. CDD operations are providing structured involvement of youth at
the local level by creating spaces for increased civic engagement and institutionalizing inclusion
of youth in decision making, design, and implementation aspects that directly affect them.

•	   CDD provides valuable—and valued—opportunities for young people to participate more
     fully in local development. Gains to empowerment from the implementation of CDD
     processes alone, however, cannot be assumed or expected. In most cases, project design
     would be improved by explicitly tracing a path to empowerment and projected results—for
     example, how increased involvement in decision making affects benefits accruing to youth.
     Such a causal chain would greatly enhance monitoring and evaluation.
•	   Quantitative targets are inadequate to ensure effective youth participation. Additional
     effort should be spent on measuring the quality of participation and its outcomes. The risks
     of “token” involvement and unmet expectations should be recognized and steps taken to
     avoid or mitigate them.
•	   It is important to understand the ongoing impacts or spillover effects of youth involvement
     in local decision-making processes and initiatives. Tracing CDD project participants over
     time to understand if they are becoming a new generation of national development leaders
     would be valuable. Documenting unintended negative consequences or unmet expecta-
     tions of early engagement by young people could also generate constructive lessons.
xii • Engaging Youth through Community-Driven Development Operations




                      •	   While most CDD projects address multiple objectives, design documents do not consis-
                           tently or explicitly address the hierarchy or potential tradeoffs among service delivery,
                           economic enhancement, and empowerment objectives. Practitioners should explore these
                           potential tradeoffs.
                      •	   An increasing number of CDD youth projects are piloting ICT-enabled approaches to improve
                           project management, strengthening accountability and making the most of young people’s
                           ability to master new technologies. New technologies have the potential to enhance youth
                           participation, and access to and command of new technologies can be a strong source of
                           youth empowerment.

                      This stocktake of the CDD youth portfolio reveals various design features employed by projects
                      to help ensure that resources reach young people. While a complete analysis of these elements
                      and choices is beyond the scope of this review, it suggests insights and preliminary guidance
                      around select features: the extent of youth focus, preparatory analysis, youth mobilization and
                      facilitation, social accountability, and monitoring and evaluation.

                      Extent of youth focus. The study identifies four broad categories of CDD projects that, to vary-
                      ing degrees, focus on youth, ranging from projects where youth are one of several target groups
                      to projects exclusively dedicated to youth. The decision about how much to focus on youth has
                      implications for project complexity, sustainability, and effectiveness.

                      The portfolio review and task team consultations suggest that the CDD projects that integrate
                      young people most successfully and sustainably are those that employ considered adjustments
                      to standard CDD procedures, either by introducing a youth “window” with earmarked funds or
                      a separate component, to increase and sustain the focus on and benefits to youth within the
                      context of the wider community. The experiences of youth-targeted programs in Tamil Nadu,
                      Northern Uganda, and Kenya, which all have dedicated funding streams, suggest that the addi-
                      tional complexity imposed by specific implementation arrangements to identify and implement
                      youth-focused activities is justified by strong positive results.

                      Preparatory analysis. Many of the CDD youth projects reviewed invested in some analysis of
                      the state of young people in their areas as well as institutional responses to addressing youth
                      development. Task teams reiterated in project documents that understanding the constraints,
                      priorities, and needs of young people is crucial to effectively reach and engage youth. The value
                      of preparatory analysis could be enhanced by:

                      •	   engaging more with Bank youth development specialists to ensure the transfer and applica-
                           tion of lessons from the Bank’s significant portfolio of youth investments, more systemati-
                           cally informing CDD projects seeking to benefit youth;
                      •	   using information often gathered during a situational assessment that differentiates among
                           categories of youth (e.g., young men and young women, skilled/educated and less skilled/
                           less educated, and rural and urban) more systematically to design interventions tailored to
                           specific groups of young people;
                                                                                                      Executive Summary • xiii




•	   paying more attention to useful information in order to gather baseline data that would
     advance evaluation; and
•	   exploring additional opportunities for study tours, South–South exchanges, and similar
     sharing events, including community-to-community and youth-to-youth exchanges.

Youth mobilization and facilitation. The importance of the quality of community mobilization
and facilitation efforts to the effectiveness of CDD subproject implementation is widely cited.
These efforts are likely to be even more critical when seeking to engage youth, given the scarcity
of opportunities to participate, the related lack of prior experience, and the general suspicion by
young people of institutional engagement.

Engaging youth requires additional and specific outreach strategies, tools and materials, longer
timeframes, simplified procedures, and more capacity-building, with implications for resource
allocation. Transparency of procedures, open channels of communication and information, and
the setting and management of realistic expectations help to reduce young people’s lack of
trust.

Social accountability and monitoring and evaluation. CDD projects entail distinct risks due
to the financing and implementation of large numbers of widely dispersed activities and the
susceptibility of processes to various forms of elite capture. Most CDD project designs include
measures to address the implicit risks that stem from the relative inexperience, capacity con-
straints, and unequal power relations facing young people.

Beyond the monitoring essential to addressing governance issues, CDD projects must measure
and evaluate the impacts of investments and processes on young people to ensure interven-
tions provide intended benefits to identified target groups. Understanding the factors that can
enhance or undermine the outcomes of youth development projects requires planning, moni-
toring, measuring, and documenting achievements and shortcomings.

This study also highlights the following elements of the participatory approach that task teams
agree add particular value to youth outcomes.

Institutional platforms. The local-level institutions created and enhanced by CDD projects
provide platforms for entry into households, communities, and local development spaces
through which information can be directly solicited from and imparted to project participants—
removing a key constraint to youth involvement. Targeting outcomes are improved through
community identification of beneficiaries. Space can be opened for young people’s voices to
be heard, for youth to begin their civic engagement, and for their ideas, skills, and enthusiasm
to be channeled to productive purposes. In crisis and post-conflict contexts where youth may
have served as combatants or where distrust of government may be high, interventions through
community institutions can help rebuild relationships between young people and the broader
community, and between communities and local authorities.

                      Group formation and joint liability. Through eligibility criteria, processes, and investments,
                      CDD projects incentivize and strengthen group formation, which help realize gains from joint
                      liability. Collective action, shared responsibility, and peer pressure reinforce a common sense of
                      purpose that helps to minimize the loss of funds and achieve and sustain outcomes.

                      Direct control of resources. By directly transferring resources to young people, CDD projects
                      grant significant authority to youth to influence local development in ways aligned with their
                      interests. In building the capacities of youth to direct and manage these funds, projects convey
                      the commitment, trust, and dignity crucial to the development of young people.

                      This stocktake also reveals several areas that would benefit from further attention and action:

                      Documenting and sharing lessons. Additional learning about how and why CDD approaches
                      affect youth outcomes would be greatly enhanced by more documentation of experiences and
                      opportunities to share these lessons. Capturing tacit knowledge held by practitioners is needed
                      to improve the design and implementation of new and ongoing programs. Documenting and
                      understanding failed efforts to produce desired outcomes would also be highly valuable.

                      Expanding learning. Most projects in the CDD youth portfolio drew on CDD experience in
                      project design. However, they drew much less systematically on the experiences of the Bank’s
                      youth projects. As this study helps identify CDD’s contributions to youth programming, learn-
                      ing from youth projects implemented through a range of approaches should also inform CDD
                      operations. The experiences of those youth projects that already apply some elements of the
                      CDD model, such as youth-targeted mobilization activities or participatory targeting, would be
                      particularly useful.

                      Evaluating. There is a dearth of evidence about how specific and isolated factors impact
                      outcomes. Examples include the impact of investments in sports and recreational facilities
                      and activities, the cost-effectiveness of delivering similar benefits through other investments
                      and approaches, the need for relevant supply-side investments, and why certain programs are
                      working.

                      Throughout the developing world, young people face a number of common challenges that
                      must be addressed in a more comprehensive way at both the policy and program levels. With
                      its multisectoral and demand-driven approach, CDD is well placed to help meet youth-defined
                      needs holistically: increasing human capital endowment, expanding economic opportunities,
                      and strengthening empowerment. Given these findings, it is reasonable to assume that a CDD
                      operation is most effective at meeting youth needs when it forms a critical piece of a govern-
                      ment’s harmonized youth development strategy, complemented by policy initiatives and other
                      programmatic responses.
I. Introduction

Background and Rationale
Today, approximately two billion people, or one-third of the world’s population, are young
people between the ages of 15 and 35—the largest group to transition into adulthood in
history. This number is expected to continue rising, peaking in the coming years, creating a youth
“bulge” in many countries. Such a large, growing, and vital demographic group presents both
enormous potential and a fundamental challenge as young people begin to play increasingly
important roles in economic growth, development, and stability.

The vast majority of the world’s youth live in developing and conflict countries, where they
constitute a disproportionate share of the poor (World Bank 2006). Many face common chal-
lenges that prevent them from fully participating in their country’s economic, political, and social
life, including:

•	   poor quality of education and low levels of functional literacy, which
     limit learning, the development of additional skills, and productivity;          Box 1.1. Defining “Youth”
•	   risky behaviors with significant health consequences, including high rates
     of early pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, and substance abuse;                               “Youth” is a transitional phase from child-

                      Community-driven development (CDD) is an approach that emphasizes local control over
                      planning decisions and investment resources. Initially implemented to channel basic develop-

                      capacity or fragile/conflict-affected circumstances, the approach has been mainstreamed across
                      a range of applications in different sectors and contexts. These programs operate on the prin-
                      ciples of local empowerment, participatory governance, demand-responsiveness, administra-
                      tive accountability, and enhanced local capacity. When given clear explanations of the process,
                      access to information, and adequate capacity and financial support, experience demonstrates
                      that poor people can effectively organize to identify community priorities and address local
                      problems by working with local governments and other supportive partners. Frequently used to
                      target the poorest regions, villages, and households, CDD operations are successfully reaching
                      and empowering communities, delivering cost-effective infrastructure, enhancing livelihoods,
                      and improving community dynamics.1

                      CDD offers important advantages for engaging young people, and thus has the potential to
                      enhance the inclusion of an alienated youth population. The approach’s flexibility and adapt-
                      ability allow it to be applied in varying contexts for a range of purposes and to address the needs
                      of different groups of young people. Working at the local level, CDD can attract and retain the
                      interest of youth through investments and by tackling issues of direct relevance to them. It can
                      help bring youth voices to the table, leverage positive community influences to guide their
                      behavior and development, and integrate youth policy issues with local development priorities.
                      CDD’s multisectoral approach also allows the needs of young people to be comprehensively
                      addressed. In turn, youth, can significantly enhance CDD operations—broadening participation,
                      increasing the transparency of decision making and resource use, offering their creativity, energy,
                      optimism, and improving outcomes.

                      But given CDD’s underlying principle of inclusive participation, inherent challenges exist in
                      using the approach to address the needs of specific beneficiary groups within communities.
                      Without earmarking resources and/or including additional criteria for promotion and eligibility,
                      a participatory process that applies democratic principles likely results in the prioritization of
                      investments demanded most by the broader community. Directing resources to youth—or to
                      any specified group—can generate issues and concerns, particularly in fragile contexts, including
                      the potential for elite capture of scarce resources, the introduction of incentives for others to
                      demonstrate their “weakness” in order to be included, and the instigation of resentment among
                      the excluded. Furthermore, working with young people presents specific challenges: their skills
                      are often limited, their abilities untested, and their attention difficult to sustain. And youth can
                      possess an inherent suspicion of institutional engagement. By definition, youth is a transient
                      stage, and thus capacity-building efforts must be continuously repeated. In order to ensure that
                      investments contribute to youth development, awareness by governments and project teams

of both the opportunities and challenges of adopting the approach to benefit young people is
needed.

The portfolio of CDD projects provides a rich repository of global experiences about how
this approach has been adapted to engage youth by addressing their needs through expanded
access to social services and economic opportunities, and by strengthening their participa-
tion and capacities in local decision making. While client and CDD task team interest in and
demand for guidance on how to tap the potential of young people grows, there has been little
effort to document the wide experience of CDD projects seeking to include and benefit youth.2
This global stocktake synthesis is therefore an initial and modest attempt to fill this knowledge
gap, looking broadly and systematically at the Bank’s considerable portfolio of CDD projects
through a youth lens.


Objective, Scope, and Audience
The objective of this study is to promote a better understanding of the experiences, findings,
and opportunities of World Bank community-driven development activities for engaging
youth. To this end, the study captures CDD’s contributions to various dimensions of youth devel-
opment and examines how CDD projects are seeking to affect youth outcomes. This learning is
intended to inform and improve the design and implementation of ongoing and planned CDD
operations that target young people. Its primary audience is CDD task teams seeking to increase
the role of and impact on youth in their projects. Task teams employing other approaches for
similar purposes interested in adapting and adopting elements of CDD to enhance outcomes
might also find the study informative.


Approach
Initially, it was envisioned that this stocktake would present case studies highlighting good
practices of CDD projects that focused specifically on youth, and from that, a report syn-
thesizing these experiences and lessons would be developed. This approach posed several
challenges and opportunities. First, the portfolio review yielded few case studies with sufficient
evidence of positive youth outcomes. Approaches employed by these limited examples were
so diverse that a coherent and meaningful summary of them was impractical. Furthermore, the
systematic compilation of project information revealed a much broader collection of opera-
tions that offers valuable lessons. At the same time, the publication of the World Bank’s recent
Inclusion Matters report (World Bank 2013d) presented an opportunity to assess the portfolio
by looking at youth development through an inclusion lens. Consequently, the scope of this
study expanded from one that would summarize select case studies to one that reviews cur-
rent CDD experiences of engaging youth through a framework that links youth development to
the domains of inclusion, and that illustrates this experience with examples from the broader
portfolio of World Bank CDD projects.

                      This study is primarily based on a desk review of project documents and reports, supple-
                      mented by consultations with task teams. Project documents, including project appraisal
                      documents, implementation status and results reports, and implementation completion and
                      results reports, and evaluations were used to compile a universe of CDD projects with significant
                      experience involving and benefiting youth. Secondary literature on youth development and
                      challenges was reviewed to determine typical results. CDD task teams were consulted to elabo-
                      rate and reflect on the contributions of their project to youth outcomes, and youth specialists
                      within the Bank helped analyze relevant issues and evidence. Bank staff and project teams in
                      three countries (Kenya, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone), targeted under a companion country-level
                      analyses of youth issues, provided valuable details that were discussed during site visits. A mul-
                      tisectoral team comprised of specialists from the Social Protection, Social Development, and
                      Rural Development sectors, who initiated the grant activity in a collaborative manner, guided
                      project selection and focus.


                      Limitations
                      It is important to note the limitations of this study in assessing the experience of CDD in
                      engaging youth. First, this stocktake captures the experience from World Bank initiatives only.
                      Second, given their focus on communities, by definition, all CDD projects involve youth, which
                      made identifying a discrete portfolio of CDD youth projects difficult. Third, extracting youth-
                      specific design and implementation experiences was hindered by a lack of documented exam-
                      ples. Finally, a lack of robust outcome and impact data on CDD interventions that have targeted
                      youth limits the soundness of conclusions, although available output level data and qualitative
                      assessments do substantiate the findings. Where possible, the study also draws on evidence
                      from the broader youth literature to corroborate promising results.


                      Structure
                      The report is organized into four chapters. This chapter has introduced the rationale, objec-
                      tives, scope, approach, and limitations of the study. Chapter 2 expands on the methodology
                      and presents an overview of the portfolio. It also provides a framework for analyzing youth
                      engagement across three dimensions—endowments of human capital assets, employment, and
                      empowerment—with interventions in the related domains of inclusion—services, markets, and
                      spaces. Chapter 3 illustrates different types of CDD investments across these dimensions and
                      domains, and explores aspects of CDD that offer the most promise for improving youth out-
                      comes. Chapter 4 draws conclusions, offers emerging guidance around select project design
                      features, and identifies areas for further attention. A matrix of CDD youth projects compiled for

II. Methodology,
     Portfolio Overview,
     and Framework

Defining the Universe
In defining the universe of World Bank community-driven development (CDD) youth projects,
projects with explicit intent to benefit youth using specific design elements were identified.
Projects naming youth as one target group without defined measures to reach them were not
included. This step was taken because young people are members of every community, so by
their nature, all CDD operations include youth. The stocktaking exercise began by considering
the broad set of recently closed, active, and pipeline CDD operations extracted from the CDD
database3 as well as projects financed by World Bank-managed trust funds not included in the
CDD database. This set was then narrowed by cross-referencing it with the Youth and Child
database (fiscal 2000–10) and various regional matrices of youth operations, and by reviewing
available project appraisal, implementation, and completion reports. The review did not exam
youth employment and development projects that use select aspects of a participatory/CDD
approach given the challenge of covering the vast and dynamic youth development agenda and
the potential for diminishing the depth of analysis.

Within these parameters, the study identified and included four broad categories of CDD
youth projects that reflect increasing degrees of youth focus: projects with youth as one
target group, projects with a youth “window,” CDD projects with separate youth programs or
components, and dedicated CDD youth projects (see figure 2.1).


Overview of the CDD Youth Portfolio
Based on these parameters, the study identified a universe of 61 active, planned, and recently
closed CDD youth projects in 39 countries across all regions in which the Bank operates (see
annex). A degree of judgment was exercised in compiling the universe, given the information
available and the lack of any usable project coding for this purpose. The primary value of this
compilation of projects is to guide information collection.

This universe embodies a significant degree of variation across sectors and regions, and in
terms of scale, context, and dimension of youth engagement. Like the broader portfolio of
CDD investments, CDD youth projects are being managed by multiple sector units, including

                        grams to small, targeted grants. In addition to dedicated CDD youth projects and components,
                        the universe also includes projects that integrate youth as members of the broader community,
                        making it difficult to estimate the dollar amount of Bank investments in youth activities through
                        CDD.

                        While the CDD youth portfolio spans all regions, there is a degree of uniformity in project
                        rationale, design, and strategy by region.

                        •	   In Sub-Saharan Africa, engagement with youth is focused on employment initiatives, includ-
                             ing labor-intensive public works, self-employment, and entrepreneurship, and on facilitating
                             access to private sector employment through training and apprenticeships. In many African
                             countries—as elsewhere—an emphasis on youth arose because of the need to respond to
                             post-conflict and/or other unstable environments. In these contexts, additional emphasis is
                             placed on the reintegration of youth in development decisions and communities as well as
                             labor markets to improve community reconciliation and reduce the potential for conflict.
                        •	   In South Asia, most CDD youth projects make significant investments in employment
                             opportunities and livelihoods, each adapting a similar model that identifies eligible youth,
                             organizes job fairs with potential training partners and potential employees, and places
                             youth in wage jobs or prepares them for self-employment through strategic partnerships
                             with private sector companies. Such interventions respond to the growing youth popula-
                             tion, expanding private sector, and significant deficits in skilled labor for industries.

•	   In East Asia, youth are incorporated in national CDD operations as members of the broader
     community. In general, CDD investments are concentrated on the provision of infrastructure
     and services to increase access to economic and social services. Also, in both the South
     Asia and East Asia regions, young people are given special attention in fragile, conflict, and
     post-conflict contexts such as Mindanao (Philippines), Timor-Leste, Southern Thailand, and
     Sri Lanka, with a focus on social cohesion and empowerment.
•	   In Latin America, where there is an active portfolio of youth projects, CDD youth engagement
     varies widely—emphasizing access to basic services and economic and social infrastructure
     in Brazil, improving employability in the agricultural sector in Paraguay, and reducing the
     potential for violence in Jamaica and Haiti through the financing of youth-specific services
     such as conflict resolution training and after-school programs. All projects aim to empower
     youth through participation in local development decision-making processes.
•	   In the Middle East and North Africa, attention has focused on increasing the access of
     youth to economic opportunities, quality education, recreational activities, and political
     participation/active citizenship. The region’s CDD projects in Morocco, West Bank/Gaza,
     and Lebanon emphasize youth inclusion and voice through greater participation in decision
     making and activities of particular relevance to youth.
•	   In Europe and Central Asia, CDD youth operations aim to include youth to increase access
     to assets, targeting those from particularly vulnerable and marginalized groups (internally
     displaced persons in Azerbaijan), as well as initiatives to develop active citizenship among
     young people by mainstreaming participation.

One common thread found across regions is that CDD investments address challenges to
youth development posed by particular contexts of conflict, post-conflict, or violence. Exam-
ples include Côte d’Ivoire, Azerbaijan, and Iraq, where projects are intended to strengthen the
prospects for peace; Southern Thailand, Mindanao, and Sri Lanka, where inter-ethnic or religious
tensions threaten stability; and urban areas in Papua New Guinea, Jamaica, and Haiti with high
rates of crime and violence often perpetrated by youth.

Many CDD youth projects are being implemented in rural areas. Examples include regions
of Brazil and India where inequities/disparities have excluded vulnerable groups—including
youth—from benefiting from significant economic gains experienced elsewhere in the country
or state. Urban projects are concentrated in cities with high crime rates or in particularly poor
areas where youth suffer from lack of access to social services and economic opportunities.

CDD youth projects address one or more dimensions of youth development: human capital
endowments or the accumulation of education and health; economic opportunities, nota-
bly employment; and empowerment or agency. The decision about which of these youth
development outcomes to address reflects the particular challenges and constraints faced by
young people in these varying contexts. As discussed below, these dimensions—endowments,
employment and empowerment—provide a framework through which to analyze the portfo-
lio’s engagement of youth.
8 • Engaging Youth through Community-Driven Development Operations




                      Framework
                      In many countries, young people are at risk of exclusion, which can result in reduced social
                      standing accompanied by lower development outcomes. This study approaches the topic by
                      broadly considering the dimensions of youth development— endowments, employment, and
                      empowerment—and the associated domains of services, markets, and spaces, as described in
                      a recent World Bank report on social inclusion (World Bank 2013d). Figure 2.2 connects these
                      dimensions and domains.

                      Defining and distinguishing among these three dimensions is not straightforward because
                      they differ depending on sociocultural and political contexts, are interrelated and overlap.
                      The accumulation of assets grants access to economic opportunities. Increased income from
                      economic activities, in turn, enhances investments in human capital and voice. Greater endow-
                      ments combined with economic opportunities enhance the position of youth to act, and
                      empowerment or agency influences their ability to build up human capital and pursue economic
                      opportunities (World Bank 2006a; 2011d). Nevertheless, these concepts provide a framework that
                      helps to illustrate the entry points for CDD engagement with youth.

     How Community-
III. 
     Driven Development
     Seeks to Enhance Youth
     Development Outcomes

The youth development literature identifies three areas of vulnerability and related pathways
for improving the lives of young people (World Bank 2005; 2006). These are: enhancing access
to and the quality of education and health services to increase human capital, addressing market
constraints to expand opportunities for productive economic activity, and engaging in spaces
for young people to influence decisions regarding their own development. Community-driven
development (CDD) youth projects can and do finance investments in all three of the identi-
fied domains—services, markets, and spaces—to improve youth outcomes in endowments of
human capital assets, economic opportunities, and empowerment through voice and agency.

CDD youth projects aim to achieve one or more of these three linked and mutually support-
ive outcomes (see table 3.1). Even when projects seek to produce tangible outcomes generated
by investments in infrastructure and basic services and/or in strengthening livelihoods, most also
aim to improve the less tangible outcome of empowerment, social capital, and local governance,
either explicitly or implicitly.


Human Capital Endowments
In many parts of the world, young people are excluded from quality basic services, resulting
in substantial deficits in human capital, such as in health, education, and physical assets. As a
result, their ability to access productive economic opportunities and to constructively contrib-
ute to society is limited. For example, the exclusion occurs in terms of a lack of access to primary
and secondary schooling, nonformal education, appropriate health services, and reproductive
health information. In the short term, the deprivation of opportunities to accumulate human
capital leads to inadequate skills development, poor prospects for employment, risky behav-
iors such as early pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections, and possibly violence. In the
long term, it can cause prolonged unemployment or low-wage employment, intergenerational
transmission of poor health, high economic costs of risky behaviors to society, and foregone
contributions to development (World Bank 2005). The Inclusion Matters report notes: “perhaps
the most important route to social inclusion is through the enhancement of human capital,
which can be achieved through better and more dignified access to services” (World Bank 2013d).

                              CDD project documents note the exclusion of young people (and children) from access to
                              social services and infrastructure, which limits their accumulation of health, education, and
                              physical assets. Exclusion is due to both demand and supply constraints. These barriers and the
                              specific investments by CDD youth projects to address them are detailed in table 3.2.

                              CDD projects that seek to improve access to basic social services and infrastructure by poor
                              communities and vulnerable groups, including young people, are being implemented in all six
                              regions. In operations where subprojects were proposed and prioritized by groups comprised of
                              a cross-section of community members, investments were typically concentrated in the roads,
                              education, health, and water sectors. Youth-specific groups, on the other hand, exhibited a pref-
                              erence for youth and community centers, sports and cultural facilities, and libraries as well as the
                              equipment, goods and programs to help realize the benefits of these spaces.

                              Increases in the accumulation of human capital assets in CDD (and CDD youth) projects are
                              typically measured by actual or perceived changes in access to and/or satisfaction with ser-
                              vices delivered. Impact evaluations of CDD programs suggest that when implemented well, these

operations can increase access to and use of services, particularly in health and education (Wong
2012). In Mongolia, the number of children and youth staying in school dormitories, essential in a
nomadic society, increased by 169 percent, and school drop out rates declined by 82 percent.4 In
Azerbaijan, in areas where rural roads were rehabilitated, average travel time to secondary schools
was reduced by 49 percent. In Morocco, 41 to 65 percent of young people reported increased use
of basic infrastructure and socioeconomic services created by the National Initiative for Human
Development Program.5 In Poland, 95 percent of survey respondents reported improvement in
the availability of extracurricular activities for children and youth.6 Beneficiary assessments that
survey young people often report high rates of satisfaction, particularly with the delivery of
youth-friendly goods and services.7 Documented improvements in longer-term education and
health outcomes as a result of CDD interventions are less widely available because few projects
measure impacts on educational achievement, learning, or longer-term health outcomes, in part
due to the short timeframes for the evaluations (Wong 2012).

Generally, many of the CDD operations that aim to enhance human capital endowments
employ similar design features to achieve results. Project design is informed by preparatory
analysis, commonly a situational analysis, which reveals specific constraints and recommends
possible responses. The majority of CDD youth projects do not employ a dedicated focus on
young people but instead adapt—to varying degrees—design features to address youth needs.
Funds are not earmarked or otherwise set aside for youth-specific activities. Investments ben-
efiting youth are prioritized by the broader community, including young people. Participating

 Box 3.1. Encouraging Youth Participation in the West Bank and Gaza

 Context. In the West Bank and Gaza, continuing conflict was perpetuating an internal cycle of violence, weakening the social fabric and
 institutional resilience at both the central and local levels, and affecting individual well-being. The weakening of the Palestinian Authority,
 the increased restriction of movement, and intensifying political polarization in an inherently patriarchal society, intensified the exclusion
 of weaker social groups from the decision-making process and from the economy.

 The Village and Neighborhood Development Project, launched in 2008, was designed to build on existing social capital before it was
 further diminished. It aimed at promoting a coordinated development approach to enhance the capacity of communities to plan for and
 manage resources. It also sought to promote youth empowerment through community-based projects with the potential and flexibility
 to involve youth in local decision making and to enhance their participation.

 Approach. To achieve its objectives, the project provided grants to vulnerable communities to finance projects identified through a
 participatory local planning process. The targeted populations were those that had been marginalized because of restrictions on mobility
 (i.e., the separation barrier and check points) and those in poor, remote areas or refugee camps in Gaza that had received little donor
 assistance. Informed by a trust fund-financed grant to promote youth inclusion in conflict and post-conflict contexts and a study visit
 to Indonesia, project design paid particular attention to the participation of young people (along with other excluded groups) in local
 decision-making processes.

 Guidelines for youth participation throughout the project cycle, based on consultations with youth and youth organizations, were out-
 lined in the operational manual. Provisions included:

 •	 Oversight consultants: personnel who assist communities throughout program implementation, including mobilization, subproject
   implementation, and evaluation, and who specifically strive to engage youth volunteers with ties to local communities, promoting
   acceptance, facilitating access to information at the village level, and helping to mobilize the young generation.
 •	 Project support groups (PSGs) were formed through community-level consultations, composed of local community representatives,
   including youth and women.
 •	 Activities financed included family-friendly parks or recreational areas, construction or rehabilitation of classrooms, support to youth
   centers and sports facilities, and delivery of equipment for schools.
 •	 The monitoring system (or results framework) included numerous youth-specific indicators and qualitative assessments.

                                                                                                                                    (continued)



                              youth play varying roles during subproject implementation, from providing labor to supervising
                              activities. Youth-specific indicators are monitored against targets.

                              In the West Bank and Gaza, where youth are typically excluded from public decision-making pro-
                              cesses, the Village and Neighborhood Development Project introduced a set of specific design
                              features and monitoring indicators to ensure their inclusion (see box 3.1).

                              New generation CDD programs are adopting tools from other types of operations to
                              strengthen targeted outcomes, such as secondary school attendance, responsible parent-
                              ing, and preventive health services. In Indonesia’s National Program for Community Empower-
                              ment —Healthy and Smart Generation (PNPM Generasi), targeted rural poor communities and
                              local service providers work together with help from facilitators to identify needs and bottle-
                              necks for schooling and use of health services. Using the block grants financed by the program,

  Box 3.1. Continued

  Results. As a result of these provisions:

  •	 Youth comprised 41 percent of PSG members compared to a targeted 30 percent, and the number of youth (and women) in PSGs
     continues to grow.
  •	 44 percent of implemented subprojects had youth among the main beneficiaries, exceeding the target of 30 percent.
  •	 49 percent of beneficiaries stated that subprojects contributed greatly to the development of services provided to youth.
  •	 86 percent of indirect beneficiaries reported that the CDD approach helped communities become more capable of engaging youth.

  Beneficiary assessments and stakeholder workshops confirmed that communities became more aware of the need to engage women and
  youth in decision-making processes and in highlighting issues and project ideas that the communities had not considered prior to their
  participation. The vast majority (82 percent) of direct beneficiaries reported that they evaluate the participation of youth as valuable; 70
  percent reported that the “youth groups had become more influential or efficient.” However, the role of youth declines as the process
  moves from decision making into implementation, and follow-up activities, in part because more specific expertise is required for imple-
  mentation, and the PSG assumes the role of monitoring implementation.

  Lessons learned. By monitoring youth indicators, the project team learned that it is important to introduce creative ideas in order to
  maintain the roles and contribution of youth and women in operating projects, allowing them to feel responsible for their communities
  and to take part in changing their realities. Success depends on the right incentives and on regular monitoring. For example, allocating local
  contributions for incentives to youth in the form of job opportunities, financial rewards, or recognition such as certificates that convey
  appreciation and respect for their contributions. Such recognition may lead to increased commitment and could encourage more youth
  to take part in the local community’s ongoing development process.

communities can stimulate demand by giving people cash or scholarships to use certain services,
or they can address supply problems, such as too few health clinic workers or overcrowded
classrooms, to improve access. A recent impact evaluation found that enrollment and atten-
dance in junior secondary school improved, with the biggest impacts on families with incomes
in the bottom 40 percent (Olken et al.). Although not specifically targeting youth, the program’s
promising outcomes, combined with evidence from operations using similar approaches, offer
insights for using community-wide incentives to remove constraints to accumulating the human
capital of young adult members of the community (World Bank 2013a; 2014b).

CDD youth projects that initially focus on enhancing endowments of human capital assets face
pressure to address demands for increasing the earnings and employment of young people.
Partly in response to a preoccupation with employment issues at the community level, Timor-
Leste and Morocco programs both allowed financing for income-generating activities, compli-
cating project implementation because additional expertise to appraise and supervise these
activities was required. Project stakeholders in Poland, explicitly recognizing the link between
poverty and unemployment and social inclusion, noted that efforts to comprehensively address
social inclusion should include a component specifically targeting employment creation. In Azer-
baijan, additional financing will expand the livelihoods pilot in response to demands, including by
youth, for the financing of productive investments.

                      Reflections and Opportunities on Human Capital Endowments
                      •	   CDD projects, including those that seek to benefit youth through the financing of basic
                           infrastructure and services, are succeeding in delivering cost-effective investments that
                           expand access—particularly in education and health—and broadly satisfy beneficiaries.
                           These investments are primarily designed to benefit children, but they extend to young
                           people. To better reach young adults, specific additions to the menu of eligible investments
                           may be required (e.g., construction of secondary schools, cash grants or scholarships for
                           older students, and life skills training or counseling programs). Youth-identified priorities
                           reveal preferences for recreational and other communal activities and spaces.

                      •	   Evidence of outcomes of sports-related investments is particularly scarce. Justification for
                           financing such investments is often made on the basis of empowering youth (and reducing the
                           potential for violence) through increased interaction and responsiveness to expressed priori-
                           ties. This dimension is discussed in further detail in the empowerment subsection on page 23.

                      •	   These differences in relative priorities between community-wide and dedicated youth
                           groups highlight a distinction and possible tension between the value of investments in
                           basic education and health and those that enhance interaction through more recreationally
                           focused activities. While respecting the principle of participation and ownership, youth (as
                           with other groups) may need to be guided to help make informed decisions that can mean-
                           ingfully enhance their human capital assets over the long term.

                      •	   Reaching youth requires concerted efforts and adjustments, not only with the initial prepa-
                           ratory work to understand youth constraints and priorities, but throughout the subproject
                           cycle. Examples of effective adaptations include conducting local information and outreach
                           campaigns specifically targeted to youth, ensuring youth representation on decision-making
                           bodies, defining roles for youth during implementation, and monitoring activities. A coherent
                           set of design features should include youth-specific indicators and the monitoring of progress
                           and outcomes.

                      •	   CDD youth project teams that focus on increasing access to and utilization of services
                           and infrastructure (public goods) should anticipate demands for investments that increase
                           income and earnings (private goods). Employment and livelihood-related activities have
                           been incorporated in some projects by targeting the employment of young people in the
                           construction of subproject investments and financing for income-generating activities, and
                           they are also being implemented through complementary initiatives (see Employment and
                           Economic Opportunities section that follows). In order to ensure understanding of the
                           rationale for eligible investments, projects should clearly communicate their objectives and
                           scope, including limitations.

Employment and Economic Opportunities
Access to economic opportunities is the second critical dimension of youth development
and engagement addressed through CDD youth projects. Youth unemployment and a lack of
economic opportunities for youth in general are major development concerns for young people
as well as for the economic growth and performance of countries and for social and political
stability (Cunningham et al. 2010; Filmer et al. 2014; Robalino et al. 2013; World Bank 2013e). Unem-
ployment rates for youth are systematically higher than for older generations, and young people
constitute a disproportionately large share of the working poor. Prolonged youth unemploy-
ment or delayed transition to work can affect the accumulation of human capital assets, physical
and psychological health, and lifetime earnings (Robalino et al. 2013). These individual effects
can also restrict productivity and economic growth. In conflict-affected countries, employment
for young men and ex-combatants takes on particular importance given their vulnerability to
participate in violence.

Access to and resulting inclusion in labor markets is constrained by factors and failures at mul-
tiple levels, which can disproportionately affect young people. Individual characteristics, such
as cognitive, technical, and noncognitive skills; household income; and social networks determine
choices people have in the labor market. Failures in labor and capital markets limit opportuni-
ties to obtain salaried jobs or start businesses. Macro-characteristics, such as macroeconomic,
demographic, and geopolitical factors, influence the potential of new businesses and expansion
of firms, directly affecting the employment prospects of young people (Cunningham et al. 2010).

CDD projects that focus on youth employability, employment, and livelihoods seek to
address many—although not all—of the supply- and demand-side constraints. The range of
CDD youth investments encompasses skills training, entrepreneurship and livelihoods promo-
tion, public works programs, and employment services. Table 3.3 maps interventions against the
broad set of constraints that affect youth labor market outcomes, and it notes those projects
that employ the related strategy. As described below, these interventions are not mutually
exclusive, and CDD projects are following good practices by successfully combining activities
that simultaneously address several constraints.

The portfolio review reveals that various types of youth employment programs are being
implemented by CDD projects in different regions. Training activities and entrepreneurship
promotion financed through CDD programs are found in countries in every region. Labor-inten-
sive public works are most prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa and in conflict contexts. Another
variation of subsidized employment programs, where young people are paid to deliver social
services is found in the Middle East and North Africa. Comprehensive employment services
programs, which combine access to information regarding job availability, job counseling, and
placement services are concentrated in South Asia and are being piloted in Africa.8 This variation
across regions is due, at least in part, to different sets of opportunities and constraints to youth


8. This typology of employment projects follows that used by the Youth Employment Inventory, a joint effort of the
World Bank, the German Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank,
the International Labor Organization, and the Youth Employment Network. An analysis of these programs is included in
Robalino et al. 2013.

                                    varying constraints to youth employment. These initiatives cover four of the five categories of
                                    youth employment interventions—skills training, subsidized employment through public works,
                                    entrepreneurship promotion, and employment services.9 Each intervention targets one or more
                                    groups of youth with different backgrounds and characteristics, and seeks to increase access to


                                    9. The fifth area, reforms to labor market regulation, is beyond the scope of CDD initiatives.

            ngaging Communities through Sierra Leone’s Productive Safety Net
  Box 3.2. E
           for Vulnerable Youth

  Context. To help mitigate the negative impacts of the global food, fuel, and financial crises, in 2011, the Sierra Leone Youth Employment
  Support Program launched a cash-for-work component to provide a safety net and income support for the most vulnerable youth
  through short-term employment on labor-intensive projects.

  Approach. The cash-for-work program targets youth (ages 15–35) in poor and vulnerable communities. Beneficiaries are selected through a
  multistep process: (1) communities are identified based on poverty and food security estimates; (2) communities submit requests for sub-
  projects based on a list of eligible investments (e.g., feeder road rehabilitation, planting of crops, and renewable energy and environmental
  mitigation activities); and (3) community oversight committees identify the poorest households with at least one young person willing to
  work. In addition, lower-than-market wage rates are used to discourage non-poor applicants from participating. Day-to-day implementa-
  tion of the program at the local level, which includes purchasing materials, recording participation, and administrating payments, was
  initially managed by independent contractors hired by the project. However, this responsibility has been shifted to communities after
  concerns regarding mismanagement and leakages were raised. Currently, subprojects are typically contracted out to youth associations
  and local enterprises run by youth. Community oversight committees monitor the progress of works and payments as well as disputes.

  Results. Overall, in the short-term (two to three months), the cash-for-works program served as a highly productive safety net for par-
  ticipating households. A recent impact evaluation found that the program successfully reached youth with low levels of education (more
  than half had not completed primary school) working in the agricultural sector, approximately one-third of whom were young women.
  More than half of the beneficiaries had not engaged in any remunerated work in the month prior to the program. As a result of program
  participation:

  •	 monthly household incomes increased by 26 percent;
  •	 households increased their likelihood of enterprise creation and participation in informal savings groups, although no corresponding
     increases in household savings were reported;
  •	 households accumulated greater stocks of small livestock assets; and
  •	 spending on food, hygiene products, and home improvements increased.

  Lessons Learned. Evaluation results are being used to improve program design. Adjustments include the introduction of a mobile money
  payment mechanism to strengthen accountability, the shifting of responsibility for subproject implementation from contractors to com-
  munity management, and the implementation of measures to further increase the participation of young women.

employment opportunities in different sectors with varying prospects for sustained increases in
income.

Subsidized employment programs involve direct job creation through the construction of
public infrastructure (e.g., rural roads and bridges) or other activities that produce goods and
services. These programs can mitigate impacts of financial crises or alleviate unemployment or
short-term poverty by creating temporary jobs, building productive assets, providing effective
social safety nets, and contributing to social cohesion and inclusion in fragile environments.
They are usually targeted—geographically and by offering below-market wages—to poorer and
less educated youth with limited prospects. Another form of subsidized employment through
the public sector provides an opportunity for youth (typically the more educated) to further

 Box 3.3. Combining Education, Employment, and Civic Engagement in Yemen

 To help meet its twin goals of improving access to basic services and enhancing economic opportunities, the Yemen Social Fund for
 Development project has recently introduced a new subcomponent to provide cash-for-work opportunities for youth to increase poor
 communities’ access to education services. Young men and women who have completed at least secondary education will be trained,
 supervised, and paid to deliver community-based nonformal educational services, drawing on the project’s integrated approach at the
 local level to identify and address the most pressing constraints to school enrollment and literacy. Activities to be implemented in com-
 munities with weak education indicators include filling teacher gaps in formal schools, nonformal accelerated programs for out-of-school
 children and youth, adult literacy and life skills classes, and community awareness campaigns.

 The program intends to create 750,000 person-days of employment for a total of 3,000 young people benefiting 26,000 children and
 9,000 adults in targeted communities. By targeting unemployed youth, the project seeks to provide young people with income, work
 experience, and the opportunity to contribute to the development of their communities, thus supporting social stability as well as the
 welfare of beneficiaries.

                                      al. 2013). The CDD youth portfolio includes examples of both of these types of cash-for-work/
                                      public employment programs.

                                      In Sierra Leone, the project introduced a labor-intensive public works component targeted to
                                      low-skilled youth. The design is being refined based on the experience and findings of a rigorous
                                      impact evaluation (see box 3.2).

                                      In Yemen, for example, an employment support subcomponent was introduced under the Social
                                      Fund project for young men and women to address both weak education indicators and youth
                                      unemployment (see box 3.3).

                                      Entrepreneurship programs often combine several types of interventions to support suc-
                                      cessful self-employment in farm and non-farm sectors, including training, providing access
                                      to finance, advisory services, and mentoring. Evidence suggests that comprehensive programs
                                      that bundle activities that address different constraints improve labor market outcomes more
                                      than separate initiatives (World Bank 2013e). Demand-driven entrepreneurship and livelihoods
                                      interventions reach different categories of youth, including young men and women, through
                                      support for different occupations or links in a given value chain.

                                      The Youth Opportunities Program component of the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund pro-
                                      motes entrepreneurship through an innovative approach that is yielding impressive results (see
                                      box 3.4).

                                      CDD projects also have promoted self-employment by investing in livelihood or income-
                                      generating activities. Livelihoods programs typically provide communities, including youth
                                      groups, with block grants to start their own micro/small businesses, sometimes coupled with

  Box 3.4. Promoting Entrepreneurship in Northern Uganda

  Context. In Northern Uganda, two decades of insurgency, instability, and conflict led to economic stagnation, high rates of poverty,
  and rising unemployment. The profound effects of the conflict on social and human capital as well as on traditional social structures and
  norms were disproportionately borne by young people who were not only physically displaced, but had also lost their roles in society.
  The Northern Uganda Social Action Fund was launched in 2003 to empower communities to identify their needs and improve access to
  income-earning opportunities and better social services. Three years later, in the face of a growing labor force exceeding the capacity of
  the formal sector (mostly farming), the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund launched the Youth Opportunities Program to improve the
  livelihoods of youth and to promote social cohesion by increasing and strengthening informal enterprises and addressing constraints on
  access to credit.

  Approach. In order to boost youth development in a cost-effective manner, the Youth Opportunities Program introduced a highly de-
  centralized, locally driven system of youth vocational training designed to enrich and empower young adults. To participate, self-selected
  applicants form groups of 15 to 30 members interested in a common vocation and submit proposals to purchase skills training from speci-
  fied institutes as well as tools and other materials to start or expand businesses. If approved, the group receives a single-tranche, largely
  unsupervised cash grant, which they are responsible for managing and disbursing.

  Results. Hundreds of groups applied for funding. Although the self-selection process resulted in a pool of motivated candidates, the
  program reached a large number of youth with a range of skills, means, and war experiences, many of whom were poor and/or unedu-
  cated. Grants averaged about US$382 per member, roughly equivalent to one year’s income for a young adult. Four years after the cash
  grants were disbursed, a robust evaluation revealed significant impacts. Participants enrolled in training for occupations such as tailoring,
  carpentry, metal working, and hairdressing. Compared to the control group, participants invested more in business assets (tools, machines,
  and raw materials), and received higher returns from increased access to credit and capital. Incomes increased an average of 41 percent,
  and young women participants earned 84 percent more than their peers.

  Key features. Although not isolated during the evaluation, several important CDD elements likely contributed in important ways to the
  program’s impressive achievements:

  •	 The transfer of funds to groups rather than individuals mitigated risks associated with cash transfers. Joint liability of group members helps
     minimize the risk of loss of funds and thus plausibly accounts for reports that funds were equally shared, with scant evidence of elite
     capture by group leaders. The group transfer of funds and attendant social pressure to use the funds for intended purposes contributed
     significantly to the program’s cost-effectiveness, given the minimal supervision evidently required after the disbursement of funds.
  •	 The “demand-side” latitude that was granted young people, to identify their desired training and business opportunities, manage pro-
     curement, and assume direct control of resources disbursed as a single-tranche lump sum, likely enhanced voice, leadership capabilities,
     and other factors of empowerment.

training and access to finance and other support networks. In doing so, task teams note that
value chain analysis is important in order to increase awareness by young people of a wider
range of more competitive and profitable activities and ensure that their investments are well-
integrated into ongoing economic activities.

The Western Kenya Community Driven Development and Flood Mitigation Project has intro-
duced and adapted several specific processes to help improve the livelihoods of young people
within participating communities (see box 3.5).
20 • Engaging Youth through Community-Driven Development Operations




 Box 3.5 Improving Livelihoods through Microinvestments in Western Kenya

 Context. The Western Kenya Community Driven Development and Flood Mitigation Project was launched in 2007 to empower local
 communities to engage in wealth-creating activities, lower the incidence of poverty, and reduce the vulnerability of the poor to adverse
 outcomes associated with recurrent flooding. During preparation, stakeholders identified the lack of economic opportunities for youth
 as one of the contributors to high rates of poverty. It was also noted that with primary-school completion rates exceeding 90 percent,
 youth are well equipped with basic literacy and numeracy skills to help create the foundation for young people to plan, implement, and
 manage their own income-generating projects.

 Approach. The project earmarked US$1 million (under the CDD component) to finance investments of up to US$5,000, proposed by
 youth-only groups in select communities aimed at improving their livelihoods and well being through income generation, employment
 creation, and social initiatives. Following processes similar to those of the main CDD project, young people identify and prepare proposals
 for small enterprises. Parents and other adults in the community, who are ineligible to serve on youth executive committees, typically play
 active but supporting roles in guiding youth. The project engages local line ministries, (e.g., agricultural extension departments) to support
 technical aspects of the microproject design and implementation. These linkages are essential for the sustainability of these investments
 as well as for encouraging the extension of youth groups into new activities.

 Results. The project is financing youth-proposed investments in over 50 communities. Activities include the creation or expansion of tree
 nurseries, fish farms, block-making enterprises, battery charging kiosks, and barber shops with young people typically preferring invest-
 ments with quicker returns over longer-term investments.

 Key Features. Several factors contribute to the substantial engagement of youth in the project.

 •	 First, earmarking ensures the availability of funds and incentivizes the formation and participation of youth groups.
 •	 Second, youth groups are identified through the Participatory Integrated Community Development Process. In those communities with
    dedicated funds for youth, Youth Action Plans are prepared by youth groups in parallel with the development of Community Action
    Plans by other groups within the same community. No additional efforts to facilitate the formation and involvement in youth groups
    are undertaken.
 •	 Third, the community platform allows the constructive participation of adults who provide financial support, technical advice, and
    play a role in resolving conflicts, thus contributing to the sustained involvement of youth. Project staff observe that youth groups that
    include adults are more successful in implementing, sustaining, and extending microproject activities, providing a potentially valuable
    insight for a comparison between development projects that target and include youth exclusively and those that cover entire com-
    munities to address challenges that young members face.
 •	 Fourth, all microprojects require a community contribution of 30 percent of total project costs. In some cases, this requirement has
    been used to leverage access to land by youth groups, relieving a significant constraint to the implementation of a range of activities
    since land is traditionally one of most difficult assets for the youth to obtain. As a result, some youth groups have revitalized “waste
    land” of their parents’ generation by introducing new and more productive activities on it.
 •	 Finally, differently skilled youth assume various positions and responsibilities matched with their interests and abilities. Gender differ-
    ences are also accommodated (e.g., young women’s preferences for involvement in marketing agricultural products). Together, it is likely
    that these factors increase the number and diversity of young people who participate.

          urning Young People into Wage Earners through Comprehensive
Box 3.6. T
         Employment Services in Tamil Nadu

Context. Although Tamil Nadu has developed into one of India’s most industrialized states over the past 15 years, with comparatively
strong growth rates and impressive social indicators, almost 20 percent (12 million people) of the state’s total population still lives in
poverty. Economically underprivileged rural youth face limited opportunities in the rural, non-farm sector due to a lack of appropriate
skills for high-demand factory jobs. Launched in 2006, the Empowerment and Poverty Reduction (Pudhu Vaazhvu) Project sought to
empower the rural poor and improve their livelihoods. In response to youth emerging as an important interest group in village develop-
ment, the project introduced the Employment Generation for Rural Youth Program to provide young people with job-oriented skills
training that would lead to empowerment in either high-growth sectors or in self-employment.

Approach. The program implements a range of intermediation-related activities designed to address market-level employment con-
straints. Working through the project’s institutional platform, the Village Poverty Reduction Committee (VPRC), which includes two youth
members, manages the youth employment program to which it allocates 20 percent of its budget. Assisted by project staff, the VPRCs
identify youth needs and priorities and design, implement, and monitor skill-training activities in each project district. To mobilize in-
terested youth, community professionals help the VPRC organize outreach activities aimed at youth and their parents. The VPRC then
creates a database of interested candidates with their qualifications, skills, and training preferences. Based on youth requirements, a team
of specialists, local managers, and VPRC representatives select eligible training institutes and companies based on their reputations and
track records, inclusion of soft skills training, qualifications of instructors, adequacy of their infrastructure, and commitment to place
youth after they complete their training. Based on their qualifications and skills demanded by available jobs, registered youth are screened
and enrolled in training centers. Training costs are financed by the VPRC’s Youth Development Fund, and loans are available for related
expenses (e.g., food, transport, and accommodations).

Project officials provide a bridge between the youth and training institutions or potential employers. Project staff canvas companies to assess
entry-level employment opportunities and required skills and regularly organize job fairs. Companies attending job fairs convey to youth
employment terms and conditions, and selected youth are recruited. Support mechanisms for participants are extensive, including outreach
to and education of parents (e.g., through exposure visits to training institutes and companies), career guidance cells (composed of retired
educators) in every district, and employment and counseling teams that are based in the companies that employ project-trained youth.

Results. As of December 2012, the project had trained almost 191,000 unskilled or semi-skilled youth in trades including automotive repair
and operation, garment making, construction, computer skills, industrial mechanics, medical applications, and cell phone production.
Almost 85 percent of graduates—160,000 young people—are now gainfully employed at reputable companies and viable businesses. A
mid-term assessment of the program reported an annual growth rate in youth employment (and corresponding decrease in unemploy-
ment) in participating villages of more than 10 percent. Over 85 percent of households reported improvements in economic status, with
mean incomes increasing an average of 40 percent. Participants also reported enhanced self-confidence and independence, improved
social status, and protection from antisocial activities.

Key features. Central to the program’s success are two factors: (i) representative community structures (VPRC) that identify and support
beneficiaries, monitor activities and progress, and help ensure family and community commitment to the program; and (ii) the private sector
skills and contacts of the project’s implementing agency that ensure market orientation and effective linkages between beneficiaries’ skills
and job opportunities.

22 • Engaging Youth through Community-Driven Development Operations




                      Within the CDD youth portfolio, projects in several parts of South Asia are known for
                      implementing innovative and largely successful employment service programs. The term
                      “employment services” covers a range of intermediation-related activities designed to address
                      market-level employment constraints (Robalino et al. 2013). The local institutional platforms built
                      by CDD programs at the community level are effective in ensuring that young people are given
                      the opportunity to obtain and keep wage-earning jobs. A story from Tamil Nadu in India pro-
                      vides insights for other countries and programs regarding success factors and opportunities for
                      improvement (see box 3.6.).


                      Reflections and Opportunities on Employment and Economic Opportunities
                      •	   CDD projects that are seeking to increase the employability, employment, and/or earnings
                           of youth support four of the five key initiative categories: skills training, entrepreneurship
                           promotion, subsidized employment, and employment services. In almost every case, these
                           interventions are combining elements of two or more types of activities to improve results.

                      •	   These initiatives, although not unique to CDD projects, are effectively using elements of the
                           CDD approach to improve youth outcomes. These include the delivery of private benefits
                           through a participatory communal mechanism, community and self-targeting, mobilization
                           of broad community support and complementary inputs, and direct control of resources by
                           project beneficiaries. Although evidence of the impact of these features on program results
                           is mostly limited to qualitative assessments, there is considerable agreement by project
                           teams that they add significant value by minimizing risk, contributing to cost-effectiveness,
                           and ensuring buy-in, thereby enhancing sustainability.

                      •	   CDD employment-related investments are reaching a wide cross-section of youth with dif-
                           ferent education endowments, experiences, interests, and aspirations. Understanding these
                           differences and consciously tailoring programs to distinct categories of youth, including by
                           gender, could increase effectiveness.

                      •	   Livelihoods programs are very successful in South Asia, but project teams in other regions
                           have identified challenges, mostly due to required technical and private sector expertise not
                           commonly found in CDD project implementing units. Experience in areas such as Tamil Nadu
                           or Andhra Pradesh demonstrate the importance of assessing markets and using value-chain
                           analysis to identify types of viable investments. While respecting the demand-driven prin-
                           ciple, CDD project and related technical teams must guide youth if funds are to be applied
                           to economically sustainable activities. Oftentimes, when youth are given an opportunity to
                           start their own initiatives for the first time, they opt for conventional business ideas com-
                           monly seen in their localities, whether or not further demand exists in the market. Technical
                           advice helps expand youth vision beyond typical activities to those that are potentially
                           more economically viable.

•	   Task teams also emphasize the need for continued and evolving capacity-building pro-
     grams for young people. In particular, programs that involve private goods should start with
     essential life skills, basic financial management, and related business skills, adding savings
     and investment skills as the program develops. Experience suggests that livelihood initia-
     tives need dedicated support teams in the field to continue to provide capacity-building
     training and guidance. These requirements make project operations complicated and labor
     intensive, and therefore more costly to manage, but they offer enormous potential when
     implemented well.

•	   In the face of significant concern about and attention to youth employment, evidence
     about the effectiveness of youth employment-related initiatives is emerging. The rigor-
     ous impact evaluation of the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund’s Youth Opportunities
     Program offers valuable lessons about key success factors. The South Asian employment
     services “model” has been adapted and adopted by many countries in the region, providing
     a rich set of experiences from which to extract lessons, including isolating features adapted
     to each context. A comparative assessment of the South Asia CDD job placement portfolio
     would enhance learning and advance replication outside the region.


Empowerment
Perhaps the most significant benefit of CDD for engaging youth is in the third dimension
of empowerment, encompassing participation, agency, and voice. Empowerment is defined
as the expansion of assets and capabilities of young people to participate in, negotiate with,
influence, control, and hold accountable the institutions that affect their lives. All projects in the
CDD youth portfolio aim, explicitly or implicitly, to empower youth—as an outcome in itself,
and/or as a means or process to enhance access to social assets, and/or economic opportunities.

In CDD youth projects, empowerment is sought through two primary channels: (1) the financ-
ing of investments to foster interaction, cohesion, and social capital through enhanced access to
physical, social, and cultural spaces or places; and (2) the creation of and access to local political
“space” that grants opportunities for increased participation and influence in decision-making
and other processes.


Physical Spaces and Social Interactions
CDD project documents cite a dearth of physical places and social activities in which young
people can actively interact. This lack is particularly acute in transition economies with little
precedent for such spaces as well as in conflict and post-conflict contexts, where such interac-
tions are restricted by violence and dislocation. In response to youth demands, CDD projects
are making significant social investments in places and activities with the purpose of fostering
interaction among young people, between young people and members of the broader com-
munity, and among communities—to increase social capital and cohesion.

                                         Often based on priorities identified by youth during project preparation, CDD projects invest
                                         in a range of spaces and activities that seek to enhance the amount of social interaction.
                                         Types of investments and the projects in which these are financed include:

                                         There is a lack of quantitative evidence in the CDD and youth literature on the benefits and
                                         results of these investments. CDD youth projects typically measure outputs (e.g., the number—
                                         and, in some cases, the amounts—of subprojects financed and the number of youth participat-
                                         ing). Emphasizing responsiveness over concrete outcomes, projects also measure alignment with
                                         priorities and beneficiary satisfaction with goods and services delivered.

                                         The Poland Post-Accession Rural Support Project introduced effective mechanisms to system-
                                         atically include marginalized groups such as youth, and demonstrates the perceived value of
                                         such investments (see box 3.7).


 Box 3.7. Institutionalizing Inclusion in Poland

 In Poland, the economic liberalization pursued over the past two decades that resulted in relatively high growth rates also brought sig-
 nificant structural poverty and unemployment, resulting in pervasive social exclusion, including of rural youth. The Poland Post-Accession
 Rural Support Project sought to increase social inclusion in rural, underdeveloped districts by enhancing the capacity of local govern-
 ments to identify, plan, and execute social inclusion strategies. Unique to the project was the participation of local communities in the
 identification of their own social inclusion strategies; this was in sharp contrast with the traditional top-down approach.

 As a result of the project, rural districts purchased high-priority social services for vulnerable groups (e.g., youth, the elderly, and the
 disabled) delivered by civil society organizations. Eligible youth services included youth centers to stimulate personal development, sup-
 portive educational services outside the formal education system, involvement in cultural and sporting events, elective and after-school
 programs (e.g., foreign languages and youth clubs to promote self-governance and organization), Internet cafes, counseling and crisis
 support networks, and volunteer youth programs.

 At the start of the project, the value of some of the social inclusion activities financed—picnics, fairs, and celebrations—raised concerns.
 However, the project’s open menu of eligible subprojects that allowed youth (and other participants) to decide what activities to engage
 in and how those services were to be delivered proved effective in inspiring social activity and activism. It also demonstrated the power
 of demand-driven local development initiatives in breaking down isolation and invisible boundaries young people face in the society.

                   III. How Community-Driven Development Seeks to Enhance Youth Development Outcomes • 25




Access to Local Political “Space”
In addition to physical, cultural, and social spaces, CDD invests in expanding opportunities for
young people to express their voices—an essential element to their development.

The literature on youth development notes that the skills and desire to participate in the life
of a community are formed early and that as a person matures, early involvement predicts
the ability and willingness to engage in civic life (World Bank 2006). Civic engagement provides
the opportunity to contribute to society and to be recognized. Voice, agency, and collective
action, fostered through involvement in social organizations, enhances human and social capital,
betters service delivery, and broadens access to economic opportunities. Local settings, in the
context of CDD, provide space for young people to be heard and have an impact on issues that
directly affect them.

A lack of voice in their communities and influence over decisions affecting their lives has
left young people feeling alienated, ignored, and frustrated. They are not only demanding an
equitable share in services, markets, and cultural spaces, but also greater political space—“an
idea that simultaneously subsumes notions of voice, agency, and participation” (World Bank
2013d ). Thus, the inclusion of youth must extend beyond social and economic welfare to youth
empowerment and voice as well as in their participation in decision-making processes.

CDD youth projects use a number of strategies to help create space for youth to articulate
the challenges and risks they face and to participate in decisions regarding ways to address
them. They also invest in approaches and activities to develop such capabilities. These opportu-
nities and capacities combine to impart experience, confidence, leadership, and other life skills
that increase the standing of young people in their communities and beyond.

As illustrated in figure 3.1, the stages of the typical CDD subproject cycle provide entry points
for enhancing the opportunities and capabilities of young people in decision making and
management of community investments. Identifying and designing these entry points is impor-
tant in general, but even more so in post-conflict or violent contexts. Task teams need to pay
enough attention to potential consequences “youth empowerment” would have on local formal
and informal authorities and power dynamics where youth have been historically deprived of
access to political space.

Community outreach and facilitation strategies dedicated to youth, and sometimes per-
formed by youth, are commonly cited as a critical determinant of reaching youth. CDD
projects are introducing innovative approaches and media to ensure that community decision-
making processes better reflect the voice of marginalized groups, including youth. The Govern-
ment of Indonesia, recognizing that marginalized communities often benefit comparatively less
from poverty reduction efforts and public services (under the national CDD program known as
PNPM Rural) introduced a pilot program—PNPM Peduli—to “unlock” the potential of marginal-
ized groups and individuals, including at-risk and vulnerable youth. PNPM Peduli aims at empow-
ering the marginalized to become more self-reliant and creating opportunities to improve their
basic conditions. To reach these people, the pilot program makes grants to national and local

                           selected by the community. In Rwanda, community development committees require a young
                           person to be elected by secret ballot. In Tamil Nadu, the VPRCs include two youth members.

  Box 3.8. Using Cultural and Educational Activities to Attract Young Members in
  Indonesia

  Indonesia’s PNPM includes the Creative Communities initiative, which gives a stronger voice to poor and marginalized groups, including
  youth, by using community-based cultural and educational activities such as community video, theater, music, and painting.

  For example, some participants under the Creative Communities initiative formed a study group primarily consisting of young village
  women that visits homes to interview people on issues affecting the community, such as waste management and the quality of the local
  health-care service. The group records these interviews on a “handy-cam,” and then plays them back to other members of the community,
  in public spaces but also in their own homes. Following the presentation, members of the group record the responses of the audience.
  This interactive process allows people who do not often take part in village meetings, especially young people, to play important roles in
  village planning forums and decision-making processes that are otherwise dominated by older male members.

As quantitative targets for youth representation on decision-making committees have been
widely adopted and met, focus is shifting to the quality or meaningfulness of the participa-
tion of young people. In Morocco, the initial phase of the National Initiative for Human Devel-
opment program brought young people (as well as women and civil society) “to the table,” but
“their effective voice and participation in the design and implementation of projects has yet to
emerge.”10

Opportunities for participation must be paired with the capability to access such openings.
While capacity is built through participation in project processes, CDD youth projects also invest
directly in developing the capabilities of youth. This is done through ongoing facilitation and
support provided by project staff or civil society organizations contracted by the project in
addition to training in a range of areas from life skills to procurement and financial management.

Some projects are reserving roles for or targeting youth to perform specific functions, often
well matched with the interests, energy, time, skills, and other assets of young people. As
mentioned above, several projects rely on youth to mobilize and oversee youth participation
and to facilitate processes benefiting the broader community. The Timor-Leste Youth Devel-
opment Project trained and staffed a corps of youth facilitators. Although not intentionally
included at the start of the project, the West Bank and Gaza team recognized the invaluable role
youth were playing in facilitation, and at mid-term, offered them training and stipends. In Benin,
many young people who benefited from the grassroots management training program, which
was designed to build the community’s capacity to organize itself and prioritize its needs, went
on to become qualified to deliver these training workshops. In the province of Papua, Indonesia,
where many villages are isolated, recent high school graduates were selected and trained as
“barefoot engineers” to provide needed technical facilitation. From the third phase of the train-
ing program, 290 trainees had graduated and were subsequently hired by the PNPM provincial

                                     training programs, particularly in Papua.11

                                     The increasing prevalence of new technologies, combined with their appeal to young people,
                                     presents valuable opportunities to engage youth in project processes and local development.
                                     Although many CDD youth projects operate in remote rural areas, information and communica-
                                     tion technology (ICT) is widely available due to expanding telecommunication network cover-
                                     age. Projects are increasingly using ICT, often employed by young people, to strengthen project
                                     management and outcomes (see box 3.9).

                                     In general, despite these indicators of success, measuring the results of empowerment efforts
                                     is difficult, and therefore, concrete evidence is scant. Only in some projects is empowerment
                                     and the path to realizing it explicitly articulated and associated outcome indicators defined.
                                     Proxy measures include:

                                     •	   alignment of investments with youth priorities;

 Box 3.9. Using ICT to Enhance Transparency and Accountability in Sierra Leone

 In Sierra Leone, the “Cash for Work” component of the Youth Employment Support Project has introduced a mobile “e-payment” and
 data collection system using smartphones in order to strengthen the accountability, transparency, and efficiency of the program.

 With the newly introduced mobile “e-payment” system, each beneficiary gets an activated account that is linked to his or her personal
 SIM card. Once money is transferred into the account, beneficiaries are able make withdrawls at any cash dispensary. Rigorous verification
 steps allow the beneficiaries to solely own and manage his or her independent account (for some, probably for the first time in their lives).
 After five months of operating, the new system successfully transferred more than US$450,000 to over 6,000 beneficiaries across the 14
 districts at half the time previously required (from more than one month to about two weeks).

 Given the cash-for-work program’s national coverage and the country’s large rural population, many of the public works project sites are
 in fairly remote areas, making monitoring difficult. Therefore, the project team also developed a data collection instrument using free
 open-source software available on smartphones for registration and project monitoring purposes. The project trained the district youth
 council (DYC) members to use GPS-enabled smartphones for monitoring subproject sites. As part of the monitoring initiative, the DYCs
 also collect suggestions and complaints from participants regarding the program. The pilot exercise showed that this channel was both
 practical and useful to youth beneficiaries, leading to an expansion of the initiative to other project components. Furthermore, the control
 that project participants and DYC members had over key project management issues is considered extremely empowering.

•	   knowledge of local development agendas and practices; and
•	   spillover effects from involvement in youth activities to continued engagement in broader
     local development activities.

Although not systematically evaluated, project experiences provide insights into the value
placed by young people on the processes and investments in empowerment. The objective
of Timor-Leste’s Youth Development Project was to expand capacity and opportunities to initi-
ate and execute community projects. A beneficiary survey conducted as part of the Imple-
mentation Completion and Results Report process of the World Bank highlighted the following
positive results from civic engagement: establishment of productive dialogue between young
people and traditional authorities, increased willingness of young people to participate if asked
by village leadership, enhanced awareness of the national development agenda and local devel-
opment initiatives, and great potential for applying skills gained to future local development
projects. Echoing the recognition of the importance of voice and dignity, participants valued
their role in decision making granted by the project above more tangible economic benefits
resulting from the workfare program implemented in the same areas.12


Reflections and Opportunities on Empowerment
•	   CDD provides valuable—and valued—opportunities for young people to participate more
     fully in local development. The youth development literature is uniform about the benefits
     from such involvement to youth and to society, in both the near- and long-term (World
     Bank 2005; 2007). Gains to empowerment from the implementation of CDD processes
     alone, however, cannot be assumed or expected. As with more tangible objectives, in most
     cases, project design would be improved by an explicit tracing of the path to empowerment
     and projected gains—for example how increased involvement in decision making affects
     benefits accruing to youth. Clearly articulating the causal chain would greatly enhance moni-
     toring and evaluation by unpacking the participatory theory of CDD.

•	   Quantitative targets alone are insufficient to ensure effective youth participation. Addi-
     tional effort should be spent on measuring the quality of participation and its outcomes. As
     the literature cautions about the costs of “token” involvement and unmet expectations, this
     potential should be recognized and steps taken to avoid or mitigate them.

•	   It is important to understand the ongoing impacts or spillover effects of youth involvement
     in local decision-making processes and initiatives. As recommended in the recent review of
     CDD impact evaluations, tracing CDD project participants over time to determine whether
     or not they are becoming a new generation of national development leaders would be
     valuable. Documenting unintended negative consequences or unmet expectations of early
     engagement by young people would also be likely to generate constructive lessons.

                      •	   While most CDD projects address multiple objectives, design documents do not consistently
                           or explicitly address the hierarchy or potential tradeoffs among service delivery, economic
                           enhancement, and empowerment objectives. Practitioners should explore these potential
                           tradeoffs. For example, does a primary focus on youth empowerment objectives make less
                           important the outcomes from social investments (and thus justify their lack of measure-
                           ment)? Do positive employment outcomes outweigh expected impacts on social cohesion?

                      •	   To strengthen accountability and make the most of the comparative ease with which young
                           people handle new technologies, more and more CDD youth projects are piloting informa-
                           tion and communication technology (ICT)-enabled approaches to improve project manage-
                           ment. New technologies have the potential to enhance youth participation. Access to and
                           command of new technologies can be a strong source of empowerment in and of itself.
IV. Conclusions,
    Emerging Guidance,
    and Future Work

As the numbers of young people and the challenges they confront continue to grow, clients and
task teams are increasingly demanding approaches that effectively engage youth in develop-
ment efforts. Community-driven development (CDD) is widely recognized as one approach for
enhancing youth opportunities and capabilities, and thus their inclusion in various dimensions
of development.

This study explored a universe of CDD youth projects spanning all regions in which the World
Bank operates, providing a rich repository of learning. Significant diversity was found among
these projects in terms of the extent of youth focus; their size, scale, and scope; the context and
conditions to which they respond; and their objectives and desired outcomes. Mapping these
interventions to a framework that links dimensions of youth development to related domains
of inclusion reveals that CDD projects are contributing in significant and innovative ways to the
youth development agenda in three spheres:

Improving endowments. Where public goods that specifically target youth are financed (e.g.,
school dormitories, scholarships to secondary schools, and reproductive health services), CDD
operations are improving the human capital endowments of young people by tailoring interven-
tions responsive to the priorities of youth.

Increasing economic opportunities. By addressing individual, labor market and financial con-
straints, CDD projects are increasing the employability and employment opportunities available
to young people. In contexts with strong private sectors, comprehensive employment services
programs are training and placing significant numbers of youth in salaried jobs. Demand-driven
entrepreneurship promotion programs are yielding promising economic results. However, liveli-
hood investments delivering private benefits require specific linkages and skills that differ from
those needed to deliver public sector investments.

Enhancing empowerment. CDD operations are providing structured involvement of young
people at the local level by creating spaces for increased civic engagement and by institutional-
izing the inclusion of youth in aspects of decision making, design, and implementation directly
affecting them. In addition to quantity, attention must be paid to the quality of youth partici-
pation, and investments in capacity are needed to help ensure their meaningful and sustained
participation.

                      Emerging Guidance
                      The review of the CDD youth portfolio reveals different design features employed by projects
                      to help ensure that resources are effectively reaching young people. While a complete analysis
                      of these elements and choices is beyond the scope of this stocktake, the study does suggest
                      insights and preliminary guidance around select features, namely the extent of youth focus,
                      preparatory analysis, youth mobilization and facilitation, social accountability and governance
                      measures, and monitoring and evaluation.

                      Extent of youth focus. The study identifies four broad categories of CDD projects that focus
                      on youth to varying degrees, ranging from projects where youth are one among several target
                      groups to projects dedicated exclusively to youth. Decisions regarding how much focus should
                      be placed on youth have implications for the complexity, sustainability, and effectiveness of
                      projects.

                      The portfolio review and task team consultations suggest that the CDD projects that integrate
                      young people most successfully and sustainably are those that employ considered adjustments
                      to standard CDD procedures, either by introducing a youth “window” with earmarked funds or
                      a separate component, to increase and sustain the focus on and benefits to youth within the
                      context of the wider community. The experiences of youth-targeted employment and income-
                      generating programs in Tamil Nadu, Northern Uganda, and Kenya, which all have dedicated
                      funding streams, suggest that the additional complexity imposed by specific implementation
                      arrangements to identify and implement youth-focused activities is justified by strong positive
                      results.

                      Preparatory analysis. Many, if not most, of the CDD youth projects reviewed invested in some
                      analysis of the state of young people in their areas and in institutional responses for addressing
                      youth development. Task team observations in project documents reiterate that understand-
                      ing the constraints, priorities, and needs of young people is crucial in effectively reaching and
                      engaging them.

                      Three main types of analysis proved particularly valuable, offering different advantages in the
                      identification and/or preparation of projects or the introduction of a dedicated youth com-
                      ponent or program. First, youth situational analyses or social assessments incorporating youth
                      were used to map constraints, aspirations, and qualifications of young people and to identify
                      responsive project activities, allowing broad consultations with a range of stakeholders, includ-
                      ing youth. Second, piloting activities, as a stand-alone project, during preparation or during
                      implementation, provided valuable opportunities to introduce and test new procedures and
                      approaches and helped build the capacity of implementation teams and community groups.
                      Third, knowledge exchanges, involving different participants, were useful for building political
                      support behind new operations, offering valuable peer-learning opportunities.

                      Currently, preparatory analysis contributes to the quality of the design of CDD youth initiatives,
                      but its value could be enhanced by:
                                                               IV. Conclusions, Emerging Guidance, and Future Work • 33




•	   engaging more with Bank youth development specialists to ensure the transfer and applica-
     tion of lessons from the Bank’s significant portfolio of youth investments;
•	   using information often gathered during a situational assessment that differentiates among
     categories of youth (e.g., young men and young women, skilled/educated and less skilled/
     less educated, and rural and urban) more systematically to design interventions tailored to
     specific groups of young people;
•	   paying more attention to useful information in order to gather baseline data that would
     advance evaluation; and
•	   exploring additional opportunities for study tours, South–South exchanges, and similar shar-
     ing events, including community-to-community and youth-to-youth exchanges, which are
     particularly cost-effective, and following up such visits/events with concrete action plans.

Youth mobilization and facilitation. The importance of the quality of community mobilization
and facilitation efforts to the effectiveness of CDD subproject implementation is widely cited.
These efforts are likely to be even more critical when seeking to engage youth, given the scarcity
of opportunities to participate and the related lack of prior experience combined with a general
suspicion by young people of institutional engagement.

CDD youth projects typically use one of three general facilitation models to help enhance youth
involvement: youth-only facilitation teams, youth participation on teams (sometimes ensured
through quotas), and partnering with youth-focused organizations. Regardless of whether CDD
youth projects are facilitated by youth, members of the broader community, or civil society
organizations, it is generally recognized that engaging youth requires additional and specific out-
reach strategies, tools and materials, longer timeframes, simplified procedures, and more capac-
ity building. Transparency of procedures, open channels of communication and information, and
the setting and management of realistic expectations help reduce young people’s lack of trust.

Social accountability and monitoring and evaluation. Although not inherently riskier than
other Bank operations, CDD projects carry a distinct “risk profile” because of the financing and
implementation of large numbers of highly dispersed activities and the susceptibility of pro-
cesses to various forms of elite capture. Most CDD youth project documents do not cite the
potential increased risks posed by working with youth. Nonetheless, many designs include mea-
sures to address implicit risks stemming from the relative inexperience, capacity constraints, and
unequal power relations facing young people.

Beyond the monitoring that is essential to addressing governance issues, CDD projects must
measure and evaluate the impacts of investments and processes on young people to ensure
interventions provide intended benefits to identified target groups. Understanding the factors
that can enhance or undermine the outcomes of youth development projects requires planning,
monitoring, measuring, and documenting achievements and shortcomings (World Bank 2011b).

Systems to effectively express the voice of beneficiaries are critical to fostering transparency,
accountability, and effective management in all CDD projects. Experiences with different tools
and strategies tried by CDD youth projects—and non-CDD youth projects—should be docu-
mented and shared so that projects can strategically select the ones most likely to increase results.
34 • Engaging Youth through Community-Driven Development Operations




                      The enhanced use of information and communication technology (ICT) for social accountability
                      and M&E purposes presents valuable opportunities for constructively engaging youth.

                      The study also highlighted the following elements of the CDD participatory approach that task
                      teams agree add particular value to youth outcomes.

                      Institutional platforms. The local-level institutions created and enhanced by CDD projects
                      provide a platform for entry into households, communities, and the local development space.
                      Key information is directly solicited from and imparted to project participants through these
                      platforms—removing a key constraint to youth involvement. Targeting outcomes are improved
                      through community identification of beneficiaries. Space can be opened for young people’s
                      voices to be heard; for youth to begin their civic engagement; and for their ideas, skills, and
                      enthusiasm to be channeled to productive purposes. In crisis and post-conflict contexts where
                      youth may have served in particularly negative roles such as combatants, or where distrust of
                      government may be high, interventions through community institutions can help rebuild rela-
                      tionships between young people and the broader community and between communities and
                      local authorities.

                      Group formation and joint liability. Through eligibility criteria, processes and investments,
                      CDD projects incentivize and strengthen group formation, which help realize gains from joint
                      liability. Collective action, including around transfers of private goods; shared responsibility; and
                      peer pressure reinforce a common sense of purpose that helps to minimize the loss of funds and
                      to achieve and sustain outcomes.

                      Direct control of resources. By transferring resources directly to young people, CDD projects
                      grant significant—and often unique—authority to youth to influence local development in
                      ways aligned with their interests. In building the capacities of youth to manage these funds and
                      giving them control over them—especially as most young people may not be able to afford to
                      invest in themselves—the projects convey the commitment, trust, and dignity that are crucial
                      for the development of young people.


                      Future Work
                      As a modest, initial attempt to illustrate the contributions of the CDD approach to youth devel-
                      opment, this study revealed several areas that would benefit from further attention and action.

                      Documenting and sharing lessons. This study was hindered by the lack of readily accessible
                      information about CDD engagement of youth. Additional learning about how and why CDD
                      approaches affect youth outcomes would be greatly enhanced by more documentation of
                      experiences and opportunities to share these lessons. Recent impact evaluations are significantly
                      contributing to operational learning. Capturing tacit knowledge held by practitioners is also
                      needed to improve the design and implementation of new and ongoing programs. Document-
                      ing and understanding failed efforts to produce desired outcomes would also be highly valuable.
                                                               IV. Conclusions, Emerging Guidance, and Future Work • 35




Expanding learning. Most, if not all, projects in the CDD youth portfolio drew on CDD experi-
ence in project design. However, they drew much less systematically—or explicitly—on the
experiences of the Bank’s youth projects. This review is similarly limited. As this study helps
identify CDD’s contributions to youth programming, learning from youth projects implemented
through a range of approaches should also inform CDD operations. The experiences of those
youth projects that already apply some elements of the CDD model, such as youth-targeted
mobilization activities and participatory targeting, would be particularly useful.

Evaluating. Like other CDD reviews, this one cites the dearth of and need for additional evidence
of how specific and isolated factors impact outcomes, the impact of investments in sports and
recreational facilities and activities, the cost effectiveness of delivering similar benefits through
different investments and approaches, the need for relevant supply-side investments, and
further understanding of why given programs are working. With regard to employment and
economic activities, a comparative assessment of the South Asia CDD job placement portfolio
would enhance learning and advance replication outside the region.

In conclusion, the literature recognizes that, throughout the developing world, young people
face a number of common challenges that must be addressed in a more comprehensive way at
both the policy and program levels. With its multisectoral and demand-driven approach, CDD
is well placed to holistically help meet youth-defined needs—increasing human capital endow-
ment, economic opportunities, and empowerment—that are best addressed through local-level
initiatives. Given these findings, it is reasonable to assume that a CDD operation is most effective
at meeting youth needs when it forms a critical piece of a government’s harmonized youth
development strategy, complemented by policy initiatives and other programmatic responses.

Community-Driven Development
and Youth Global Stock Take:
Universe of Projects
The following matrix is intended to assist project teams to easily identify experiences that are
relevant to their operations and to start their own search of project design and results in more
depth based on their needs The descriptions provided are based on the authors’ analysis. More
detailed information can be on the online project portal.


Methodology
In defining the universe of World Bank “CDD youth” projects, projects were identified that
explicitly seek to benefit youth using specific design elements. Projects that identify youth as
one target group but do not include any specific measures to reach them were not included
because since young people are members of every community, all CDD operations, by their
nature, include youth.

Projects included in the matrix met the following criteria:

•	   The financing is through the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development /
     International Development Association lending instruments or World Bank-managed trust
     funds—e.g, the Japan Social Development Fund, Policy, the Human Resources Development
     Fund, or the State and Peace-Building Fund.
•	   They are included in the database of Bank-wide CDD operations maintained by the Social
     Development Department (so as to ensure the application of a consistent definition of
     CDD).
•	   They are recently closed, active, or in the pipeline.

For the purposes of the global stocktake, youth “outcomes” are identified as endowments,
employment, or empowerment.
