Many policy makers across Sub-Saharan Africa, including in fragile and conflict-affected
situations (FCS), consider youth employment a central policy issue. As the recent World
Development Report (WDR) on jobs has highlighted, jobs are a key driver of development
(World Bank 2012). Jobs matter for living standards, productivity, as well as social cohesion.
Particularly in FCS, jobs mean more than earnings; feelings of exclusion stem from a lack of
reliable, quality employment, not simply income (Rebosio and Romanova 2013). Volume 1 of
this paper presents results from the application of a novel qualitative toolkit in Liberia, with
the objective to improve the knowledge of the constraints to entry and productivity among
nonagricultural household enterprises. It outlines lessons learned from the application of this
research and makes policy-relevant findings on how to improve productivity in the sector in
Liberia. In addition, the report contains methodological lessons that can inform the
application of the toolkit in other contexts. Volume 2 of this paper presents a global review
of the literature on household enterprises in FCS and the detailed methodology and tools for
the research.

Introduction

This toolkit provides all the relevant information that will enable a country team to conduct
a full qualitative assessment of household enterprises (HEs) in fragile and conflict-affected
situations (FCS). Table 1 provides a summary of activities that will need to be conducted to
complete this work within three months. Following the table, a brief literature review of what
we know about HEs in FCS is provided to give contextual background to the major themes
that are explored in this research. Following that is the research toolkit, which explains the
desk and field research, including data entry, analysis, and reporting followed by the
interview guides (focus group discussions [FGDs] and key informant interviews [KIIs])
themselves. It is expected that all the materials in this document and e-annexes will be
reviewed and understood in full before beginning any work. 1

  For the Liberia pilot, the lead researcher and field team leader were different people; for future work, the
field team leader will take on both roles in his/her respective county, where possible; in such a case, lead
researcher = field team leader days (not combined).

I.     Global Literature Review: Household Enterprises in Fragile and Conflict-Affected
       States

 1.1         Summary

 In FCS, conflict impedes economic recovery, and lack of economic recovery increases the
 chance of conflict. FCS have difficult business environments. Youth unemployment is a
 particular internal economic challenge in fragile countries. Employment is effective in
 providing incomes and increasing demand for goods and services. However, quality
 employment is essential for this to happen.

 HEs mitigate some of the risks in FCS. HEs are secondary operations that supplement other
 income, reducing poverty. Owners and other members of the household spread risk by
 engaging in a variety of activities. The market needs they meet are small, they are risk averse,



                                                        7
and their plurality is significant. In circumstances of informality, underemployment, few
ladders to formal employment, limited social safety nets, and a risky operating environment,
HEs are flourishing and benefit those operating them. However,

   •   national and local authorities are often biased against HEs. The day-to-day business
       environment for HEs is generally determined by local authorities, who are responsible
       for zoning and other regulations which determine access to workplaces,
       infrastructure, and support structures. These can compound the problems of weak,
       inaccessible institutions, and lack of legal enforcement by police who are at times also
       perpetrators of harassment and extortion.

   •   FCS generally have poorer access to credit, and HE’s largely rely on savings or loans
       from family or friends to initiate business. Accessing and managing capital to start and
       operate an HE is especially complicated. Innovative credit and savings mechanisms
       can be important and grants can facilitate entry.

   •   the informal sector disproportionately comprises individuals with a low level of
       education and skills. Relevant and responsive education and training is key to
       addressing this. Entrepreneurship is a means of bypassing failing institutions and state
       bureaucracy, although it is unclear what entrepreneurship is and whether it can be
       taught.

   •   HEs face mistrust from partners in business and customers themselves. Clustering
       can assist cooperation, which can contribute to or be enhanced by improved trust.
       Clusters offer shared fixed costs and proximity fosters mutual knowledge and trust.

   •   HEs must be seen as a valued option, otherwise interventions will not lead to take-
       up of opportunities. Expectations may appear out of step with reality though. HEs
       also need to be seen as viable and worthwhile in a cost-benefit analysis.

1.2     Introduction

This literature review provides a background to consultants and World Bank staff in FCS as a
starting point for thinking about research on HEs. It is intended as a broad overview and a
way to highlight key themes that should be considered in additional desk and field research.
Local work will provide a more complete picture for each context, depending on what
information is or is not available in a country. This review should also be used together with
a qualitative toolkit that is designed to elicit exactly this information: the current nature and
scale of HEs in a given FCS and the interventions which will be most effective in developing
the sector.

HEs respond to clear, small-scale market needs. They fit into markets that lack a modern
service sector. They offer services such as hairdressing and repairs and locally and
internationally produced goods (secondhand clothing, household supplies, groceries, and so
on). These activities take place in households in which members live and where reproductive
(non-income generating and consumption) activities take place.

HEs are particularly well suited to FCS. In circumstances of informality, underemployment,
few ladders to formal employment, limited social safety nets, and a risky operating
environment, HEs are flourishing and benefit those operating them. Forty percent of
households rely on HEs in Sub-Saharan-Africa and an eight-country analysis shows that HEs
are generating most new jobs outside agriculture.2

HEs bypass some of the problems that businesses face. The role of HEs was highlighted in
recent research on Youth Employment in Sub-Saharan Africa 3 in both urban and rural areas.
HEs are common in developing nations, even more so in FCS, due to the absence of industry
and the relative difficulty in establishing a legitimate business.4 The facilitation of transition

from farm to nonfarm HEs is more likely to result in higher earning and productivity gains, as
compared to a focus on increasing productivity within existing enterprises. As owners look to
mitigate risk, the ways in which they operate (unregistered, irregular, mobile) allows for
coping with the challenging environment.

However, HEs face particular challenges. Five broad constraints to HEs have been identified:

    (a) Urban policy - insecurity of space and harassment are often problematic

    (b) Lack of credit and financial services - prevent entry and limit growth

    (c) Skills deficits - particularly basic education and technical training

    (d) Business environment - especially issues of trust

    (e) Attitude - this refers to understanding of work and unemployment, and whether HEs
        are seen as desirable

Conflict and violence reduce gains made to development and restrict a return to positive
growth. Around 1.2 billion people live in countries affected by fragility and around 800 million
live in developing countries with very high rates of conflict and violence. In such societies, it
has become clear that peacekeeping alone is insufficient, although immensely important.5
The dominant paradigm has become that ‘post-conflict societies face two distinctive
challenges: economic recovery and reduction of the risk of a recurring conflict’. 6 In fact, a
country that has been through a war faces a 40 percent risk of a return to violence. 7
Furthermore, these two distinctive challenges are inextricably linked: conflict impedes
economic recovery, and lack of economic recovery increases the chance of conflict.

FCS have difficult business environments, unstable and corrupt political regimes, and rent-
seeking actors. 9 In FCS environments, regulatory systems (especially construction permits,
property registration, investors’ protection, and contracts enforcement) are extremely weak.
The trust required for commerce is reduced by rent-seeking, political instability, inefficient
courts, and lack of security. This worsens business environments that already suffered from
political instability and very poor access to formal finance (Africa, East Asia and Pacific, South
Asia), as well as burdensome tax rates (Europe and Central Asia). Formal financial services,
such as the provision of loans or lines of credit, are very limited for firms in FCS (Europe and
Central Asia and Africa). Basic infrastructure shortages (power, water, roads) elevate costs of
doing business in FCS. In addition, poor access to general-purpose technology (especially
high-speed Internet) makes business slower and even more costly.

Youth unemployment is a particular internal economic challenge in fragile countries that
can contribute to renewed or exacerbated conflict. 10 Where young people have already

  Rent-seeking actors are people who use power, including violence, to get a bigger share of sources of money,
without creating anything new. So they might extort money without providing a service or demand taxes for
services that should be provided anyway.

fought as armed combatants, for example, some from when they were children, they
sometimes reflect nostalgically on the opportunities provided by military action. Even the
young people who have never fought—male and female alike—may feel that peace has
offered limited distribution of benefits and opportunities, and look to other routes, including
membership of armed groups. We may consider three major explanatory frameworks that
look at youth as a threat to frame future research that can provide us better evidence about
this issue. First and most obviously, the sheer number of youth relative to the rest of the
population; second, availability of youth to be coerced into violent insurrection; 11 and third,
young people as holding grievances and seeking restitution for wrongs committed against
them. 12 Still, in looking at youth, it is essential that definitions in a particular context are
considered, because these are highly varied; simply counting those under 18 years is
insufficient.

Employment is effective in providing incomes and increasing demand for goods and
services. 13 However, good quality employment is essential for this to happen. There is good
evidence that creating employment increases incomes and reduces poverty in low-income
countries. 14 UNDESA (2010) also notes that ‘by helping restore legitimate market links and
relationships of trust among different social groups in fragile and post-conflict environments,
value chain development offers both economic and peace-building benefits’. 15 Employment
must be appropriate to the local situation, including whether the country is classified as FCS.16
For example, in Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, ill-suited
employment-generating interventions have been shown to exacerbate poverty and

instability. 17 Self-employment is vital if the formal sector has collapsed, but alternatives to
simple survival are essential.

The United Nations suggests that there should be three tracks of employment creation: (a)
emergency employment for high-risk and high-need groups; (b) income-generating activities,
private sector development, and microfinance for communities; and (c) creating an enabling
(national) environment. HEs may represent a valuable shift beyond microenterprise, if there
is an enabling environment. The particular circumstances of an FCS need careful assessment,
including which track a country may have reached.

1.3     The Role of HEs

HEs are secondary operations that supplement other income, reducing poverty. 18 HEs are
also often part of a “diversified livelihood strategy;” 19 owners and other members of the
household spread risk by engaging in a variety of activities.20 This partly explains why they
tend to remain small or disappear—as secondary activities, introduced to mitigate risk and
expand earnings, but with little time available for expansion and limited appetite for the risks
of employing regular waged labor. Data from West Africa suggests that even after a decade
of operation, capital stock remains unchanged.21 Rural households will often operate an HE
to supplement farming activities. 22 They tend to operate from homes, and at particular times
built in around farming and when foot traffic is passing—evenings and weekends, for
example, as other residents are returning from their fields. Urban owners are more likely to
see an HE as their primary activity, but will still attempt diversification where possible. If they
have a primary activity, it is likely to be waged employment, not farming.

There are perhaps as many types of HE as there are HEs. The market needs that HEs meet
are small, they are risk averse, and their plurality is significant. 23 Individuals look to establish
HEs as self-employment alongside other activities and then offer a wide variety of products,
or goods may be sold alongside services in the same location.24 Goods and services are also
of low quality, with little or no value added, and therefore tend to disappear as economies
grow and skills increase. It needs to be borne in mind, therefore, that the benefits to
individuals and a state may continue to be seen beyond or outside of an HE, once a different
stage of development is entered.

HEs are different to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The International Labour
Organization (ILO) considers everyone working in an unincorporated business with less than
five employees as having informal sector employment.25 Self-employed people may employ
family members without pay, or fewer than five non-family members on a continuous basis,
but most are pure self-employment (70 percent). 26 Establishment of an HE cannot really be
considered as a transition to SME status because SMEs start with more assets and employees.
In fact, operating an SME is predicated on the ability to hire and manage labor, which may be
an entrepreneurial skill HE owners do not demonstrate. 27

1.4     Priority Areas

Existing literature is used here to highlight areas where data is needed to better understand
the issues of HEs in a particular FCS. Filling these data gaps will ensure that sufficient
information is utilized in planning effective interventions.

ironwork, or processed grain (flour). Artisanal activities include carpentry, dressmaking and tailoring, and
construction.

1.4.1 Urban and rural policy

National and local authorities are often biased against HEs. HEs have been criticized at
national levels for not offering the income and benefits of wage and salary employment, but
they are extremely important for households to move out of poverty. 28 The day-to-day
business environment for HEs is generally determined by local authorities, who are
responsible for zoning and other regulations which determine access to workplaces,
infrastructure, and support structures. These can compound the problems of weak,
inaccessible institutions, and lack of legal enforcement by police who are at times also
perpetrators of harassment and extortion. 29 The provision of roads, water, electricity, and
markets is also vital. Informal businesses, including HEs, may be seen as reluctant to pay taxes
and fees or obey planning regulations. 30 Local authorities sometimes attempt to evict
informal enterprises from central business districts, especially hawkers and activities
considered noisy or polluting, such as vehicle repair, metalworking, and carpentry. 31

Evidence suggests that regulation and planning can help, instead of hinder, HEs. Without
planning, traders and vendors crowd sidewalks and roads. This is problematic in and of itself,
and is often responded to with evictions that are frequently violent, result in destruction of
capital and stock, and are usually only an element in cycles of exit and return.32 In a survey of
tailors and dressmakers in capital cities in West Africa, 43 percent of enterprises in operation
for less than one year reported the lack of an adequate locality for their business as a major
problem. 33 Vetting businesses can also protect consumers—ensuring taxi drivers are
qualified, kitchens are clean, and so on.

Clarifying land rights can also assist in ensuring supplies of security, sanitation, electricity,
transport, and water. Where these are available, HEs are generally willing to pay, even though

taxes are often higher than those for large businesses. 34 However, the weakened, and often
still fluctuating, infrastructures of FCS, often do not allow for approachable tax or regulatory
systems that would encourage the existence or growth of small businesses. 35

Clustering in appropriate, safe areas has been shown to assist industries such as
metalworking, while traders need access to foot traffic in central areas. The United Nations
Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) Development of Clusters and Networks of SMEs
2001 report shows evidence from developing and developed countries that cooperation and
joint action are more likely when enterprises share markets for products, infrastructure
needs, and other business interests.

1.4.2 Credit and finance

FCS generally have poorer access to credit, and accessing and managing capital to start and
operate a HE is especially complicated. Background to the 2011 World Development Report
describes credit in FCS as either coming at ‘usurious rates or confined to those best-
connected to officials controlling state-owned banks’. Once an HE is up and running, poor
skills in bookkeeping are compounded by the complications of linking business and household
finances. HEs usually combine household and business finances. The HE is part of the
household’s livelihood portfolio, in which funds move back and forth between the HE and
other activities (such as purchasing farm inputs). Expenditures (school fees, repairs, and so
on) and external shocks (family illness) often spill over to the business.

HEs largely rely on savings or loans from family or friends. Virtually all HEs in Africa today
report that their own funds or loans from friends and relatives enabled them to start their
businesses, and the overwhelming majority of existing businesses report that they did not

obtain any type of loan over the last 12 months. 36 Such mechanisms can allow the initiation
of an HE, but they are informal, uncertain, and open to abuse.

Young people have particular trouble getting a loan for start-up capital. Even microfinance
institutions prefer to lend to individuals with a salary so that they have a better chance of
repayment. Some will lend to households based on collateral or an agreement with a salaried
guarantor. An initial savings deposit is often required, which young people are unlikely to
have available. Ideally, young people should not be segregated as a group and offered
financial services designed specifically for them. The risks of working with this client base are
high, and separating young people from a larger pool for sharing risks would make them even
less attractive to financial institutions.

Saving is as important as credit. Using credit requires a borrower to put aside money
regularly to service the loan, so a savings mechanism is critical. However, where financial
inclusion remains poor, finding safe places to keep money is difficult.37 In FCS, just 15 percent
of adults have an account at a formal financial institution, while 26 percent report having
saved in the past year.38 This problem is especially acute for youth and women. Security of
savings is especially important for women, who tend to perform more reliably with regard to
repayments when they are able to find such security. 39 Those saving in FCS are less than half
as likely as those in the rest of the developing world to use a formal financial institution. They
are also 50 percent more likely to save using a community-based method. 40 Afghanaid's
Savings Groups, for example, give impoverished people in rural Afghan communities an
opportunity to accumulate group savings and build their confidence to start income-
generating enterprises. They assist members in developing the discipline, trust, and
experience of saving, borrowing, and repaying reliably.

Grants may be another means of facilitating entry to operate an HE. Such programs are
combined with business training, support services, vocational training, or financial capital.
Results seem to be positive although recipients tend to be relatively wealthy. 41 For example,
grants to existing businesses in Sri Lanka helped improve sustainability, providing evidence of
capital constraints both at start-up and during operation. 42 However, risk-free access to
capital may not be conducive to dedicated operation of business.

1.4.3 Skills deficits

The informal sector disproportionately comprises individuals with a low level of education
and skills, and many lack even basic literacy and numeracy. Functional literacy and numeracy
can add as much as 40 percent to the earnings of HE owners, compared to their illiterate
peers. 43

Relevant and responsive education and training is key. A disillusioned outlook of young
people toward education and its role in improving their livelihoods is a common phenomenon
in countries where access to education, along with the school-to-work transition, has not kept
up with the relevance of and quality improvements in curriculum, skills training, and
pedagogy. 44 The quality of education in developing and fragile conflict settings remains
extremely variable, and students in these settings can be disappointed that attaining a
diploma will not have the same meaning to employers that it does for them. 45 Lack of
employment opportunities and belief that personal connections are more important for
finding a job fosters apathy among youth and devalues education. Vocational training does
not necessarily lead to employment, for example, especially when they are not designed to
meet market demand.

Young people already often work in the HE sector. This, generally unwaged, experience can
be a pathway to sustainable employment in the sector. They can receive on-the-job training
without affecting other activities too much (including education and occasional waged
employment). Trust can also be earned, meaning that a family may provide start-up capital
later. Working in the informal sector means that individuals must have skills for many
different functions—within one or a variety of roles. However, it is difficult to take much time
away for training.

Entrepreneurship is often seen as a means of bypassing failing institutions and state
bureaucracy. Colleges and educational programs have been established in many countries
around the world, although it remains unclear what entrepreneurship is and whether it can
be taught. In Nigeria, for example, entrepreneurship programs greatly increased business
knowledge and practice, but there was no corresponding growth in business setup and
expansion or increased income. 46

1.4.4 Business environment

FCS are tense settings and HEs face mistrust, both from potential partners in business
(suppliers and so on) and customers themselves. The same problems that keep their trades
tucked away in their households also keep them from growing financially; which is to say,
these enterprises often remain somewhat marginal, in part because of an environment that
remains unhealthy both economically and culturally. 47

Clustering can assist cooperation, which can contribute to or be enhanced by improved
trust. Clusters offer shared fixed costs and proximity fosters mutual knowledge and trust.
Clustering can help small firms address problems as highlighted by the U.S. Agency for
International Development in the Building Markets 2013 Market Overview Report. These
issues include poor customer service that 38 percent of local businesses suffered from, poor

quality of goods and services (35 percent of businesses), general lack of capacity (16 percent),
and delayed delivery time (14 percent). 48 A UNIDO clustering case study of Nicaraguan
handicraft hammock producers is useful.49 At the beginning of the program, SMEs had little
cohesion and were not exporting. UNIDO grouped the SMEs into 11 clusters, which began
sharing skills and resources to develop an export market. UNIDO helped the groups
standardize their products and improve quality and pricing systems. As demand for exports
grew, the groups hired a manager to handle development, technical capacity, and financial
awareness. The project was successful, achieving US$300,000 in new investments.
Additionally, 30 new business networks were created, a total of 480 SMEs.

1.4.5 Attitudes

It needs to be established as to whether HEs are seen as a valued option, otherwise
interventions will not lead to take-up of opportunities. In Liberia, for example, young people
aspire to salaried office jobs. Other types of jobs, such as farming or unskilled labor positions,
are not held to the same regard and are not considered to be a "true" employment option.50
Recent World Bank qualitative research highlights that feelings of exclusion stem from a lack
of reliable, quality employment (specifically, that which youth consider to be ‘good’
livelihoods), not simply income. 51 Short-term, labor-intensive works may not be considered
jobs by youth, for example, because they consist of unskilled, low-wage, short-term
employment.52 Research can help understand what a viable alternative is, and to what extent
they will see alternatives as ‘better’.

Expectations may appear out of step with reality though. Ideas may be based on unrealized
ideals, marketing, and media rather than consistent experience. However, young people may

  also be interested in public sector work, rather than private sector work, even when it’s more
  lucrative if such jobs are seen as more stable, reliable, with the benefits one needs for their
  families. 53 In sum, young people may strive for reliable income (regular pay) over insecurity
  with possible high rewards; power and status over security and reliability. 54 Some may be
  even willing to be underemployed for lack of (what they consider to be) better options.

  HEs also need to be seen as viable. HEs are also additional, and therefore demanding
  activities. Individuals need to see that HEs are worthwhile in a cost-benefit analysis. Urban
  owners work extremely long hours and are subject to disruptions in electrical supply and
  other challenges, making involvement in running an HE stressful, even as it assists in survival
  or prosperity. HEs also operate in a risky environment, in the sense that they depend on
  income from wages that may be hit by redundancy or agricultural income that may be hit by
  particular shocks. 55 As households, illness, and other life events can disproportionately affect
  income if family members are rendered unable to work and provide the free labor required
  for an HE to be profitable.

II.     Research Methodology

  2.1      Qualitative Research Toolkit Development

  The qualitative research toolkit was developed to fill in gaps and provide further nuance to
  existing research that was summarized above. The toolkit can be used with minor changes in
  other FCS as many of the key themes in such contexts overlap.

  The overall methodology was adopted based on other qualitative research that has been
  conducted with good success in similar contexts: FGDs and KIIs across a sample of
  communities that have relatively different socioeconomic, geographical, and political
  differences. The purposive selection of communities is also determined by feasibility of

conducting the research in a reasonable amount of time and given other logistical
circumstances. In many cases, spending two to three days in a single community is sufficient
for obtaining qualitative data, allowing for organization of interviews/focus groups. If they
are any longer, they will interfere with the day-to-day activities of community
members/consumers (CCs) and not necessarily yield enough additional information short of
conducting a full ethnography, which is of course not feasible.

The groups with which research will be conducted were determined based on the literature
reviewed above and understanding which groups would experience issues related to HE
differently. As such, we see that existing household enterprise operators (HEOs), aspiring
entrepreneurs (AEs), and consumers (or those not aspiring to be entrepreneurs at this point)
will have unique perspectives on the various issues which we want to learn more about.

Communities should be selected to try and capture a variety of places across the country
that will depict the broad scope of perceptions and experiences that people have within
that given country. This is particularly important when ensuring that marginalized people and
communities are represented in such research, which is a difficulty in representative
(quantitative) sampling without oversampling those marginalized groups. Five communities
should be selected unless the scope of work (time allowed) is altered, which will allow
research teams to choose a variety of communities based on the following features:

   •   Relative population size: One large urban market or peri-urban market easily
       accessible to the largest city in the country should be chosen; at least one other site
       among the five should be a relatively small (though not rural) town or city.

   •   Proximity to country border/where cross-border trade occurs: At least one site
       should be within proximity to a border where cross-border trade is active.

   •   General accessibility to a major city: At least one community should be relatively
       isolated from other cities/large towns, for example, because of poor road networks,




                                             22
       far distances, or other factors increasing travel time for those who would engage in
       trade.

   •   Proximity to country’s biggest city/commerce capital: At least one community
       should be within the commerce capital and others should be various distances from
       the capital, with at least one being more than a day’s trip (or whatever the maximum
       travel time is within that country) away.

Questions were decided by reviewing all questions asked from a combination of existing
qualitative and quantitative toolkits dealing with related issues (youth, employment,
livelihoods, and other FCS-specific issues). Based on the data gaps identified in the above
literature review, and acknowledging that the focus of this study is on youth in
nonagricultural HEs, the most relevant questions were adopted for use in FGDs and KIIs. In
some cases, phrasing was changed to provide a more accessible form of questioning from
that found on questionnaires. Key resources referred to in selecting the questions for FGDs
and KIIs are:

   •   World Bank (2011), Rapid Qualitative Assessment on Gender and Poverty in Liberia

In other cases, reports did not make available the questions used in the research; however,
data was presented such that it was apparent what type of questioning was asked to yield
very useful information. Such inferences were made from:

2.2       The Research

The work in each FCS requires both desk and field research, as guided by this toolkit. After a
brief overview (below), the methodology (field data collection, entry, and analysis) is
explained in detail; following that are the actual field tools/questions. The e-annex contains
the field forms (questions to ask with coding fields, space for notes, participant data sheets,
and daily tracking sheets), qualitative database (for transcribing and analysis qualitative
data), and training videos (to explain how to use the qualitative database).

2.2.1 Desk

As is clear from the brief literature review above, each FCS has a unique context and therefore
any interventions designed to support, scale up, and sustain HEs will also be unique. While
there is literature available around the themes in most of these contexts, in most cases,
additional qualitative research is needed. An important first step in gathering relevant
information around HEs in a specific FCS is to conduct a literature review that will help
highlight major data gaps. Each country team is expected to do this before adapting tools and
doing any field research.




                                               24
   2.2.2 Field

   Qualitative field research will enable us to fill the gaps identified in the country-specific
   literature review. The qualitative toolkit has already been developed, taking into account the
   major themes outlined above and also identifying the typical gaps in nuanced data. As such,
   all the key questions in the toolkit (presented following the methodology overview) are
   expected to be asked as they are written (of course with suitable translations and nuances as
   needed), but it is also required that each country team make adaptations to follow-up
   questions to elicit specific discussions around that country or region’s context at that time. In
   addition to the specific questions, the overall methodology is to be replicated as much as
   possible in each country. In general it will be necessary to conduct activities in four to six
   communities, purposefully chosen to provide a good representative sample of the country as
   a whole (that is, go for variety in selecting communities).

   In each community selected, the research team will spend five days (including travel to/from
   the community) to make introductions, set up interview times, and then conduct a variety of
   FGDs and KIIs. FGDs will be held with existing HEOs, AEs, and community
   members/consumers (CCs); KIIs will be conducted with various other relevant persons as
   determined by the research team to have important perspectives and knowledge on the area.
   The following pages explain the logistical and methodological details around each of the tasks
   in each community. Following that are the tools themselves, which were developed
   specifically for this work, as explained below.

III.   Overview of Tasks per Community

   The list below provides a brief overview of the tasks per community; following that are
   detailed explanations for each.

       (a) Meet key stakeholders and leaders within that community to help introduce the work,
          organize logistics, and solicit help with participant selection (ensuring that the




                                                  25
        stakeholders understand the need for diversity within each group). This should be
        done at least one week before fieldwork.

     (b) Recruit additional day-hire fieldworkers—not from the communities where research
        is being conducted—who can assist in interpretation (into local dialects) for FGDs and
        KIIs, as necessary.

     (c) Recontact leaders who were helping with selection, and review participant lists to
        ensure that they meet the selection criteria/quotas have been reached. If not, work
        with community leaders to find suitable replacements.

     (d) Conduct FGDs with a minimum of four 56 groups as indicated above in ‘(c)’ per
        community (two hours per focus group, with 6–12 persons per group), using
        previously developed FGD interview guide (semi-structured), sampling methodology,
        and suggested participants. For each FGD, a participant data sheet will need to be
        filled out. Flip charts and markers will be required for each FGD (their utility is
        explained below).

     (e) Conduct KIIs with a minimum of six key informants per community, identified by the
        field team leader with the help of the field team and other interviewees throughout
        the fieldwork (one hour per interview), using previously developed KII guide (semi-
        structured) and suggested participants.

     (f) At the end of each day of research, the field team leader should take the time to meet
        with the field team to review the day’s events, including how the methodology was
        working and specific findings (what was surprising, what was expected, and so on),
        and also to allow time for each field team member to finalize the notes before the
        end of the day. Then, the field team leader should collect and review all field notes



56
  Total number depends on whether men and women should be separated; in Liberia, we recommended that
they be separated, so the total number was six per community.



                                                 26
               from the team, providing necessary feedback and re-interviews if notes are not
               sufficient/incomplete.

            (g) Ensure electronic backup of each page of notes (low-resolution photographs using
               mobile phones are ideal) at the end of each evening, where possible.

            (h) When the lead researcher 57 is not with the field team, the field team leader must send
               all photos, per bullet ‘(g)’ above, to the lead researcher using WhatsApp. A suitable
               mobile phone with 3G connectivity would be required for this. If this is not possible,
               the field team leader will need to bring a computer and flash modem to email the
               files.

            (i) Once all files are sent, the lead researcher will have a phone conversation with the
               field team leader about the data/next steps.

            (j) Also, at the end of each day, a daily productivity report should be sent through a text
               message to the lead researcher with a count of FGDs and KIIs.

IV.         Detailed Field Tasks

      4.1      Hold Community-level Meetings

      This phase will take place in each community that has been selected for research, at least one
      week before the research itself. The field team leader can travel alone or with the field team.
      The purpose of these consultations is to help introduce the work, organize logistics, get
      feedback on follow-up questions that would be relevant in that community, and very
      importantly, solicit help with participant selection (ensuring that the stakeholders understand
      the need for diversity within each group).




      57
         As mentioned, in some cases, the lead researcher and field team leader will be the same; in this case, it is
      still important to have someone not in the field providing backup of data.



                                                             27
It is left to the discretion of the field team leader to decide who the important leaders to visit
are, but examples of relevant leaders are commissioners, chiefs, mayors, elders, youth
leaders, women’s leaders, and so on. It will be useful at this point to present to the leaders a
letter of introduction signed by the World Bank’s country manager, to ensure access to key
counterparts. The objectives of all the meetings are to have, at the end of the day of
consultations,:

   •   Secured locations (ensuring privacy), dates, and times for each of the FGDs;

   •   Town map: For the team to get a good idea as to the layout of the town, the above
       persons will help the team draw a map of the town, including key areas like markets,
       shops, households, schools, transport hubs, government buildings, nongovernmental
       organizations (NGOs), and so on;

   •   Possible KII participants: Leaders will also assist in preparing a list of names of
       individuals who may be suitable for KII, along with contact information (place of
       residence/work and mobile phone, if available) to get in touch with them
       quickly/make appointments for meetings; and

   •   FGD participants preliminary lists: This aspect will require the most attention, as the
       makeup of FGDs is important in capturing diversity within the community. Selection
       of FGD participants is outlined below.

4.1.1 FGD participants

For this study we are focusing on existing HEs operating in the markets, AEs, consumers
/community members within the market catchment area. The field team will need to make
sure that the community leaders who are recommending names understand the criteria –
and adhere to the quotas – that are needed for participants to be in each of the FGDs, most
especially that the participants broadly represent the types of people of that participant type
in that community. Quotas are therefore set on education level, type of business operation,



                                                28
age level, and gender. Guidance is provided below, but the field team leader should, during
refinement of toolkits, set specific targets that will be followed across all communities.

   •   Education: Must be broadly representative of the education of the population as a
       whole (see basic census statistics). Oversampling may be used in order to capture
       people whose education level is an outlier in that community (that is, college
       education). If it appears during piloting as though mixing education levels could
       negatively affect the conversation (if for example someone of a very high education
       dominates the conversation and the others do not feel comfortable speaking), then it
       will be important to hold separate groups, or to conduct KIIS with those who are very
       highly educated and conduct FGDs with those that are more representative of the
       population.

   •   Age: The target age group is 18-35 but there should be a range of ages within each
       group, such that half of the group is made up of those aged 18-25; the rest aged 26 –
       35).

   •   Gender: There must always be an equal proportion of men and women in each group
       (unless it is decided that separate groups will be used)

   •   Type of business: These should be broadly representative of the types of business in
       a given community, but there must be at least two persons working in services in each
       HEO and AE group.

At the end of the day of consultations, preliminary participant lists should be prepared, and
the community leaders will be encouraged to continue refining those lists and have
everything ready by the time the field team arrives for research. Phone communication
between the field team leader and leaders in the community after the consultation and
before the research will be important to ensure that plans are moving forward.




                                              29
4.2       Recruit Additional Day-hire Interpreters

Depending on the language skills of the field team, it will be necessary to hire interpreters to
help during FGDs and KIIs. It is very important that all participants of FGDs are able to
understand the facilitator and are comfortable speaking. Interpreters should be recruited
from outside of the community to ensure maximum confidence that interpretations are
accurate (in case he/she has some reason to change what is being described).

4.3       Introductions and Participant Selection

When the field team arrives to the community, meetings with the leaders who were visited
originally should be held to confirm that the selection criteria were adhered to. If the
selection criteria have not been adhered to, then the field team leader should explain why
changes need to be made, and then suitable replacements should be found where needed.

4.4       Focus Group Discussions

As indicated above, in each community, FGDs will be held with the following groups of young
people (ages 18–35):

      •   Persons with existing HEs operating in the markets (formal and informal) - who have
          their own operation selling goods or offering services; primary location of business
          (preparing goods, storing goods, and offering services) is the household

      •   AEs - who are involved in selling goods/offeringservices, but do not have their own
          operation, and are doing this business on behalf of someone else and being paid for
          it

      •   CCs (male) and CCs (female) - those who fall outside the above two categories, not
          involved in business at all (either doing nothing, farming only, or have salaried or

                                               30
Each group should consist of 6–12 persons ages 18–35. FGDs will last no longer than two
hours each (timing guidance will be provided on each question/module), and should be
conducted with one facilitator, one notetaker, and one interpreter (as needed). Notetakers
should record everything they hear and also note the things that happen during the
conversation (that is, disagreement, laughter, embarrassment, silence, and so on). The first
step of each focus group is to complete the participant data sheet, which is part of the toolkit
provided for each FGD in each community. This will give important data and also help call
participants by name, which can contribute to a better discussion.

Each FGD has a CORE module, and another module specific to their group. The CORE module
gives good insight into broad themes that we want to compare across communities and
groups, and also is a good line of questioning to begin a focus group. The group-specific
questions will give us details around that group’s particular experiences and attitudes
regarding employment, livelihoods, and HEs.

In FGDs, there are two types of questions that can be used within the modules (whether they
are ‘blind’ or ‘open’ should be decided within each country, depending on the sensitivity of
the questions and whether respondents will feel free to answer the questions).

   •   Close-ended blind (or not blind, where appropriate) voting questions: In this case,
       the group will be asked a question (where the information is sensitive, they will need
       to put their heads down/hands up to vote for specific answers; otherwise, simply
       hands up will be fine); the notetaker will record the tally of responses on a (prepared)
       flip chart for the whole group to see. At the same time, the notetaker will record the
       answers in his/her notes. Once all the responses have been received, the facilitator
       will go through each answer and request volunteers to explain why they gave that
       response. People should not be forced to respond, as the reason for blind voting is to
       allow anonymity. However, everyone should be given a chance to respond and
       conversation should be encouraged among the group. When the conversation is
       ending and/or everyone has responded, follow-up questions should be asked. The



                                              31
         benefit of blind voting is not just confidentiality, but also ensuring that respondents
         aren’t answering only what they think is the ‘normal’ answer based on what their
         colleagues are saying.

   •     Open-ended questions: In these questions, a subject will be introduced through a
         question, allowing the group to go right into discussion. In some modules, the flip
         chart will be used to help respondents visualize the conversation. Everyone in the
         group should be encouraged to give their opinion on each question. If it seems that
         most people have the same ideas/opinions, to go more quickly through the
         conversation, questions like “Does anyone have a different reason?” or “Do all of you
         agree with this point? If so raise your hand” should be asked. The point is to get (a)
         detailed information and (b) an idea of the variety of opinions in the group. At this
         point, the notetaker and facilitator should try to agree upon the relative distribution
         of responses and indicate these estimates in the notes themselves (the note forms
         have pre-categorized response options, including a space for ‘other’ in some cases).
         The recorded numbers do not have to be exact (as with blind voting), but rather from-
         the-field estimates as to where the group’s individual opinions are. Doing this will
         greatly assist in the data analysis. In addition to recording this information, of course,
         the notetaker must take detailed notes on the conversation and specific opinions
         people have and why. All open-ended questions also include follow-up questions,
         which are indicated on each sheet.

Each question/discussion point appears on a single piece of paper with two sides (see Figure
4.1 for an example of what one question for one group will look like on the front side of the
form).




                                                32
                                Figure 4.1. Example Field Form Page




In addition to the main question (in bold), there are instructions for the facilitator/notetaker
(in italics and brackets) and also additional follow-up questions in plain text, which should be
asked whenever the discussion has not already covered these points. For each response, what
the person voted for or their response type (according to the categories provided) and then
their detailed explanation with direct quotations should be noted.

The conversation should be allowed to continue until either (a) everyone has spoken or (b)
there is not much variety in responses and everyone seems to agree with the same point.
Then, the follow-up questions need to be looked at to determine whether additional
information needs to be gathered—this is very important because while we hope that all the
information we need will come up naturally, we want to make sure that we do not move on
without talking about certain issues. Each follow-up question should be asked one by one as



                                                33
needed. The notetaker should continue taking notes, and whenever a follow-up response can
be categorized under a certain response type, the notetaker should clearly note this in his/her
notes. For example, for the question in Figure 4.1, if most people in the group have been
saying that ‘the job situation is very good here’, then the notes should be recorded under the
heading ‘a)’. Then, if someone says, ‘I think it is very bad’, then what they say should be
recorded under ‘e)’. An example of how these notes will look like is provided in Figure 4.2 and
Figure 4.3.

4.4.1   ‘Tips’ for facilitators and notetakers in the field


Below are points that the field team leader and also each facilitator/notetaker should
understand about his/her work, to ensure that the work is done efficiently and leads to the
collection of rich and detailed data. We depend on the field team leader to understand the
points below fully and effectively convey each of them to the entire field team.

   •    The most important thing for the facilitator and notetaker is to really understand
        what we are trying to learn from each question. Detailed information on what we
        want from each question is provided during training and in training materials. If the
        facilitator understands what we are trying to learn, then he/she will be better able to
        frame the line of questioning to the participants so that the rich discussion begins.

   •    The facilitator and notetaker must be very familiar with all the questions being
        asked, because in some cases, topics may be fully covered even without asking
        questions about them specifically. For example, if the conversation has naturally
        veered into discussions on regional instability, and questions about regional instability
        come up later, then the notetaker should turn to that page in the guide and begin
        taking notes there.

   •    If information that is not part of the interview guide comes up, but is very relevant to
        what we want to know, then the facilitator and notetaker should feel free to continue
        probing into that unscripted topic. This is partly why FGDs are so useful—we can learn
        about things we may never expect to hear. It is up to the facilitator and notetaker to
        determine whether the topic is relevant to the subject matter and what we want to
        learn from this study. If it is not, then the conversation should be gently shifted toward
        the issues we want to know about.

   •    A good technique to get through FGDs quickly is to point out early on that we are
        interested in hearing everyone’s opinion, but that we would like to hear as much



                                               37
    variety as possible. So, before beginning, the group should be told, “If someone has
    said something that you agree with and you would say the same thing, then go ahead
    and raise your hand to say simply, ‘I agree with this’. If you have some other opinion
    or a different reason for what you think, then please do give us this new information.”
    While we want to allow time for everyone to speak, by allowing them to raise their
    hand to say, “I agree,” can greatly speed up conversations while encouraging various
    responses.

•   The in-country team needs to realize that certain issues that come up may be
    something that ‘everybody knows about’; it is important to realize that this may not
    be the case for those who will read the research and reports, so it is important for the
    notetaker to take note and talk about issues that may seem very obvious. What is
    normal may be very unique in another context! The main point is to encourage
    conversation and write down (and audiotape as a last-resort backup) everything!

•   Notetakers should write everything in the first person, but not worry too much about
    writing in complete sentences or even with perfect spelling, if this slows them down
    so much that they can’t write down everything that was said. They just have to get
    the key information and can edit their notes later, with the help of the recording that
    they have. In some cases, the notetaker may use shorthand if it is easier and the lead
    researcher/team leader will understand what they’ve written (that is, w/o for
    ‘without’; bc for ‘because’, and so on). When we think about analysis, it should be
    remembered that if what has been said has not been written down, then it might as
    well have never been said. Whoever sits down to do the analysis needs a record of
    what was discussed, and the notetaker is the one in charge of keeping that record. If
    at any time during the discussion the notetaker needs more time to record notes,
    he/she must let the facilitator know.

•   The facilitator should keep the group/person engaged and happy to be
    participating. At the beginning of the interview, and also midway through if the group


                                            38
          is getting bored or restless, the facilitator should conduct an ‘icebreaker’ exercise and
          give them an honest estimate of how much time remains. Also, the participants
          should be reminded that what they are doing is greatly assisting future planning for
          their country; that they are ‘representatives’ for their people; and that their role here
          is very important: “If you don’t tell us what it is like in your community, then we will
          go back and know very little. You are really helping us do our work and for that you
          are most appreciated.”

      •   Each question has a recommended time limit; the notetaker and facilitator should
          make sure that these time limits are correctly observed so that all questions are asked
          of the group. We cannot keep people longer than two hours, but we don’t want to
          miss discussions around an entire theme. Keeping time is very important. If the
          facilitator needs to set an alarm on his/her cell phone or wear a watch, he/she should
          do so.

4.5       Key Informant Interviews

A minimum of five KIIs will be conducted with a specific selection of individuals in each
community. These names will be confirmed after meetings with community leaders and other
stakeholders, and after discussion with the lead researcher to agree that these persons are
suitable. In addition, the field team leader is expected to take an active interest in the
research in proposing good candidates for the KII. He/she should consider whether or not a
certain person will provide good and useful information that fills the data gaps identified, to
facilitate writing the report. Interviews need to be prearranged (if it is not possible to do so
in the days prior through local contacts, then it should be arranged first thing in the morning
before other data collection begins) to ensure that these individuals are available at the time
of data collection and are willing to sit down for an interview. If the research team leader
discovers that any of the individuals will not be available at all during data collection, then
he/she must coordinate with the lead researcher so that a suitable replacement can be




                                                 39
decided upon. It may also be necessary for the field team to allocate an additional day for
each site to set up/wrap up the full day of qualitative research.

KIIs will be conducted one-on-one (and with an interpreter as well, if needed), with the
facilitator taking notes, in a private location. The KII guide will have many of the same
questions for each key informant, but additional questions specific to that ‘type’ of informant
will be provided in the interview guide (clearly indicated). Each question is open-ended, but
there will be areas where the facilitator/notetaker will need to ‘code’ the response type in
addition to taking thorough notes of what is said (verbatim) during these discussions. It is the
responsibility of the interviewer to add additional questions that he/she considers relevant
to the subject matter.

Persons selected for KIIs should include (at least one such interview in each community) the
following:

   •   Persons with existing HEs

   •   AEs

   •   NGO stakeholders/partners in the region—can be in the nearest major towns (Mercy
       Corps, International Rescue Committee, ILO, and so on)

   •   Government stakeholders (Ministry of Youth and Sports, Ministry of Labor, Ministry
       of Education)

   •   Community leaders

   •   Marginalized young person (that is, someone involved in crime, illegal activity, or of
       high-risk for such activities)

             o Note that this interview will not include the CORE questions, and should be
                conducted by a suitable member of the team (for example, a young man




                                              40
               should interview another young man; a young woman should interview
               another young woman). Such interviews should only be conducted if it will be
               appropriate.

4.6    Collect, Review, and Back-up Field Notes

It is recommended that data recording devices be used only as backup—they tend to
discourage notetakers and also result in far too much time being taken in transcription. So,
at the end of each day of research, if field researchers need to fill in any ‘gaps’ in their notes,
then they can go to the audio tapes. However, under no circumstances should these build up
such that the field team leader is faced with hours of audio at the end of research.

After consulting with the field team to determine if they need to fill any gaps using the audio,
and allowing time for them to do so if necessary, at the end of each day the field team leader
should collect finalized notes from each data collector and review them. The field team leader
is responsible for providing necessary feedback and determining whether there should be re-
interviews, if notes are not sufficient/incomplete and audio recordings do not provide
sufficient information.

Once notes are finalized by the field team leader, it is necessary to take steps for electronic
backup in case papers are lost or damaged. This is best done by taking photographs of all
pages of notes and participant data sheets using a mobile phone (ensuring that they are
readable). In areas where a scanner is available, low-resolution scans may be taken as well.

Finally, at the end of each field day, the field team leader must complete the ‘Community
Checklist’ (see Chapter 8) to indicate the activities that were completed.




                                                41
     4.7      Quality Assurance Processes with Lead Researcher 58

     While the field team leader is responsible for all of the above, it will also be necessary for the
     lead researcher, who will be working virtually, to provide solid quality assurance as per the
     following steps.

           (a) When the lead researcher is not with the field team, the field team leader must send
              all photos to the lead researcher using WhatsApp. A suitable mobile phone with 3G
              connectivity would be required for this. If this is not possible, the field team leader
              will need to bring a computer and flash modem to take a backup and then (once
              Internet is possible) email the files.

           (b) Once all files are sent, the lead researcher will have a phone conversation with the
              field team leader about the data/next steps.

           (c) Also at the end of each day, a daily productivity report with a count of FGDs and KIIs
              conducted should be sent through text message to the lead researcher.

           (d) Where there is no Internet connectivity, it is expected that the field team leader will
              communicate this to the lead researcher. If necessary, half a day or full day will be
              used by the lead researcher to travel to a point in the county where Internet can be
              accessed (that is, at a partner NGO, area with 3G network, and so on).

V.         Ethical Considerations in Field Research

     In any research that deals with vulnerable or marginalized populations, it is imperative to pay
     close attention to the potential to do harm through asking questions or eliciting conversation.
     The research team will follow ethical guidelines as prescribed by the American Sociological
     Association and World Bank standards, summarized here.


     58
        In some contexts, the lead researcher and field team leader will be the same person; however, in all cases of
     field research, it is useful to have another person in the office who is storing and reviewing data as it comes.
     So this process should be facilitated with someone not in the field in all cases.



                                                           42
The team must be acutely aware of the need to obtain vocal informed consent from EVERY
participant in the study when recruiting participants for FGDs or KIIs (that is, the researcher
exactly explains what is going to happen during the questioning, and allows people to decide
not to participate after getting this information); each participant will be told that his/her
name will not be used in any project documents without their explicit permission;
pseudonyms will be used in any narratives; and that they will be given a unique ID, which will
be linked to their names but those names will be kept separately in a password-protected
document. The importance of keeping track of their individual progress (if needed) will be
explained to them such that they understand its importance and can give informed consent.

If at any point in a conversation (whether during meetings with leaders, focus groups, or
interviews) it appears that the participant no longer wants to speak or be present, then it is
imperative that the researcher (a) identifies this easily and (b) stops the research
immediately. The participant should never be coerced to take part in the first place or to
‘keep answering’ while taking part.

Certain questions might bring up sensitive topics (that is, conflict, violence, poverty,
traditions, gender-based violence); therefore, it is important that the researcher, while
obtaining informed consent, explains the types of questions that will be asked in the survey
or during the conversation and assures the participant that (a) his/her answers will remain
totally anonymous for FGDs (as we will not record quotations by name, only by group) and
confidential for KIIs (unless permission is given by the KII to use his/her name); (b) he/she can
choose to not answer a question if he/she chooses; (c) he/she can stop the interview at any
point without question. If the interview is stopped, then it is up to the field researcher to
locate another suitable candidate for interview if more information is needed.




                                               43
VI.         Data Entry, Analysis, and Reporting

      6.1       Introduction

      This section will go through data entry, analysis, and summary report writing. It is
      recommended that the field team leader is completely familiar with the field data collection
      methodology and the field interview guides/questions and has gone through all the training,
      before beginning to study this section.

      In this document, the following will be provided:

            •   An introduction to the key themes of this study that will be enhanced with qualitative
                data

            •   An overview of the qualitative databases (one each per module)

            •   An explanation of how data should be entered to ensure ease in analysis

            •   An explanation of how the ‘Analysis’ tabs can assist in summarizing data and helping
                see major findings, according to the key themes of this study

            •   Guidance on integrating key quotations into each analytical theme (tab in the
                database)

            •   Guidance on how to utilize analytical themes (tabs in the database) to organize and
                prepare the summary report

      To effectively analyze the qualitative data, the procedures provided in this manual should be
      utilized. If they are not utilized, then we will consider that the qualitative analysis that has
      been conducted is incomplete and not to be considered a valid qualitative analysis. It is
      important to note that data entry processes will take a long time. This should be considered
      to complete the analysis and report by the deadline.




                                                      44
6.2    Qualitative Databases

The qualitative databases have been created not just to facilitate data maintenance, but also
to assist in organizing and analyzing the data around the above themes. While the databases
contain many rows, columns, and tabs and require the field team leader to spend some time
entering data and importing key quotations and narratives, once the field team leader
becomes comfortable with the system, then he/she will be able to see the huge help this will
be in analyzing data and preparing the summary report. The field team leader should consider
which he/she would prefer: a complex but sophisticated data maintenance system that neatly
summarizes the data or a large stack of field notes that he/she will just read over and over
again, hoping to come to some conclusions. It is also important to realize that by using these
databases, the field team leader is ensuring that the qualitative analysis is much less
subjective than simply writing based on field notes that he/she has read. The field team
leader will see that the database requires him/her to see certain trends, and when he/she
sees them, to import quotations. This will ensure that the field team leader does not overlook
an interesting finding, which could easily happen if he/she were distracted by some other
interesting finding.

As explained above, each module will have its own database; however, all the databases will
work in the same way. As such, a detailed overview of the CORE database is provided here,
as this will help with becoming familiar will all the other databases. Note that there are
supplemental documents and training that will help understand the additional module
databases, but these should be clear after reviewing this guidance document.




                                             45
6.3        Data Entry

The first step is to simply enter the data. This is indeed the most time-consuming part of using
the database. Entering data into the database will be vastly simplified if the notetakers have
followed the notetaking guidelines provided in PART ONE of this training manual. If they have
not, then the field team leader may be required to think a bit about where to enter which
data, but it should still be possible.

The tab labelled ‘FGD Data Entry’ is where all the raw data should be entered, for all FGDs in
all communities. This database can be ‘filtered’ using the basic Excel feature, so that only
responses to a certain question or responses for a certain group can be viewed. Note that the
black rows indicate the community which is being referred; all communities’ notes will be
logged within the same database (and all communities have identical questions). Figure 6.1
provides a screenshot of the top of the CORE database where the data for CORE Questions
from each group will be entered. Following that is a screenshot of the database filtered by
only responses to Question CORE 1.1 across all FGDs in five communities. See the finalized
database itself for clarity. 59

FGD Type               C       This field refers to the group that sat for the FGD (existing HEO; AE, and so
                               on). This field is already filled in; close attention needs to paid while
                               inputting data to ensure that the fields align with the FGD group (this will
                               ensure the analysis tabs work properly).
Gender                D        If genders were separated in the study, ‘male’ or ‘female’ should be
                               entered. If they were together, ‘Mixed’ should be entered, but then it
                               should be noted on the analysis tabs where M and F are indicated that
                               this is of course actually mixed.
FGD Code              E        A unique code for that particular FGD should be entered. The structure
                               Community Name - Participant Type – Gender is recommended.
Module                F        This refers to the module (CORE or group-specific) for which the data is
                               being entered. This field is already filled in.

Sorting                        attention needs to be paid while inputting data to ensure that the fields
                               align with question.
Theme                 H        This field refers to the overall theme (topic) of the question which will be
                               reflected in each of the questions for easy reference. In some cases it is
                               ‘General’, meaning that multiple themes come up in the question that
                               should be woven into relevant parts of the thematic analysis.
Opening Question      I        This field provides the main question (bold print on the field forms) to
Text                           which the answer coding corresponds. This is the line of questioning that
                               will remain consistent across all countries. The follow-up questions (not
                               listed in the database) are those specific to the country context, and the
                               data for which will enrich the notes for each question.
Answer Choices        J        This field provides the answer choices that were provided on each of the
                               field forms. For open-ended questions, these should have been filled in
                               with an estimate as to the distribution of response types. For blind-
                               voting/close-ended questions, these should have been filled in with the
                               exact number of persons who had a certain response type. This has
                               already been filled in to help in recording the # of people who chose a
                               certain answer.
# Chose               K        In this field, the total number needs to be recorded (the tally marks
                               should be counted and a number should be entered next to each
                               respective field). If there was nobody who answered in a certain way,
                               then a ‘0’ must be entered (that is, no cells should be left blank).
Corresponding         L        In this field, the transcripts of notes that were taken as it relates to each

                               to response a should be entered in column Q. If the notes are not
                               excellent and do not indicate what a person said, then if the statement
                               can be ‘read into’ to determine what type of response they gave, then
                               this is where and the response should be coded accordingly and entered
                               in the appropriate cell.

                               additional information will be entered, or if there are notes that do not
                               clearly align with a certain answer choice. There should be no information
                               here that could be aligned with any of the response choices (that is, even
                               if the notetaker did not label it as such, if it is clear from the content of
                               the response that it should belong in one of the cells in column M, then it
                               should be put there).

6.4     Key Informant Data

Also in each theme’s database are multiple individual tabs where transcripts from each of the
KIIs conducted in each community will be entered. The format for these is similar to that
which is used for the FGD; the main difference is that the distribution of responses is not
recorded (since there is only one respondent). Here the full text of what was said during the
interview, aligned with each of the questions that was asked, will be entered. There are no
analysis tabs to align with the KII data, as it is expected that these interviews will further
enrich findings of the FGD and the thematic summaries on each tab (explained in detail
below) will be prepared. Each KII question is aligned with the same broad themes and
subthemes as those in the FGD database. Each module’s database has six tabs for KIIs. If more
than one interview of a certain type was conducted in one community, then the database
allows the insertion of additional rows (all the rows from one full KII should be copied and
pasted below). These data entry templates can also be filtered by question in the same way
the FGD data entry templates are (column F).

6.5     Analysis Tabs for FGD Data

There is one tab for each of the broad themes of this study: General, Urban Policy, Resources,
Skills Deficit, Business Environment, and Attitudes. Each of these tabs has been pre-populated
with tables and formulas that will provide a ‘summary’ of the data that has been entered in
column K (# of persons who chose a certain response type; % of total for all FGD participants).
In many cases, all groups or most groups answered the same question; as such, the summary
tables provide a concise look at the response types as they are distributed from group to
group, and across all communities. Table 6.2 provides an example of what this summary data
looks like for one community, for Question CORE 1.1 (the other communities are found
immediately next to it, but has been omitted from this screenshot because of the long width)
which is on the ‘General’ tab.

Table 6.3 shows the data from community 5. Also, in the table, we can see the grand total
figures for all five communities, and also a column that calculates the relative differences
between the opinions of the communities, overall, given the tallies provided in the TOTAL
column for each community. This column will help identify where major differences exist in
community-level opinions surrounding this question.

By summarizing the data in this way, it is much easier to see trends and differences based on
the groups being interviewed or based on the area that the community is in. For example,
the above would indicate a few things. First, we see that overall, people are not positive about
the job situation—most (67 percent) said it was ‘very bad’ and a large proportion of the
remainder (27 percent) said it was ‘bad’. Nobody said it was ‘excellent’. Also, we see that
women are slightly more content than men with the job situation. Also, we see that overall,
HEOs are slightly less content with the job situation than AEs; least content are non-
entrepreneurial community members. This suggests that young people see more success in
pursuing their own businesses, giving us more weight to the idea that helping HEs is an
important component of ensuring youth security. Second, we see that the job situation in
Community 1 is better overall for people than it is in Community 5 and, looking at the Total
for all communities, it is somewhat better across all communities surveyed. This would
encourage us to explore more into that community and what about that community is leading
youth to be more content with their job situation as compared to the others. The detailed
notes from the focus group and KIIs will, of course, provide important insights into this. These
summary tables are not intended to be treated as quantitative data findings, but rather to
help the field team leader to focus on interesting trends and outliers. Of course, the analysis
should be the field team leader’s, but these components will help the field team leader to see
the data in a more systematic way, and point out where to look more into the many field
notes that have been collected. As these percentages are reviewed, in the corresponding blue
box (column AW), the overall trends observed using the exact percentages should be entered.




                                                  53
6.6    Key Quotes for Each Group

After the field team leader has looked through the data tables and noticed any trends,
outliers, or other interesting data, it is time to go back to the FGD data entry sheet to extract
relevant quotes from the FGDs that he/she thinks best explain the findings in the tables. The
field team leader is required to enter at least one key quote from each group in each
community, which relates to each answer choice (of course, if 0 people voted for one choice,
then this can be left blank). It is better, of course, if the field team leader can include more
than one quote in a cell, if he/she thinks it is relevant, but it should just be clear in writing
that they are from different people by referring to (a)… (b)… for each new speaker. If separate
gender groups have been used, to the gender of the person talking should always be
distinguished. These notes will be recorded in columns AX to BB.

Next, the field team leader will need to write a summary for each question to convey the
overall sentiment of that community, as per the discussion point, in column BC. He/she can
refer back to the key quotes that have been used and try to incorporate them into their
summary. This step will be the most challenging, as it requires the field team leader to think
deeply about what the notes that are being looked at say about the situation, whether the
communities (and genders) differ (and why), how things have changed (and why), and what
this means for the broader research. While this may seem to be an arduous process, it should
be noted that for every summary that is written, the field team leader has effectively written
a section of the report and has also forced himself/herself to focus attention on key findings.
When this is done for every question, the field team leader will not only be required to read
all the notes thoroughly, but also forced to think through them, how they relate to other
findings, and the broader themes that we’re trying to learn about. It is important to include
quotations here from KIIs that support and/or contradict findings in FGDs; also, KIIs may give
additional ‘insider’ information to further enrich discussions on the FGDs. It is expected that
the field team leader can read the KII transcripts in full before completing summaries, to pull
out relevant quotations for the summaries and then later for the report.

All of the fields on each analytical tab, to which the field team leader will be expected to add
notes and summaries, will be clearly indicated with text and also highlighted in light blue
color. All other fields on the analysis tabs are pre-formatted and locked, and as such the field
team leader will not be able to change anything that is not in light blue color.

                       Each Question by Answer Type; (c) Summary for the Question




Finally, at the top of each analysis tab for each database module (subtheme) is a light blue
box where the field team leader should summarize the entire content of the conversations
that occurred during that module, including additional information from KIIs, and which
related to that particular tab’s theme. Here, it is perfectly acceptable to copy/paste the
summary text directly from that which has already been written in the boxes below each
question. However, here is also an opportunity in which the field team leader can write
additional findings that may not relate directly to the questions that were asked, and also to
note any further connections that he/she would like to make as it related to the broader


                                                    55
conversations that were heard. As with the individual summary boxes for each question, this
task will take some time; however, as the field team leader is doing it, he/she is effectively
writing portions of the report, and making sure that he/she does not forget to write any
important information that has been analyzed on each of the tabs and reviewing the full
transcripts as they’re being typed. To help focus on the summary, the box has been placed
next to each of the module’s/tab’s ‘broad themes’ and also the key ‘points for analysis’ that
need to be considered throughout the analysis and report writing.

6.7    Participant Information Databases

One additional database is used to record participant data for FGDs and KIIs. These forms
provide basic data on every person that is being spoken to, and it is important that this data
is logged as well. It is very important that when recording the job type for FGDs that the type
of business they are primarily involved in is specified. So, not just ‘selling’, but, ‘selling mixed
vegetables’ or ‘selling used clothes’. The databases are nearly identical, except for the FGD
database where the ‘FGD Type’ is recorded and for the KII database ‘Role of KI’ is recorded.
As the key informant data are analyzed, the role that he/she plays in the community is
important.

VII.     Summary Report

   7.1      Writing the Report

   The report should be organized according to the following outline, which should make it easy
   to bring in the summaries that were prepared in the qualitative analysis for each question. It
   is important that the qualitative data is presented in a way that is neatly woven together to
   make a specific point, not simply reporting on each question one by one based on the
   question codes provided. The outline below should provide a very basic structure to the
   report, but based on what the field team leader finds in the data in a specific country, there
   is much freedom for him/her to expand upon this structure and provide much more detail
   and nuance. In other words, if the data is there, then it should be presented! The most
   difficult task will be in deciding where it best fits; however, to do this, it is recommended that
   the context of Liberia is considered, and where the information would be most useful from a
   project-implementation perspective. Imagine it from the World Bank’s position: deciding
   which projects to implement and how best to do it in these specific communities in the
   country. What information would be needed to best inform the decisions that will be made?

   The outline given below should be followed to prepare the summary report. The total page
   length should be around 25 pages (not including the annex which can be of any length). The
   databases should be referred when preparing this report, as the notes themselves, and also
   the quotations and summaries that have been prepared on the analysis tabs that are
   organized according to the same themes as those that are written in the ‘findings’ section
   below.

   7.2      Outline

         A. Executive Summary (2 pages) - If someone were to only read this section, it should be
            ensured that all the important information from the research is provided in a concise
            and organized summary.

B. Introduction (1 page) - A brief introduction to the work and the importance of the work
   given Liberia’s situation should be provided.

C. Methodology (2 pages) - Very brief explanation

       1. Brief description of fieldwork conducted/places visited/people spoken to

       2. Limitations/problems encountered in the field

D. Findings organized by theme (findings from all communities should be summarized,
   showing major themes, but also any outliers noticed between communities should be
   highlighted. Also, any differences noticed between men and women, or those of
   different age groups (and any other characteristics) should be pointed out clearly.
   Quotations from FGDs and KIIs, if they are particularly powerful and relevant, should
   be included. Also, it is good to include any case studies that the field team leader has
   come across in stand-alone ‘boxes’ within the text, to help the reader keep attention
   on something the field team leader finds to be very important. Also, the field team
   leader should feel free to add subheadings to each of the recommended sections
   below, if he/she thinks that it helps to organize the discussion better. Using the
   subthemes, for example, as subheadings, can help organize the presentation. Some
   subheadings are suggested here, but they can be amended based on the findings of

8.2        Focus Group Discussion Guides

Note that before every FGD, it is imperative to read/explain clearly to the group the mission
in conducting this fieldwork, and allow them to ask any questions. It should be made clear
that they do not have to take part if they do not want to. By filling out the participant data
sheets (with their signature/thumb print) they are agreeing that we can use their quotations
(we will not report their names) and ideas in our research reports.

8.2.1 FGD participant data sheet

A participant data sheet needs to be completed before every FGD.60 Not only does it give us
good information on the people who we are talking to (name, age, gender, job/type of
business, level of education, additional training, number of children, ethnicity), but it will also
help the facilitator/notetakers to (a) ensure that there is a good representation of job types,
genders, and ages in the group before beginning; (b) allow the facilitator to learn the
participants’ names to make them feel more comfortable as he/she calls them by name; and
(c) ensure that the facilitator does not forget to get this information from them before letting
them go/that they do not leave before getting this information. Participants should be
informed that their names will be kept completely confidential and if they prefer to not give
their names, or only their first name, this is absolutely fine.

8.3      Key Informant Interviews

KIIs will be semi-structured, but here it is important that the field researcher engages actively in the research and the conversation
ongoing, as this is the chance to ask key follow-up questions that relate to the findings so far in the work. Therefore, the questions
provided should be used as a very rough guide to the line of questioning. In most cases, the Field Team Leader should conduct the
KIIs; when not possible, the strongest members of the field team should conduct them. All KIIs will be asked CORE questions
(adopted from the FGD Guide). For HE and AE KIIs, we use the same questions in respective FGDs; for leaders we include additional
questions that relate to the overall situation in the community that relates to youth, HEs and stability.

8.4     Methodology Development Notes

The qualitative research toolkit was developed to fill gaps in and provide further nuance to
existing research on HEs, both in Liberia and in FCS more broadly. The toolkit was designed
to be applicable in other FCS as many of the key themes in such contexts overlap.

The methodology used in the toolkit was developed based on other qualitative research
that had been conducted with good success in similar contexts. It adopted FGDs and KIIs
across a sample of communities that had discernable socioeconomic, geographical, and
political differences. The purposive selection of communities was also determined by
feasibility of conducting the research in a reasonable amount of time and given other
logistical considerations. In many cases, spending two to three days in a single community
was sufficient for obtaining qualitative data, allowing for organization of interviews and focus
groups. If they are any longer they will interfere with the day-to-day activities of community
members and not necessarily yield enough additional information short of conducting a full
ethnography, which was of course not feasible. Similar qualitative methods had been used
with good success in FCS contexts. 61

To develop the research questions in the toolkit, a literature review on HEs in FCS was
prepared, intended as a broad overview and a way to highlight key themes around the topic.
Because each FCS has a unique context and therefore any interventions designed to support,
scale up, and sustain HEs will also be unique, literature related specifically to Liberia was
explored. Content obtained through this review primarily informed the follow-up questions
used, but the headline questions were maintained. As such, for the research going forward,

each team should prepare a country-specific literature review to supplement the global
review and to refine the country-specific toolkit.

The literature review also elucidated what types of people would experience issues related
to HEs differently. As such, it was determined that existing HEOs, AEs, and CCs would have
unique perspectives on various issues related to the dynamics of HEs in informal markets.
While all groups were asked the same core questions, additional follow-up questions were
specific to each group’s unique perspective. While all groups were treated separately in the
Liberia research, it is important for future research teams to recognize the significant overlap
between HEs, AEs, and CCs, particularly where AEs are becoming HEOs, and where CCs may
have underlying aspirations to do business, but have not actually engaged in business yet.
This reality further highlights the importance of conducting qualitative research with these
individuals to understand where they may be on this spectrum and how they move toward
becoming an HEO (and what barriers keep them from doing so).

Questions were decided by reviewing a combination of existing qualitative and quantitative
toolkits dealing with related issues (youth, employment, livelihoods, and other FCS-specific
issues), and were also assigned thematic categories based on the major constraints/priority
areas identified throughout the literature (explained in the Introduction). Based on the data
gaps identified in the literature review, and with the decision to focus this study on youth in
nonagricultural HEs, the most relevant questions were adopted for use in FGDs and KIIs. 62
Key resources referred to in selecting the questions for FGDs and KIIs were:

     •   EPAG Liberia, 2014 (Quantitative)

     •   USAID 2009 Youth Fragility Assessment Liberia (Qualitative and Quantitative)

     •   ILO SWTS: Module 2 SWTS Questionnaires, 2009 (Quantitative)


62
  The determination to focus on youth in nonagricultural HEs was based on the developmental priorities of
the Government of Liberia, as well as the dominance of youth employment and productive inclusion in other
FCS and across the Sub-Saharan Africa region more broadly.

In other cases, reports did not make available the questions used in the research; however,
data was presented such that it was apparent what type of questioning was asked to yield
very useful information. Such inferences were made from:

   •   World Bank, Youth Employment in Sub-Saharan Africa: Creating Productive
       Employment for Youth in the Household Enterprise Sector, p. 166

   •   Blattman, Christopher, Nathan Fiala, and Sebastian Martinez Bustos. "Employment
       generation in rural Africa: mid-term results from an experimental evaluation of the
       Youth Opportunities Program in Northern Uganda." (2012).

   •   USAID, A Framework for Analyzing Resilience in Fragile and Conflict-Affected
       Situations, p. 43

The qualitative toolkit consisted of semi-structured interview guides for FGDs and KIIs. In each
community, FGDs were held with groups of young people (ages 18–35) who were HEOs, AEs,
and CCs. For FGDs, each group consisted of 6 to 12 persons and lasted no longer than two
hours each, and were conducted with one facilitator, one notetaker, and (if needed) one
interpreter. The first step of each focus group was to complete the participant data sheet,
which provided important data and also helped identify participants by name, contributing
to better discussion. The facilitator conducted two interview modules with each FGD having
a CORE module, and another module specific to their participant type. The CORE module gave
good insight into broad themes to compare across communities and groups, and also
provided a good line of questioning to begin a focus group. The group-specific questions were
designed to elicit details around that group’s particular experiences and attitudes regarding
employment, livelihoods, and HEs.




                                              87
KIIs were conducted one on one using an interview guide that had the same CORE questions
across all groups, but also included a number of additional questions that were particular to
that type of KII (HEO, AE, community leader, government staff, NGO staff). Participant data
was collected from all KIIs, and interviews generally lasted around 30 minutes. A minimum of
five KIIs was conducted per community, ensuring that at least one type of KI was represented
in each.

8.6    Selected Narratives of Success

Narratives of success that were particularly powerful in their full length and which
exemplified the ‘typical’ narrative of how an HEO could succeed in Liberia, but which would
not fit into the main report, have been excerpted from FGDs and KIIs and reported here.

      “The major thing that I think is making young people succeed is that some of these
      young people are respectful, hardworking, and determined… For example, the boy you
      people met at the store you passed through has been with me for the past eight years
      and I have found him to be hardworking, determined, and respectful. Since he came to
      my company, with that I have turned this store over to him to run…. I am deciding to
      give it [the store] to him for himself. I want to say that most of them [youth] are used
      to getting free things through the war, so this is how their lives will be forever; that is
      why they don't want to work and earn something for themselves that is while they are
      not succeeding. The few that are succeeding now are those that are prepared and
      hardworking and determined about their future.” (Male HEO, Sanniquellie)

      “There are many successful business people in this community and I am one those. I
      started by making garden. I used to sell potatoes, greens, and cassava leaves around in
      the communities along with my wife on our head and in wheelbarrow. We did that for
      good three years and we were able to generate some money to start a business. My
      wife and I were working very hard and we were also focused and determine in doing
      our garden. We started our business by selling rice in wheelbarrow and other small
      cooking materials like [stock] cube, pepper, better bore, and okra. She was selling those
      small cooking materials while I was selling the rice at the same time going to school.
      After few years we were able to get a table in the market and started selling dry goods
      which was my aim and objective. It is also based on good management skills by me and
      my wife. We had so many constraints but we were strong and determined to achieve
      our objectives. Today we have built a house and a store in the market, which people are



                                              101
renting from us. Other people are not successful like us who are doing good in business
because they are not determined, focused, serious and have no good management skills
in them. They also mixed business with fine time and do not manage their capital well.”
(Male HEO, Redlight)

“Let me share a story of my friend who struggled a lot to start his business, and today
he a successful businessman... He started his business with selling plastic bags, in 1992,
after the Liberia civil war ceased for the first time, here in Buchanan. Mr. T [name
changed] sold plastic bags in front of his house for two years. When the war came he
left his business and ran into the bush, and lost all of his goods. He had just returned
from Ivory Coast from purchasing his new consignment of goods. A few months after
all of us returned to Buchanan, he left the plastic bag business and started selling rice,
but his brothers and sisters that were taking care of his business while he carried some
goods to the various gold camps to sell, started to spend his money lavishly, so he
decided to be with his business personally, and he removed all of his family members
from his business. With all these problems, he has managed to have three stores from
his hard work and serious attitude. He has one of the best [fashion] boutiques on
Tubman Street.” (Male NGO stakeholder, Buchanan)

“One of the most successful businessmen in Nimba County is Mr. B [name changed].
[He] started his own business by selling medicines around in the community. After
sometime he started going to the various villages to sell. During the war, he faced so
many constraints from robbers who looted his goods and made away with his income.
He was not discouraged. He did not give up. After the war he got money from his own
account and started selling medicines again. Based on his determination, self-
motivation, self-confidence, and hard work, the business started to grow. He
established a drug store to sell medicines. He decided to go to the medical school to
become a medical doctor. He attended Cuttington University. He graduated with a
degree in medicine. [He] used the knowledge and skills that he acquired from




                                        102
Cuttington University to improve his business. He was able to put in more time and
managed his business well. Today he has drug stores around the county. He is also into
real estate business, and he owns a hotel. [He] is a successful businessman because he
was honest, hardworking, determined, and self-confident that he was going to be a
successful businessman.” (Male NGO staff, Sanniquellie)

“Some of the reasons [that some youth are better off than others] are: hard work,
attitude, self-confidence, connections, and being honest. For example, there is a youth
in this [who] was selling little goods on a small table… he was focused and he put in all
of his time and effort into his business. He used to go to the market every day and leave
late just to make sure he was running and managing well. After some period of time, he
got connected to someone who was willing to give him goods. The person got him goods
to sell and later return the money for the goods. The person got connected to him
because of hard work and the passion he had for business. He did that business for two
years and today he owns his own shop selling for himself. He was always confident that
his business was going to expand one day. Some youth in this community are worse off
after school because they are not hard working, they do not have good attitude, they
are not honest to people, and they lack self-confidence. They do not put in time to
work.” (Male HEO, Sanniquellie)

“Yes!! I can give you a short story about myself, how I came into business and those
constraints and how I try to overcome them to be at the level I am today. I started selling
for a friend in this market for over three years after I lost my husband and I was the only
source of income for my children’s progress. It was one day after these long periods of
selling for my friend, she took one bill of the used clothes which I was selling for her and
she told me to see it, give her the principal, and take the profit for myself. I sold it for
four months and started my own market on the table, selling dry goods such as paper,
salt, and so on. From which I moved to the level of being able to purchase my owned
used clothes, which I have [done] for the past years, and up to now I have more than




                                         103
six tables in this market and currently serving as the head of the marketing association.
I face a lot of constraints as I was in my transitional period to where I am today.” (Female
HEO, Sanniquellie)

“I am successful today because of many reasons. I started my business with a little
amount of money that I got from my own savings. I started with LRD 500.00 as capital
of the business that I am running today. I decided to mobilize most of my friends that
are in business, and also in the community, to establish a local credit club. After I shared
the idea with most of my friends, they saw it as a good thing to do. We started putting
in money and after sometime people started coming to take credit from us. When the
money started growing, I also took some money from the club and invested it into used
clothes business. With the profit that I generated from there for four years, I decided to
open a tea shop. During the 2000s war, I went to Guinea. I returned from Guinea in
2004 and was able to start my business again. During my stay in Guinea, the club was
still operating in Liberia. Today I am able to build a shop and my house from the teashop
profits. I am into agriculture business today. I have an oil palm farm, and I am confident
that come 2018, I will be harvesting and selling my palm nuts to the general public for
consumption. I am successful today because of the hard work, trust, and honesty.”
(Male HEO, Sanniquellie)

“I am one of those who started selling from scratch and expanded and diversified my
business. I started selling dried fish and meat in the market. Later I started selling
peanuts and pepper. I later switched to slippers and dishes. I later opened many tables
in the market. Today I am the owner of a shop in which I sell lappas, cosmetics, dishes,
imported clothes, drinks, book bags, and so many things. More people are not
successful like me because they are not hardworking and determined. I vowed never to
work for anyone other than myself. Some people are not successful like me because
they are not innovative. They do not have constructive jealousy.” (Female HEO,
Tubmanburg)




                                         104
“One of the successful business persons in this community that started her own
business from nowhere is Mrs. B. [name changed]. She is successful because of her hard
work and focus in doing her business. Mrs. XY started her business by selling red oil by
bottle in the market. She used to go to villages and take the red oil from people, bring
it to Sanniquellie, and sell it and later return their money to them. She was very honest
in doing that business. After selling the red oil she used to put her daily susu which was
her own saving. She kept putting the susu for three years. After those three years she
collected her money and it amounted to LRD 25,000.00 which she started using to buy
her own red oil to sell. She did that for five years and she was able to earn some money
to transfer the business from selling red oil to owning a shop to start selling dry goods.
Today Mrs. B is one of the most successful businesswomen in this community. I think
other people are not successful like Mrs. B because they are not hard working, they do
not put in more time to their business, they are not also focused on why they are doing
business. Some of them mixed family issues with business while others do not reinvest
their profits.” (Male Community Leader, Sanniquellie)

Abstract

Many policy makers across Sub-Saharan Africa, including in fragile and conflict-affected situations
(FCS), consider youth employment a central policy issue. As the recent World Development Report
on jobs has highlighted, jobs are a key driver of development (World Bank 2012). Jobs matter
for living standards, productivity, as well as social cohesion. Particularly in FCS, jobs mean more
than earnings; feelings of exclusion stem from a lack of reliable, quality employment, not simply
income (Rebosio and Romanova 2013). Volume 1 (SPL Discussion Paper no. 1608) presents results
from the application of a novel qualitative toolkit in Liberia, with the objective to improve
the knowledge of the constraints to entry and productivity among nonagricultural household
enterprises. It outlines lessons learned from the application of this research and makes policy-
relevant findings on how to improve productivity in the sector in Liberia. In addition, the report
contains methodological lessons that can inform the application of the toolkit in other contexts.
Volume 2 of this paper presents a global review of the literature on household enterprises in FCS
and the detailed methodology and tools for the research.
