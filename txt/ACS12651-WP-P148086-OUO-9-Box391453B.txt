Executive Summary
The abundance of natural resources combined with high commodity prices for much of the last two
decades has helped Turkmenistan reach upper middle-income status. The economy has grown
fourfold in real terms and poverty outcomes are likely to have improved substantially. The question is
whether this progress is sustainable, or just a windfall gain. In other words, what will it take to
consolidate the gains achieved so far and achieve the long term objectives of a high-income, diversified
economy able to create productive and well-paying jobs?

Turkmenistan prospered by integrating more into the world economy and the instrument of this
integration has been hydrocarbons, the resource that the country has in the greatest abundance.
Turkmenistan discovered its largest natural gas deposits (Yolotan) in the early 1990s, after the breakup of
the Soviet Union, before transitioning to a market-based economy and commencing structural reforms.
Over time this has led to the economy’s reliance on extractive industries, which account for almost half of
GDP and nearly 90 percent of exports, resulting in the most concentrated export basket in Central Asia.
This is not surprising since countries typically export the items that are derived from their most abundant
assets. Indeed, estimates of subsoil capital - the present value of the stream of annual resource rents that
countries generate from production and exports of oil, gas, and mineral reserves - demonstrate
Turkmenistan’s richness.

Turkmenistan is working on completing its transition as it advances through upper middle income
to high income. To a large extent, natural resource abundance thwarted the incentives for structural
reforms and delayed first generation economic reforms, including trade/price liberalization, enterprise
privatization and creation of institutions for the regulation of markets. Implementation of first generation
economic and structural reforms began mainly after 2007. The public sector plays a dominant role in the
economy, with centralized decision making.

Economic diversification is a key strategic priority. As part of diversification efforts and reduction of
dependence on oil and gas revenues, the Government of Turkmenistan has embarked on a number of
structural reforms. These aim to sustain a high level of government investment to diversify the economy,
increase competitiveness, create new businesses and jobs, and expand domestic demand. Investment in
infrastructure, particularly in more provincial and remote areas, is a key priority, as demonstrated by one
of the highest rates of Gross Fixed Capital Formation in the world. Key priorities are also the
improvement of monetary and credit policy and strengthening of the banking system.

Turkmenistan has a vertically centralized governance structure. Top-down decision-making
characterizes the way the public administration operates. Most decisions are taken at the highest political
level and implementation falls into various Ministries and agencies. Uneven coordination among the
various agencies, capacity constraints in parts of the public administration and limited consultation with
outside stakeholders may lead to fragmented regulation and sub-optimal quality of service delivery. In
this context, the private sector has hardly evolved in a natural pathway and the relationship between the
State and private enterprises is tightly controlled.

Accelerated and sustainable development will combine active diversification policies with policies to
strengthen the country’s asset base of natural resources, built ca pital and institutions. It may seem
easier to target specific sectors or firms, with subsidies or other forms of preferential treatment, because
focusing resources on the final objective (diversification of production or exports) is perceived as a quick
win. Cursory observation of global experience, however, shows that direct government intervention can
only succeed if industrial policy is aligned with the comparative advantages of the economy and if the


                                                     8
mechanisms put in place to dispense government support are well designed and governed. Following the
example of economies worldwide, the attention of policy and public financial resources could focus on
leveraging natural resource revenues to diversify the country’s asset base - the physical and human
capital, and institutions that ensure macroeconomic stability, provide public services and regulate private
enterprise. This development strategy offers better chances to achieve durable results, but requires a
sustained effort on many fronts and over several years.

Reflecting its extraordinary resource abundance, Turkmenistan’s asset portfolio is weighed toward
“hard” endowments (natural resources and physical capital) while human capital and institutions
are in need of improvement. Turkmenistan is richly endowed with natural resources, especially
hydrocarbon wealth (it ranks 10th in the world in subsoil capital per capita). Thanks to massive
investment in physical infrastructure, Turkmenistan has also built sizeable physical assets. Investments in
“softer” assets - human capital and institutional upgrading - remain relatively low priorities. The Human
Development Index (HDI), a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and income, shows that,
despite the spectacular increase in income per capita in recent years, health and education lag most
comparators. Policies need to be put in place to improve the quantity and, more importantly, the quality of
education. At the same time, rules to manage resource rents, provide public services, and ensure a level
playing field for entrepreneurs and innovators need to be made more robust. For instance, Turkmenistan
does not have transparent rules for defining limits of resource utilization from the Stabilization Fund or
for the utilization of resource revenues for programs with higher public returns on investments. As for the
regulation of private economic activity, there are no clear guidelines to ensure that procedures are duly
followed when designing and implementing regulations, while Turkmenistan does not have a legal and
institutional framework for competition.

In order to rebalance the country’s asset portfolio, authorities can make specific policy choices to
strengthen human capital, ensure a more level playing field for business, improve public service
provision and manage resource rents. Key policy options in each of these areas are as follows:

Strengthening human capital

       Identify the optimal pace of increase in public investment spending in health and education,
        taking into account the current level of development and absorptive capacity of the country.

       Identify appropriate education policies to increase the quality of education and tailor the supply of
        education to the economy’s development needs.

       Consider taking part in international benchmarking exercises, such as the OECD PISA
        assessment, to identify strengths and weaknesses of its education outcomes.

Regulating enterprise

       Consider a model of private sector development that allows greater decision-making autonomy to
        private entrepreneurs, for instance regarding production and location decisions. This should apply
        to both new firms and privatized enterprises.
       Devise regulatory management practices and procedures (regulatory impact assessment,
        consultation mechanisms, etc.) that can help improve the quality of regulations.
       Establish a competition framework that ensures a level playing field for enterprises, private and
        state-owned, domestic and foreign. The process could involve: (i) development and enactment of
        appropriate competition legislation (ii) identification of an institutional set up for a competition
        agency (sector-based, instrument-based or hybrid) that is appropriate within the current legal and


                                                     9
        administrative framework, (iii) identification of the degree of independence and reporting
        requirements that guarantee effectiveness of competition enforcement in the current context.

Enhancing the quality of public service provision

       Enhance coordination mechanisms within government to ensure effective policy formulation,
        implementation and monitoring.
       Enhance the control system to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditure.
       Identify normative changes that would help increase the quantity and quality of service delivery,
        including, in due course, with the involvement of private partners in PPP arrangements.
       Develop a long term public investment strategy and introduce a public investment appraisal
        system.

Managing resource rents

       Introduce prudent fiscal rules and regulations to improve management of the Stabilization Fund
        to positively impact the quality of fiscal policy in the current setting of multiple fiscal institutions.
       Enhance the capacity of Ministry of Finance and Central Bank staff by developing skills on fiscal
        sustainability analysis and macroeconomic modeling.
       Use monetary policy instruments for effective smoothening of economic cycles.
       Reassess the fixed exchange rate arrangement.

Introduction
1.      Turkmenistan has become an upper middle-income economy driven by hydrocarbon
exports. The strong growth performance, sustained over a decade, helped to lift the country from a low
income to an upper middle-income status. GDP per capita rose from US$970 in 2002 to nearly US$7,000
in 2013. Living standards of the population have improved, accompanied by massive investment in
physical capital. Growth has been driven by natural gas exports, which amount to over 90 percent of
exports, with the extractive sector (including refineries) accounting for nearly half of GDP.

2.       Sustained growth, continued improvement in living standards, an increased role for the
private sector and economic diversification have become strategic government priorities for 2030.
In May 2010, the Government of Turkmenistan adopted its National Program for Socio-Economic
Development of Turkmenistan for 2011-2030 (NPSD). Specific objectives include: a) increasing the
private sector’s role in the economy by expanding its share in the non-hydrocarbon economy to at least 70
percent; b) reaching a high-income status for the country by 2025; c) ensuring sustainable regional
development by achieving universal access to drinking water in all communities by 2030; and d) closing
the development gap between rural and urban areas and ensuring inclusive development throughout the
country. The program envisages diversification of the economy and increased competition, and
recognizes the importance of further market and institutional reforms. The program also includes
privatization of small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

3.      A number of medium-term strategies support the implementation of long-term priorities.
This strategic vision is supported by the medium-term objectives of the Rural Development Strategy,
SME Development Strategy and the President’s program for Turkmenistan’s Socioeconomic
Development for the period of 2012-2016. These documents reflect the government’s priorities of
economic diversification, gradual increase of the private sector’s role in the economy and ensurin g
sustainable development with environmental and social considerations. They also aim to further
strengthen the base for the formation of a growing, diversified, highly competitive, and technologically
strong economy. Both the energy and transport sectors are high-priority areas in which large-scale public
investments are envisaged over the program period. According to the program, GDP is projected to see
robust growth in 2012–2016, with industry expected to account for 55 percent of GDP by 2016, followed
by services (22 percent), construction (14 percent), and agriculture (9 percent).

4.       Improvements in the investment climate and business environment are seen as fundamental
factors for ensuring dynamic economic development. The NPSD emphasizes the need to promote
investments in the country from all sources, both domestic and foreign. In this respect the government’s
strategic documents include the priorities of creating an enabling environment for the transformation of
private savings into real investment, developing an investment infrastructure, channeling investments into
high return areas, drawing on multiplicative effect of investments, training specialists in investment
management, improving the legal and organizational framework for investment facilitation, creating a
network of investment information bureaus in the country and abroad, and encouraging investment
activity by SMEs.

5.       The government also aims to create a stable, credible and well regulated financial and
banking sector. The NPSD suggests modernization of the financial and banking sector to offer high
quality services and facilitate the growth of the non-hydrocarbon private sector. In addition, it anticipates
increasing the role of the banking sector in the economy, improving its credibility in a competitive
environment, upgrading the skills of banking sector personnel, as well as improving the financial literacy
of the population. The country’s main strategic document also envisages gradual development of an


                                                     11
effective foreign exchange market and transition to full liberalization of the exchange rate and
convertibility of the national currency. These priorities are also stipulated in the Banking Sector
Development Strategy for 2011-2030 and in the State Securities Market development for 2012-2016.

6.       This discussion note aims at supporting the government’s strategic priorities. It provides an
umbrella framework for World Bank engagement in Turkmenistan. Companion discussion notes have
been presented in the areas of privatization, investment climate, access to finance and trade. Based on
global experience, this note identifies priorities to sustain Turkmenistan’s modernization efforts,
improvement in living standards and the successful diversification of the economy. It is argued that a pre-
condition for success is the development of a balanced portfolio of national assets. This includes the
country’s resource endowments, an adequate base of physical and human capital and, most importantly,
sound institutions for macroeconomic management, for the provision of public services and for the
regulation of private economic activity. Only a balanced portfolio of national assets will guarantee the
success of government policy in the long run, including the successful diversification of the economic
base. The note has the following structure. First is an overview of recent economic developments,
including the evolution of the country’s economic structure and foreign trade. Next is an assessment of
Turkmenistan’s current asset portfolio of natural resources, physical capital, human capital and
institutions. International experience is used to provide insights on how to better manage natural
resources, improve physical and human capital, and strengthen the Government’s ability to manage
macroeconomic volatility, provide public services and regulate enterprise. A final section concludes with
issues for discussion in the current context. This discussion note is informed by the policy priorities
stipulated in the government’s main strategy documents. More detailed analysis could be conducted when
sectoral strategies and specific policy instruments deployed by the government to achieve its development
objectives are made available.

Economic Performance
7.       Natural resource revenues served Turkmenistan well. The strong growth performance,
sustained over a decade, helped to lift the country from a low income to an upper middle-income status.
GDP per capita rose from US$970 in 2002 to nearly US$7,000 in 2013 and the average wage in the
economy grew by a factor of 7 between 2000 and 2011. The pace of wage increase was even higher in the
construction and transport sectors. In the absence of other direct measurements of welfare, the average
wage dynamic may be used to assess the overall positive social impact of natural resource revenues on the
country’s prosperity. Proceeds from hydrocarbon exports helped to build large foreign exchange reserves
and create a comfortable fiscal buffer. Also, provision of key utilities (electricity, natural gas, and water)
free of charge to the entire population since 2006, administrative control of prices for key foodstuffs, and
subsidized prices for a number of goods and services with a large share in the consumption basket have
had a large positive impact on the country’s social situation. Official statistics indicate that social
transfers are significant source of income (20 percent) for the lower quintile of population and account
above 8 percent of income for the upper quintile.

8.       The global crisis revealed the economy’s vulnerability to a single-product centered and a
single-market oriented growth model. Before 2009 the main destination of the Turkmen hydrocarbon
exports was Europe through Russia. But the crisis led to a decline of hydrocarbon prices and a drop in
energy demand in Europe. As a result, natural gas exports from Turkmenistan collapsed during the last
nine months of 2009, leading to a 30 percent decline in hydrocarbon output. Although growth was
sustained at 6.1 percent, it was extensively supported by the expansion of public expenditures at the cost
of significant depletion of the accumulated hard currency reserves. The crisis recovery strategy pursued
by the authorities was centered on the redirection of trade to new markets for the most traded product,
natural gas, in order to offset losses incurred in traditional markets. Construction of new pipelines to
China and Iran in late 2009 helped to diversify the geography of gas supply and return the economy to
double-digit growth. The eastward expansion of hydrocarbon exports will become even more significant
after the completion of two on-going projects - the second pipeline to China, which is anticipated to
become operational in 2017, and the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline set to
enter into operation starting 2018. It is projected that these two large projects will increase
Turkmenistan’s natural gas export and triple current extraction capacity to 250 billion cubic meters by
2030.

9.      Structural imbalances, measured by the level of non-hydrocarbon fiscal and current
account deficits, have increased over time. The non-hydrocarbon primary fiscal deficit substantially
widened from 6 percent of GDP in 2007 to almost 45 percent in 2011 (Figure 3). Similarly, the overall
positive current account balance hides an expanding non-hydrocarbon current account deficit, which
reached 40 percent of GDP in 2012 (Figure 4). A simple fiscal rule requires saving one-third of
hydrocarbon revenues in the Foreign Exchange Reserve Fund (FERF). But the government needs to
enhance its institutional capacity to ensure efficiency and sustainability of public spending funded from
hydrocarbon revenues (see section on institutions to manage volatility).

Economic Structure
10.     The hydrocarbon sector has been a major source of growth and export earnings .
Throughout the last decade exports grew tenfold in dollar terms, helping the economy to expand by more
than 4 times in real terms between 2002 and 2012, with average annual growth of 11 percent. Both
growth and exports remained concentrated in the extractive sectors and were driven by a combination of
favorable external environment (high prices for hydrocarbons) and increasing extraction capacity. By the
end of 2013, the hydrocarbon sector contributed about 35 of GDP, nearly 90 percent of total exports,
increased its contribution to the foreign exchange earnings by 2.6 times and ensured 85 percent of budget
revenues, while providing employment to about 2 percent of the labor force.

11.     Hydrocarbons and construction have come to dominate the Turkmen economy, while
services account for only one quarter of value added. Between 2004 and 2013 the Turkmen economy
expanded threefold owing to the strong contribution of industry and construction. As a result, the sectoral
structure of the economy has substantially changed, leading to a reallocation of resources from agriculture
and services to industry and construction. The latter became the most dynamic sector, expanding its share
in the total economy from 6 percent in 2007 to about 17 percent in 2013. Together, construction and
industry accounted for about two thirds of the Turkmen economy in 2013, up from 44 percent in 2007.
Meanwhile the contribution of agriculture and services declined by half and 30 percent, respectively. The
observed industrialization of the economy from 38 percent in 2007 to nearly 50 percent in 2013 was
driven by the doubling of natural gas extraction during the same period. In total, hydrocarbons secured 80
percent of total industrial production in 2013 compared with 52 percent in 2007. The extractive sector’s
dominance was accompanied by the diminishing importance of food and light industries from a 42
percent share in industrial output in 2007 down to 15 percent in 2013.

12.      Almost half of employment is in agriculture, with the expanding sectors contributing little
to job creation. Despite the notable structural change in the sectoral composition of the economy over
the last decade, the sectoral structure of employment remained almost unchanged. Almost half of
employment is in the primary sector, about nine percent in manufacturing and less than two percent in
extractive industries. Services sectors are still under-represented and are likely to be the main source of
new job creation in the years ahead.

13.      The number of privately owned enterprises and individual entrepreneurs has increased
significantly in recent years. Recent government policies have led to an increase in the number of legal
entities registered in Turkmenistan, from 19,268 in 2011 to 19,792 in 2012, with construction and
manufacturing showing more dynamism in new firm creation. The total number of employed in
individual entrepreneurship has increased by 14 percent in 2010-2011. Employment in manufacturing has
slightly declined whereas it has been rising in other sectors. Most of the employed among 78,517 people
in individual entrepreneurship are engaged in the trade and transport/communications sectors (Figure 8).

Foreign Trade
14.     Turkmenistan is one of the most open economies in Central Asia, mainly because of exports.
Exports have grown over 24 percent per annum over the last decade, with even faster growth (26 percent
CAGR) since 2006; while imports grew at a 22 percent CAGR over the decade and 24 percent CAGR
since 2006. As a result, the trade turnover increased by 2.6 times between 2007 and 2013, of which
exports by 2.1 and imports by 3.6 times. Turkmenistan has run a strong trade surplus, rising steadily
through the early 2000s to reach a peak of 38 percent of GDP in 2006 – it stood at 29 percent in 2012.
The export share of GDP (48 percent in 2013) and trade share of GDP (90 percent) are among highest in
the region. This is driven mainly by a high export share of GDP – Turkmenistan’s import share of GDP
(41 percent in 2013) has actually declined significantly from its levels in the late 1990s and early 2000s.1

15.     The export base is highly concentrated and dominated by hydrocarbons. Turkmenistan’s
exports are the most concentrated of any country in the region, with more than 90 percent of exports in
2012 in oil and gas (Figure 9). This ratio has held broadly steady over the decade, with the only
exceptions of 2009 and 2010. According to the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, the concentration of
Turkmenistan’s exports has declined somewhat from previous years. Looking only at non-mineral
exports, Turkmenistan remains relatively concentrated although it has increased the diversity of the non-
mineral export basket – mostly cotton - and is now more diversified than Tajikistan, Chile, and Laos.
Furthermore, Turkmenistan has one of the narrowest set of products. There are a few emerging products
in the chemical industry, such as polypropylene, technical iodine sulfur and sulfuric acid, which have

also contributed to the country’s export basket since 2009-12. Nevertheless in 2012, Turkmenistan
exported only 132 HS 6-digit products (of a total potential of more than 5,000), with relatively little
growth over the decade (only 20 more products were introduced).

16.      Market reach is also relatively limited, with exporters selling to 50 markets in 2011, the
same number as in 2000-01. The number of destination markets is very limited both for all products and
for non-minerals (Figure 10 and Table 2). Markets have shifted from Ukraine to China and Turkey (for
natural gas and oil) and from the US and the EU to Turkey for non-minerals (mainly cotton). Non-
minerals exports are almost equally concentrated in the top 10 markets (the top 10 share has grown from
61.7 percent to 88.4 percent over the decade). The most important export market for non-minerals is
Turkey, which has grown substantially in share over the decade; with Russia second most important (18.8
percent, an increase from earlier in the decade). Non-minerals exports to the EU fell sharply as a share of
the total over the decade; a similar pattern holds with the US, which accounted for 12 percent of non-
minerals exports at the beginning of the decade.

17.      China is by far the most important export market, followed by Turkey and Russia, with
exports mostly concentrated in natural gas. Between 2007 and 2012 Turkmenistan’s trade turnover
with China has increased by almost 20 times, dominated by natural gas exports to China. Exports are also
significant to Turkey and Russia, but in these markets Turkmenistan runs a large trade deficit with
imports amounting to four times exports. Exports (and imports) are very limited with India and Pakistan.

18.     Growth of non-mineral exports to China has been significant (23 percent per annum) but total
exports as of 2011 were only US$40m. Almost 100 percent of exports to China are in minerals, while
imports are more diversified. New export items, such as downstream petroleum products, polypropylene,
and licorice root extract, as well as leather, wool and cotton yarn emerged in recent years. Exports of
technical iodine and sulfur started in 2012. The structure of imports from China is diverse and consists of
industrial goods, vehicles, furniture, clothes, shoes and fabrics. Tea is a prevalent import item in the food
category. Outside natural gas, no single product accounts for more than US$20m in exports. Vegetables
and cotton, along with some chemicals account for virtually all other exports.

19.     Turkmenistan’s exports to Russia are its most diversified. They include plastics, textiles and
minerals, among other smaller exports. Plastics in particular have grown strongly over the decade.
Imports are also highly diversified, with the largest volumes in metals, machinery, and transport, but also
substantial wood, vegetables, food, and chemicals. A number of new exports to Russia have emerged in
Turkmenistan’s export basket, but most of these are extremely small scale. The significant exports remain
oil and petroleum products, lint cotton, cotton yarn, terry fabrics, bed sheets, textiles, wool, vegetables,
grapes, melons, water melons, licorice root extract, polypropylene (the latter did not exist in the export
basket a decade ago).

20.     Exports to Turkey are highly concentrated in textiles and minerals with virtually nothing
outside these categories. The most important exports to Turkey have remained broadly the same over the
decade – mainly textiles, cotton and woven fabrics, along with some petroleum products, though there is a
tendency of exporting new products such as polypropylene, unprocessed skins of large and small
ruminants and bed sheets. Imports are much more diversified, with substantial volumes across almost all
categories. Metals and machinery, in particular, have grown in importance over the decade.

21.     Turkmenistan has low levels of regional trade with major fluctuations of export partners in
recent years - away from Kazakhstan and toward Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Exports to the region
have grown 11 percent per annum (in nominal US$ terms) over the decade, but more than 30 percent per
annum since 2005. Imports have grown 40 percent per annum over this period. Non-minerals trade with
the region has grown even faster than minerals trade but remains at an extremely low level. Turkmenistan
runs a significant trade deficit in the region for non-minerals. Although compared with 2007 the trade
turnover in 2012 with Kazakhstan grew by 3.2 times, with Uzbekistan by 7.9 times, with Tajikistan by
3.8 times and with Kirgyzstan - by 12 percent, regional exports amounted to only US$276m in 2010, or
only 1.6 percent of total exports. Similarly regional imports (US$185m in 2010) accounted for just 1.8

                                                            20
percent of total imports. Exports to Kazakhstan in recent years have collapsed with only minor volumes
(less than US$3m each) in minerals, plastics, and transport. The reported structure of exports to
Kazakhstan has been stable and consisted of vegetables, fruits, and gourds, oil and petroleum products,
polypropylene, cement, bed sheets, and textiles, while imports collapsed as Turkmenistan substituted the
wheat flower import from Kazakhstan by its domestic production. Trade with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan
has been growing rapidly with the majority of exports in non-minerals products (minerals exports ranged
from less than 15 percent of the total regional exports to a high of 26 percent in 2009). Trade with
Uzbekistan might be expanded by the enforcement of a free trade agreement which is currently under
discussion between the two governments. Export to Tajikistan includes oil, petroleum products, bitumen,
vegetable oil, and, since 2012, also wheat and wheat flour. Imports are dominated by vegetables, fruits
and aluminum and insulated wire.

22.      Turkmenistan’s exports have a low probability of survival, but with substantial variation by
export market. The probability of an export relationship surviving after 2 years is only 16 percent
(Figure 11). By year 5, it drops to 5 percent. The picture for non-mineral exports looks even worse, with
the two-year survival rate at 12 percent and the five-year rate at 4 percent. There are, however, variations
by export partner. Survival rates with Turkey are the highest (46 percent after two years), while survival
rates to South Asia are low (17 percent to India and 13 percent to Pakistan). Within the region, the
probability of export survival is highest with Uzbekistan (33 percent) and lowest with Kyrgyzstan (11
percent). Higher survival rates may be explained by integration in global value chains, where
relationships among export and import partners tend to be longer term. Turkmenistan may be integrated
across the cotton-textile-apparel value chain, particularly with Russia and Turkey, where two-way trade
exists across most stages. Trade has grown strongly in the fabric and yarn stage of the value chain (as well
as cotton).

Turkmenistan’s Asset Portfolio
23.      Assets can be classified into three categories: natural resources, built capital, and national
institutions. Natural resources—in the form of minerals, arable land, and forests—are largely endowed,
but technological progress and better management can radically alter their economic value. Built capital
consists of both physical and human capital, in the form of adequate infrastructure and a healthy and
skilled labor force. This again can be measured for any country, though with more difficulty and less
precision than natural resources. Finally, the most poorly measured and possibly the most important asset
a country has are national institutions—the regulations and mechanisms that a country has put in place to
manage resource rents, deliver public services such as roads, security, health care, and education.

24.      A country’s asset base determines success or failure in the long run. Based on the last two
decades of experience in Eurasia, and more than two centuries in other parts of the world, governments
can create the conditions for building a balanced portfolio of national assets—natural resources, built
capital, and institutions. The United States and the United Kingdom increased their per capita incomes
tenfold since 1870, and have diversified exports. Australia and Canada’s economies have also grown as
quickly, but their exports remain specialized. Through import substitution and industrial policies,
Argentina and Brazil have diversified more, but have struggled to sustain economic growth. In 1910
Canada and Argentina’s per capita incomes were about 80 percent of U.S. levels. By 2010 Canada’s per
capita income was 85 percent that of the United States; Argentina’s had fallen to 35 percent. Brazil’s
GDP has stagnated at about 20 percent relative to the United States for more than a century (Gill et al.,
2014). These experiences, together with the more recent success of countries like Chile, Korea or Finland,
show that a balanced asset base is the critical factor of success in the long run.

25.      Turkmenistan’s asset portfolio is weighed toward “hard” endowments. Turkmenistan is
richly endowed with natural resources, especially hydrocarbon wealth. In Turkmenistan, natural wealth
accounts for the bulk of total wealth per capita, which also includes produced capital and intangibles as
defined in World Bank (2011). Wealth in middle-income countries as a group was almost US$75,000-and
less than a fifth was natural resources. In high-income economies, measured wealth in 2005 was close to
US$700,000 per capita, with natural resources a negligible fraction. In resource-rich Australia, Canada,
Norway, and New Zealand, natural capital is 8-13 percent of overall wealth.

26.      In order to sustain growth and increase the likelihood of success of the Government’s active
diversification policies, the asset portfolio needs to be balanced toward the “softer” assets that are
essential ingredients of long run success. In recent years, thanks to massive investment in physical
infrastructure, Turkmenistan has built sizeable physical assets. Large-scale public investment programs
are primarily targeted to enhance the country’s physical capital. Investments in human capital and
institutional upgrading remain relatively low priorities. Investments into physical assets and infrastructure
of the social sector prevail over public spending aimed at improving the quality of the labor force and the
development of skills demanded by emerging sectors of the economy. Policies need to be put in place to
improve the quantity and, more importantly the quality of education. At the same time, rules to manage
resource rents, provide public services, and ensure a level playing field for entrepreneurs and innovators
need to be made more robust.

Natural Resources
27.     Natural capital, similarly to physical capital, is the present discounted value of the profit
stream that such resources can generate far into the future. Countries with similar initial quantities of
land or subsoil assets may thus have different levels of estimated natural capital if they differ in how

                                                     22
productively they use their land or in how effectively they exploit their subsoil assets. The period over
which resources generate profit depends on whether they are renewable or exhaustible. Reserves of
subsoil assets such as oil, natural gas, and minerals are typically nonrenewable and exhaustible, whereas
land, forests, and rivers can potentially last forever if managed well. The Changing Wealth of Nations
(World Bank 2011) develops and applies a methodology that captures these dimensions, to compute
comparable estimates of total natural capital or natural wealth for 150 countries for 2005 and in 2005 U.S.
dollars. Each country’s estimated total natural capital is then divided by its 2005 population to estimate
per capita natural capital and its major components (subsoil capital and land capital) to permit
comparisons across countries, regions, and income groups.

28.      Turkmenistan has the highest level of natural resources per capita in the CIS. Turkmenistan
ranks 12th in the world in natural capital per capita, ahead of Russia and Kazakhstan. It ranks even higher
(10th) based on subsoil capital per capita (Figure 12). Natural capital per capita rose in Turkmenistan over
2000–10, driven by a combination of growth in the production of natural gas, the expansion in reserves,
and, most importantly, higher world prices (Table 3). Subsoil capital now accounts for more than 90
percent of natural capital (Table 4). At present, after Russia, Iran and Qatar Turkmenistan has the fourth
largest natural gas reserves in the world with an estimated 250-270 years of extraction horizon and owns
the world's second-largest single deposit (Galkynish), which started operation in 2013. Turkmenistan
could have high potential for discovering additional reserves of both oil and gas, if more risk capital and
better technology can be deployed for more intensive exploration in more difficult terrain (IEA 2011).

29.      In addition to being resource abundant, Turkmenistan is heavily dependent on its natural
resources. Extractives account for almost half of GDP, over 90 percent of total exports and 47 percent of
fiscal revenue, much more than in resource-rich OECD countries (Figure 13).This dependence may result
in excessive volatility of export receipts and government revenue, adding to overall economic volatility,
hurting savings, investment, and economic output, straining government finances, and increasing
uncertainty for households and firms.

30.      Turkmenistan needs to become more efficient in converting its natural resource revenues
into built capital. Annual data for Turkmenistan are not available, but information for a few years shows
a significantly negative adjusted net savings (ANS), lower than negative 50 percent (see Box 1).
Turkmenistan should increase its GNS steeply to get close to a zero ANS and avoid continuing reductions
in total economic endowments. One reason is high energy subsidies. In 2011 these subsidies in
Turkmenistan amounted to 31 percent of GDP. Another reason, based on the experience of other
countries, is that while ever bigger amounts are being saved in stabilization funds, a sizable fraction is
likely to be invested abroad in long-term funds to transfer wealth to future generations, mainly through
foreign investments. While this helps keep currencies from appreciating too much, it does not build
capital at home. The central issue for governments is to secure a reasonably large share of resource rents
as revenue while providing reasonable incentives to private firms to continue investing.

                                             Box 1: Adjusted Net Savings

High national savings typically finance high investment in a sustained manner. Whether total GNS are adequate
depends on whether they exceed the depreciation of physical capital and the depletion of nonrenewable resources.
Only in such a case does investment from these savings avoid a reduction in total economic endowment of natural,
human, and physical capital. This is the concept of adjusted net savings (ANS). When ANS is zero, the total
endowment can potentially be kept unchanged provided all such savings are invested in the domestic economy;
when ANS is negative, the total endowment is likely to fall; when ANS is positive, the total endowment can
potentially grow if all savings are invested. Total savings thus make possible any changes in total endowment, but
this is not an either/ or scenario. How much of the savings is invested determines the impact on endowment. Some
countries have negative ANS, and countries with higher resource rents relative to gross national income (GNI) have
more negative ANS.

Resource-rich countries save more than others but at a declining rate, suggesting that the greater the abundance the
more difficult it is to increase savings (Atkinson and Hamilton 2003). The resource mismanagement is manifested in
government consumption and public wages in particular. The same study finds that countries with high-quality

                                                        25
institutions transform resource-wealth into additional savings more easily than others. These patterns are consistent
with the evidence elsewhere. Eurasian countries face some of the same public spending pressures as other resource-
rich countries. First, greater resource revenue can create a deficit bias and reduce public savings. Second, these
spending pressures show themselves through, for example, energy subsidies, unproductive public sector jobs, and
higher public sector wages. Most energy subsidies are not only inefficient but also regressive in countries where the
poor do not own a car or use much electricity, public sector employment has climbed, and public salaries have risen
faster than inflation (in most of these countries). Third, pay increases for government employees given during a
boom are almost impossible to reverse. More generally, spending that leads to increases in consumption is hard to
reverse, because habits are formed and political resistance is high. By contrast, fluctuations in investment are easier
to manage. Fourth, international capital markets turn suddenly generous when countries become newly resource-rich
and when resource prices are high, often resulting in excessive external borrowing for consumption or investments
with low return (Mansoorian 1991; Manzano and Rigobon 2007).

There is no easy way to counter these spending pressures, but three options may be considered. First, governments
should increase the transparency for all revenue collection and all public spending and make spending agencies
accountable to parliament and the public. Second, they should establish a centralized system of financial control and
authority, backed up by a strong public financial management system, including an information system that provides
real-time information on spending. Third, they should adopt countercyclical fiscal policies, supported by a short-
term stabilization fund.

       Spotlight 1 – Converting resource rents into revenues: international experience

Governments must seek to maximize the net present value of fiscal revenue from resources so that they
can use it for the benefit of their citizens. Eurasian countries —as countries elsewhere—use a mix of tax
instruments to affect the size and timing of revenue flows from resources. Bonus payments on signature,
discovery, and production (single or staged lump-sum payments) advance the timing of revenue flows.
Sliding-scale royalties on gross revenue are often a part of fiscal systems in resource-endowed countries
because they secure early revenue, though they may not be very responsive to profitability. Corporate
income tax is typically a core component of such arrangements because it ensures that the normal return
to equity is taxed at company level. In addition, a tax instrument like the “Brown Tax” is based on a base
of net cash flow and tries to target resource rents. The combination of instruments used, rates, and
administration determine how much of the resource rents are converted into resource revenue. The larger
the share of resource rents extracted by the government without undermining buoyant private investment
in resources, the more efficient the conversion usually is. The share of the tax take in total rents is a
measure of that efficiency, though combining it with an assessment of the efficiency of the resource tax
regime is also important.

The tax take of three oil exporters in Eurasia (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation) is far
lower than in most comparators in the Middle East. Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, which depended heavily
on FDI for exploration and extraction, may have offered a larger share to investors for at least two
reasons. First, they were relatively new independent countries and thus required to pay a higher risk-
premium to investors than Middle Eastern countries with a longer hydrocarbons track record for FDI.
Second, contracts and oil fields in Eurasia are quite new, with most of the oil produced in the early years
going toward the investors’ cost rather than profit under the PSAs, making the potential base for
extracting revenue smaller than the total rents generated. Part of the rent probably dissipated in two other
ways. The State-owned resource companies needed some of the rent to finance their operating costs,
which may have been higher than elsewhere because of various inefficiencies. Also, State-owned
resource companies were selling energy at subsidized prices.

Physical Capital
31.      Turkmenistan has been building physical assets at a very fast pace, driven by public
investment in the extractive industry. Besides being one of the fastest growing economies,
Turkmenistan’s investment rates in the last 5 years, at about 47-48 percent of GDP, have been among the
highest in the world. Proceeds from hydrocarbon exports facilitated large-scale, especially public
investments in physical infrastructure. The sources of funding have been mainly public, accompanied by
one of the highest shares of foreign investment in the economy, largely in extractive sectors (Figure 14).
Total investment in 2012 amounted to 48.4 billion Manats (17 billion US$), of which 77.6 percent from
public sources, 15.6 percent from foreign sources and only 6.8 percent from private investors.
Investments in physical capital have been increasing at a much faster pace than those directed to social
sectors (Figure 15). In 2012, investments in health and education amounted to only 2.9 and 3.1 percent,
respectively, of total investment. Industry, mainly hydrocarbons, is the largest recipient of public (46.1
percent of the total in 2012) and foreign funding (85.2 percent of the total in 2012). The majority of
private investment (37.3 percent of the total in 2012) has been directed to transport, while agriculture, and
trade and services received 11.7 and 11.9 percent of total investment (Figures 16).

32.       Investments in transport infrastructure need to be complemented by the development of
services to facilitate trade. Expansion of the domestic and regional transport network is a cornerstone of
the diversification agenda. The current transport and communication network is designed mostly to serve
the demand of the extractive sector though the government approved large infrastructure projects aimed at
facilitating increased volume of tourism, trade and transit flows. The 13,000 Km North-South and East-
West highway is under construction to improve connectivity within the country. The North-South and
East-West railroads are under construction. The Turkmen government set an ambitious objective to make
the country an intensive transnational transit corridor, including the Black Sea and Caspian Sea
connection, Middle-East - Iran and CIS route through a new railroad connecting Iran with Kazakhstan
through Turkmenistan. Improvement works are currently underway on the interstate highways connecting
Turkmenbashi with Ashgabat, Mary, Turkmenabat and Farab, as well as on the Ashgabat – Dashoguz
direction, which will facilitate increased traffic of transit cargo through Turkmenistan. The total length of
highways under reconstruction and construction is 1.700 km. In order for the government’s objectives to

                                                                      28
be achieved, investments in infrastructure projects will need to be complemented by policies to develop
logistics and trade facilitation services.

33.      Penetration of ICT is at very low levels and this may hamper business growth going
forward. Telecom penetration in Turkmenistan is at extremely low levels, as shown by the fact that in
2012 there were only 7 internet connections per 100 people and only 3 fixed broadband internet
subscribers per 10,000 people, very far from more advanced countries, including in the Eurasian region
(Figure 17).2 Although mobile connections are increasingly common, they are typically underused for
data services, largely because of limited broadband availability and high prices. Inadequate ICT
infrastructure will become an increasingly binding constraint for the development of a competitive
business sector, since ICT is crucial for efficient communication with customers, suppliers and
government authorities and is an especially crucial component of trade in business services, notably
business process outsourcing. ICT makes it possible for companies and households to bridge distance and
division, leapfrogging challenges in physical infrastructure.

  According to official sources, ICT penetration has dramatically increased since 2012. By 2014 the number of Internet users is
reported to have increased to 21 connections per 100 people due to reduction of user charges, improvement of provided services
and opening of alternative access points (internet cafes). The number of broadband LTE and 3G users has also increased. 15
people per 10,000 inhabitants are subscribers of fixed broadband internet lines. Since December 2012, internet penetration in
Turkmenistan has increased also due to the provision of fixed broadband internet services to public and private enterprises,
universities and secondary educational institutions.

                              Spotlight 2 – Physical capital in Eurasia

The Eurasian countries began the transition with a quantity of physical capital in line with the Soviet
Union’s level of development and its status as a superpower. Eurasia’s high investment in physical
infrastructure in the 1970s and early 1980s fell sharply with the advent of perestroika in the mid-1980s
and the transition’s early years. But infrastructure was allocated inefficiently across a vast territory, and
other physical capital was spread less than optimally across sectors under the command system. The
reasons are well known: the breakup of production arrangements within the Soviet Union and with the
countries of Eastern Europe, along with the much-reduced role of military buildup and the privatization of
State-owned enterprises.

Eurasia maintained investment at about 23 percent of GDP a year on average after the transition began,
far below the 28 percent that East Asia invested. Eurasia’s rate is lower than the 25 percent calculated as
the average that several fast-growing countries maintained for several decades. Meanwhile, inadequate
maintenance and repairs of the extensive transport networks that Eurasia inherited from the Soviet Union
led to steep drops in infrastructure quality. Infrastructure established in cold climates proved too
expensive to maintain and was allowed to degrade. Communal infrastructure similarly suffered, as
artificially low prices and heavy State subsidies led to persistent underinvestment and less-frequent
maintenance. Infrastructure, which did not figure much as an obstacle for doing business in the 1990s, is
now one of the greatest obstacles for most countries.

Recent World Bank studies that use the perpetual inventory method with a fixed depreciation suggest that
Eurasia’s stock of produced capital—machinery, equipment, and urban land—was in line with its per
capita GDP in the mid-2000s. Per capita physical capital was substantially lower in the mid-2000s than at
the start of the transition. The quantity of physical capital would be even lower if the inefficiencies in
public investment are taken into account. Recent estimates correcting for the efficiency of investment
indeed suggest that Eurasia’s capital stock is much lower than investment numbers imply. One study
constructs a new public capital series that explicitly takes into account the efficiency of public investment
by using the Public Investment Management Index. While efficiency-adjusted capital stocks throughout
the world are lower than stocks estimated from cumulative investment, Eurasia stands out. In Eurasia, the
stock of public capital is less than half of what cumulative investment spending suggests, due to the poor
quality of investment itself.

Human Capital
34.      Human capital is a vital asset for economic growth and to discover and exploit
opportunities in all sectors of the economy. It is the ultimate source of innovation and productivity and
one of the key mechanisms for transferring wealth across generations. Its pace of growth depends on the
quantity and quality of education (in the classroom and on-the-job training), on the quality of health care,
and on the broader social environment. Education and training institutions play a key role in enhancing
the productivity of capital by supplying well-trained graduates and developing innovative ideas that
improve existing technologies. Workers whose skills are aligned more closely with the demands of firms
are typically more productive and contribute more to the country’s economic growth. In addition, they
tend to command higher wages and enjoy lower levels of unemployment. By contrast, workers whose
skills are misaligned with employers’ needs are likely to be unemployed, underempl oyed, or paid less
than others.

                                                     30
35.      The quality of Turkmenistan’s human capital, its health and education, lags behind most
comparators. The Human Development Index (HDI), a composite statistic of life expectancy, education,
and income, shows that, despite the spectacular increase in income per capita experienced in recent years,
improvements of health and education outcomes should be a key priority of public policy (Table 5). The
people of Turkmenistan have lower life expectancy than most neighbors, let alone the populations of
more developed resource rich countries around the world. At 9.9 years, average years of schooling are
quite high for Turkmenistan’s income level, a legacy of the Soviet system of universal education.
Although there are no comparable data, such as the OECD PISA assessments, the quality of education, its
alignment to the present and future needs of the economy, may be an issue. The Turkmen authorities
prioritized the education sector by making important policy decisions, such as the adoption in March,
2013 of the Turkmenistan President’s Decree on the “Improvement of the Education System in
Turkmenistan” and a President’s Resolution approving the “Concept of Transition to 12 -year General
Secondary Education in Turkmenistan”. These changes are enshrined in a new Education law, adopted on
May 4, 2013, and effective from the 2013-14 academic year.

36.     Investment in human capital is crucial in light of the sharp increase in the working age
population that will occur in the next two decades. Current employment rates of 55 percent and a labor
force participation rate of 61 percent for the 15-64 year old population are low by international standards.
Improvements in the quality of the labor force will become even more pressing going forward. With the
working age population projected to increase by one-third in 2030 investment in human capital is critical
to allow the next generation of Turkmen citizens to find jobs (Arias et al., 2014 and Figure 18) . Together

with reforms aimed at increasing labor demand, such as improvements in the business climate and
investment in physical infrastructure, the quality and employability of labor will crucially depend on
policy choices and investments aimed at improving education and health. There are three key growth-
enhancing effects of human capital. First, it contributes to economic efficiency. Second, it provides the
labor resources on which growth depends. Third, it can reduce social inequalities and, potentially, make
growth more sustainable.

37.      Science and technology policy could further improve the contribution of human capital to
economic growth and diversification. The recent adoption, in March 2014, of the Law of Turkmenistan
on the State Policy of Science and Technology could contribute, among others, to the development of an
innovative economy, support innovation in education, as well as to promote private participation in
scientific activities. The State, through the Cabinet of Ministers, will be the main executor of science and
technology policies and projects, but little is said on the links to education and entrepreneurship.

38.      Public expenditure in health and education is quite low by international standards. Most
governments around the world spend about 5-10 percent of GDP on health and education. Countries that
spend more public resources tend to achieve better health and education outcomes. This positive
relationship holds even when adjusting for the effects of GDP per capita. Turkmenistan spends around 5-6
percent of GDP on social sectors, of which 3-4 percent on education, 1 percent on healthcare and 1
percent on social protection (Table 6). The number of schools has remained quite stable despite the fact
that the number of pupils has increased at all levels. For instance, there were 891 pre-school
establishments with 123,300 children in attendance in 2000, while in 2012 there were 871 establishments
and 190,200 children. The reduction of establishments took place in rural areas, but the number of
children there increased. Despite the declining number of education institutions, 166 new pre-school
institutions with 25,035 pupil capacity and 134 new schools with 60,964 pupil capacity have become
operational since 2008. Also, some of the new establishments offer larger spaces and allow for economies
of scale. The number of secondary schools decreased from 1,922 in 2000 to 1,741 in 2012, as did the
number of pupils, from 1,017,100 to 900,400 in the same period. The number of secondary professional
schools and higher education schools increased somewhat in the same period, but so did the number of
students, by almost the double in some cases (State Committee for Statistics, 2013).

                                  Spotlight 3 – Education in Eurasia

In Eurasian countries, persistently high and rising education attainment rates—education quantity— are
not accompanied by high-quality education outcomes. Resource-rich or resource-poor, the countries of
Eurasia outside Russia have functional literacy rates detrimental to long-term development. Poor
education quality translates into inadequate skills, and firms are increasingly concerned about the skills of
job seekers. Exacerbating the low education quality and perceived skills mismatches are low health
indicators that, despite some recent improvements, remain little changed from their level four decades
ago. Starting with an already high level in the late 1980s, most resource-rich countries further increased
the average number of years of schooling. Russia stands out for better education attainment —quantity of
schooling—at all levels but more strikingly at the tertiary level.

A large share of Eurasian secondary students completes vocational education programs. One of the Soviet
legacies is a large number of vocational schools originally designed to supply trained workers to State-
owned enterprises (Sondergaard and Murthi 2012). This produces narrow labor market skill sets, which
limit a worker’s ability to adapt to fast-changing labor market conditions and production technologies.
Learning increasingly takes place after completion of secondary or tertiary education —whether during
job searches, on the job, or as part of job-related formal training. In the United States, it is estimated that
on-the-job training contributes around a fourth to a half of all human capital (Heckman, Lochner, and
Taber 1998). Studies on countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) demonstrate that adult education and training sharply lift worker productivity. OECD (2004)
shows that employee training affects wage growth of young or highly educated employees and that
training employees allows them to attain and maintain the competencies required to bring productivity in
line with market wages of older and low-educated workers.

Few Eurasian firms offer formal training programs to full-time employees, despite international evidence
about the importance of post-formal education. While almost 70 percent of Czech firms and 60 percent of
Polish firms offer formal training to their full-time employees, only about 45 percent of firms in Russia
and Kazakhstan do. In Azerbaijan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic, less than 20 percent of firms do.
Companies are voicing strong concerns that Eurasia’s low-quality human capital is increasingly an
obstacle to doing business. The Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey reveals that 36
percent of Eurasian firms consider worker education and skills a “major” or “very severe” constraint to
firm growth in Eurasia. About half of surveyed firms in Kazakhstan and Russia identify inadequate
education and skills as a major constraint to firm growth. Not surprisingly, innovating firms are even
more concerned about the skills constraints. Management plays a key role in determining the success or
failure of a firm. Bloom and Van Reenen (2007) show that management practices correlate strongly with
labor productivity, sales growth, and return on capital employed. The authors collected management
practice data from 732 medium-size firms in France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United
States and found that measures of managerial practice correlated strongly with firm-level productivity,
profitability, and survival rates.

                   Spotlight 4 - Investing in human capital: the case of Korea

In Korea, developing human capital has been key in the economic performance of the country. Education
played a key role in Korea’s transformation from one of the poorest countries in the world to a leading
industrial nation by promoting the development of human resources and technological change.

Innovation and human resources development have been at the core of the policies of the Government of
Korea and all national economic programs in the last few decades. Total spending on education – public
and private – as a share of GDP in Korea, at 8.0 percent in 2009, is the second highest in the OECD, even
before taking account of outlays for private after-school instruction. Moreover, the increase in spending –
from 6.1 percent of GDP in 2000 – was the largest in the OECD area. Education spending rose from 16
percent of government expenditures in 2000 to 20 percent in 2008. Nevertheless, the private sector plays a
large role, accounting for 40 percent of education spending, the second highest in the OECD area,
reflecting its large share at the pre-primary and tertiary levels. Expenditure per student relative to GDP
per capita in Korea was slightly above the OECD average in 2008 before including outlays for private,
after-school instruction.

According to the OECD (2013), the annual public expenditure per student in Korea is below the OECD
average. On average, Korea spent in 2010 US$ 8 198 per student from primary to tertiary education,
against the US$ 9 313 of OECD countries. However, expenditure per student increased significantly
between 2005 and 2010: for all levels of education, expenditure increased by 39 percent, more than
doubling the average increase across OECD countries for levels below tertiary (17 percent) and more than
quadrupling the average increase for tertiary education (8 percent). At the tertiary level, Korea has made a
significant effort, increasing public expenditure on tertiary educational institutions by 104 percentage
points between 2000 and 2010 against an average increase of 35 percentage points for OECD countries.

The education system includes nine years of compulsory free education (six years in primary school,
followed by three years of middle school). Advancement rates approached 100 percent for middle school
by 1980 and for high school by 2000 making Korea one of the few countries in which graduation from
high school is almost universal. In 2011, 72.5 percent of high school graduates continued on to tertiary
education, although this was down from 84 percent in 2008.

Institutions
39.     Institutions are a fundamental asset for long run economic development and are
particularly important in resource abundant countries. They comprise the rules and norms of
behavior by which economies and societies operate, shaping the incentives of governments, individuals
and firms. In resource abundant economies, institutions are what makes the difference between success
and failure in the long run. Building a sound institutional framework will ensure that natural assets are
exploited responsibly and productively and that governments, individuals and firms have an incentive to
invest in physical and human assets. Stronger institutions will enhance the economy’s growth potential
and the ability to develop a comparative advantage in non-extractive sectors.

40.     Three government functions are essential: (i) the package of fiscal, monetary and exchange
rate policies that allow managing the volatility deriving from a concentrated export basket; (ii) the
capacity of the public administration to effectively deliver public services, such as health, education and

                                                    35
infrastructure; (iii) and the ability to effectively regulate private enterprise guaranteeing a competitive
environment across all sectors, where the most efficient firms can emerge and prosper, increasing overall
productivity and generating sustainable employment. These institutions are especially necessary for
countries that have to manage sizable resource rents, where weaknesses in accountability and corruption
can become sources of instability (Gill et al., 2014).

41.     Turkmenistan has made limited progress in building the institutions for a market economy .
Inconsistent enforcement of laws and regulations are typical symptoms of weak governance, and
Turkmenistan is far behind comparator countries in all elements of governance and transparency. The
World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) indicate that rule of law, corruption, regulatory
quality and accountability remain problematic, ultimately undermining the effectiveness of government
policy (Table 7). Although private ownership is enshrined in legislation, these weaknesses may translate
into a major deterrent for firms to invest and innovate, including by constraining financial development.

42.      Turkmenistan has a vertically centralized governance structure. A strong presidential system
results in top-down decision-making that characterizes the way the public administration operates. Most
decisions are taken at the highest political level and implementation falls into the different Ministries and
various agencies, with limited public participation. Turkmenistan is a civil law jurisdiction in which the




                                                       36
laws are hierarchically organized, being the Constitution of Turkmenistan the Supreme Law of the
State. The hierarchy of laws is as follows:3

           In terms of primary regulations:

            a.    The Constitution of Turkmenistan was approved on 18 May 1992 and amended in 1995,
                  1999, 2003 and 2008. Norms and provisions secured in the Constitution have direct effect.

            b.    Constitutional laws, which either amend and modify the Constitution or are established by
                  the Constitution, such as laws regarding independence, fundamental principles of State
                  organization, or on the permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan.

            c.    Codes. Currently, laws in Turkmenistan are in the process of being codified.

            d.    Ordinary laws, which constitute the bulk of regulation in Turkmenistan. Having a legacy
                  from the Soviet legal system, economic activity is heavily regulated.

            In addition to a number of subordinate or secondary regulation:

            e.    Decrees and acts of the President, Resolutions of the Mejlis (Parliament).

            f.    Resolutions and orders of the Cabinet of Ministers.

            g.    Normative acts of the organs of State power and government.

            h.    Resolutions of the hyakims (regional governors).

            i.    Decisions of local meetings (gengeshi).

43.      Executive power is with the President, the Cabinet of Ministers, Ministries and local
government. The President enacts Constitutional and other laws, and issues decrees, resolutions, and
orders, which have mandatory force throughout the country. The Cabinet of Ministers is an executive and
management body. The President chairs the Cabinet of Ministers. According to Article 75 of the
Constitution, the highest-level executive authority is the Cabinet of Ministers, chosen and headed by the
President. The Cabinet consists of the deputies of the Chairman of Ministries and the ministries. Among
others, the Cabinet of Ministers is empowered to organize the enforcement of the laws of Turkmenistan,
the legal acts of the President of Turkmenistan, and of the Mejlis of Turkmenistan; to develop proposals
regarding key areas of internal and external policies of the State, as well as programs for the country’s
economic and social development, which are then submitted to the Mejlis for review and to ensure State
management of economic and social development, organize management of State enterprises,
organizations and institutions, and secure rational use and protection of natural resources.

Policy Coordination and Regulatory Quality

44.     In Turkmenistan as elsewhere, accountability, transparency and clear responsibilities of
functions are essential to ensure policy coherence and coordination. The role of the center of the
government is essential to promote such coherence and coordination. Its function is to lead and steer the
implementation of the national vision-based strategy and its policy and programming initiatives
effectively, efficiently and coherently across the central administration and with sub-national authorities,
as well as mobilize non-governmental actors from across society in support of the government’s vision.

                 Spotlight 5 - Policy coordination: Finland, Estonia and Poland

Finland has a strong track record in responding to difficult economic situations. The public administration
has been critical to this success; both in supporting Finland’s remarkable transformation from an economy
specialized in traditional industries to a diversified and modern economy, and in helping the country
navigate the Nordic economic crisis of the early 1990s. As a result, the Finnish citizenry today trusts the
public administration as a key partner for economic development and service delivery, as well as the
mechanism to realize many Finnish values of social solidarity and equality. Finland is a leader in
identifying and placing high-level commitment behind horizontal, government-wide priorities. Since
1987, successive Finnish governments have focused on the modernization of government, with public
management reforms receiving strong political support. Within the State administration, reforms have
focused on increasing the productivity and efficiency of operations, and achieving greater coherence of
cross-sectoral policy issues. They included a program on performance management, ministry and agency
mergers, a Productivity Program, and e-government. Strong, independent ministries and agencies in the
State administration and autonomous municipalities characterize the structure of the Finnish public
administration. Finns traditionally trust the State level of government, but prefer that everyday functions
(such as the delivery of basic services) be located at the local level. The Nordic model followed by
Finland means that social benefits and public services are provided in a more comprehensive way than in
other OECD countries. The Nordic experience has proven that social protection and economic
development can work in tandem, in a mutually reinforcing way. High economic growth has been
combined with a reduction in poverty and income inequality, coupled with close to full employment. A
strong welfare State is compatible with strong economic growth. The Nordic countries have also shown
that social protection can play a crucial role in economic development.

Since the restoration of independence in 1991, and prior to the global financial and economic crisis,
Estonia enjoyed one of the most dynamic periods of economic growth among both transition and OECD
countries. Critical to this success was Estonia’s transformation from a centrally planned economy to a
liberal market economy. The stewardship of the government has resulted in budget surpluses, a
reasonable level of openness, and a high level of economic and political stability, an important factor for
investors. As a result, the Estonian government, supported by the public administration, was a key
orchestrator of economic development. Over the same 20-year period, Estonia has also developed,
practically from scratch, all the functions and apparatus of a modern State, including a legal code, a civil
service, and national and sub-national institutions that bear all the responsibilities and risks of
independent statehood. Estonia operates a fragmented and decentralized public administration. However,
as a small State, it is critical that the public administration work as one cohesive unit, rather than in
separated silos. Estonia’s public administration has shown its capacity for horizontal working at both the
political and administrative levels. However, this ability to come together collectively shines more in
times of crisis, or when a more immediate policy response is needed, than in “business -as-usual”
activities. Estonia has an impressive ability to establish working groups for a variety of activities
including pilot projects in the public administration, drafting policy reforms and legislation (e.g. the
Employment Contract Law), processes and systems (e.g., sustainable development indicators), sub-
national negotiations, and international initiatives. Often these are populated with a wide array of
appropriate stakeholders, providing a more structured way to tap into individual personal or professional
networks, both inside and outside of government. In addition, there also is solid co-operation and
collaboration at the technical or administrative level, often based on or reinforced by informal networks
and personal relationships. This is evidenced by the collaboration required for designing and
implementing pilot projects and integrated (cross-sectoral) policy initiatives (e.g. the program and accrual
budgeting initiative). But one reason that public administration reforms have not advanced in Estonia is
that senior public servants have not been able to articulate a coherent and unified message about the need
and direction for reform, and then communicate it to politicians. Given conflicting signals, politicians

                                                    39
have held off committing to public administration reforms. To gain support and buy-in at the political
level, the public administration’s senior leadership needs to communicate its own vision for reform.

In 1989, with the end of the communist regime, Poland undertook important reforms aimed at building a
democratic State and a functioning market economy, such as the privatization of public sector economic
activity, price liberalization, the reform of the banking system, administrative modernization and the
recasting of the social welfare system, including in education and healthcare. Coordination is still
evolving in Poland. The central government has made an important effort to consolidate and streamline
national planning, laying the ground for enhanced co-ordination. From over 400 politically driven single-
sector strategies at the beginning of the 2000s, the government has integrated its strategic direction within
a single long-term vision (“Poland 2030”), a National Development Strategy and nine medium-term
integrated strategies which address cross-cutting issues and form the basis for working across traditional
ministerial lines. However, most medium-term integrated strategies have yet to be approved, and the
center of the government structure still appears to be too siloed and neither integrated nor nimble enough
to address fast-moving policy challenges effectively. Uneven co-ordination between center of the
government institutions, and between these institutions and line ministries, hinders capacity to build
cross-sector synergies and coherence to maximize the impact of decisions on results for citizens and reap
fully the potential benefits of the new strategic framework. Intra- and inter-ministry co-ordination within
the national government tends to be sporadic and ineffective. In addition, evidence-based policy analysis
is not yet systematically informing important decision making by the government of Poland, and
evidence-based policy advice is not always sought by decision makers, perhaps due to a perception that it
takes too much time and effort to generate this evidence, or due to a lack of confidence in the quality of
the evidence once it is produced, or that once produced the evidence will be ignored. However, the civil
service as an institution has been enhanced significantly – the government now employs a relatively
diverse, well-educated workforce. Many centers of excellence exist across the government and Poland’s
National Civil Service School’s role in training civil servants is now recognized beyond the country’s
borders. For Poland, given the scope and scale of the reforms that are still required to implement
strategic-State capability, an incremental approach likely constitutes the most prudent and realistic way to
complete the reform implementation process.

45.       Turkmenistan does not have specific guidelines to ensure that procedures are duly followed
when designing and implementing regulations. Initial steps of an organized process of regulatory
management exist: technical government officials prepare draft laws and regulations in the respective
Ministry and then legal advisers review them in order to comply with consistency with other legal norms,
constitutionality and coherence. In the case of primary regulation, e.g. laws, drafts are sent to the Cabinet
of Ministers with an explanatory note providing the reasons and justification for intervention. The Cabinet
of Ministers, which oversees the various policy sectors, reviews draft laws and it might require further
changes and revisions in the draft from the respective Ministry, which has to prepare protocols in case of
amending regulations or new proposals. In the case of subordinate regulations, draft regulations are not
sent to Cabinet, but have to be registered by the Ministry of Justice, which also acts as a quality control
filter in legal terms. Laws are finally approved by the Mejlis and enacted by the President.

             Spotlight 6 - Regulatory management: Canada, France and Sweden

In Canada, the Cabinet Directive on Streamlining Regulation came into effect on April 2007. It replaced
the Government of Canada Regulatory Policy (1999), and introduced several key improvements,
including a more comprehensive management approach with specific requirements for the development,
implementation, evaluation, and review of regulations. The Directive establishes that when regulating, the
federal government will:

       Protect and advance the public interest in health, safety and security, the quality of the
        environment, and the social and economic well-being of Canadians, as expressed by Parliament
        in legislation;

       Promote a fair and competitive market economy that encourages entrepreneurship, investment,
        and innovation;

       Make decisions based on evidence and the best available knowledge and science in Canada and
        worldwide, while recognizing that the application of precaution may be necessary when there is
        an absence of full scientific certainty and a risk of serious or irreversible harm;

       Create accessible, understandable, and responsive regulation through inclusiveness, transparency,
        accountability, and public scrutiny;

       Advance the efficiency and effectiveness of regulation by ascertaining that the benefits of
        regulation justify the costs, by focusing human and financial resources where they can do the
        most good, and by demonstrating tangible results for Canadians; and

       Require timeliness, policy coherence, and minimal duplication throughout the regulatory process
        by consulting, co-ordinating, and co-operating across the federal government, with other
        governments in Canada and abroad, and with businesses and Canadians.

In France, the government´s programme of work (PGT), which details the main orientations of the
government, field by field, is set out every six months. This enables political will to be expressed and
priorities adapted by checking that government policies are consistent. It includes the list of draft
legislation that the government intends to submit to a vote in parliament, the list of draft ordinances and
decrees proposed for introduction into the agenda of the Council of Ministers’ meeting, and the li st of
matters that are to be subject of communication in the Council of Ministers (oral presentation by ministers
of their actions within a field under their responsibility). The programme of work is therefore an
instrument for organising legislative and regulatory activity, allowing forward planning and timely
scheduling of business in the Council of State, the Council of Ministers, and the parliamentary agenda for
the government’s part. Since the programme of work is simply indicative, if necessary, it ca n be modified
to take account of new requirements arising from current events. The themes included in the work
programme are subject to proposals made by members of the government. These proposals are collected
by the Secretariat General of Government (SGG), which puts them in a uniform format. They are all then
submitted to arbitration by the Prime Minister. The government´s programme of work is not made
public, without necessarily being classified as confidential.

In Sweden, work flows from the government’s political agenda, based on the coalition agreement at the
start of each political term. The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) submits a list of upcoming bill proposals
twice a year to the parliament. The annual Budget Bill also indicates the direction of reforms. It gives
significant information about priorities, including new legislation for the coming years. The government

(kommittéberättelsen, the Committee Report). These documents are available on the government’s
website.

46.      Regulatory quality is key for Turkmenistan in its current transformation efforts. Regulation
is an essential function of government. Together with taxes and budget, regulation is intended to shape
social and economic relations in any society. It is therefore essential to have adequate regulatory
procedures that are transparent and participatory, in order to attain clear policy goals. Diversification of
the economy and consolidation of a market economy can be successfully achieved only if there are
adequate regulatory frameworks in all policy fields. Government should actively promote clear and
proportionate rules to ensure macroeconomic stability and enforce a level playing field for the private
sector. Several countries have taken the lead in reforming their regulatory processes, integrating the use of
modern tools to ensure regulations are proportionate and attain their desired objectives (see Box 2).

                                           Box 2: Why regulatory quality matters?

Having adequate procedures during the regulatory process to make it more predictable, transparent and
participatory, and integrating tools that can help preparing and implementing regulations of quality are essential
components for economic development, growth and social welfare. Regulatory quality refers to the capacity of the
government to manage the regulatory flow and stock (preparing new regulations and reviewing existing ones) and
ensure that regulations are cost-effective and efficient. To achieve these goals, governments have to engage in
regulatory management and reform, and introduce adequate tools and policies to ensure that the administrative
machinery carries on good regulatory principles.



47.     Consultation is fundamental to improve the quality of regulations. While preparing new
regulations or amending existing ones, some consultation takes place. Within the Turkmen central
administration, consultation with other bodies is not uncommon, particularly when regulations are
intended to implement government strategies and plans. In that particular case, the Ministry of Economy
has some coordination roles, as it monitors the implementation of the Government programs and plans.
Ministries have to report quarterly to the Ministry of Economy on the implementation progress. Some
indicators also help institutions to measure progress.

48.     Engagement of stakeholders is more challenging, as consultations are rather focused and
there are no open mechanisms for different groups to participate in the process . However, Ministries
reported that depending on the nature of the regulation, they are obliged to consult with stakeholders. The
Ministry of Justice verifies that such a consultation has taken place and comments from stakeholders have
been incorporated in the final draft. There are, however, no clear provisions or guidelines for consultation.

49.      Laws are published in the Official Gazette and Ministries and other institutions also
promote their dissemination through official channels and at local levels. There is an official website
of the Government of Turkmenistan4 that publishes the laws enacted by the President, but this repository
consists only of a list of laws issued by date. There are no search options that could help interested parties
to find easily the laws.

Spotlight 7 - Consultation in the regulatory process and publication of regulations: United
                                States, Canada and Mexico
Consultation with stakeholders is a fundamental tool to ensure the quality of the regulation. Greater public
involvement enhances legitimacy and is a pre-condition for effective governance. It helps establish public
confidence, trust and credibility. Stakeholders and citizen engagement is an important part of improving
the design of rules and promoting acceptance of and compliance with rules – reducing therefore
enforcement costs. Several countries have improved consultation procedures and publish systematically
regulatory decisions. In addition, making regulations public is essential to increase participation and to
inform stakeholders so they can better comply with regulations.

The United States incorporated consultation procedures in the regulatory process in the 1948 Federal Act
of Administrative Procedure. Thus, consultation is an essential part of the rule-making process, which is
followed by executive and independent agencies of the federal government to implement primary
legislation. Executive Orders by the U.S. President also establish principles and guidance for the rule-
making process. In 2003, the e-Rule-making program was established to improve access and participation
in the federal regulatory process. The e-Rule-making programme launched the www.regulations.gov
website to enable citizens to search, view and comment on regulations issued by the U.S. government. On
average, federal agencies and departments issue nearly 8,000 regulations per year. In the past, if members
of the public were interested in commenting on a regulation, they would have to know the sponsoring
agency, when it would be published, review it in a reading room, then struggle through a comment
process specific to each agency. Today, the public can contribute to and retrieve rules and regulations that
impact their lives conveniently, from anywhere. They find all regulations in a single online portal. While
www.regulations.gov is a depository of all regulations prepared by the federal government, the rule-
making docket (known as a “Docket Folder”) contains all of an agency’s relevant rule -making materials
(e.g., Notice of Proposed Rule-Making, hearing notices, extensions of comment period, and final rule),
supporting documents (e.g., economic and environmental analyses), studies and other references, all
public comments, and other relevant documents. This approach follows the principle that, as a norm,
government decisions should be based solely on the information set out in the publicly available record.
This should include all comments submitted by citizens, affected entities, along with all other information
the government relies upon and the response of the government to public comments.

In Canada there is a strong link between public consultation and public policy making. Consultation
rounds start very early in the policy formulation phase. Departments use discussion papers, written
submissions, informal discussions, ad hoc meetings, departmental Web sites to seek input and
disseminate information, workshops, conferences, and seminars, using regional offices to collect and
channel opinion, newsletters, consultative or on-going multi-stakeholder advisory committees. Especially
performing is consultation on subordinate regulations. The Canadian Government puts particular
emphasis in the preparation of a structured “consultation plan”, which, while it requires an upfront
investment of time, budget and effort, allows to critically frame the boundaries of the consultation process
and hence enhance the overall efficiency. The plan should precisely state the objectives of the process and
include the issues under review, a public environment analysis, key participants, realistic timelines, and a
mechanism for reporting consultation results. It should clearly describe the proposed consultative
approach and “rules of engagement,” so that interested parties can decide whether or not to participate
and, if so, how. The Government suggests that stakeholders can, where appropriate, be invited to provide
input on the development of the consultation plan, including on how the consultation should be conducted
and which consultative tools would be most appropriate. The Privy Council Office, the non-partisan
advisory body to the Prime Minister and Cabinet, released the Government of Canada Regulatory Policy
in 1999, formalizing requirements for consultation. Guidelines for Effective Regulatory Consultation are
available through the Treasury Board. Other governmental agencies developed own tools.

In Mexico, the Federal Registry of Formalities and Services (Registro Federal de Trámites y Servicios) is
the official, single on-line portal for all federal formalities and services, classified by institution and
administrative unit. The Registry is provided for by law, which grants it legal status. Every formality and
services is registered in the Federal Registry with the following information: name of the procedure, legal
basis of the formality or service, situation in which the formality might be requested or the service
offered, how the formality or service can be requested, forms to be filled in, data and information that has
to be presented with the formality or service, response delay, fees to be charged and how they are
established, validity of the licences, authorisations or permits that could be provided, criteria for
resolution, administrative unit responsible of the formality and service, time schedule for citizens and
businesses, and contact details. In Mexico, process re-engineering was used to improve business
formalities. In June 1998, the UDE (the former Deregulation Unit at the Ministry of Trade and Industry
which later on became the Federal Regulatory Improvement Commission, COFEMER) launched an
ambitious communications project: an electronic one-stop shop based on the inventory of formalities
supported by Internet search facilities. A user-friendly, online search tool was posted, permitting any
person to retrieve a list of formalities needed to start up or operate a business. Once the inventory became
the official federal registry, the list of formalities provided nearly 100 percent accuracy and legal security.
The registry became in 2000 the Federal Registry of Formalities and Services, a unique tool to provide
business and citizens with a full list of compulsory procedures. Through the Federal Registry, the
COFEMER can ensure the regulatory improvement process, as businesses can identify problems or
inaccuracies, in addition to assess their economic impact on business activities. The Federal Registry
provides legal security, as institutions cannot apply a formality that is not registered in the Federal
Registry or ask for obligations or requirements that are not listed in the online portal.

Managing Volatility
50.      Resource rich economies usually face a challenge of uncertainty and volatility associated
with the price and/or demand fluctuations for the natural resource . Given the importance of the
extractive sector for such economies, volatility of resource flows may impact the country's broader
macroeconomic parameters and lead to larger policy challenges, such as fluctuations in export
performance, ups and downs of GDP growth, budget revenues, public spending/investment, employment,
inflation and exchange rate behavior.

51.      To address these challenges and manage volatility, most resource-dependent countries
introduce additional institutional arrangements and task them with specific functions . In some
countries these institutions are legally separate entities and autonomous units in the public administration
structure (Alaska/USA, Alberta/Canada, Azerbaijan, and Kuwait). In other countries, for example in
Norway or Timor Leste, they are divisions within the Ministry of Finance. The size of assets managed by
stabilization funds varies from country to country. As of 2009, the largest fund in nominal US$ terms was
managed by Norway (US$423 bn), as a percentage of GDP - by Tuvalu (365 percent of GDP) while the
smallest funds - by Venezuela and Sudan (0.2 percent of GDP respectively). Kuwait was the first country
establishing such an institution (Kuwait Investment Authority, KIA) in 1953 and then the General
Reserve Fund (managed by KIA) in 1960. Since then the total number of stabilization funds around the
world has grown to 52. The main objectives of most of these funds are of short term nature - smoothening
government revenues and thus public spending. The international experience shows that in countries
where there is a Stabilization Fund fiscal performance is more disciplined and fiscal policy
implementation, measured by the non-primary balance, is smooth (Sugawara, 2014).



                                                      44
52.     Usually the designated institutions manage resource revenues separately from the regular
budget. But important considerations are whether: a) there are designed rules and regulations for
operation for such institutions/funds; b) the execution reports of separated funds are integrated into the
regular budget reports; c) they follow the established rules of accountability and internal/external
oversight and d) there is a coordination mechanism at the policy level (macroeconomic, fiscal, monetary
and exchange rate) and at the institutional level (Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economy/Development,
Stabilization Fund, and Central Bank).


                   Spotlight 8 - Stabilization Funds: international experience

Norway established Government Pension Fund Global in 1990 with US$ 396.5 billion. The Government
Pension Fund is a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) where the surplus wealth produced by Norwegian
petroleum income is held. It is the largest pension fund in Europe and the second largest in the world. It is
among the most transparent of the SWFs in its holdings and investments. The petroleum fund is investing
parts of the large surplus generated by the Norwegian petroleum sector, generated mainly from taxes of
companies. The purpose of the Government Pension Fund-Global is to facilitate government savings
necessary to meet the rapid rise in public pension expenditures in the coming years, and to support a long-
term management of petroleum revenues. The fund invests a large portion of assets in fixed income and
equities. It currently does not invest in private equity.

Alaska (USA) established Alaska Permanent Fund 1976 with and initial capital of US$734,000. It is a
constitutionally established Fund, managed by a semi-independent corporation. At least 25 percent of
proceeds come from minerals, such as oil and gas, sale or royalties are directed to the Fund. The Alaska
Permanent Fund sets aside a certain share oil revenues to continue benefiting current and all future
generations of Alaskans. Spending Fund income is up to the Legislature. The Fund grew to the sum of
approximately US$40 billion as of 2007.

Alberta (Canada) established the Investment Fund for Future Generations in 1976. This fund was created
with several goals in mind, including diversification of economy, improving quality of life, and
accumulating savings for "rainy days". The fund was originally designed for economic development, but
now primarily it is a long-term savings and investment fund. The fund is invested in stocks, bonds, and
real estate and alternative investments, with the aim of generating revenue for the Alberta province.
Currently the Fund's capital is estimated about US$ 17 bn.

Azerbaijan established the State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) in1999. Main
responsibility of the Fund is to manage foreign currency and assets generated from oil and gas exploration
and development. It has seven members of the Supervisory Board, represented by state bodies and civil
society, who are appointed by the President. The Fund may be categorized as a savings fund for future
generations. The Fund primarily invests in investment-grade securities such as government agency bonds,
corporate bonds, and mortgage-backed securities.

Kazakhstan established the National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan in 2000 on the basis of
resources originated from oil, natural gas and metallic minerals. The National Fund a stabilization fund
that ensures economic stability of Kazakhstan against the price swings of oil, gas, and metals. The assets
of the National Fund assets are monitored by the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Currently
the Fund's capital is estimated at about US$ 38 billion.

The Stabilization Fund, Fiscal Policy and Management

53.      Turkmenistan created a Stabilization Fund (SF) in 2008. The SF's assets are held at the
Central Bank as a separate sub-account of the Treasury Single Account and managed by the Government
of Turkmenistan. The timing of creation of the SF coincided with the recent global crisis and the need to
execute a fiscal stimulus package to support the domestic economy during the post-crisis period. To
execute these programs a new institution, the State Development Bank of Turkmenistan (SDBT), was
created in 2011 with a starting capital of US$1 bn. As of the end 2013 the total credit to the economy
through the SDBT amounted to TMT 11 bn (about US$4 bn). The funds have been used not only to
provide credit to public sector entities through domestic banks, but also to implement priority investment
projects approved by the President and by the Cabinet of Ministers, and acquire domestic or external
financial assets. Revenues generated from hydrocarbon exports have been channeled to non-hydrocarbon
sectors through public investments and thus stimulated domestic sources of growth.

54.     By its mandate, the SDBT performs functions of both fiscal and monetary institutions . It
provides lending to the economy directly and through local commercial banks. There is a set reporting
requirement to the government, Central Bank and Chamber of Control with monthly and quarterly
periodicity. The interest rate charged by the State Development Bank for on-lending is approved by the
government. Besides the ex-post reporting, it is also important to ensure full coordination with the Central
Bank to ensure consistency of the State Development Bank’s lending practices and interest rate
application with monetary policy objectives.5

55.      A simple fiscal rule was introduced in 2008. It stipulates accumulating the surplus of the State
Budget in the Stabilization Fund at the end of each fiscal/calendar year after safeguarding the deficit
financing need of the following year. The annual limit of utilization of the Stabilization Fund resources by
the State Development Bank is approved by the President's decree and specific directions - by the Cabinet
of Minister's decision.

56.     There is a shared responsibility between the Ministry of Finance and the State Development
Bank for the execution of State Programs. The Ministry of Finance, through the State Budget, is
responsible for implementation of the Rural Development Plan (envisaging projects mainly of social
nature) while the State Development Bank is tasked with implementation of the rest of public programs
(mainly infrastructure, construction and economic development). However, there are different
requirements for legislative approval and external oversight for the State Budget and for the Stabilization
Fund. The State Budget and its annual execution report are subject to Parliament approval and external
audit by the Chamber of Control. Allocations from the Stabilization Fund do not require approval by
Medjlis and by the end of the fiscal year project implementation reports are not incorporated into the State
Budget (Consolidated Budget) to be presented and discussed by the legislature. Although the Chamber of
Control reviews and approves each investment project on a case by case basis, it is important to produce
and present the full picture of fiscal accounts and public spending by the end of each reporting period
regardless of the institutional setting of public expenditure execution agencies.

57.     Moving ahead, the authorities could introduce more objective criteria and set transparent
rules for defining limits of resource utilization from the Stabilization Fund. Also, the government
may consider approving a long-term strategy for utilization of resource revenues for programs with higher
public returns on investments. In addition, improved coordination between different fiscal institutions
(Ministry of Finance and the State Bank for Development) for ensuring consistency and harmonization of
public expenditure management practices and policy objectives would be essential. As the SDBT

develops more capacity, it may consider introducing more robust methods for public investment appraisal
to be able to screen and select from project proposals developed by line ministries.

The Foreign Exchange Reserve Fund, Stabilization Fund and Exchange Rate Policy

58.     Natural resource dependent countries are usually prone to the “Dutch Disease”, associated
with exchange rate appreciation triggered by large foreign exchange inflows from exported natural
resources. The appreciated currency imposes an implicit tax on export of the non-resource tradable sector
and impedes export expansion. At the same time, large foreign currency inflows elevate domestic demand
through increased levels of public spending, which in turn leads to an increase in prices for domestic non-
tradable goods and to the appreciation of the national currency. As a result, the country loses its
competitiveness, resources shift from non-competitive tradable sectors to non-tradables, the economy
becomes dominated by a few sectors and less diversified. It is, thus, very important for resource-
dependent economies to draw attention not only on institutional arrangements for managing resource
revenues and on setting transparent fiscal rules but also on the need to ensure a competitive exchange rate.

59.     Turkmenistan created a Foreign Exchange Reserve Fund (FERF) in 2007. The FERF is
managed by the Central Bank and has been created to guarantee full convertibility of the national
currency.

60.      In May 2008 the Central Bank of Turkmenistan announced the unification of the exchange
rate. Before 2008 Turkmenistan experienced a dual exchange rate operation with a difference between
the official and parallel exchange rates of about 4-5 times. The dual exchange rate practice resulted in an
implicit tax on exports and an implicit subsidy on imports. Also, it hindered the banking sector’s
involvement in the foreign exchange market and trade financing operations. The unification had a
positive net effect on the economy as the reform momentum was highly advantageous for Turkmenistan.
First, the dominance of the hydrocarbon sector ensured revenues to the budget. Second, the country
enjoyed a fiscal surplus, low public debt and comfortably high external reserves, which provided room to
deal with external shocks. Also, the government already implemented large subsidy programs which
helped to mitigate the negative implication of relative price changes on the welfare of certain groups of
the population. Besides, the government decided to support public enterprises with input subsidies to
maintain jobs and prevent possible disruptions caused by the higher cost of inputs.

61.      The exchange rate unification was followed by the redenomination of the Turkmen Manat
in January 2009. The currency was redenominated at TMT 1 per TMM 5000 and pegged to the US
dollar at fixed TMT 2.85 per 1 US$. Macroeconomic and social indicators of the post 2008 period show
that the overall exchange rate unification and redenomination of the currency were managed successfully.
The stable exchange rate increased confidence towards the national currency. The exchange rate
unification also set the stage for the banking sector’s development as it enabled the revaluation of assets
and liabilities, and increased access to the foreign exchange market.

62.     The choice of a fixed exchange rate in 2009 was well justified in the background of the prior
developments and applications of parallel exchange rates. In addition to increased confidence, the
stable currency encouraged savings and thus promoted formal financial intermediation though from a
very low base. Between 2009 and 2013, the banking deposits denominated in Manats increased by more
than 6 times while foreign currency deposits by less than 3 times. As a result, the ratio of domestic
currency deposits to foreign currency deposits contracted from 1:3.1 to 1:1.4 during the last five years.
Also, the stable currency was quite helpful in ensuring social stability during the recent liberalization of
administratively controlled prices.




                                                    47
63.      Despite the above mentioned positive aspects, the fixed exchange rate seriously limits the
space for monetary policy and does not facilitate export of non-resource sectors. The exchange rate,
fixed in January 2009 and not revisited since then, may pose obstacles for the Central Bank in its pursuit
of low inflation. In addition, the cost of the fixed peg increases over time and leads to overvaluation of the
national currency. Therefore it is advisable to introduce exchange rate flexibility, move away from the
fixed US$ peg and introduce a wider foreign exchange band or trading margins to manage the transition
to a floating exchange rate smoothly.

Providing Public Services
64.      A key function of government is the provision of public services. In Turkmenistan State
intervention is dominant not only in social policies, such as health and education, but also in large
infrastructure projects or the development of transport systems. The Government defines the pace and
scope of the delivery. Private participation (local and foreign) is rather limited in most areas, as services
and products are mostly offered by SOEs and other State entities.

65.      The Law on Investment Activities in Turkmenistan governs investment decisions. Decisions
on State investments are adopted expecting a high rate of return and on the basis of the following criteria:
(i) forecasts for economic and social development; (ii) schemes of labor development and distribution;
and, (iii) special scientific and technical feasibility studies. The Law foresees private participation in such
investments, but in the move towards a market economy, the State plays a key role in guiding the way
investments are channeled.

Priority Setting and Capacity

66.     Policy priorities are decided by the President and Cabinet of Ministers in line with the
Government development programs. The Government, mainly through decisions by the President and
the Cabinet of Ministers, sets priorities for public services, with participation of local executive bodies
and concerned public organizations. Priorities have to be in alignment with the main directions of the
different Government development programs and monitoring of project execution has to be conducted by
the responsible Ministry or institution, according to the mentioned Law.

67.      The Ministry of Finance is then in charge of allocating resources for such priorities. The
recent introduction of a new system of multi-year budget planning should facilitate monitoring resource
allocation with the introduction of a results-based system. This is of core importance as the current
magnitude of public investment spending accentuates the need for better control over the efficiency of
spending. At the moment this is rather opaque, as a significant amount of government revenue and
expenditure remains outside the main State budget, moving through extra-budgetary funds (ADB, 2014).
According to official numbers (State Committee for Statistics, 2013), investments in Turkmenistan have
increased from 1,814.4 Mio. Manats in 2000 to 48,407.1 Mio. Manats in 2012. In 2012, the following
funding sources, in decreasing order of magnitude, were used: other, internal funds of enterprises and
organizations, foreign investors, loans, centralized and local budget and population.

68.     Better prioritization of expenditures and focus on results will strengthen the quality of
public service provision. Turkmenistan could follow the lead of advanced OECD countries and shift to
performance-oriented public sectors that emphasize efficiency and accountability. This requires systems
to monitor results―including enlisting private companies, academic instituti ons, and nongovernmental
organizations to monitor indicators of public service delivery. The role of external performance audit will
also become important in ascertaining that delivery units comply with their delivery obligations, on the
basis of which they receive budget financing. This approach would require systematic reviews of public
spending to identify the scope for service delivery improvements and to advance institutional reforms.

                                                      48
69.      Coordination and capacity within the public administration is crucial to ensure the effective
provision of public services. Strategic-State capacity refers to the extent to which the central government
can (i) set and steer a national long-term strategy for the country, (ii) identify and address internal and
external challenges to implementing this strategy correctly through enhanced evidence-based decision
making and strategic foresight, (iii) improve efficiency in policy design and service delivery to meet these
challenges, and (iv) mobilize actors and leverage resources across government and society to achieve
integrated, coherent policy outcomes that address these challenges effectively. The strategic-State concept
emphasizes leadership and stewardship from the center, integrity and transparency, the importance of
networks and institutions both inside and outside government, the need to draw inspiration from sub-
national initiatives and from citizens, and the importance of effective implementation of strategy in
support of positive outcomes for a country’s economy and society (OECD, 2013a).

70.      Capacity of the administration in Turkmenistan is uneven across ministries and service
delivery can be fragmented. The example of the current efforts to improve vocational training offers a
case in point of the challenges still facing the administration (see Box 3). In response to high demand to
attend vocational schools and training centers, the government has begun establishing a vocational
training system. In doing so, it has faced challenges, mainly related to government capacity and
coordination within the administration. The lessons from the current experience can be summarized as
follows. First, coordination mechanisms among the different Ministries and institutions have to be
explicitly promoted, as in many cases the top-down decision-making and the implementation process fall
into the competences of different entities, which are not able to communicate and coordinate on their own
and promptly. Second, human capacities also vary considerably across the administration, which in some
cases does not have adequately trained staff to deal with the demand for services. Ministries and other
government agencies need to build those capacities in a sustained manner over time because expertise to
deal with specific and very technical implementation of Government programs is not always at hand
within the administration. Third, social participation is limited, even if providing services entails meeting
stakeholders’ expectations and needs.

                                   Box 3: Vocational training in Turkmenistan

Vocational training is an important priority of the Government of Turkmenistan, in particular to develop expertise
and specialists for economic and social areas that are demanding a more qualified labor force. It is part of strategies
to be promoted as part of Government programs in the medium and long term. In Turkmenistan, training is provided
on both a full-time and part-time (evening classes) basis. There are were 118 accredited initial vocational schools
and training centers in 2000 and 129 in 2012, which come under the jurisdiction of the corresponding sectoral
ministries and departments. The number of pupils in those establishments increased from 21,000 to 51,100 in the
same period. As a rule, vocational schools receive no government funding, and training is provided on the basis of
tuition fees paid by students or directly, for example, by enterprises, which order training courses from vocational
schools. According to the Ministry of Education, the schools at this level provide training in 268 occupations.
Secondary VET is provided in secondary schools of different types (colleges, secondary professional schools and
others) and at certain higher education institutions that hold the relevant licenses. Training in secondary vocational
schools is provided on a full-time basis. In 2010/11, there were 27 secondary vocational schools and 6,206 enrolled
students (a 44.2 percent increase compared to 2000/01).

Traditionally, this policy area was in the hands of the State Committee on Labor and later on in the Ministry of
Economy. A new Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare was set up in April 2011 to replace the old Ministry of
Social Welfare, which is now in charge of this issue. The Ministry defines the main guidance at the policy level, and
other institutions, mainly Ministry of Education, are in charge of implementation. Regulations to help
implementation are put forward by the responsible implementer institution, but the Ministry of Labor participates
with comments to any draft.

Through technical assistance of the European Union, the project on Improvement of the Quality and Relevance of
Professional Education has helped to develop better coordination mechanisms. The purpose of the project was to

                                                         49
provide technical assistance and policy advice to various stakeholders in Turkmenistan to develop human resources
and related policies through analyzing current and future skills needs in the selected economic sectors, developing
new standards, curricula and training programs, creating a basis for vocational and educational training (VET)
qualifications, establishing relevant quality procedures for the VET system and facilitating the development of
policy options aimed at widening equal access to VET and lifelong learning. The Ministry of Education is the main
stakeholder, and a steering committee has been set up that includes all the relevant stakeholders and representatives
of other donors active in the field of education and training

Improving Service Delivery

71.     Increased private participation could improve the quantity and quality of public service
delivery. Private participation in long-term projects that can improve service delivery is promoted by the
Government of Turkmenistan, mainly through specific incentives, such as credit lines at very low rates (1
percent or even no interest at all). Even if this policy has had some success in attracting investors, an
adequate framework for private participation in service delivery is not yet in place.

72.      Going forward one possible option, widely used at international level, is to establish public-
private partnerships (PPPs) as an alternative to more traditional arrangements . Although some laws
acknowledge the cooperation between the public and the private sectors under concession agreements,
PPPs do not have a legal basis in the country. International experience shows that different incentives,
combined with an adequate legal framework, have to be in place in order to ensure sustainability of PPPs,
as well as to maximize and improve the use of resources. In Turkmenistan, institutional arrangements and
capacities within the administration are still inadequate for a PPP model to be viable. Skills and
institutions to initiate and supervise PPPs have to be systematically developed.

          Spotlight 9 - Private participation in service delivery: Indonesia and Korea

Several countries around the world have been confronted to the need to increase private participation in
service delivery, not only for ideological reasons, but also in the pursuit of value for money, e.g. how to
improve the use of resources. Public-private partnerships (PPPs), long term contractual agreements
between a government and a private partner whereby the latter typically finances and delivers public
services using a capital asset, have been used as a “third way” between public provision and full
privatization, inducing cost minimization behavior by the private provider in charge of the provision
while reducing potential market failures by limiting the market power conferred on the private provider
via the regulation through the contract. PPPs are widely used around the world. In the United Kingdom,
for instance, they account for 14 percent of public investment. Both developed and developing countries
have opted for PPPs, and results are mixed. The introduction of PPPs also raised a series of political,
economic and technical questions. Two concrete cases illustrate the use of PPPs and challenges faced:
Indonesia and Korea.

In Indonesia, prior to 2001, decision-making was largely centralized. However since 2003 the country
experienced a significant degree of decentralization following the passing of the 2003 Law on State
Finance (Law 17/2003). In addition, the implementation of a legal and institutional framework that could
serve as basis for a larger degree of private participation in the form of PPPs was actively promoted after
the Asian crisis in the early and mid-2000s. The legal and institutional framework establishes a basis for
the involvement of private participation in infrastructure construction, finance and management. The
Master Plan for Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia’s Economic Development, 2011 -2025 (MP3EI)
focuses primarily on increasing the connectivity in Indonesia through, among other things, the
development of six corridors and various ports. In addition, the MP3EI seeks IDR 4 012 trillion (US$ 440
billion) of investment, with IDR 1 786 trillion assigned to items such as highways, harbors and power
plants. Through the significantly increased use of PPPs in toll roads, rail and power generation the
government of Indonesia wants to significantly catch up in infrastructure development, creating the
necessary foundation to maintain the high economic growth rates it needs as a frontline emerging market
economy intent on joining the BRICS. Today, most PPPs in Indonesia are in the form of concessions. The
Government of Indonesia passed a number of laws to improve the process and principles through which
projects are awarded, becoming the legal framework for PPPs: Presidential Regulation 67/2005
introduced the use of competitive bidding, and Presidential Regulations 13/2010 and 56/2011 regulate
what types of projects are considered as infrastructure, what the eligible contracting agencies are and the
role of potential private participants. In addition, regulations set out the responsibilities of the Ministry of
Finance (MoF) with respect to the granting of fiscal support and guarantees to specific projects in the
procurement process. Some challenges persist in Indonesia in relation to PPPs, such as lack of
coordination among institutions involved in the design, implementation and supervision of PPPs, the need
to have a dedicated PPP Unit within the MoF, more transparency, predictability and convergence of the
regulatory framework of PPPs and sectorial areas, better alignment of overall PPPs strategy with
objectives and priorities of individual projects at the highest political level, better value-for-money
assessments of the different projects (including not only a high rate of return, but also economy, risk,
effectiveness and efficiency of the project), and strengthen the budgetary process to ensure integrity of the
PPPs cycle.

Korea has 15-year experience in PPP programs, well-established institutional settings and a mature
market. Following decades of rapid economic growth, the country found itself at the beginning of the
1990s with a serious shortage of infrastructure facilities, such as roads, railways, seaports, and airports.
The government, judging there would be limits to its ability to fund the needed construction of
infrastructure facilities, had come to feel the need to induce private sector participation in infrastructure
investment as an alternative means of replenishing infrastructure. The Government of Korea (GoK)

                                                      51
initiated then various kinds of policies that could facilitate infrastructure financing through PPP
approaches. Comprehensive and clear definition of the PPP procurement steps—to secure or enhance
value for money—in the special law and regulations has been an essential element to improve consistency
and efficiency and to reduce uncertainty in implementing PPP projects in the country. The Ministry of
Strategy and Finance (MOSF) is responsible for managing PPP projects, and the Public and Private
Infrastructure Investment Management Center (PIMAC) at the Korea Development Institute (KDI)
supports MOSF different ways, prescribed in the PPP Law: (i) supporting MOSF in formulating the Basic
Plan for PPP; (ii) supporting the competent authorities and ministries in the procurement process, such as
assessment of feasibility and value for money for potential PPP projects, formulation of the request for
proposal, designation of the concessionaire, and promoting foreign investment in PPP projects through
consultation services and other related activities; and (iii) developing and operating capacity-building
programs for public sector practitioners. In addition, PIMAC at KDI conducts policy research related to
PPP programs and provides policy advice to MOSF and procuring ministries. The PPP Act and the
Enforcement Decree, the principal components of the legal framework for PPPs, clearly define eligible
infrastructure types, procurement types, procurement processes, the roles of the public and private parties,
policy supports, etc. . The PPP Act lays out the PPP Basic Plan and PPP Implementation Guidelines,
which together address, in detail, policy directions, procurement steps, and government support. The
Basic Plan provides PPP policy directions, PPP project implementation procedures, financing and
refinancing options, risk allocation mechanisms, payment schemes for government subsidies, and
documentation instructions. PIMAC developed the PPP Implementation Guidelines to improve
transparency and objectivity in PPP implementation. According to this framework, 46 types of
infrastructure facilities in 15 sectors are currently eligible for PPP procurement. Among those, most active
PPP projects involve transport facilities, such as roads, ports, and railways. Also, some PPP projects
include social facilities, such as waste treatment facilities, educational facilities, military housing projects,
and bachelor’s resident projects. Continuous development of the act and related regulations demon strates
a strong commitment on the part of the government to strengthen the private sector’s confidence in the
PPP program and also shows that there are always challenges ahead: for instance, to address ex-post
management of PPP projects, as some of them enter into the implementation phase and strict monitoring
is needed to ensure adequate performance.

73.      The Concessions Law has significant shortcomings to become a legal basis for PPPs. While
the Concessions Law contains a basic set of rules on tender procedures, these rules are very limited and
the scope of their application unclear, arguably leaving room for arbitrary decisions by the authorities.
The Concessions Law provides that concession agreements may only take the form of Build Operate
Transfer arrangements, thus limiting flexibility between the parties. Under the Concessions Law the
concession projects can be granted for exploration, development, extraction or operation of natural
resources, as well as for any other economic activity in all sectors, provided that such activity is not
prohibited by existing laws and does comply with established requirements of ecological, sanitary-
hygienic, radiation, fire and explosive safety. The definition of concession implies that a PPP mechanism
(if used in the country) can be applied to a broad range of sectors (i.e. not only to infrastructure sectors,
such as transportation, waste, water, disposal, etc., but also to sectors, such as manufacturing and
agriculture, that fall beyond the scope of traditional PPP arrangements).

74.    The legal framework for PPPs could be strengthened and extended beyond natural
resources. The concession relations in Turkmenistan are governed by the Law on Foreign Concessions
1993, under which an authorized body on State property is entitled to review tender applications, select
the concessionaires and sign the concession agreements. According to an EBRD assessment (EBRD,

                                                       52
2012) of the Concessions Law in 2011, the Law is too vague as far as the majority of core areas are
concerned and its scope of application needs serious improvements, e.g. concession is defined as “a
permission of the State to carry out a specific type of business activity.” In addition, the Contracting
Authority is not clearly defined, there is discrimination against domestic investors, and sectors that may
be subject to concessions are not defined, and seem limited to natural resources. Finally, the selection
procedure is not developed. Thus, Turkmenistan scored low for compliance in the assessment of its legal
PPP framework (26 percent compliance rate), receiving the lowest marks in the EBRD region. The
analysis of the local institutional framework revealed substantial gaps, from 50 to 67 percent, in all key
indicators.

75.     An additional instrument used by the Government of Turkmenistan to support service
delivery is the creation of the State Development Bank of Turkmenistan. Established in September
2011, the Bank plays a decisive role in service delivery, as it is a key institution for financing government
projects. The Bank helps implement projects to diversify the economy, financed either through own
resources or through the Stabilization Fund. The breakdown of its lending is as follows: 30 percent to
transport and communication systems, 25 percent to construction, 4 percent to agriculture, 4 percent to
trade, 37 percent to other type of projects, such as social development projects (schools, hospitals,
tourism, etc.).

76.     The State Development Bank offers preferential lending to government entities, such as
ministries or SOEs, or private entrepreneurs through a tender process. Projects have to be approved
by the Cabinet of Ministers, and should be in alignment with government priorities established in the
development programs. Once the request has been approved, the Ministry of Economy has to justify why
the project requires financing. The State Development Bank monitors the use of the credit and the
payment, but other institutions, such as tax authority or the Ministry of Economy, also participate in the
reporting system that beneficiaries have to comply with.

Regulating Enterprise
77.      The government’s function in regulating private enterprise is essential to ensure the
development of all sectors of the economy. Apart from imposing additional costs, regulation can be
manipulated with the objective of creating unfair competitive advantages for some firms (not necessarily
the most productive) with welfare losses for the rest of the economy. In the long run, an economy where
competition is restricted, by cumbersome or captured regulation or by other means, will be less
productive because its firms will face reduced incentives to be efficient and adopt new technologies. The
consequences may be particularly severe for economies that are far from the technological frontier, since
the ability to adopt new technologies is essential to productivity growth and convergence to the levels of
more developed economies (Acemoglu et al., 2006).

78.      The Government of Turkmenistan is committed to increase the share of private sector in
GDP to 70 percent by 2020. Several economic reforms are needed to achieve this goal. In particular,
having adequate regulatory frameworks is key. Thus, Turkmenistan still requires improving regulatory
processes to ensure that regulations are of quality and meet their intended policy objectives. Several
international examples show the relevance of promoting regulatory quality for better economic
performance.

Spotlight 10 - Promoting regulatory quality for economic growth: Australia and the United
                                        Kingdom

Some countries have actively used regulatory quality to trigger economic growth. Australia and the
United Kingdom are successful examples where improving the quality of regulation has been sought to
increase competition, make the economy more competitive and deliver better services.

In Australia regulatory reform has served the purpose to make the economy more competitive. The
Productivity Commission (PC) is an independent research body that advises the Australian Government
on a range of economic, social and environmental issues that affect the welfare of Australians. Its charter
is to improve the productivity and economic performance of the economy, taking into account the
interests of the community as a whole, considering environmental, regional, and social dimensions, not
just the interests of particular industries or groups. An important function of the PC is modeling the
economic costs and benefits of alternative policy options. It may make recommendations on any matter
that it considers relevant, and it is up to the government to decide how to use the advice provided. The PC
is unique among OECD members for its standing inquiry and policy advising work across a range of
economic, social and environmental issues. The government directs the PC on what areas to study
through the issuance of formal terms of reference, but the PC is independent in its analysis and findings.
The processes of inquiry are public, allowing the opportunity for the participation of interested
individuals and groups, and the inquiry reports must be tabled in Parliament within 25 sitting days of the
government receiving the report. The PC cannot launch its own inquiries, although it can initiate
supporting research and publish the results via Commission or staff research paper.

The United Kingdom has constantly reviewed its regulatory reform program, ensuring that it responds to
the private sector needs and looking for more efficient ways to deliver services to the society. The UK
Government understands which areas of regulation concern business most. Research by the Better
Regulation Executive in 2006 estimated that just the administrative cost of regulation to UK businesses
was some £13 billion a year. Since 2009, the Better Regulation Executive has compiled, and published at
intervals, a Forward Program, which in March 2010 projected total costs across the whole economy of
£9.9 billion a year from new regulation planned to be introduced by April 2011. Total benefits to society
from this regulation were projected at £11.6 billion a year. The current work on regulatory delivery aims
at creating a regulatory environment in which businesses have the confidence to invest and grow and
citizens and communities are properly protected.

79.     In Turkmenistan the development of a market economy and a private sector is still
underway and regulation will play a crucial role in shaping a level playing field. International
experience shows that the regulatory conversion into a competitive market economy requires a
combination of factors, including commitment at the highest political level and the creation of capacity
within the public administration to manage regulatory frameworks. Countries in Eastern Europe, such as
Poland and the Czech Republic, understood the relevance of having a sound regulatory system to
accelerate the transition to a market economy and consolidate it over time.

 Spotlight 11 - Regulatory transformation in former communist countries: Poland and the
                                     Czech Republic

In the case of countries that have experienced a reshuffle in their regulatory system after the fall of
communism, such as Poland or the Czech Republic, regulatory governance has been key to promote
economic activity and growth and to consolidate a market economy.

From 1989 to 1999, the Czech Republic largely completed the move from a central planning to an open
market economy. By the year 2000, about 77 percent of GDP was produced by the private sector,
compared to less than 5 percent in 1989. However, the reforms were uneven at the beginning. The Czech
State embarked in fundamental changes to its role and in the establishment of new capacities and
institutions, becoming an accountable implementer of public policy and an increasingly capable regulator
and overseer of competitive markets. It was necessary to transfer State powers to democratic institutions
and to create a free market through implementation of an economic reform program, liberalizing foreign
trade and domestic prices (though price controls remained in some important markets), establishing
currency convertibility, deregulation and rapid privatization. Later on, fast track harmonization with EU
legislation supported the legal and regulatory transformation, and the Czech Government committed to
enhance capacities to produce high quality regulations. For instance, it introduced the Governmental
Legislative Rules, which established a well-structured mechanism for intergovernmental consultation on
policies and legal drafts. Publication of an annual legal agenda enhanced public consultation mechanisms
that were increasingly used across the administration. Located at the center of government and supported
by two specialized departments, the well-respected Legislative Council improved the legal quality of
texts. A modernization program launched in 1997 helped further promote good regulatory management
practices.

Poland’s transition proceeded on five strategic fronts: (1) establishing democracy through transfer of State
powers to democratic institutions; (2) creating a free market through implementation of an economic
reform program; (3) decentralizing the power to govern to municipalities, counties and regions; (4)
striving to join the European Union, and (5) reforming the State and rebuilding its administrative and
regulatory capacities. Among these fundamental areas, progress differed significantly, but two
interconnected trends were visible. First, laws regulating the functioning of the economy and the
foundation of civic society were adopted in the first half of the 1990s, whereas a new constitution and
new penal codes along with many other significant laws were adopted in the second half of the decade.
Second, progress was easier in re-establishing and creating private sector law than administrative law. A
culmination of the reform of the State was the enactment of a Constitution in 1997. The new Constitution
had two major effects on the legal order. First, it eliminated major inconsistencies in the sources of law by
providing for an explicit catalogue of the different legal instruments. Second, it triggered a major review
of existing laws and regulations to make them compatible with the new constitutional framework,
replacing, redrafting or removing hundreds of statutes. In parallel with the constitutional reform and the
restructuring of the public administration, Poland embarked on improving its regulatory policies through
a better management system and new institutions. For instance, in September 2000, the Prime Minister
articulated the regulatory reform policy stating that its aim is “to achieve sustainable development, to
increase the competitiveness of the country and improve the quality and transparency of government” in a
government order. The same order also established an inter-ministerial body, the Team for Legal
Regulations Quality, as the advisory and consultative body, chaired by the Minister of Economy to drive
the policy.

The Privatization Program6

80.      Privatization in Turkmenistan has been an on-going process since the days of independence
and has taken new momentum in today’s Government programs. The private sector, without the fuel
and energy sector, has accounted for almost 40 percent of GDP on average in recent years, and the plan is
to increase this figure to 70 percent and reduce the country’s reliance on oil and gas production.
Privatization of SOEs, particularly SMEs, is envisaged up to 2020, as part of a strategy to increase the
role of the private sector in the economy. The privatization program includes three stages. The first stage
will be implemented in 2013/14 and focuses on the privatization of textile, catering, and construction
companies. The second stage is to be implemented in 2014/15 and should focus on industrial enterprises.
The third stage is to be implemented between 2015/16 focusing on the privatization of enterprises in the
communications and transport sectors, as well as converting large SOEs to joint-stock-companies. The
privatization of SOEs has resulted in 2,123 enterprises that have been denationalized between January 1 st,
1994 and January 1st, 2012. 598 enterprises have been auctioned or sold in a commercial competition, 18
have been awarded by target sale, 1,507 have been sold in other forms, and 34 have become a joint-stock
company. The biggest number of entities privatized is in the following sectors: non-production types of
consumer services to the population (1,294), trade and organizing public catering (718) and industry (57)
(State Committee for Statistics, 2013).

81.      A number of legal changes have been introduced to govern the privatization process. The
draft Law of Turkmenistan “On de-nationalization and privatization of State property” was submitted for
consideration of the Cabinet of Ministers of Turkmenistan. Based on the Resolution №11906 of the
President of Turkmenistan dated November 18, 2012 the State program on securities market development
for the period of 2012-2016 has been approved.

82.      A regulatory framework has also been introduced to promote private participation in the
economy.7 Much, however, remains to be done, as SOEs have pre-eminence in the economy and private
sector development is controlled by the State. For instance, Law No. 198-IV about the Union of
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Turkmenistan, from May 21, 2011, “defines the legal, organizational
and economic basis for the activity of the Union of industrialists and entrepreneurs of Turkmenistan and
aims at increasing its role in entrepreneurship development”.8

Institutional and Regulatory Constraints

83.      The private sector has hardly evolved in a natural pathway and the relationship between
the State and entrepreneurs is heavily regulated. According to the Law of Turkmenistan on
Entrepreneurial Activity in Turkmenistan, State bodies might organize their relationships with
entrepreneurs using different tools and incentives, such as tax and finance credit policy, including
establishment of tax rates and interest rates for State credits, tax privileges, prices and rules of pricing,
special grants and subsidies, economic sanctions; State property and system of reserve, licenses,
concessions, leasing; external economic and currency policy; State orders and scientific-technical and
social State and regional programs. The Law does not provide further guidance on how these tools and

  Privatization is treated in greater detail in a dedicated World Bank Discussion Note,
7
  For instance, the Law of Turkmenstan on Investment Activities in Turkmenistan, the Law of Turkmenistan on Entrepreneurial
Activity in Turkmenistan, the Law of Turkmenistan on Free Economic Zones, the Law of Turkmenistan on Licensing on Certain
Type of Activities, etc.
8
  The Law also defines the main characteristics of the union of industrialists and entrepreneurs of Turkmenistan. The Union is the
public organization pooling industrialists and entrepreneurs, carrying out business activity on the basis of a privately-owned
pattern of ownership. Its role is to express and protect the rights and legitimate interests of its members to help entrepreneurship
development in Turkmenistan. In addition, it sets its main purposes: 1) assistance to development of the economy and market
relations; 2) formation of entrepreneurial infrastructure for private sector development; 3) creation of economic sectors and
raising the level of employment and entrepreneurial activity of the population.

                                                                56
incentives are to be used, but other laws pick up on the subject, for instance, on concessions or licenses.
The Law also provides for dispute resolution mechanisms and ways to terminate economic activity.

84.      To encourage the establishment of new businesses, the authorities have simplified the
registration and accounting systems required for small enterprises. Other measures related to taxation
and access to credit have been introduced to create a more favorable environment for SMEs and to
stimulate their development. Entrepreneurial activity can only be undertaken once State registration is
conducted. Registration is done at the Government State Registration on Legal Entities and Investment
Projects of the Ministry of Economy. Once registration is completed, businesses have to comply with
different licenses, according to the Law of Turkmenistan of Licensing of Specific Activities from 2008.
The Law integrates a comprehensive list of activities that require issuing a license, as well as the
procedures to be followed for both the applicant and the State body in charge of the license.

85.     A legal framework of State support to SMEs has been established. This includes the
Presidential Order on Improving the Licensing Procedures in Turkmenistan and the Law “On State
support to small and medium size enterprises”, which was adopted on August 15, 2009. In addition, the
Government adopted “The State Program to support small and medium enterprises in Turkmenistan for
2011-2015”. This program envisages improving access to credit and the quality, stability and
transparency of legislation, developing the financial sector, eliminating bureaucratic barriers, as well as
other measures. At the moment, the State ministries and departments offer only limited support to private
enterprises and the only measures are the ones related to taxation and access to credit. The role of the
government is limited to assisting the management of State-owned enterprises, which are the
responsibility of the corresponding ministries. Support to entrepreneurs from local authorities is also
limited, and regional development agencies need to be set up to promote the establishment of SMEs
outside the capital.

86.     The Government has also established a State Commission for the support of SMEs ,
composed of government agencies and private sector representatives, coordinated by the Ministry of
Economy. The State Commission has regular meetings, has defined a particular policy agenda and it helps
channeling suggestions and concerns from different stakeholders. It prepares a Performance Report that is
submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers.

        Box 4: Main objectives of the State Program to support SMEs in Turkmenistan for 2011-2015

The main objectives of The State Program to support SMEs in Turkmenistan for 2011-2015 are:

       Establish strong legal foundations for entrepreneurship and State support. A series of legal challenges still
        persist in the development and consolidation of SMEs, such as State registration, starting banking
        operations, getting permits for different activities, certification of products, leasing of industrial and
        commercial activities, inspections by different bodies. Several proposals to amend existing laws or
        introducing new ones will be required to ensure legal changes that support SMEs development.

       Use of modern financial instruments, widespread entrepreneurship and development of financial and credit
        methods. Banking services need to be provided to SMEs, particularly preferential credit on a long-term
        basis, as well as insurance for property. Lending capacities have to be created to support productive
        capacities and new products.

       Dissemination of experience aimed at creating favorable conditions for SMEs, organizations and
        institutions related to the State. The State needs to create capacities and infrastructure for SMEs, which
        could include the implementation of joint projects and transfer of State ownership. This also includes the
        privatization of certain enterprises, particularly SMEs, to private individuals or legal entities.



                                                        57
       Train highly qualified specialists to implement public policies related to the development of SMEs. In
        addition, offering them the possibility to have access to data and information systems to improve their
        performance. This objective also includes the set-up of information centers in different cities of
        Turkmenistan to offer consulting services to SMEs on their development and growth opportunities.

       Provide opportunities for employment by enterprise activity to the general population. This also includes
        the promotion of entrepreneurship among the Turkmen population and in particular linked to creating skills
        in the educational cycle.

       Facilitate the implementation of regional and interregional markets of products (works, services) produced
        by SMEs. Entrepreneurial activity should aim at producing competitive products locally, primarily for the
        internal market, and then expanding externally.

The expected results of the program are, among others, the increase in the number of SMEs in Turkmenistan,
creation of jobs due to SMEs, economic competitiveness and create an entrepreneurial culture among the Turkmen
population.



87.      Labor market regulations are not particularly cumbersome, according to the Institute for the
Study of Labor‘s Employment Protection Legislation Index (Muravyev 2010). The Labor Code of
Turkmenistan (last amended in July 2009), the Social Welfare code, and a number of regulations
approved by presidential resolutions govern labor issues. The Government of Turkmenistan continues to
employ 24.4 percent and the private sector 45.4 percent of the labor force while most of the rest are
employed by organizations with a mixed ownership. . One major problem for businesses is the lack of
highly qualified workers and most vacancies posted at employment offices are low-skilled jobs. A major
problem for foreign companies is the restrictive visa regime that has contributed to hinder the creation of
an attractive foreign investment climate.

88.     Non-regulatory barriers to trade are high in Turkmenistan. A variety of means are used to
discourage trade and protect domestic industries. Turkmenistan does not apply tariffs per se on imported
goods. However, in practice the Government of Turkmenistan levies customs duties and higher excise
taxes on imports, which are significant barriers to trade. Under Presidential Resolution # 9925 dated July
27, 2008, there is a customs duty on the import of 49 types of merchandise. Average rates range from 5
percent to 100 percent. Importers also pay small administrative fees to the Customs Service. The slow and
bureaucratic customs procedures seriously inhibit trade. When the basis of the consignment is a contract
but not a paid invoice, Turkmenistan requires that export and import contracts be registered at the State
Commodity and Raw Materials Exchange (SCRME), the only exchange in the country.

Competition Policy

89.     Market competition is crucial for achieving higher productivity and living standards by
allowing the efficient reallocation of resources among firms. It also signals acceptance of new entrants
and clear rules of the game for newcomers. By stifling innovation in existing firms and entry of new
firms, however, anticompetitive behavior unchecked by clear rules reduces firm efficiency (Nicoletti and
Scarpetta 2003; Conway et al. 2007). Competitive markets for labor, capital, and other inputs provide
signals to entrepreneurs about the profitability of different economic activities. This process may be
driven by incumbent firms or by new entrants. Both have an opportunity to expand and grow as a result of
improved processes, introduction of new products, and marketing or organizational innovations.

90.   Competition is necessary to let the market pick the best firms. Corporate activity in
Turkmenistan is likely to be dominated by less productive incumbents, many of which are owned partially

                                                       58
or wholly by the public sector, or are likely to have strong links with the political establishment.
Observing the experience of neighboring countries, these firms are bound to have privileged access to
natural resources, markets, credit, and licenses. More efficient enterprises, especially small and medium
firms and start-ups, cannot compete with public sector entities and incumbent firms on an equal footing,
with the result that the best firms do not emerge, inefficient firms remain dominant and overall
productivity suffers.

91.      The role of competition authorities is essential to prevent horizontal and vertical agreements
among firms, control mergers transactions that would limit competition, and undertake advocacy efforts
that promote the demand for competitive outcomes. Competition advocacy, in particular, refers to those
activities conducted by a competition agency related to the promotion of a competitive environment by
means of non-enforcement mechanisms, mainly through its relationship with other governmental entities
and by increasing public awareness of the benefits of competition.

92.     Turkmenistan is the only country in the former Soviet Union that does not have a
competition authority. As a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Turkmenistan
became a party to the inter-governmental Treaty on the Implementation of a Coordinated Competition
Policy, which was signed on December 24, 1993, in Ashgabat (see Box 5). In October 1993, Resolution
No. 1532 established a Committee for the purpose of protecting enterprises and other entities from the
impact of monopolistic practices. The increasing dominance of the State in major sectors of the Turkmen
economy severely undermined the effort of creating an appropriate institutional framework. The
Committee was abolished by the Presidential Resolution 2057 of January 11th, 1995. Meanwhile, most
Eurasian countries had adopted modern competition laws, such that by 1999 all but two (Belarus and
Turkmenistan) had enacted modern competition frameworks, with regulatory bodies in charge of
enforcing legislation. Across the region, however, implementation efforts have remained weak and
uneven, partly because of limited institutional capacity, resource constraints, and a lack of relevant
information, but mainly because of the inability of young competition agencies to resist anticompetitive
and distortive policies aimed at favoring businesses that are directly or indirectly connected to political
parties or to the legislative or executive branches. The enactment and early implementation of
competition law was often stopped or overruled by distortive government interventions and biased court
decisions.

     Box 5: Competition Policy in the former Soviet Union – the Interstate Council for Antimonopoly Policy

The legal basis for the prevention, reduction, elimination of monopolistic conduct and unfair competition in the
organization of former Soviet Republics is contained in the Treaty on the Implementation of a Coordinated
Antimonopoly Policy, which was signed on December 24, 1993, in Turkmenistan, Ashkhabad. The treaty outlines
the main principles of coordination and cooperation on competition policy matters. Significantly, the treaty created
the Interstate Council for Antimonopoly Policy (ICAP). Meetings of the ICAP allow its participants to regularly
exchange views on recent tendencies in antimonopoly law, views on the general economic situation in their
countries, and information about the most interesting cases of antimonopoly enforcement practice in order to
develop common approaches to the harmonization of competition law and its implementation in the CIS. A revised
edition of the international agreement has been signed in Moscow on January 25th, 2000.



93.      Turkmen legislation contains only few fragmented references to antimonopoly practices
and unfair competition. Despite efforts to set up a new legal framework in the early years of its
independence, Turkmenistan has never enacted specific provisions to regulate market dominance,
mergers or anticompetitive agreements. No industry is specifically restricted in regards to monopolistic
activity. Determining the legal foundations for the prevention and elimination of monopolistic activity
would require the introduction of a modern legal and institutional competition regime.

                                                        59
94.     Monopolistic activities and unfair competition are generally prohibited but not specified by
the legislation of Turkmenistan. The most relevant provisions are contained in:

       Articles 80 and 780, Civil Code of Turkmenistan (2000);

       Article 9, Law on Commerce (2002) preventing the creation of monopolies in the consumer’s
        market;

       Article 16, Law on Foreign Investments (2008) regulating aspects of unfair competition;

       Article 3, Law on Licensing of Certain Types of Activity (2008);

       Article 45, Law on Communications which represents the legal basis for activity of
        telecommunications operators (2010);

       Article 11, Law on Tourism (2010);

       Article 245, Criminal Code of Turkmenistan (2010) setting up the grounds for liability with
        reference to monopolistic activities and other anticompetitive conducts restricting competition.

95.     The legal and institutional framework for competition is still poor. Considerable development
is needed before it becomes an instrument to enhance market access for new competitors, protect markets
from restrictive business practices, and foster economic efficiency and consumer welfare. No
governmental body is in charge of supervising and enforcing the prevention of anticompetitive practices.
The establishment of a well-functioning enforcement mechanism would require the development of
competition legislation, adequate funding to ensure the proper functioning of a competition authority, as
well as appropriate administrative rules and procedures to protect its independence.

96.      There is no optimal design for a competition framework in Turkmenistan given the variety
of approaches that a jurisdiction can decide to adopt. Specific factors such as legal and administrative
traditions, degree of economic development, and political conditions always play an important role in the
institutional setup. When designing a competition authority, the following can be taken into account:

   Functions, powers, and competencies. The Authority might have specific tasks as regulator in some
    sectors (sector based model) or foster the concentration of specific skills for a particular instrument,
    such as cartels (instrument based model). A hybrid structure is also possible.

   Independence vs. Influence. In order to be able to freely conduct its activities, a competition
    authority should enjoy the highest degree of independence from the Executive and be separate from
    the ministerial administrative structure. Whereas Government’s involvement is normal for activities
    falling under the general mandate of the Authority, the issue of independence might become crucial
    when a specific case is being handled or an advocacy activity is undertaken. The way these potential
    “conflicts” are resolved depends on strategic choices. The most relevant statutory rules governing the
    Authority, such as the procedure to establish and to approve the budget and to appoint (and remove)
    the Head should be determined accordingly.

Whither Diversification? Options for
Turkmenistan
97.     The Government of Turkmenistan has taken a proactive stance in creating a diversified
economy, where the private sector plays an increasingly important role. Strategic priorities are
enshrined in a long term development strategy for 2030 and in a number of medium term plans to guide
implementation of the strategy. The ultimate objectives are to improve development outcomes: increase
the well-being of the population, sustain a high economic growth rate, and gradually increase the role of
the private sector as a driver of economic diversification.

98.     Government programs are targeting a number of priority sectors to diversify the economy .
Whereas it is possible for the Government to put in place the conditions for specific sectors to develop
and make production and exports more diversified, a crucial lesson from international experience is that
policies to directly diversify export compositions or production profiles are rarely successful on their
own. Successful diversification can be achieved if governments create the conditions for building a
balanced portfolio of national assets - natural resources, built capital, and institutions. With a strategy to
diversify assets rather than production, Turkmenistan’s economy and exports might well become more
concentrated in the short term. But if done right, the economy will become more productive and better
able to create jobs. Over time, a balanced asset portfolio will also yield a more diversified economy, but
one that is sustainable and not dependent on artificial government support. As underlying assets
strengthen, Turkmenistan can also begin to participate in global value chains and take advantage of intra-
industry trade, capitalizing on the inherent advantages of specialization.

99.      Stabilization, education, and competition are the priorities for the next decade.
Turkmenistan needs better economic institutions to ensure stable public finances and dampen volatility,
improved education and infrastructure to make workers more productive, and stronger competition
regimes to encourage private enterprise and entrepreneurship. In order to manage the volatile revenues
associated with the exploitation of natural resources, good rules need to be in place to manage the
revenues from natural resources over booms and busts and reduce the volatility of government spending.
Turkmenistan can use revenues from natural resource exports to invest more in education, health, and
infrastructure, while the quality of education needs to improve to keep pace with a growing economy.
Rules for private enterprise have to be made better with public institutions that enforce them consistently
and impartially.

100.    This note proposes concrete ways to strengthen Turkmenistan’s portfolio of national assets.
A number of issues for consideration by the Government of Turkmenistan are put forward. They suggest
ways to achieve a better balance among natural resources, built capital (physical and human) and three
essential functions of government, namely managing volatility, providing public services and regulating
enterprise. A number of observations and policy options, grouped by area, are proposed below.
Availability of more detailed information on sectoral programs and specific policy instruments to achieve
the Government’s strategic objectives would allow more tailored analysis and recommendations. World
Bank staff stands ready to assist the Government of Turkmenistan in designing and assessing the
effectiveness of specific policy instruments.

101.   Suggested policy options for diversifying Turkmenistan’s national assets, grouped by area,
are summarized in the table below.

                          assessment, consultation mechanisms, etc.) that can help
                          improve the quality of regulations.

                          The authorities may wish to establish a competition
                          framework that ensures a level playing field for
                          enterprises, private and state owned, domestic and foreign.
                          Although the establishment of a competition authority will
                          be necessary in due course, the authorities should refrain
                          from creating a government agency devoid of real clout.
                          The process could be gradual and involve: (i) development
                          and enactment of appropriate competition legislation (ii)
                          identification of an institutional set up for the competition

                          appropriate within the current legal and administrative
                          framework, (iii) identification of the degree of
                          independence and reporting requirements that guarantee
