    The scorecard evaluates the service delivery pathway through                 through the process of developing plans and sector activities,
    which the country transforms funding into sustainable services               and (3) the sustainability of the services provided.
    for water and sanitation in each of four subsectors: rural water,
    urban water, rural sanitation and hygiene, and urban sanitation              Each building block is scored from a minimum of 0 up to 3, depending
    and hygiene (table 1).                                                       on the answers to the three to five indicators per dimension.
