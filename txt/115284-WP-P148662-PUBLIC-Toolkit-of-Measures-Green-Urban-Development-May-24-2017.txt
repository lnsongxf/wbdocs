EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Background

Cities depend on a healthy natural environment that continuously provides a range
of services or benefits to society and the economy. Managing the urban environment
is, however, a complex task. Many urban cities in Africa are struggling to meet their
infrastructure needs; maintain or provide adequate service delivery; and upgrade city
systems to keep pace with the rate of change, urbanization, and population growth.
Identifying what investment is required in urban areas to enable economic activity, and to
create livable and vibrant cities in an environmentally sustainable way is the key challenge
for decision makers, but also presents significant opportunities.

The instruments included in this toolkit were identified
following a broad review of the literature and were
selected according to a number of criteria and following
discussions with relevant stakeholders around the nature
and significance of the urban environmental issues that
they face and their priorities for addressing these.




Each of the instruments described in this toolkit
may be used to address one or more environmental
externalities. The user is therefore encouraged to first
consider the nature of the externality to be addressed
(i.e. what is the problem) and the drivers of change
or causes of environmental degradation (i.e. what
are the root causes of that problem). This will in turn
help identify where efforts to reverse, or prevent
further degradation, need to be targeted. The range of
environmental issues that may be addressed by each
instrument is identified through a series of icons.

Each of the instruments is then described in terms of:

  •	 The key environmental challenges or urban
     externalities it seeks to address
  •	 The concepts and principles underlying each
     instrument (or how the instrument works in theory)
  •	 How the instrument works in practice, including
     reference to the wider policy, regulatory, legislative
     and operational considerations
  •	 Where it has been applied in practice and the key
     lessons learnt, drawing on examples from African
     cities wherever possible
Links to further information, including relevant
examples, are also provided.

A summary overview of each of the instruments covered
by this toolkit is provided in the table overleaf.

    Box 4: Sources of Finance

    Apart from conventional sources of finance, there is a range of other green financing mechanisms that may be
    considered to support activities that promote green and climate-resilient urban development. These include:

      •	 The Global Environment Facility
      •	 The Green Climate Fund
      •	 The Clean Development Mechanism
      •	 Climate Investment Funds
    Further information on each of these funds can be found in Appendix 1.

    In addition to these funds that may provide the necessary start-up capital, this toolkit also describes a number of
    financing mechanisms implementable at a local level that may support the longer-term sustainability of measures.
    These include:

      •	 Taxes or charges levied on the consumers of polluting products or users of natural resources
      •	 Payments for ecosystem services
      •	 Developer contributions
      •	 Revolving funds
      •	 Fiscal transfers

The toolkit is also not exhaustive. It focuses predominantly on policy instruments, i.e. instruments that provide
guiding principles for urban decision-makers. In practice, these are likely to be accompanied by a combination of
process, management and urban management measures4 as illustrated in the figure below.

  Box 10: Risks in Establishing and Operating Pollution Charges

  1.	 Lack of, or insufficient, data available on the damage caused by pollution which can vary from one location
      to another depending on factors such as the location of the population at risk, prevailing wind, sunshine,
      temperature.

  2.	 Challenging to set the pollution charge at the appropriate level to encourage desired behavioral change

  3.	 Political opposition to large revenue transfers from pollution sources (the firms) to the authority imposing the
      tax (government)

  4.	 Pollution can be difficult to measure and it can be costly to implement monitoring schemes, for example in the case of
      a solid waste collection charge


3.4	 Case Studies
The following case study examples illustrate applications of the instrument in different nations.


  Box 11: Emission Fees in China

  China has the most comprehensive emission charge system in the developing world. Results from an analysis of
  the system indicate that the instrument has been effective in decreasing pollution. The Chinese Levy System was
  implemented when China’s State Council began nationwide implementation of pollution charges in 1982. The system
  is applied to an extensive number of sources of air, water, solid waste, and noise pollution. Implementation has been
  widespread and the number of firms participating, and the revenues collected, have increased year on year.

  The revenues collected as levies are used to finance environmental institutional development, administration,
  environmental projects, and to provide subsidies or loans to firm-level pollution control projects. Enforcement is
  implemented via a schedule of penalties. The levy has been particularly successful in managing air and water pollution.
  Key results of the scheme include:

     •	 Pollution discharge intensities have been highly responsive to this instrument.
     •	 For air pollution, the results suggest that emissions decline by about 0.65% for each 1% increase in the
        effective levy rate. Water pollution declines by 1.08% for each 1% increase in the levy.

  Lessons Learnt
  In an attempt to curb pollution from factories, the government set up an emissions fee which was deductible from taxes
  as a business expense. In addition, a rebate system was implemented whereby 80% of a firm’s pollution charges were
  returned for investment in pollution controls. This created a disincentive for firms to invest in pollution controls lest they
  lose the privilege of paying emissions fees and gaining the rebate. The government replaced the rebate with loans in an
  attempt to solve the problem; however, enforcement has been weak.

  This example underscores the importance of matching policy designs with institutional capabilities. Any rebates offered
  must be tied to upgrading pollution controls.

  Box 12: South African Wastewater Discharge Scheme

  In South Africa, the Department of Water Affairs (DWA) has being developing and piloting the WDCS to promote
  waste reduction and water conservation. The WDCS is based on the polluter-pays principle and aims to:

     •	 Promote the sustainable development and efficient use of water resources
     •	 Promote the internalization of environmental costs by polluters
     •	 Create financial incentives for dischargers to reduce waste and use water resources in a more optimal way
     •	 Recover the costs associated with different water treatment and water quality management programs
  Many municipalities also impose charges to cover the costs of their own water treatment programs (i.e. as part of
  tier three pricing). The municipalities of eThekwini and the City of Tshwane, for example, have introduced further
  sanitation charges for wastewater discharges that exceed the pollution load of normal wastewater.

  The WDCS scheme was developed drawing on key insights from international experience and understanding of the
  challenges faced locally in a South African context. The scheme is run as an adaptive management system that seeks
  to rehabilitate and manage the local water quality problems experienced by finding mechanisms to supporting
  existing water management initiatives, as opposed to just the introduction of polluter charges. The approach taken
  makes allowances for administrative, financial and institutional frameworks.

  There are two charges associated with the WDCS:

  1.	 Waste Discharge Levy (WD Levy): Charges that provide a disincentive or deterrent to the discharge of waste,
      based on the use of the resource as a means of disposing waste.

  2.	 Waste Mitigation Charge (WMC): Charges to cover the costs of measures to mitigate waste discharge related
      impacts.

  The DWA is responsible for the national roll-out of the WDCS. National Treasury, together with DWA, retains
  oversight to ensure good governance and appropriate fiduciary management. Catchment Management Agencies
  (CMAs) are responsible for implementation, including planning, identifying dischargers, invoicing, debt collection
  and financial management, disbursement, and monitoring and evaluation. The DWA implements the charge in cases
  where there is no CMA.

  Implementation of the WDCS requires :

     •	 That all municipalities (and any other direct discharger) will have to pay to discharge treated effluent to any
        watercourse.
     •	 Process control and other operations at all wastewater treatment works are effective and reliable.
        Monitoring of the receiving water environment to determine any detrimental impact from the discharge.
     •	 Updates, modifications or revisions of the sewage disposal bylaws that were in force prior to the
        implementation of the WDCS. Although the previous municipal bylaws included the polluter-pays principle
        via the right to recover costs related to objectionable discharges by a polluter, these clauses in the bylaws
        had to be drawn out more strongly. Furthermore, the bylaws must give the Municipality sufficient powers to
        investigate and identify the actual source of any objectionable discharges into the sewers, thus ensuring it is
        the actual polluter who pays for any activity that leads to additional (Tier 2, 3 and 4 ) deterrent charges.

comparison to traditional sources, technological issues,
lack of infrastructure, lack of information and socio-
cultural issues. In practice, national governments may
need to adopt a number of policies to achieve the
desired change in fuel use. These may include:

  •	 Creation of clean cooking fuel initiatives at national
     level;
  •	 Introduction of financial instruments to address
     economic barriers to clean cooking fuels; and

4.4	 Case Studies
The zero VAT on LPG approach has been adopted in a
number of countries including Uganda, Senegal, Botswana
and India. The following case study examples illustrate
applications of the instrument in different nations.


  Box 13: Case Study of Tax Exemptions on Alternative Fuels, Uganda

  Between 2005 and 2006, 78% of Ugandan households depended on firewood and 18% depended on charcoal
  for cooking. Charcoal was mainly used in urban areas while firewood was more prominent in rural areas.
  Overall, 96% of the households depended on wood fuel for cooking. The Ugandan government was motivated
  to encourage poorer households to switch to LPG to achieve improved human health outcomes and human
  development. By implementing a zero VAT scheme on LPG, the government forfeited revenue worth USh3.4
  billion, equivalent to US$2.1 million, the first year of implementation.

  Initial analysis of the scheme highlighted challenges in establishing access to LPG by the rural poor, since retail
  outlets had not expanded beyond urban areas. Secondly, the retail prices for LPG did not decrease after the
  removal of the VAT. This suggests that the importing companies benefited from the removal of VAT more than
  consumers.

  Lessons learnt from the scheme were the importance of identifying, before implementation, whether poor
  households can afford LPG even with zero VAT applied. In the Uganda case it was found that the tax exemption
  was not sufficient to stimulate demand from the poor because the cost of even the smallest LPG cylinder was
  still beyond the reach of the very poor.

  Box 14: Case Study of Tax Exemptions on Alternative Fuels, Senegal

  Evidence from a zero VAT scheme implemented in Senegal indicates that widespread use of LPG can reduce
  deforestation and improve the quality of life for poorer households.

  Senegal initially implemented an LPG program in 1974, at a time when wood fuel consumption accounted for
  approximately 90% of energy use. This high level of dependency on wood fuel was negatively impacting the
  country’s natural forest. It was also a time-intensive burden to women who spent a large portion of their time
  collecting firewood.

  The LPG program was implemented with the introduction of 2.75 kg capacity gas bottles, on which all import
  duty was removed on the bottle and corresponding cooker. Initially the gas was not subsidized, however, in
  1976 the Senegalese Government elected to subsidize the 2.75 kg gas cylinders and withdrew tax exemption on
  imported equipment. In 1983, in response to the needs of large families, a larger cooker model, the Nopale was
  introduced in Senegal, adapted to fit a 6 kg capacity cylinder.

  Problems arose with the subsidies, as by 1998, LPG had penetrated households of both poor and rich families
  and by 1994, subsidies had risen to a high US$10 million. Using subsidies in Uganda has been a considerable
  expense to the government. However, positive environmental outcomes have been achieved as deliveries of
  wood fuel in Dakar declined while LPG deliveries rose.

  According to estimates from the Senegalese Ministry of Energy, the growth in LPG use resulted in annual savings
  of approximately 70,000 tons of wood fuel and 90,000 tons of charcoal since the program commenced.

  Box 15: Case Study of Deposit Refund System in South Africa: Rubber Tire Recycling

  The South African National Waste Management Strategy and the Waste Management Bill are based on the
  Polluter Pays Principle (PPP) and holds households and companies responsible for paying the costs associated
  with the waste that they produce*.

  The National Waste Management Strategy recommends that DRS are most suitable for products that are easy
  to identify and handle, feasible to re-use or recycle, require careful disposal and where co-operation is feasible
  between producers, retailers and consumers.

  There are a number of private sector industry-initiated DRS in South Africa, that cover glass, plastic beverage
  containers and steel beverage cans. Under these schemes the consumer pays a deposit per bottle and receives a
  refund per bottle upon return to a retailer.

  A tire recycling scheme was implemented in South Africa in response to the growing awareness of the scale of
  the illegal disposal of scrap tires and the environmental problems that they cause; For example, scrap tire piles
  are a reasonably common sight in urban areas in developing cities. These scrap tire piles are a fire hazard and
  can burn for lengthy periods releasing toxic chemicals. Abandoned scrap tires also act as breeding grounds for
  mosquitoes and can leach toxic chemicals into groundwater. Disposal of whole tires in landfills creates problems
  as the tires tend to rise to the surface.

  The Recycling and Economic Development Initiative of South Africa (REDISA) Integrated Industry Waste Tire
  Management Plan was approved in 2012 by the Minister of Water and Environmental Affairs to tackle these
  problems. REDISA is an independent body that is separate from the tire industry. The tire management plan
  was implemented to deal with the extensive number of waste tires and to create income generating activities.
  Manufacturers and tire importers are charged a levy of R2.30 plus VAT on every kilogram of new rubber tire
  and the cost of waste tire collection is passed on to consumers. The revenue generated by the levy is used to
  subsidize the collection and recycling of the waste tires and acts as an incentive for consumers to return the tires
  to a location where they can be appropriately disposed. It is estimated that the plan will generate approximately
  10,000 income-generating opportunities** and by mid-2014, more than 17,000 tons of used tires had been
  collected and diverted from landfill by REDISA***. As a result of the scheme, South Africa’s waste tire recycling
  rate has increased from 4% to 19% by the end of 2014.

section sets out a selection of case studies focusing on Tanzania, Peru and the USA.


  Box 16: Eastern Arc Mountains Conservation Endowment Fund, Tanzania

  The Eastern Arc Mountains are a globally recognized biodiversity hot spot, with high levels of endemism.
  They are also an important source of water and hydroelectric power for many Tanzanians.

  The Eastern Arc Mountains Conservation Endowment Fund is a trust fund that was established in 2001 as a
  joint initiative between the Government of Tanzania, the World Bank, the Global Environmental Facility, and
  the Fund’s Board of Trustees. It aims to provide reliable and long-term financing for community development,
  biodiversity conservation and applied research projects in the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania.
  The Fund is managed by a Board of Trustees which provides policy guidance and oversight control of the
  Fund’s activities and operations. Fundraising is a key element of the Fund’s activities; amongst others, the
  Government of Norway has committed US$5,947,700 to the Fund over a five-year period from 2011. The Fund
  has the institutional and operational capacity to receive, manage and disburse monies from this and other
  commitments, and has therefore developed a reputation for transparency and good governance.

  Box 19: Case Study of Thai Energy Conservation Promotion Fund

  In 2003, the Government of Thailand launched the Thai Energy Efficiency Revolving Fund (EERF) as part of its
  Energy Conservation Program. The EERF seeks to support investment into energy efficiency as a means of
  reducing Thailand’s GHG emissions. The fund was established to address key barriers to investment in energy
  efficiency that are present within the Thai financial sector. Investing in energy efficiency was perceived to be
  high risk with little demand, prior to the establishment of the EERF. However, the EERF has proven successful in
  obtaining private capital through low-interest loans to banks, which in turn finance energy efficiency projects
  with favorable interest rate loans. The Fund provides capital at no cost to Thai banks when it is used to fund
  energy efficiency projects.

  The EERF is financed through levies on petroleum and has an annual income of approximately US$225 million.
  The financing model adopted by the EERF is simple and is easily replicable in other countries. Replicating this
  model in other applying the model in other economies would require:

     •	 A revolving pool of funds from which to provide loans
     •	 Agreement from the finance sector (banks and other financial institutions) to participate in the financing
        model;
     •	 Commitment of a small number of staff from a government agency to establish the financing model and to
        carry out a small proportion of the work involved in assessing loan applications, administering loans and
        promoting the financing model.

Box 21: Ecological Fiscal Transfers

Ecological fiscal transfers act as an incentive to municipalities for biodiversity conservation and the provision of
ecosystem services and are an example of a specific-purpose fiscal transfer. To bring accountability in the use of
funds, the recipient states and local bodies are required to meet certain conditions. These conditions include a
clear statement of the objective and how the funds will be spent to achieve the objective, with clear targets for
achieving the objectives. Local governments must demonstrate that the funds are spent on a verifiable project
with measurable ecological benefits. That is, grants must be linked to physical outcomes and are independently
assessed using an accredited auditing and evaluation system.

The instrument provides a method for compensating the local and state public actors for their contribution
to public ecological objectives; essentially the transfers redistribute public revenue from federal and
regional governments to local governments. The mechanism also has the potential to be used to finance the
establishment of other public services that have environmental benefits such as wastewater treatment facilities.
For example, transfers could facilitate the construction of wastewater treatment infrastructure and other
establishment costs, that local governments typically have trouble financing.

There are an increasing number of ecological fiscal transfer programs with schemes operating in Brazil, the USA,
India, China, and South Africa.

In the case of Brazil, the central government has been financing conservation through ecological fiscal transfers
since the 1990s. Recognizing that it is difficult for municipalities to generate income from conservation and
related ecosystem services, a number of Brazilian States agreed to establish an ICMS Ecológico. The ICMS
(Imposto sobre Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços) is a tax on goods and services, similar to the value-added
taxes in other countries. 5% of the revenues from the ICMS are distributed to municipalities with conservation
units or protected areas or those that supply water to neighboring municipalities. The State allocates more
revenues to those municipalities with the greatest amount of area under environmental protection. Essentially
this means that local governments are compensated for land-use restrictions associated with conservation and
the provision of ecosystem services, such as protected areas and watershed protection by providing them with
financial incentives for conservation.

The instrument provides a method for compensating the local and state public actors for their contribution
to public ecological objectives; essentially the transfers redistribute public revenue from federal and regional
governments to local governments.

In order to implement the mechanism, some amendments to current state laws were necessary, including the
addition of environmental indicators to the existing criteria for revenue sharing. Indicators are largely related
to land use restrictions, such as protected areas within a municipality, but some States incorporated indicators
related to environmental public services, such as degree of sanitation and of adequate waste disposal in the
municipality.

The success of a fiscal transfer instrument depends on the following criteria:

   •	 Revenue adequacy: the subnational authorities should have sufficient resources, with the transfers, to
      undertake the designated responsibilities.
   •	 Equity: transfer should vary directly with local fiscal needs and inversely with local fiscal capacity.
   •	 Transparency and stability: the schemes should be announced and each locality should be able to forecast
      its own total revenue (including transfers) in order to prepare its budget. Schemes should be stable for a
      minimum of 3-5 years to allow long-term planning at the local level.
   •	 Capacity building is extremely important in order to allow local organizations and firms to take over once
      the fiscal transfers have ended

7.3.7	   Technical Issues
There are a number of technical issues that need to be addressed when designing and implementing any PES
scheme. Some of the most significant of these are described below8.	


    Establishing the                      The baseline is critical as this facilitates monitoring which in turn is necessary to
    baseline                              check that the services being paid for are actually being delivered. The baseline
                                          represents the likely future provision of the relevant ecosystem service in the absence
                                          of the PES scheme. This should take account of any existing (or anticipated future)
                                          regulatory requirements, as well as the impacts of climate change in future changes
                                          in commodity prices in so for as possible. At a minimum sellers would be expected to
                                          comply with regulatory requirements and so would only receive payments for service
                                          delivery that is additional to this.


    Issues of land                        For PES to work, it is necessary to establish land tenure or use rights. This may be
    ownership and                         challenging in places where property rights are not well defined; insecure land and
    property rights                       resource tenure of many poor people remains a key obstacle to them participating in
                                          and benefiting from PES schemes.

                                          However, formal land title does not necessarily preclude PES from working. In Uganda,
                                          for example*, while proof of ownership is necessary to enroll in a carbon credit-
                                          funded forest restoration program, proof, can come in the form
                                          of a proper land title, or approval and endorsement by the local council. The key is to
                                          firmly establish ownership within the structures of the local community.

                                          Projects carried out on communal lands can also work, but require a different
                                          payment mechanism. For example, the Uganda Wildlife Authority’s (UWA) cooperative
                                          management framework shares 20% of all park entry fees with local communities.
                                          UWA has established Community Protected Area Institutions (CPIs) based on
                                          community leadership structures associated with local parishes. CPIs serve as an
                                          advisory body and liaison between the community and UWA. They help communities
                                          identify development projects of interest and then present project proposals to the
                                          Chief Park Warden who allocates funds to the districts to implement projects.

    Deciding on the                       PES can be implemented at a variety of scales. In some cases, the scale will necessarily
    appropriate scale                     be determined by the scale at which the benefits of the ecosystem service(s) in
                                          question accrue, for example, in the case of hydrological services from watershed
                                          PES schemes. Larger-scale schemes may offer economies of scale (e.g. in relation to
                                          transactions costs) and reduce the risk of leakage while smaller schemes may offer
                                          more flexibility, allow more targeted interventions and better prospects for engaging
                                          with individuals buyers and sellers. However, in some cases smaller schemes may not
                                          have a sufficient number of sellers to provide or maintain the required level of service.


    Identifying the                       It is necessary to identify and agree the specific interventions needed to achieve
    most appropriate                      the scheme objectives. These may include ecosystem restoration, ecosystem
    interventions                         rehabilitation, prevention of ecosystem conversion, prevention of ecosystem
                                          degradation, improved land management.

                                          This in turn requires that there is a demonstrable link between the interventions
                                          proposed and the ecosystem benefits of interest. The stronger the cause-effect
                                          relationship, the easier it is likely to be to attract buyers into a PES agreement.

                                •	   build confidence in, and a common vision for, the scheme and
                                •	   increase the commitment and participation of stakeholders in its ongoing implementation
                                •	   This in turn requires early identification of the participants and partners critical for implementing
                                     activities and reaching objectives.


  Determining the price         The appropriate level of payments need to be negotiated between buyers and sellers,
  and willingness-to-pay        perhaps facilitated by a broker. Ultimately, the price will reflect what the buyer is
                                willing to pay and what the seller is willing to accept in return for delivering the
                                service. Negotiations to establish price can take into account:

                                •	 the opportunity costs to the seller in terms of income foregone from alternative land use or land
                                   management practices, both now and in the future
                                •	 start-up and ongoing maintenance costs
                                •	 transactions costs, i.e. the costs associated with establishing the scheme
                                •	 the costs of alternatives, i.e. what would it cost to achieve the same benefit using a different
                                   solution.


  Aggregating buyers and        An aggregation of buyers and sellers may be necessary to achieve certain thresholds.
  sellers                       For instance, transactions costs may be reduced where it is possible to work with
                                established groups rather than having to negotiate agreements with multiple
                                individuals. Similarly, it is necessary to ensure that are is a sufficient number of
                                sellers to provide and maintain the required level of service. On the demand side,
                                there needs to be a sufficient number of willing buyers to cover the total costs of the
                                scheme.


  Understanding the             It is important that all stakeholders within a PES scheme understand the nature
  nature and significance       and significance of any risks involved and that appropriate mitigation measures are
  of the risks involved         identified and built into scheme design as far as possible.


  Ongoing monitoring            For schemes to succeed in the long-term, it is necessary to establish a monitoring
  and evaluation                framework, including indicators, to evaluate the impact of the activity over time.



7.4	 Case Studies
While there are numerous examples of PES schemes around the world, those that are documented tend to focus on
carbon storage and sequestration, biodiversity and watershed services. The examples illustrate how PES can also be
applied in an urban context and typically involves urban residents (or municipalities on behalf of residents, or water
companies on behalf of its customers) paying upstream (often peri-urban or rural) land managers for activities that
will enhance the supply of good quality water.

Box 23: Equitable Payments for Watershed Services (EPWS) in the Uluguru Mountains, Tanzania

The EPWS program is a Payments for Watershed Services (PWS) scheme in in the Morogoro region of the
Uluguru mountains in Tanzania piloted by WWF and CARE*. Before the scheme started in 2006, unsustainable
farming practices and land use change in the Kibungo subcatchment were reducing water quality in the
catchment through an average annual increase in turbidity of 5 NTUs (Nephelometric Turbidity Units).
This reduction in water quality was imposing increased water treatment costs on two of the region’s largest
urban industrial water users, Dar Es Salaam Water and Sewerage Corporation (DAWASCO) and Coca-Cola
Kwanza Ltd. Subsequently, WWF-CARE facilitated the creation of a PES scheme whereby these major industrial
water consumers would pay upstream sellers from Lukenge, Kibungo, Lanzi, Dimilo and Nyingwa villages to
adopt more water-friendly agricultural practices. In coordination with a number of local groups including the
Uluguru Nature Reserve (UNR) Office and Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA), farmers from participating
villages were paid to adopt a combined structural (including terracing), vegetative (including reforestation) and
agronomic (including intercropping with fruit trees) approach to improve downstream water quality. Payments
are administered on completion of a given set of conservation activities, and overseen by village governments
who manage the relationship between farmers and the main urban users.

As a result of the scheme, sediment levels in the catchment have fallen and the productivity of participating
farmers’ has increased over threefold in places, with the mean number of meals per day rising from one and
a half in 2008 to three now.

One of the main challenges that the project encountered was engagement with smallholders in poverty.
Many workers in the participating villages are landless or own less than 0.5 ha, over 65 years old, or do not
possess sufficient labor power to implement the conservation measures which are subsequently rewarded.
The project required the development of additional strategies for enabling the participation of these groups.

Box 24: Heredia Public Service Enterprise PES Scheme, Costa Rica

Empresa de Servicios Públicos de Heredia (ESPH), or Heredia Public Service Enterprise, is a private water company
serving the city of Heredia in Costa Rica. The company was concerned about the potential impact of population
growth in the demand region on water supply, especially during the dry season when groundwater becomes the
only viable source*. Informed by willingness-to-pay studies, ESPH added an extra charge to water bills for users
in Heredia. The funds raised through this extra tariff are invested by the company in upland catchment protection
and reforestation, which includes strategic planting in areas of high vulnerability. The results generated through
this funding are vetted by professional foresters, and the scheme has successfully safeguarded the company’s
future and mitigated risks to the city’s water supply.

Some of the important factors behind the scheme’s success include the guaranteed flow of funding a as a
result of the mandatory tariff added to all consumers’ water bills that allows for strategic planning and program
security, and the funds generated by the scheme being transparently placed into a fund whose sole purpose is to
invest in catchment conservation. This transparency helps minimize the threat of corruption or leakage. However,
the scheme has also dealt with challenges. One of the predominant challenges is that the national regulatory
authority did not accept the conclusions of the company’s WTP schemes and approved a mandatory tariff that
was significantly lower than the company had determined users would accept. This has limited the extent of the
funding available, constraining conservation efforts in the catchment.

There are also some more sophisticated examples of PES-like schemes including developer contributions and credit
trading schemes. While these may contain an element of ‘polluter pays’ in some circumstances, for example, where
investments are made to offset environmental externalities elsewhere, they do nevertheless operate on the principle
that land managers are rewarded for the ecosystem services they provide. An example of a credit trading program is
provided below. Similar schemes are now in operation in hundreds of US cities.


  Box 25: Washington, D.C. Stormwater Retention Credit Trading Program

  Stormwater run-off is one of the biggest and fastest-growing source of water pollution in Washington D.C. where
  up to thirteen billion liters of run-off and sewage flow into local rivers that course into the Chesapeake Bay
  estuary each year.

  Because of this threat to local waterways, the nation’s capital is among more than 700 U.S. cities that are
  required by Federal regulation to invest in new infrastructure to manage stormwater runoff. The District has one
  of the country’s oldest sewage systems, which during moderate rain, sends untreated waste and pollution-laden
  run-off overflowing into the city streets and watershed. This severely degrades aquatic habitat and impacts
  industries within the Chesapeake Bay, North America’s most productive estuary.

  Typically, stormwater management makes use of engineered infrastructure to compensate for a regulating
  ecosystem service that no longer works well in cities because so much area is built and paved over. Stormwater
  infrastructure in many places is easily overwhelmed as severe storms are becoming more frequent. The
  alternative to constructing more hard infrastructure is to re-create, or approximate, the processes nature uses to
  handle stormwater in the first place.

  In 2013, the District Department of the Environment (DDOE) within Washington, D.C. adopted local stormwater
  regulations with an innovative trading program that allows property owners (including homeowners, churches
  and, businesses) who voluntarily implement green infrastructure that reduces stormwater runoff to earn
  credits. Developers who are required to manage stormwater runoff on projects, can then meet the regulatory
  requirements by purchasing credits from offsite designs that reduce stormwater runoff, like rain gardens, green
  roofs, permeable pavement and other green infrastructure practices. The idea is that by giving other properties
  throughout the district a financial incentive to trap runoff on their own land, the city can capture more “first
  flush” water—the initial rainfall that catches the most pollution—before it hits the rivers.

                                                                        -benefits, including expanded green space,
  Investments in green infrastructure also provide a host of valuable co­
  reduced localized flooding, and jobs to build and maintain green infrastructure sites.

interface, where urban and rural land uses mix and often
clash. Environmental impacts of particular concern in
these urban and peri-urban areas include agricultural
land loss and degradation, water resource exploitation,
and waste disposal. CBNRM is an approach that can lead
to the restoration of ecological balance in such degraded
and fragile ecosystems.

8.3.1	   Risks
Risks with CBNRM include community level conflicts over
how resources are shared or managed and who profits
from management interventions. High expectations and
poor capacity building in local communities can lead to
frustration, slow progress and ultimately projects not
achieving their objectives.


8.3.2	   Challenges
Challenges are largely context-specific, but in many parts
of Africa informal land tenure is a barrier to CBNRM.
Group ownership and territorial rights may be novel
concepts for communities resident in target areas.
Individual benefits can also be small as income is split
between multiple households across communities.


8.4	 Case Studies
There are a number of case studies of successful CBNRM
from around the world. These include:


  Box 27: CAMPFIRE Program, Zimbabwe

  The CAMPFIRE program (Communal Areas Management Program for Indigenous Resources) is a program
  designed to value wildlife as a renewable nature resource. It allocates ownership of wildlife to indigenous
  populations.

  At the height of the CAMPFIRE program, 60 rural district councils participated, resulting in villagers benefitting
  from trophy hunting, while others embarked on a number of income-generating projects such as meat cropping,
  fishing, Mopani worms sales and safari operations. Between 1989 and 2004, the program raised about US$30
  million, which was ploughed back into communities, leading to improved wildlife management and better
  livelihoods.

  Box 28: Kam’mwamba Community Integrated Natural Resource Management and Use Project, Malawi

  The Kam’mwamba community had experienced heavy deforestation from both commercial and local exploitation
  of 3000 hectares of indigenous forest. The Community Integrated Natural Resource Management and Use
  Project aimed to identify economic value in the indigenous forests and devise incentives through which the
  community could benefit from such value, while also conserving the forests. Economic value was identified in the
  harvesting and marketing of non-timber forest products. The success of the project demonstrated the benefits
  of sustainable livelihood and environmental management strategies that build on community resilience. It also
  showed that adaptive capacity lessens the vulnerability of the community to future climate change.

  The Global Environmental Facility (GEF) provides
  grants and funding that assist in protecting the
  global environment and in promoting environmental
  sustainable development. It serves as a financial
  mechanism for five international environmental
  conventions:

  •	 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)
  •	 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
     Change (UNFCCC)
  •	 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants
     (POPs)
  •	 United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification
  •	 Minamata Convention on Mercury

  The Facility administers four trust funds: the Global
  Environmental Facility Trust Fund, Least Developed
  Countries Trust Fund, Special Climate Change Trust Fund,
  and the Nagoya Protocol Implementation Fund. GEF
  support for environmental sustainable development
  projects is provided to government agencies, civil society

  Green Climate Fund                                           http://www.greenclimate.fund/the-fund/the-big-
  The Green Climate Fund (GCF) mobilizes funding to low-       picture#mission
  emission and climate-resilient projects in developing
  countries, with an even split between adaptation and
  mitigation projects. Its funds are focused particularly
  on countries that are especially vulnerable to climate
  change: Least Developed Countries, Small Island
  Developing States, and African States. The Fund is an
  operating entity of the UNFCCC.


  Clean Development Mechanism                                  http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/
  The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is a climate           clean_development_mechanism/items/2718.php
  change mitigation instrument defined by the Kyoto
  Protocol. The CDM allows countries with an emission-
  reduction or limitation commitment under the Kyoto
  Protocol to establish emission-reduction projects in
  developing countries. Such projects generate certified
  emission reduction credits, which contribute toward
  Kyoto targets. Some 1,650 CDM projects have been
  started since the CDM’s implementation in 2006.
