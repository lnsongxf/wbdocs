       I.             Introduction

Over the past decade, Latin American and Caribbean countries achieved strong growth and shared
prosperity. Yet, as commodity tailwinds have receded, South American countries in particular face the
challenge of securing and expanding these social achievements in a sustainable manner, namely based on
productivity growth. Spurring firm-level productivity upgrading in ways that ensure shared prosperity has
become a top priority for the region.

The growth implications of technology adoption are well understood. Productivity upgrading through
creative destruction is the main driver of long-run per-capita income growth. This dynamic involves the
commercialization of frontier technologies, the adoption of existing improvements in managerial and
production technologies by firms, and the reallocation of resources across industries and across firms within
industries (Aghion and Howitt, 2009, Comin and Ferrer, 2013).

The distributional impact of technology adoption is more complex. The existing literature suggests that the
impact is ambiguous. On the one hand, technology adoption can lead to income inequality if the benefits
are disproportionately appropriated by owners of physical capital or managers and high-skill workers able
to implement new technologies, without sufficient benefit to low-income or less skilled workers. At the
limit, specific types of technology adoption that substitute machines for labor can make certain categories
of workers redundant and unemployable (see Acemoglu and Autor (2011) and the related large literature
on automation and skill-biased technological change). For example, technology adoption has recently been
associated with a decline in mid-skill occupations relative to low- and high-skill ones in the United States
(Autor and Dorn, 2013).

On the other hand, automation and other forms of technology adoption may complement labor, decreasing
variable costs and increasing productivity, thereby raising output in ways that lead to higher demand for
labor and increased earnings (Autor 2015). Such types of technology adoption and catch-up innovation that
generate higher productivity, employment and sales, when spurred by a competitive business environment,
have been recently shown to be associated with a larger employment share of low-skilled and female
workers by an empirical study of over 26,000 manufacturing establishments across 15 OECD and 56
developing countries (see Dutz, Kessides, O’Connell and Willig, 2012). This finding suggests more
inclusive firm growth from innovation and technology adoption. The use of the internet and the presence
of job training programs are shown in these data to make significant contributions at every stage of the flow
from ideas to inclusive employment growth.2 And in a recent theoretical task-based model where labor has

 The finding by Dutz, Kessides, O’Connell and Willig (2012) that new technology-adopting innovating firms have
higher employment growth rates and employ a higher share of unskilled and female workers than non-innovating

                                                               2
a comparative advantage in more complex versions of automated tasks, Acemoglu and Restrepo (2016)
demonstrate that although automation tends to reduce employment and the share of labor in national
income, the creation of more complex tasks has the opposite effect. In an extension of their model to include
workers of different skill levels, they find that wage inequality increases with increased automation and the
creation of new complex tasks in the short-run, but low-skill workers gain relative to capital in the medium
term to the extent that tasks become standardized and the productivity of low-skill workers increases over
time as learning pushes their wages up.

The impacts of the adoption of digital technologies on employment—on total employment, on employment
shifts across sectors, and by skill levels—are empirical questions. Brambilla (2017) expands the recent task-
based models of technical progress and labor markets to allow for firm heterogeneity and wages that vary
across firms, to derive a set of predictions of the impact of firm investment in ICT on employment and
wages, depending on the skill types of workers. In her model, skilled workers can be combined with ICT,
which increases their productivity and reduces the firm’s cost of production. The model allows for varying
degrees of complementarity or substitution between ICT and skilled workers, while ICT and unskilled
workers are always substitutes. Each task can be performed by skilled or unskilled workers, with the output
of each task also being an endogenous choice. There is a fixed adjustment cost of investing in ICT, so not
all firms decide to invest. Heterogeneity in productivity across firms is responsible for differences across
firms in size, employment, skill composition, task complexity and ICT investment decisions. Skilled-
augmenting productivity differences generate differences in the skill ratio and in task complexity across
firms. Finally, rent-sharing wage schedules generate wages levels and skilled to unskilled worker wage
ratios that vary across firms. The difference in the responsiveness of the wages of skilled and unskilled
workers in reaction to an increase in firm profits generates differences in wage inequality across firms. Key
model predictions that we explore concern within-firm changes due to ICT investments related to unskilled
and skilled worker employment and wages. The effect of ICT investments on both unskilled and skilled
employment is ambiguous. When a firm invests in ICT, output increases due to the reduction in variable
costs, working through a reduction in prices. The increase in total output increases the output of all tasks,
including both skilled and unskilled tasks. However, at the same time, three substitution effects operate
against the employment of unskilled workers: fewer tasks are performed by unskilled workers as they are
replaced by tasks employing ICT and skilled workers; the activity levels of unskilled/non-complex tasks
are reduced in favor of the activity levels of the now less-expensive tasks employing ICT and skilled


                                                            
firms does not establish that as a result of technology adoption the earnings of unskilled and female workers become
higher, nor that their income growth is faster than the skilled, nor that some of them are caused to gain higher skills.
That paper’s data did not permit these questions to be addressed.

                                                               3
workers, conditional on output; and output shifts to the firms that become relatively more productive due
to their relatively more intense employment of both ICT and skilled workers. For skilled workers, while
these three substitution effects work in their favor, a fourth substitution effect, namely the possibility of
ICT replacing skilled labor, may work against them. On the other hand, ICT adoption may support
increased skilled employment inasmuch as they are net complements at the level of task performance. So
while the overall effects of ICT adoption on employment are theoretically ambiguous, sufficiently strong
output effects can increase both skilled and unskilled employment, while likely substitution effects can
increase the ratio of skilled to unskilled labor. Finally, wages may increase for both skilled and unskilled
workers due to rent-sharing wage schedules.

These theoretical perspectives are a substantial aid in delineating the relevant empirical and policy issues
surrounding the extent and incidence of recent and forthcoming technology-driven economic growth. For
example, according to Pagés (2010), there has been a lack of dynamism in the creation and expansion of
productive firms and the exit of unproductive firms within Latin American and Caribbean countries relative
to advanced economies. Nonetheless, there likely remains substantial potential for the within-firm channel
of productivity gains from technology adoption to be a driver of broader income and aggregate productivity
growth, and for such effects to ultimately be magnified by spurring more inter-firm dynamism.3

The objective of this paper is to provide a better empirical understanding of the impact of digital technology
adoption in Brazil on jobs, wage levels and wage inequality economy-wide and across skill levels and
industry groups. Our analysis is enabled by novel data that detail the fact that in Brazil the internet was
rolled out in a staggered fashion over time from 2000 to 2014 across different municipalities. We are able
to categorize our analyses by the industry groups that are primary (agriculture, fishing and mining),
secondary (manufacturing) and tertiary (including finance & insurance, real estate, transport & storage,
utilities, construction, hospitality, wholesale & retail and public administration), as well as disaggregated
by employment-skill terciles. We use comprehensive matched employee-employer longitudinal data and
quantify aggregate effects of the introduction of internet access in municipalities on local industry clusters
and labor markets.

  In a related study, Song, Price, Guvenen and Bloom (2016) construct a matched employer-employee data set for
US firms. They show that virtually all of the rise in earnings dispersion among workers is accounted for by
increasing dispersion in average wages paid by the employers of these individuals – namely the increase in
individual inequality can be accounted for mainly by increases in cross-firm inequality, while the overall earnings
dispersion within firms did not increase. Ongoing work of theirs is exploring the extent to which the increase in
cross-firm inequality in the US is driven by growing productivity differential across firms versus increased sorting
(that firms over time have been employing workers from narrower skills groups, with some firms paying much
higher average wages than before because their average worker quality has increased). We intend to replicate the
Song et al. approach for Brazil as part of a separate research project.

                                                               4
The next section describes our novel data. Section III presents our empirical strategy and findings. A final
section concludes, including a discussion of some relevant policy considerations. In summary, we find that
economy-wide, internet adoption has no statistically significant net effect on aggregate employment and
has a negative effect on average wages, with a reduction in measures of wage dispersion. The absence of
economy-wide significant net employment effects masks important shifts in employment from sectors with
more limited expansion opportunities—wholesale and retail trade, public administration and largely
publicly-owned utilities that comprise almost half of the formal workforce in 2010—to sectors with more
output expansion possibilities. Employment effects are positive and most pronounced in manufacturing,
transport and storage, finance and insurance, and hospitality industry groups. Importantly, internet adoption
in manufacturing industries is inclusive, with positive employment and wage effects across high and
medium-skill workers.

    II.     Data

We combine the rich, comprehensive data from Brazil containing annual matched employee-employer
records with annual municipality-level information on the availability of internet to investigate the effects
of technology intensity on the labor market outcomes of workers.

Labor market metrics are derived from the Annual Social Information Survey (RAIS), which contains
annual wage earnings and occupation information for all formally-employed workers in Brazil in all sectors,
including agriculture, manufacturing and services. Each record is comprised of annual employer-reported
data on the firm’s industrial classification and each worker’s hours, earnings, hiring/dismissal dates (if
applicable), occupational classification, education level and age. The RAIS data importantly contain
identifiers for both workers and employing firms; that is, because this is a longitudinal data set both for
firms and workers, we are able to analyze worker employment histories for the entirety of their duration in
the formal sector within our sample period, and within and across firms, occupations, and industries. Using
the RAIS microdata, we construct an annual municipality-level dataset that contains aggregate indicators
of employment, wages, worker turnover (based on hires and fires), number of firms and firm size.

To map the internet rollout in Brazil, we construct a new data set based on answers to questions on internet
availability from the School Census, an annual survey of all schools in the country. We use this seemingly
unrelated data-source because other more common sources—such as official telecoms data, Census,
household and ICT surveys—are either too recent or do not allow municipal level disaggregation. Official
data on internet availability at the municipal level (ANATEL) are only available from 2007 onward, by
which time most municipalities had access. PNAD, the Brazilian household survey, only allows for spatial
disaggregation at the state level. TIC Empresa, a specific survey of internet use by households and firms,

                                                     5
only allows an even more coarse spatial disaggregation, at macro-region, and is available only from 2005
onward, well after the most important phase of internet rollout. These data are also repeated cross-sections,
preventing us from following the same firm over time. Finally, Census data, which contain questions on
internet availability at the household level, are only available for 2000 and 2010.

The School Census is an administrative record filed by all preschool, primary and secondary schools in the
country, both public and private. Since 2000, the school level form has included a question on internet
availability at the school. The question on internet access has been available in all rounds of the School
Census since 2000. We aggregate the data at the municipal level, using the share of schools with internet
access as a proxy for internet availability in the municipality. The reliability of this measure is based on the
assumption that the share of schools that have internet access reflects general accessibility of internet
connections, and that internet access is not discretely off and then on at the municipality, but rather changes
continuously over time. Our results are robust to the alternative of defining internet access in a municipality
as discretely on for the first year in which more than 10 or 25% of schools report internet access, but in our
primary estimations we maintain the share measure as our principal regressor. Table 1 contains summary
statistics of the combined data set.

There are 5,574 unique municipalities across 14 years of data from 2000 to 2013, with the mean
municipality-year observation having approximately 465 firms employing more than 9,000 workers with
an average firm size of just over 21 employees. Figures 1 and 2 show municipalities that had internet
connections in 1999 and 2009, respectively (note that these are descriptive, and are not representing our

    III.      Empirical strategy and findings

As our empirical strategy, we use within-municipality variation in internet access over time to estimate
measures of labor market dynamics in a standard difference-in-differences framework, given by:

    (1)                               ,               ,        ,      Γ    Π          ,


Equation (1) relates the focal labor market metric in municipality i in year t measured at the end of each
calendar year to internet infrastructure availability Z in the same municipality and year, and lagged year,
conditional on vectors of municipality and year fixed effects in Γ and Π , respectively.

The coefficient      then gives the change in the outcome measure for a unit increase in internet access from
the previous to the current year, conditional on the increase experienced in the previous year. Including this
term alone, however, would not capture effects that may occur only through longer-term adjustments to
prices or productivity. For this reason, it is also important to recognize that firms with market incentives
will react to lower marginal costs from increased productivity and seek to raise their output. Depending on
the competitive structure of their output markets, firms will be motivated and able to sell more at lower
prices in reaction to their lower marginal costs. This is a critical force to take into account, as added output
raises demand for labor quite apart from the substitution or complementarity effects between technology
shifts and tasks handled by different categories of labor. To test whether this may be the case, we have
added to the specification a one-year-lagged measure of internet access,          ,       , with these lagged effects
captured in      . The coefficients       and   are additive, allowing us to interpret their sum as the cumulative
effect on the focal outcome in the two-year span following an increase in internet access.

For our analysis below, all dependent variable outcomes are in natural logs, and internet access is measured
as the fraction of schools that have an internet connection in the municipality. It is important to note that
the difference-in-differences approach identifies only short-run effects occurring within the one-year or
two-year frequency with which we observe changes in internet access in a municipality. That is, the
coefficient      is interpreted to be the percent change in the outcome metric between year t-1 and t for a
municipality with zero percent internet access in t-1 and 100 percent access in t. Our estimated effects are
net of other channels through which improvements in internet infrastructure affect firms and local labor
markets other than firm internet use per se. For example, the municipal upgrade can affect other local
economic actors that interact with the firm: local competitors may become more efficient, or local
customers or suppliers may become better informed, or the workforce may be exposed to more
opportunities.



                                                          8
While we quantify the effects of internet infrastructure upgrading on the labor market experience of workers
across the skill distribution using the approach described above, there are several caveats to the
interpretation of the estimates. First, and most importantly, there are broader effects on the economy of this
technology/infrastructure upgrading, presenting potential violations of the identifying assumptions in the
DD framework; that is, those areas that saw greater internet access sooner may have been on different
trajectories than those that saw later access to internet. Municipalities experiencing increases in internet
access at different times may not satisfy the “parallel trends” assumption, or, stated otherwise, the timing
of internet rollout may be correlated with time-varying unobservables. The most prominent of these
unobservables is a latent demand for internet access, which we would expect to be higher in municipalities
with high-wage, dynamic labor markets, high-productivity firms, and/or a concentration of knowledge- or
technology-intensive sectors. For the majority of the metrics that we assess, this violation of the DD
assumption would tend to bias our results positively, suggesting our approach will recover magnitudes
larger than those that would be estimated absent this possible concern.

Municipality-level employment outcomes

We begin by estimating economy-wide indicators of workers’ labor market dynamics. Using the matched
employee-employer dimension, we calculate new-to-firm hires and firm-specific separations to get an
aggregate measure of employment churn across firms within a given municipality. We also estimate
aggregate employment and wage effects and standard measures of wage inequality (the standard deviation
of monthly wages, and the 75th-25th and 90th-10th wage percentile gaps).

Table 2 presents the coefficients on the internet access measures in equation (1) across outcomes
enumerated across rows. Overall job churn reduces (rows 1-2) with a reduction in new hires (row 1) in a
magnitude relatively similar to the percentage reduction in job separation (row 2), yielding a statistically
insignificant net change in employment (row 3). There is a reduction in the average monthly wage (row 4)
and a similar reduction in measures of wage dispersion (rows 5-7); if changes in wage dispersions were
effected through the employment margin, we might expect to see differential employment effects by relative
skill levels whereby wage decreases were effected through a larger relative reduction in higher-skill, higher-
wage employment. (We test this hypothesis below, and find that this was not the case.). In terms of total
net economy-wide employment effects, on average across municipalities, there is no statistically significant
change in employment attributable to internet access, although there is a 5.0% cumulative reduction in the
average monthly wage that would result from a 100% change in a municipality’s internet access (given by
e(-0.024+-0.027)-1). The one-year-lagged effects of increases in internet access are typically larger than the

contemporaneous effects. This is the case for both labor market churn (via hiring and firing) and measures
of wage dispersion.

Employment and wages by 2-digit industry

Table 3 presents the coefficient estimates from this specification by industry. Among the five largest sectors
by employment share, four have as-strong-or-stronger effects one year after a change in internet access; the
only outlier is public administration, which does not sell in markets so its mission and activity levels are
not likely to expand in response to lower marginal costs, and is more prone to have workers substituted for
by ICT investments in the short run.

Employment and wages by skill

We segment employment into terciles of relative skill level based on variation in mean wages across 300
3-digit occupations. We then estimate the employment and wage outcomes in Table 2 separately by skill
groupings to assess whether overall effects can be attributable to differential labor market responses across
skill levels. Table 5 presents these results, with some stark patterns: increased internet access reduced job
churn and overall employment in both low- and high-skill occupations. Employment falls economy-wide
for the lowest-skill tercile. Average wages decreased among the higher-skill occupations in response to
internet access, and average wage inequality grew among the lowest skill tercile occupations but declined
in the highest skill occupations.

We then estimate similar employment and wage coefficients by sector and skill level, shown in Table 6.
(Note that not all sectors employ workers in each tercile, which leads to only some sector-skill cells being
estimated.) The reduction in employment in wholesale and retail trade occurs largely among low-skill
occupations, whereas the opposite is true among public administration (which is comprised of only high-
skill occupations). The manufacturing sector sees gains in middle and higher skill occupations: on average
across municipalities, the two-year cumulative effect of an increase in internet access (from 0 to 100%) on
employment is 8.8% and 13.5% for medium- and high-skill occupations in manufacturing industries,
respectively.

generally found among the lower and middle skill terciles, while internet access appears to have a negative
effect on wages in the highest skill occupations. Manufacturing and real estate are an exception, exhibiting
wage increases in both the middle and high skill occupations. Both the public sector and utilities show wage
decreases among its highly skilled occupations. On average across municipalities, the two-year cumulative
effect of an increase in internet access (from 0 to 100%) on monthly wages is 4.8% and 4.1% for medium
and high-skill tercile occupations across manufacturing industries, respectively.

     IV.        Conclusions and policy considerations

Based on a novel data set that we construct on staggered internet availability by municipality between 2000
and 2014, combined with Brazil’s matched employer-employee data set (RAIS), we find that increased
internet access had no statistically significant net economy-wide effect on aggregate employment and a
negative effect on average wages, with a reduction in measures of wage dispersion. The absence of
economy-wide significant net employment effects masks important shifts in employment from sectors with
more limited expansion opportunities—wholesale and retail trade, public administration and (largely
publicly-owned) utilities that comprise almost half of the formal workforce in 2010—to sectors with more
output expansion possibilities. Employment effects are positive and most pronounced in transport and
storage, finance and insurance, real estate and manufacturing industry groups. Importantly, internet
adoption in manufacturing industries is moderately inclusive, with positive employment and wage effects
across both high and medium-skill workers. On average across municipalities, the two-year cumulative
effect of an increase in internet access (from 0 to 100%) is 8.8% and 13.5% on employment, and 4.8% and
4.1% on average monthly wages, for medium- and high-skill occupations in manufacturing industries,
respectively.

Regarding the types of policies that could help offset the uneven sectoral negative employment impacts of
internet rollout that we have found, and the negative effects on unskilled workers that Akerman et al. (2015)
have found,4 there is an important policy thrust to emphasize in addition to the presence of job training and
other input-support programs that should be responsive to the changing market needs of new and growing
firms. As highlighted in Brambilla’s (2017) useful conceptual framework, internet rollout and the attendant
ICT adoption by firms can generate output-expansion effects that, if sufficiently large, will increase firm
labor demand of both skilled and unskilled workers, more than offsetting the substitution effects from
unskilled to skilled workers, and even the partial replacement of skilled workers by ICT investments to the
extent that skilled workers and ICT are substitutes in specific industry groups. It is striking that the
statistically significant employment effects by industry group in Brazil are consistently positive only for
manufacturing, transport and storage, finance and insurance, and hospitality, which are industry groups that
seem likely to be composed of firms that are able to take advantage of opportunities to sell more as their
marginal costs decline, both in terms of more sales within Brazil outside of the municipality and more
exports (either directly or indirectly). Public administration does not sell in any market so its mission and
activity levels are not likely to be responsive to lower marginal costs, at least not in the short or even
medium term. Thus, there it is no surprise that substitution effects predominate. As for wholesale and retail
occupations, what those workers help to sell is not likely to have sales prices that are much diminished as
the costs of retail and wholesale services decline. Thus, it is likely that the activity levels of these
occupations that are demanded in the market are not elastic with respect to the costs of producing the
services of retail and wholesale workers and the ICT they may utilize. So, output effects are likely small or
non-existent, and substitution effects are expected to predominate, as confirmed by our analysis.


One important policy perspective that is beyond the scope of this paper is what becomes of the displaced
workers in public administration and in the retail and wholesale services occupations. Do they move into
jobs in sectors where they are more relatively productive? Do the sectors that can adopt ICT and elevate
their outputs more effectively wind up employing those displaced, if not in the same year as the ICT

 Akerman et al. (2015) exploit rich Norwegian data to answer similar questions to our study. In Norway, a public
program with limited funding rolled out broadband access points, and provides plausibly exogenous variation in the
availability and adoption of broadband internet in firms. Their results suggest that broadband internet improves
(worsens) the labor outcomes and productivity of skilled (unskilled) workers. They explore several possible
explanations for the skill complementarity of broadband internet. They find suggestive evidence that broadband
adoption in firms complements skilled workers in executing non-routine abstract tasks, and substitutes for unskilled
workers in performing routine tasks.

                                                               16
adoption then perhaps in the next year or thereafter? We hope to illuminate these questions in subsequent
work.


Two dual categories of directions for policy to help all workers be included in the benefits from ICT
adoption are highlighted by our work: policies to foster job mobility and policies to foster output expansion
as productivity is raised. To the extent that policies can help support worker mobility and skill adaptability
as well as make industry group output demands more elastic through reductions in transport, logistics and
trade costs, so that output expansion is more responsive to firm efficiency improvements, then output
expansion in response to internet rollout and associated ICT adoption can be that much more important,
thereby expanding employment of all skills.
