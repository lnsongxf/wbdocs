               Phase I: Scoping the Market, provides guidance on how to assess whether commercial inance is a viable solution
               in the sector. This phase covers the requirements that need to be met before moving to the design phase. Many
               markets may not have the need, interest, or readiness to build a market for commercial inance. This section
               covers what is needed at the scoping stage to move forward with building a market.

               Phase II: Designing and Building the Market, focuses on the shift in government inancial planning, new water
               policies, and the capacity building required of borrowers, government, and banks. Think of this section as a
               checklist of all of the elements needed to effectively enable commercial inance in the water sector before actual
               deals take place.

               Phase III: Executing the Deal, will be familiar to readers with experience in commercial inance, as it focuses
               on the transaction. This phase covers the roles and responsibilities of the government, bank, and utility in the
               transaction.

               Phase IV: Monitoring and Evaluating Deal Success, also focuses on the transaction and covers typical ongoing
               monitoring, enhanced monitoring, deal restructuring, and close out.

       Box 1.1.   Assessing Service Providers on Commercial Finance Knowledge


       When assessing your water service providers, the regulator, or whatever body oversees the regulatory role,
       may be a good source of information. However, most likely assessments will need to be done via surveys
       and interviews with senior management.

       Also consider the following survey topics to establish need, interest, and support validation for banks:

       •	 History of borrowing: Has the company borrowed in the past (for overdraft, asset finance, and so forth)?
       •	 Knowledge of borrowing: Does the water provider senior management (CEO, finance manager, and so forth)
          have an understanding and basic knowledge of the process and obligations of commercial borrowing?

       •	 Corporate governance: What is the structure and independence of the board of directors? Is there political
          interference? Is there appropriate ownership or shareholder structure?

     Box 1.2.   Assessing Banks in the Local Market


     When assessing the local lending market, consult these possible sources of information:

     •	 Development institutions often provide technical assistance and perform research on the local banking
       ­
       market. The World Bank Financial Institutions team, or equivalent teams in the International Monetary
       Fund, KfW, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), U.K. Department for International
       Development, and many others, may have research available on lending in a local banking market or have
       dedicated locally or globally based staff who can offer information on the need and interest of banks to
       lend to new clients such as water utilities.

     •	 Private-sector-focused   development institutions, such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC),
       Deutsche Investitions und Entwicklungsgesellschaft (DEG), and Proparco, often lend to commercial banks
       and have a deep understanding of what banks can and will do. A conversation with an IFC Financial Markets
       Group investment officer is an excellent source of information.

     •	 Banking associations (often called bankers associations) help guide and speak for the local bank market and
       can provide insight on market interest and current lending to the water sector as well as guidance on which
       banks would most likely be interested in the water sector.

     •	 Regulatory bodies for the water and financial sectors can also be helpful. A central bank’s bank supervision
       department is responsible for creation and enforcement of laws, regulations, and guidelines that govern
       the banking sector, the inspection of bank operations, and the introduction of new initiatives to promote
       financial inclusion.

     Also consider the following survey questions to establish need, interest, and support validation for banks:

     •	 Does the bank currently lend to water utilities? If not, ask about any possible overdraft facilities or asset
       finance lending; these types of short-term loans could lead to longer term, higher risk loans.

     •	 What is the bank’s view of credit risk in the water sector? Why?
     •	 What is the bank’s understanding of how the water sector is structured?
     •	 Has the bank financed other public infrastructure projects (roads, power, telephony, and so forth)?
     •	 What is the longest tenor of the bank’s loans? Can the bank make loans long enough to match the infra-
       structure life (likely 5–10 years at minimum)? Are any guarantee products available to extend tenor?

     •	 Is there any policy (in-house or governmental) preventing the bank from lending to water utilities?
     •	 What would be the estimated interest rate for water utilities? This is composed of the base rate plus the
       client spread. Be sure to get the breakdown.

     •	 Does the bank have any loans backed by subsidies or credit guarantees?
     •	 Does the bank have any loans that are not backed by collateral and are based on cash flows and other structures?
     •	 Do regulations or the in-house policy of the bank allow it to lend to the sector? What is the bank’s knowl-
       edge of risk mitigation products and does it use them?

          Box 2.1.   Regulatory Benchmarking for Commercial Finance

          There are global benchmarking sites, such as the International Benchmarking Network for Water and
          Sanitation Utilities (IBNET), and some good quality local benchmarking instruments, such as the Kenya Water
          Services Regulatory Board’s impact reports. Most benchmarking and indexation in the water sector focus on
          operational and technical indicators. These are important for lender due diligence, but lenders require
          financial and credit analysis as well. Lenders, borrowers, and regulators can greatly benefit from financial and
          creditworthiness indexation. However, this reporting is not often provided by regulators. Regulators are
          often unfamiliar with financial benchmarking and require technical assistance to establish credit indexing.

          There are multiple levels of assessing credit, from creditworthiness indexing to shadow ratings to credit ratings.

          Governments (usually regulators) can develop a uniform set of creditworthiness standards for water
          utilities by facilitating partnerships with credit rating organizations. For example, the government of the
          Philippines established a water district credit rating system, which classifies districts as creditworthy,
          semi-creditworthy, pre-creditworthy, or not creditworthy. Creditworthy water districts are ready for
          investment, whereas less creditworthy districts are seen as opportunities for technical assistance targeted
          to address their weaknesses.

          In 2015, the Kenya Water Services Regulatory Board (WASREB), with technical assistance from the
          World Bank, created the Creditworthiness Index report covering the top 40 water service providers
          (WASREB and WSP 2015a). The Creditworthiness Index evolved out of a sector-wide Kenya water utility
          shadow rating report, Financing Urban Water Services In Kenya: Utility Shadow Credit Ratings created by
          WASREB and the World Bank in 2011 (Kimani et al. 2011). Shadow rating reports are difficult for
          regulators to sustain as they are expensive, require significant expertise, and must be maintained on an
          annual basis. Normally, credit ratings and shadow ratings report costs are incurred by the borrower. An
          initial shadow ratings report can increase interest from all three stakeholders and establish a market
          interest in creditworthiness reporting. However, a self-reported and automated creditworthiness index
          managed by the regulator is more affordable and therefore more sustainable.

                          is uncommon in non-private companies, all debt-service and debt-service coverage requirements must be completed prior to
                          payment (see “Waterfall” under 3.2 Step Two phase III).

 Legal ownership of       Many governments retain ownership of all assets. Note that the most important asset in borrowing is cash. In order to receive borrowed
 cash flows               funds, repay debt, and establish debt-service reserve accounts, water companies must have legal control over the cash in the company.

     an output-based subsidy that was developed specifically to finance water infrastructure in rural areas. The
     average size of K-Rep’s loans was US$110,000, with an equity requirement of 20 percent of project costs
     contributed by the community. Once the infrastructure was successfully completed, an output-based aid
     (OBA) subsidy of up to 40 percent of the total project cost (often 50 percent of the borrowed funds) was
     provided to the community by the Global Partnership for Output Based Aid (GPOBA). Additionally, the bank
     offered technical assistance to make the projects more viable and provided a small grant of US$9,000 to help
     communities cover the cost of consultants hired for the development of a feasible project proposal. Once the

     of project construction, and management systems set up. In addition, K-Rep bank obtained a 50 percent
     Development Credit Authority (DCA) guarantee from USAID on the loans. From 2006 to 2014, K-Rep Bank
     and the Water and Sanitation Program worked together to make 35 loans valued at over US$3 million for
     water projects across Kenya’s rural communities, providing water services to over 190,000 people (WSP 2011).

     In 2015, the Water and Sanitation Program established a GPOBA $9.5 million OBA subsidy for urban water
     utilities, financing water and sanitation projects in poor areas with funding from commercial banks. The
     subsidy is implemented by the Water Services Trust Fund of Kenya and included US$1.3 million in technical
     assistance to help borrowers hire local consultants to assist in loan application, technical design, and
     business modeling. The lending is supported by a DCA guarantee from USAID to three local banks covering
     50 percent of the default risk. So far, the subsidy has supported US$2.6 million in loans from banks for water
     projects in poor areas. The Water and Sanitation Program also collaborated with the regulator, Water
     Services Regulatory Board, to create water sector commercial borrowing toolkits for each stakeholder group:

     The success of these programs has demonstrated that a combination of technical assistance, output-based
     grants, and partial-loan guarantees can mitigate credit risk and improve water projects’ access to
     ­commercial finance.

     Lessons learned

     •	 A combination of technical assistance and other credit enhancements can mitigate credit risk and increase
       interest of commercial investors.

     •	 Output-based subsidies can be leveraged to secure co-financing from the private microfinance and banking sector.
     •	 Investing in community water projects can be viable for commercial banks.

       Box 2.3.   Commercial Finance In Action: Uganda


       Confirming Market Readiness: Commercial Bank Loan

       In Uganda, the government relies on private service providers to assist in getting access to clean water to
       the local population. However, public funds to support these service providers is limited, and small to
       medium-sized private operators are often unable to get financing from local banks to maintain and/or
       grow their operations.

       To increase the flow of funds available for water infrastructure projects, the government collaborated
       with Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility and the IFC. Together they reviewed the financing
       opportunities and challenges faced by service providers, and developed alternative financing models to
       appeal to both lenders and borrowers. In addition, the IFC implemented training sessions, which
       introduced the Uganda Small-Scale Infrastructure Provider (SSIP) Water Program to local banks. The
       training explained the operation of private water projects and addressed the weaknesses in the area of
       contract administration.

       As a result of these efforts, 70 representatives from local authorities participated in training programs for
       public sector stakeholders and two commercial lenders expressed interest in funding prequalified bidders
       for a tender in Busembatia, one of the small towns in the SSIP Water Program (World Bank 2011). The loans
       also included an OBA component provided by GPOBA. In 2010, the first five-year management contract
       was awarded to a private operator, Transit Limited, which was able to receive a loan from DFCU Bank, a
       Ugandan commercial bank, for US$100,000, alongside a US$270,000 required subsidy (IFC 2012, 20).

       Lessons learned

       •	 Governments can help commercial banks assess market readiness and overcome reluctance to lend to
          the sector.

       •	 Government incentives offset perceived lending risk of private service providers.
       •	 The IFC’s relationship with local banks can be used as a model for developing risk-sharing products.

      Box 2.4.   Commercial Finance Toolkit: Checklist to Assess Water Service Provider Capacity to Borrow


      •	 Corporate governance. The company has structure and independence of the board of directors (to limit
        unwarranted political interference), and appropriate ownership and shareholder structure.

      •	 Business planning. Borrowers can create basic financial plans and model to analyze and stress test IRR of
        cash flows (including revenue projections and needed tariff hikes), cost projections including fees, staff
        costs, electricity and chemical costs, tax analysis and benefits, and coverage ratios (O&M coverage, current
        ratio, collection ratio, and so forth).

      •	 Ratio and operating analysis. The company can show the volume of water produced, billing and collection
        ratios, nonrevenue water, coverage or metering ratio, bad debt provision, and staff per 1,000 connections,
        and ratios can be checked against global or similar markets at IBNET.

      •	 Tax payment status and benefit. The company includes a tax benefit and a cash and cash flow benefit of
        depreciation in financial models since many service providers do not make a profit and do not incur tax
        liabilities.

      •	 Technical reports on projects. The borrower has the finalized technical designs stating the total cost of the
        project and these are approved by the technical team with the necessary statutory approvals.

      •	 Legal status. The service provider is a corporate body that has borrowing powers stipulated in the
        memorandum and articles of association, the license to provide service should be valid over the life of
        the borrowing period (or extended), the tariff rate should be approved (likely by the regulator), and the
        service provider should have valid abstraction permits.

      •	 Tender of awards. The service provider should have made a decision on whether it is to implement the
        project or not. The service provider should have tendered and awarded the project to a competent and
        capable contractor.

      •	 Approved business plan and tariff. The service provider should have an approved business plan that is in
        line with the strategy of the organization. As well, any required increase in tariff should be approved.

      •	 Analysis of banking needs. The service provider should carry an internal assessment on its funding needs
        for the project period so that they do not create a strain.

      Box 2.6.   Commercial Finance In Action: Philippines


      Bridging the Funding Gap with Blended Finance

      Water utilities in the Philippines traditionally relied on government funding to support infrastructure
      development and maintenance. Due to limited public funds, however, the government became increasingly
      motivated to support market-based financing for creditworthy water utilities.

      To achieve this goal, the government of the Philippines supported the creation of the Philippine Water
      Revolving Fund (PWRF)—a program funded by USAID and Japan International Cooperation Agency.
      PWRF was designed to blend public funds, official development assistance, and private sector
      financing to expand access to clean water. Through this innovative mechanism funds are pooled and
      lent to water providers through the Development Bank of Philippines alongside commercial loans. The
      goals of PWRF are to extend loan tenors from 7–10 years to 15–20 years and offer more affordable
      pricing terms. Additionally, UASID leveraged its Development Credit Authority (guarantee) to crowd-in
      commercial finance.

      By introducing private financing due diligence to the water sector, the projects selected to date have
      been thoroughly vetted and have helped utilities develop business plans for commercial success.
      PWRF has helped 16 water supply projects access US$57 million in private finance and an additional
      US$37 million in public funds (Paul 2011). Ten of the projects have been funded with 90–100 percent
      commercial finance. Partial credit guarantees, covering up to 50 percent of a loan value, have been
      utilized on 14 projects; one was able to extend a loan tenor from 10 to 15 years.

      Lessons learned

      •	 Blended finance leveraged over US$1.5 dollars in private capital for each dollar funded through PWRF.
      •	 Credit enhancements such as partial credit guarantees can improve the bankability of a water project and
        act as a substitute for traditional collateral for cash-flow-based lending.

      •	 Financial mechanisms can be paired with technical assistance. The fund also assisted lenders with train-
        ing on how to evaluate the technical, regulatory, and financial aspects unique to the water sector. This
        increased confidence in banks to measure project viability.

      •	 Water sector reform is effective as a package: blended finance, water utilities strengthening, regulatory
        reform, and stakeholder coordination were used simultaneously to create impact.

      Box 3.1.   Commercial Finance Toolkit: Setting a Cost Recovery Tariff


      For commercial borrowing, tariffs must be set at a level sufficient to recover O&M costs plus full
      amortization (interest payments and repayment of principal) of the capital costs. Best practice would
      include a long-run marginal cost or average incremental cost method that considers future costs as the best
      indicator of what consumers should pay now. Economists believe that it is beneficial if the rates charged
      signal to the consumer the value of resources used in providing the services. The regulator should have or
      develop tariff guidelines for the recovery of justified costs. The tariffs charged are meant to accommodate
      cost recovery, cross subsidization, and, in the case of commercial financing, the interest and principal
      repayment cost of the expansion of infrastructure. Therefore, the tariff should be set to cover the costs of
      operating expenditure plus depreciation plus the cost of infrastructure financing.

     Box 3.2.   Ways Government Can Support the Commercial Viability of the Deal


     To assist the commercial viability of service providers, governments should, where applicable, arrange to clear
     any outstanding debts to the water company from public entities. Often past due bills for water companies are
     from larger public clients such as hospitals, prisons, and universities. Clearing these historical debts and
     arranging to avoid these debts in the future will strengthen the financial health of a service provider. In addition,
     any outstanding tax obligations could be paid and cleared to increase the creditworthiness of the service
     provider, as these obligations will be senior to debt service and have a negative credit effect on the borrower.

     If the government has an official or unofficial practice of providing grant funding to utilities experiencing a
     cash shortfall (bailout), this procedure should be documented in official policy. Any government funding
     support to the service provider should be legally binding in order to benefit the borrowing negotiations of
     the service provider.

     Any historical debt on the financial books of the service provider could stop commercial lending. Often this
     debt is nonperforming debt to the government and will not likely ever result in payment. Writing off (or
     legally removing) this debt could qualify the service provider to access new debt to improve the company’s
     service and operations.

       Box 3.4.   Commercial Finance Toolkit: Potential Covenants in a Loan Agreement


       Rate covenant. This is the critical covenant in a revenue loan security structure, in which the service provider
       pledges to maintain a water tariff that is sufficient to make interest and principal payments on the loan. This
       covenant will likely include any current and/or future increases in the tariff as well as any triggers that will
       force the company to raise a tariff. Triggers are usually preagreed operational or financial ratios that, once
       hit, force the company to increase the tariff. Banks may insist on the borrower obtaining preapproval for any
       potential tariff increases over the life of the loan.

       Security on project assets. Although water company assets are not often used for collateral, due to the low
       resale value, project assets may have high resale value if purchased but not yet installed. Lenders may hold
       security of these liquid assets until they are no longer sellable.

       Assignment of receivables, contracts, and deposits. The assignment of receivables (customer
       contracts, customer deposits, and any other borrower contract or deposits) to the lending bank. These
       assignments will depend on the lender’s view of the service provider’s ability to meet debt-service
       obligations. A legal opinion is needed to confirm whether assignment of receivables, contracts, and
       deposits is enforceable.

       Right of set off. This gives the lender the right to take debt-service payments from other bank accounts
       held by the borrower.

       Negative pledge: This is the loan agreement clause preventing additional indebtedness. A negative
       pledge allows for additional indebtedness only if the borrower complies with a coverage test—for
       example, a net revenues to outstanding debt service ratio. The ratio usually has the same value as the
       net debt service coverage test, for example, 1.5 to 2.0, but the definition of the denominator is different.
       It takes into account total outstanding senior debt to arrive at the debt-service amount, not just the
       current loan.

       Operating and maintenance covenant. Similar to the rate covenant, this is a standard general statement
       that the water services provider will “operate the system properly and in a sound and economical manner
       and maintain, preserve, and keep the same preserved and kept with the appurtenances and every part and
       parcel thereof, in good repair, working order and condition, and from time to time make, or cause to be
       made, all necessary and proper repairs, replacements and renewals so that at all times the operation of the
       system may be properly and advantageously conducted.”

       Acceleration. This is a legal agreement that requires the borrower to pay off the loan immediately if ­
                                                                                                             pre-
       agreed conditions, covenants, or warranties are not met. Often acceleration involves support of a third
       party, such as local government or the ministry, to support this payment.

       Step-in rights. These rights allow lenders to take control of the infrastructure project, or even the company,
       if and when the company is not performing up to an agreed level and then step out when the company
       demonstrates that it can once again meet its contractual obligations. In some markets, local laws may
       prohibit lenders from having step-in rights. This will be an impediment to attracting private sector finance

       and may need to be addressed by the government. However, local banks should know the status of such
       laws. Step-in rights may be very difficult for quasi-public firms to commit to and may not be an attractive
       option to the lender. Step-in rights are generally for larger PPP projects and less likely to work for financing
       the last-mile connections.

       One solution in markets with performance contracts in the water sector is to allow the lender to appoint a
       third party manager to step in. However, this is only an option in markets where performance contracts are
       already established. Regardless of how much interest there is in step-in rights by lenders, the parties should
       considered just how realistic is it that a lender can ever exercise those rights before spending too much time
       on them. After the negotiations and required conditions have been met and documented, the loan funding

      Box 4.1.   Levels of Lender Intervention


      Cure rights allow the lenders to cure a breach of an obligation by the water service provider under one of
      the project documents, including the loan agreement. The project participants are required to notify the
      lender of the breach and let them cure the breach if they choose to. The lender is likely to exercise its right
      to cure in cases where the breach simply requires making a due payment and the project company is doing
      well otherwise. Lenders will likely want the opportunity to cure before having to decide whether to step in.
      In addition to protecting the lender, cure rights, or cure periods, can also be beneficial to the borrower in
      times of distress, as is detailed under “Restructuring.”

      Step‑in rights arise when the water company breaches one of the agreements with one of the project
      participants, who then chooses to terminate. The lender can step-in to cure the breach and to get the
      project back on track. Other project participants will be required to continue their contractual relationships
      with the substitute entity. The lenders will be permitted to step out when they choose to do so, without
      incurring any continuing liabilities. In case of this intervention, the service provider is not released from its
      obligations and remains liable both during step-in and after step-out stages.

      Substitution is a legal process that discharges the original loan agreement between the lender and the
      original borrower and substitutes it with a new contract between the lender and a third party that takes
      over the project. This substitute entity must perform debt-service obligations under the new loan (with the
      same terms as the original agreement) that were previously owed by the borrower who defaulted.

      Box A.1.   Commercial Finance in Action: Examples of Credit Guarantees Offered


      Guarantees vary and lenders may need guidance on selecting the best partial guarantee for their loans.
      Some guarantees are simple and often require less time to establish, such as the USAID Development Credit
      Authority (DCA). The DCA guarantees a percentage (usually 50 percent for new sectors) of principal at
      default/write-off.

      IFC has a more complicated guarantee, which often takes longer to arrange. However, the IFC guarantee has
      a component that allows lenders to allow borrowers to reduce the principal guarantee and draw down
      funds to use for working capital. The idea of this feature is to assist borrowers in times of economic or
      managerial stress to keep the company solvent.

        Box A.2.   Commercial Finance in Action: Philippines Credit Rating Assessment


        Traditionally, water providers in the Philippines have obtained funds for their projects from local
        government and multilateral organizations. Commercial financing has been mostly out of reach. Commercial
        lenders typically have limited knowledge of the water sector and are hesitant to lend to service providers
        because they lack a track record of securing and paying off commercial loans. To address this issue, the
        government decided to establish a standard approach to rating water utilities, which would give commercial
        lenders a reliable system for assessing the creditworthiness of water supply projects. The new rating
        standard, called the Water District Credit Rating System, classifies districts as creditworthy,
        semicreditworthy, precreditworthy, or noncreditworthy, and the Local Water Utilities Administration serves
        as the official rating agency (Bender 2015). This classification system provides lenders with critical
        information needed to distinguish between creditworthy water districts ready for investment and those that
        are less financially viable and require technical assistance to improve their bankability. As traditional sources
        of funds for water projects continue to diminish, the credit rating system has proven to be a critical step in
        attracting commercial funds to the sector.
