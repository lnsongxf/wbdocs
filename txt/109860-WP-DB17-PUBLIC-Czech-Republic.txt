This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2016 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

time recorded among all economies in the DB2017 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

       Notarize Articles of Association and Lease Agreement

       The notary prepares the articles of association according to the
       founders' requirements, and the notary is responsible for the
       compliance of the contents of the company’s articles of association with
       Czech law.

       Certain notaries require the following documents before executing the
       articles of association:
       •         An affidavit from the company managers.
   2   •         Building lease agreement, or ownership extract from the Real           1 day           CZK 17,066.77

       432/2013 Coll, effective from January 1, 2014. For the initial 100,000
       CZK in start-up capital, the notary fee is 2% or 2000 CZK; for the
       subsequent capital up to 500,000 CZK the notary fee is 1.2% (or 4,800
       CZK at full amount); for the subsequent capital up to 1,000,000 CZK the
       notary fee is 0.6% (or 3,000 CZK at full amount); for the subsequent

      amount); and for the subsequent capital up to 20,000,000 CZK the
      notary fee is 0.2% (or 895 CZK at full amount). For a case study
      company with start up capital of CZK 3,447,359 the notary fee comes to
      16,695 CZK. The fees do not include VAT (21%).

      In addition, if each founder wants their own original copy, then the cost
      is CZK 100 per page. Alternatively, instead of original copy a founder
      can ask for a certified copy and the cost would be 30 CZK per page.
      These costs are optional, and up to each founder to incur.

      The company must also certify its building lease agreement by a public
      notary. The cost to certify the lease agreement is CKZ 30 +21% VAT
      with a notary.

      Obtain confirmation of the administrator of the capital
      contribution of the company, along with the confirmation of the
      bank that the capital contribution is held in the company’s special
      bank account

      Until the company is registered, the paid-in capital is typically blocked
      in the special bank account. Opening a special bank account can costs
      as much as CZK 5,000, though most banks open special accounts for            2 days       no charge

      Agency: Bank



      Register with the Trade Licensing Office and obtain extract of the
      trade license

      The company must register its business activities with the Trade License
      Office to obtain an extract of its trade license. The required documents
      are as follows:

      •        Application for registration;
      •        memorandum of association if the company has been founded
      but not yet established (i.e. registered with the Commercial Register);      2 days       CZK 1000

      •        proof of payment of the administrative fee.

      The application form may be accessed online at:
      http://www.rzp.cz/elpod.html

      The Trade License Office must complete the registration process within
      5 working days from the day when all required documents were

      the trade license register which is either picked-up personally by the
      applicant at the Trade License Office, delivered by post mail, or
      delivered to an electronic data box.

      Upon company registration, the Trade License Office notifies the
      Ministry of Interior regarding new company formation triggering
      automatic set up of an electronic data box pursuant to 1 July 2009 Act
      No. 300/2008 Coll., “On electronic transactions and authorized
      conversion of documents.” The Act requires all public and private
      entities to use an electronic data box for encrypted exchange of official
      documents and information. Pursuant to the Law, the data box for a
      legal entity (including a limited liability company) registered in the
      Trade License Office and /or Commercial Register is established
      automatically and free of charge by the Ministry of Interior, after it
      receives the information from the relevant registration authority.
      Alternatively, the company may set up a data box prior to official
      company registration with government authorities, via in person
      request at a Czech POINT contact point located in the post office.

      In case the company chose to create the electronic data box prior to

      Obtain consent of the project from the Environmental
      Department of the Municipality

      The builder informs the Environmental Department that the
      project is a sub-limit construction by completing a specific form,
      which can be obtained online. This form can range from 1 to 60
      pages, depending on the size of the project. The Doing Business
      case study is considered low risk and a small project. The
      department will assess the impact of this sub-limit construction
      and decide whether the request should be granted or not. It is
      not automatic that all sub-limit constructions do not require a
      full Environmental Impact Assessment.

*5                                                                           30 days       no charge
      This notification will be sent to several departments (pollution,
      waste, arable land/forest if applicable) to make sure that this
      project will not have a negative impact on the environment.

      The statutory time limit is 15 days, but in reality the average time
      is around 30 days. By law, construction under 6000 sq.m. is
      considered sub-limit (Environmental Impact Assessment Act
      100/2001). This is also a harmonization of the EU regulations.

      Obtain project clearance from Road Management Agency

      This clearance is based on drawings from the preliminary project
      design.
      This procedure is required by law – it is for safety reasons. The
      Road and Management Agency will check that the builder is
      respecting all the requirements when connecting to the public
      road and will verify if the project will have an impact on traffic.
      Even if it is just a small connection to the public road, BuildCo
      will still require the clearance.                                      20 days       CZK 500

      The statutory time limit for completing this procedure is 30 days.
      The fee for obtaining a decision to connect the site to a first-
      class road is CZK 1,000.00. The fee for obtaining a decision to
      connect the site to a second- and third-class road or to a local
      road is CZK 500.00.

      Obtain project clearance from Fire Department

      The Fire Department clearance is based on preliminary project
      design drawings. The statutory time limit for completing this
*7    procedure is 30 days.                                                    10 days       no charge

      Obtain zoning permit

      A zoning permit grants only the right to build the warehouse on
      a plot; it does not authorize construction. In order to obtain the
      location permit, BuildCo must submit the clearances of the
      preliminary project design by the various agencies.

      The zoning permit is valid for 2 years, and it is a prerequisite for
      construction and building permits. The statutory period for
      completing the procedure is 60 days. In particular, the District
      authority should take a maximum of 30 days to assess all the
      clearances and provide an opinion. Then there is a statutory time
      limit of 15 days for the participants to receive the opinion from
      the District authority. Since it is a registered mailed, if the person
      does not pick it up immediately at the post office , it will be
      considered received after 15 days, whether or not the person has
      the letter physically in their hands. Then, the participants ( such
      as the neighbors) have another 15 days time-limit to appeal this         60 days      CZK 20,000

      zoning opinion. If no appeal is received within these 15 days,
      then the zoning permit is considered final and indisputable.
      However, in more complicated cases that require oral
      proceedings or local investigations, the statutory period for
      completing the procedure is 90 days.
      The zoning permit must be issued for simple structures,
      installations, and maintenance. However, if a regulatory plan (a
      more specific document than the master plan) is issued for the
      area (location), this plan replaces the zoning permit within that
      area. The regulatory plan is procured and issued by the Local
      Authority. It determines the detailed conditions for the use of the
      grounds, for the location and spatial arrangement of structures,
      for the protection of area’s values and character, and for creating
      a favorable environment.

      needs insurance, as would be the case for a new warehouse. The
      owner of the new warehouse will submit a notification explaining
      that the building is now part of the plot and should be
      registered. The owner will submit the geodesic plan as well as
      the occupancy permit to register the building in the cadaster.

      The request is made to the local water and sewerage provider.
      The costs for establishing a (completely new) water connection is
      about CZK 2,500.00 – CZK 3,000.00 per sq. m. for the excavation
      works (depending on the surface material), plus the cost of the
      actual placing of the new water conduct and coverage of the
      hole, (together, about CZK 4,500.00 per sq. m.). The costs of
      establishing a new sewerage connection are based on the same
      criteria, and they can vary substantially, based on the relevant
      circumstances (surface material, depth). The costs for
      establishing the new water connection depends on the time and
      the number of workers needed. The price is about CZK 2,200.00

        For the excavation work, a company is responsible for being in
        contractual relation with the Prague Water Supply and Sewerage
        Company (Prazske vodovody a kanalizace). The fee for the water
        and sewerage connection varies, by service provider. However,
        the approximate cost is about CZK 1,200.00. The cost stated
        above probably includes the cost for constructing the water and
        sewerage connection. However, when constructing a warehouse,
        the constructor also builds a water and sewerage connection.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for

       The buyer checks for encumbrances on the property

       It is the responsibility of the buyer or a lawyer on behalf of the buyer to
       verify whether the property has any encumbrances on it. If there are
       some encumbrances those should be stated in the purchase agreement.

       The cadastral office also checks on the encumbrances and even if they
       are not mentioned in the purchase agreement, they will be automatically
       transferred to the buyer.

       In previous years not all of the encumbrances could be checked on-line,
       because some information was solely in documents not available on-
       line.Nevertheless since 1.1.2016 all encumbrances can be checked on-
       line, because all the documents are either directly available in electronic
       form or can be scanned and delivered electronically within one working
       day.

       A notary certifies the signatures of the transfer agreement

       By law, the transfer agreement does not have to be executed in the form

       have the signatures certified by a notary public or by an attorney or by
       public authorities. Notarization (by a notary public) is the most common
       way. The notarization takes place without delay and costs CZK 30 per

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                               reorganization. The court will decide on state of insolvency, accept the petition,
                                  and the creditors will have 2 months for registration of their claims. Mirage’s
                                 management will have 120 days to prepare a reorganization plan. This period
                                 can be extended by the court for another 120 days on debtor’s request. After
                                    Mirage’s management submits a reorganization plan, the court will hold a

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
