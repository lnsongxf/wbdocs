This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

        The registration may be submitted either in person or electronically.
        Following 2014 reform of company registration procedures, in person
        applicants are registered online by government personnel. Registration
        must be completed within 1 day by law.

        Online business registration is free of charge, but in order to submit a
        registration application via web portal, it is necessary for the applicant
        to have a pre-approved electronic signature, which carries an additional
        expense. As such many companies chose to register in person. In
        person registration costs 1 base unit. Since January 2016 the cost of the
        base unit is BYR 210,000.

        The State Registration Authority automatically informs state agencies -
        tax agencies, state insurance agency RUP "Belgosstrakh", statistics

        Make a company seal

        There are no laws requiring a business to purchase company seal.
        However, the company seal is required for consignment notes and for
        certain bank transactions and power of attorney. Government agencies,
        such as the tax authority, would have no legal grounds for refusing
        documents that do not have a company seal. Nevertheless out of habit,                    BYR 200,000-

        month after he/she has been registered with the tax authorities to buy
        and register a Book of Register of Inspections (“Kniga uchiota
        proverok”). The Register of Inspections must be purchased from the Tax

        permitting project design and construction works on a given
        land plot

        To start construction, BuildCo must receive the Minsk City
        Executive Committee’s decision to elaborate on design
        documentation. The permission letter states the main
        requirements for the intended building and lists the agencies
        and the institutions where additional technical requirements
        must be obtained. The request form must contain a brief
        description of the intended building project and company
        documents.

        On April 26, 2007 the Minsk City Municipality passed Decision #
        859 according to which applicants can choose to obtain technical
        conditions or request the Centre of Engineering Services to
        obtain them on behalf of the applicant. Prior to this reform, the
        Centre used to be under the Department of Technical Conditions
   1    of the Committee of Architecture and City Construction. Now the          30 days              no charge
        Centre operates as a semi-private entity and if the work load
        increases, it can recruit additional human resources.

        After the documents are submitted to the Reception Desk they
        are forwarded to the respective departments, and if the applicant
        wishes to obtain the technical conditions through the Centre, the
        documents are directed internally to the Centre.

        All service providers that issue technical conditions have a time
        limit of 7 working days during which the approvals must be
        granted. All the approvals can be obtained in parallel. The
        services that are involved and would be required for BuildCo’s
        case are: water/sewage, telephone, sanitary epidemiological
        authority, ecological department and fire safety. By law all
        technical conditions are granted free of charge. However, if it is
        done through the Centre for Engineering Services there is a fee -
        - for BuildCo's case, it would be approximately BYR 1,000,000.00.

      Obtain the building permit

      After having obtained the approval of the state expertise of
      design documentation, BuildCo applies to the Inspection of State
      Construction Supervision Department of Minsk City (from
      hereon, "the Inspection") to obtain a permit for construction and
      mounting works. The following documents must be submitted:

      •        Decision of Minsk City Executive Committee on
      permission of construction;
      •        Positive conclusion of the state examination of the
      project documentation;
      •        Decision on the approval of the project documentation;
      •        Payment order confirming the transfer of the fees
      payable from the cost of construction and installation work.

      The construction permit is granted within 3 working days
      according to the Resolution of the Council of Ministers of Belarus
      No.156 of February 17, 2012 "On approval of a single
      specification of administrative procedures carried out by
      government agencies and other bodies in relation to legal

      the State Committee for Standardization, approved by the
      Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of 09.08.2013 №
      704, the fee to obtain the building permit is 0.35% of the value
      of the construction and engineering works for projects with
      private sector financing. For construction projects with an
      estimated duration of 12 months or less, an advance payment of
      50% of the total estimated amount of the payment must be paid
      during the application for construction permit. The remaining
      50% of the fees is paid before obtaining the occupancy permit.
      The payment is done at the bank, and a receipt is submitted to
      the Inspection. The duration of the construction works for the
      case study warehouse is assumed to be 30 weeks; therefore, 50%
      of the construction and installation costs have to be paid at the
      time of applying for the building permit.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                                   the debts of the company. Once insolvency is initiated and an administrator is
Proceeding      liquidation                appointed, the administrator has to decide whether to undertake
                                    reorganization or liquidation procedure. BizBank is the majority creditor and
                                   creditors have to approve which procedure takes place. Vote of BizBank, as the
                                           majority creditor, will be decisive. BizBank is not likely to support

                    creditor rights in bankruptcy.

Doing Business 2017 presents the data for the labor
market regulation indicators in an annex. The report
does not present rankings of economies on these
indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance
to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market
regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org). The data on labor
market regulation are based on a detailed questionnaire
on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier
score for the total tax rate—and therefore on the
distance to frontier score for paying taxes—for
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
