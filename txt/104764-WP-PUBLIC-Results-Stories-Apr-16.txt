Over the last decade, the countries of the Latin
America and the Caribbean region experienced
a deep economic and social transformation
which lifted millions out of poverty and swelled
the ranks of the middle class. Strong economic
growth driven by both domestic reforms and
a favorable global economic environment, was
responsible for this progress. Complementary
social programs, made possible by growing fiscal
space, helped finance programs that supported
the poor and disadvantaged.

Economic tailwinds have now receded and much
of the region is now working to hold on to the
recent economic and social gains. Governments
are having to adjust to the new global conditions which an increasing number of analysts
are regarding as “the new normal”. This means that the region will need to work harder to
(i) revive economic growth through productivity gains and stable macroeconomic policies;
(ii) invest in sustainable cities and infrastructure for an increasingly urban population;
and (iii) help the poor get out of poverty through quality education and health services
and affordable social protection programs.
The results stories contained in this booklet illustrate some of these efforts. From
investing in learning and education to empowering women and improving access to basic
services by poor communities, they tell the stories of Latin American and Caribbean
people whose lives have been improved by the World Bank’s joint work with governments
and civil stakeholders.

In Nicaragua, for example, safe water has become a staple in the lives of thousands of
rural inhabitants a simple enough fact that nevertheless reduces poverty by helping
them save time and money. The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project provided
over 120,000 Nicaraguans with this precious resource, as well as sanitation services, on
a sustained basis. The testimony of one beneficiary sums it up: “We used to walk to the
spring to get water – it took about an hour.”

Another telling example is the case of Juana Bravo Mateo, a coffee farmer in Guatemala.
Thanks to a Bank-supported rural development program, she has acquired the skills to
take on a bigger role in coffee production, which by her own account, was something that
only men used to do in the past: “Now, we women know how to do all of that.”
Similarly, a fruit business in impoverished Northeastern Brazil grew from a small community
shop to a multiple-service operation employing over 200 people, following an initiative to
improve infrastructure and production facilities. According to community leader Luciana
Balbino, this initiative reduced migration to cities because it helped local youth learn new
skills, which improved their business and personal connections to the community.

These stories are just a glimpse of what we can all achieve on the ground while working
in collaboration and partnership. But more importantly, they show that notwithstanding
the occasional bump in the road, the governments and people of the Latin American and
Caribbean region continue to pursue the goals of eradicating extreme poverty and boosting
shared prosperity.

PREVENTING FLOODS IN
ARGENTINA’S CITIES
Argentina is reducing the vulnerability of cities to floods by strengthening their
capacity to reduce the risk of inundations, implementing a housing program for
lowest-income populations living in urban flood-prone areas, and improving
defenses in areas with strong economic activity and vulnerability to recurrent
flooding. Institutions, businesses, and communities in the provinces of Chaco,
Corrientes, Entre Rios, and Santa Fe will be able to improve urban planning and
development and to prevent, mitigate, and respond to flooding.

BENEFICIARIES
The target population of the resettlement plan in
Resistencia consisted of two groups of families to be
moved to into a new neighborhood of Nuevo Don
Bosco. The first group was composed of families
that lived in the works site of the drainage pipe
Laprida in the Villa Don Rafael neighborhood.
The second group consisted of families in Laguna
Prosperidad in the Don Bosco neighborhood.

Both groups suffered from frequent flooding. The
resettlement plan was sensitive to the existing
social networks among beneficiaries and significant
efforts were made to place families that knew each
other together in the new neighborhood. Each
house was designed to accommodate the size and
composition of the beneficiary family.


The resettlement plan guarantees regularization
of land title, quality of housing construction, and
basic utility services connections. It also includes an
urban-environmental ‘intervention’ near the
lake, which provides a physical barrier to
discourage construction of new homes in a
flood prone area while concurrently serving as
a recreational area. All of these factors make an
important contribution to improving the social and
environmental conditions of the beneficiaries and
minimizing the exposure to flood risks.

BARBADOS IMPROVES ITS RESPONSE
TO HIV/AIDS
Barbados continues its efforts to reduce new HIV infection among youth, men who
have sex with men, and female sex workers. It is also improving treatment to HIV
positive persons and people living with AIDS.


CHALLENGE
The Caribbean region has had the highest HIV
prevalence rate among adults outside Sub-Saharan
Africa. In Barbados, the rate was 1.5 percent in
2005. The National Strategic Plan of Barbados
2005-2025 identified HIV/AIDS as one of
the major threats to the economy, because it
endangered the country’s human capital. The First
HIV/AIDS Project [2001-2007] achieved high
levels of awareness, treatment, and care, but was
less successful in inducing the level of sustained
behavior change required to affect the epidemic’s
prevention and control. For example, although 95
percent of young people were aware that sexual
relations was a way of transmitting HIV, only 21
percent used condoms.

Since 2008, the state government of Amazonas has been working to improve
conditions in the urban and rural communities of the remote Alto Solimões
region while promoting the sustainable management of the region’s fragile
natural resources. These investments include improved access to potable water,
upgraded health services delivery, and support of rural communities with the
implementation of income-generating investments.

MAINSTREAMING BIODIVERSITY AND

Brazil has developed a program to mainstream biodiversity at the national
level in the key sectors of agriculture, energy, and health by consolidating and
strengthening the institutional capacity to produce and disseminate biodiversity
information and concepts.

BENEFICIARIES
The project was overwhelmingly an institutional
development project that aimed at strengthening
capacity for and linkages necessary to mainstream
biodiversity among various government, non-
governmental, private and other actors. The
strengthened partnerships and collaboration
have had far-reaching implications, beyond the
original project scope. Project beneficiaries almost
unanimously during interviews highlighted
the enormous benefits in terms of providing a
forum and a catalytic force that served to enable
cooperation, and especially coordination.

financial mechanism for conservation, has introduced an innovative landscape
management approach. The mosaic approach effectively restores habitats,
enhances biodiversity, and empowers the participating communities, particularly
women.

BOGOTÁ REDUCES ITS
VULNERABILITY TO NATURAL
HAZARDS
Through a multi-faceted approach Bogotá made progress towards addressing
urban risk reduction. Colombia’s largest city increased its capacity to manage
disaster risks, and reduced its vulnerability in kindergartens, schools, and
hospitals. Likewise, 1,067 households living in areas subject to landslides were
resettled to safer locations with secure housing tenure.

RURAL PRODUCERS IN GUATEMALA
IMPROVE THEIR PRODUCTIVITY AND
INCOMES
Rural enterprises in Guatemala enhanced their productive, organizational, and
business capacities. Thanks to renewed infrastructure and improved links to
markets, they were able to use their new capacities to earn millions of dollars
in new sales. In addition, municipalities across the country improved their
investment planning skills by applying participatory planning processes.

IMPROVING THE ROAD NETWORK IN
NICARAGUA
Nicaragua’s improved road connections and conditions are providing better
access to markets and services. The Modulos Comunitarios de Adoquines (MCAs)
model using community-based labor for rural road works was highly successful
in generating short-term employment opportunities, enhancing technical and
entrepreneurial skills, empowering women, and fostering community ownership of
rural roads.
