This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

procedures are those that apply to a company

collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

       Notarize company registration application

       Each founder must fill out and sign a standard registration application,
       which must be notarized. There is a stamp duty of RUB200 per copy.
       This cost does not include fees for technical work charged by notaries
       or lawyers if this application form is completed by them – the cost of
       RUB 200 assumes that the application form is filled out by the
       entrepreneur themselves. Fees of technical work by lawyer/notaries are
       only applicable in cases where there is a need to draft a charter, and
       thus are not applicable to the Starting a Business case study.
   1                                                                                1 day        RUB 200 per copy
       Starting from May 5, 2014 this procedure ceased to be compulsory. If
       the founder is able to attend the Tax Service office and file all the
       documents in person, the application does not have to be notarized
       and the tax officer can certify the founder’s signature instead. However,
       this is possible only in case when all the founders are able to visit the
       Tax Service in person, otherwise the application must be notarized.

      leased property, certified with signature and building company’s stamp.
      If the leasing office space is from an individual owner this document
      would need notarization.)

      The tax authorities sometimes implement a number of additional
      requirements, and failure to comply may lead to the rejection of the
      application.

      At the time of application, the applicant receives a confirmation slip,
      which specifies the date that the registration will be complete and ready
      for pick up. Starting from December 29, 2015 the registration term is 3
      working days, not including the day of submission of documents and
      the day of issuance of the registration certificate.
      The registration fee is RUB 4,000.

      On the day of pick up, the applicant will receive a package of
      documents, including Abstract of the state registration, abstract of tax
      registration with a Tax Identification Number (TIN), one of the original
      company charters (that the applicant submitted) stamped by the
      government, and certificate of business entry in the unified State
      Register of Legal Entities. If the applicant does not pick the registration
      documents from the office, it is sent by mail.

      The procedure could also be done online
      http://www.nalog.ru/rn77/service/gosreg_eldocs/- with electronic
      signature. However, obtaining online signature is costly and time
      consuming. In practice, most businesses do not utilize the online
      services. The online service has been available since 2012.

      On 6 April 2015, the President of the Russian Federation signed Federal

      practice, majority of the businesses still obtain a company seal as part

        In accordance with Article 22.1.10 of the Basic Principles of Russian
        Legislation on Notaries Public, the notary's fee for certification of
        signatures and bank cards is equal to RUB 200. The notary's total fee for
        such certification, including technical work, is approximately RUB 800 -
        1200.

        The signature of the entrepreneur must be certified and registered by a
        bank. There is a special form (provided by the government) that must
        be completed for this procedure. Entrepreneurs have two options. They
        can either (a) have the signature form notarized and then it can be
        brought to the bank when opening the bank account, or (b) they can

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March (for 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city). As noted, the
warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff schedules may apply if a time-of-
use tariff is available.

years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

insolvency takes 2.0 years on average and costs 9.0% of
the debtor’s estate. The average recovery rate is 38.6
cents on the dollar. Most indicator sets refer to a case

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                                    Answer                                    Explanation
                                                 In accordance with Art. 9 of the Law on Insolvency (Bankruptcy), the
                                                 management of Mirage must petition the court to declare the
                                                 company bankrupt within 1 month of failing to pay the Bank’s
                                                 claims. The court will institute a supervisory procedure and will
                   Moscow,                       appoint a temporary administrator. Temporary administrator will
Proceeding           Saint         liquidation   convene the first creditors’ meeting, where the creditors will decide
                  Petersburg                     whether to petition the court for liquidation or reorganization. Under
                                                 the case study assumptions, creditors, most likely, will choose the
                                                 liquidation procedure, because it is not likely that other procedures
                                                 can lead to restoration of the debtor’s solvency. On the contrary, in
                                                 liquidation, the bank can partially satisfy its claims.

                   Moscow,                    Despite the fact that the value of the business will be higher if it is
Outcome              Saint     piecemeal sale sold as a going concern, it will be difficult to find a buyer willing to
                  Petersburg                  purchase all the assets as a whole.

                                                 In accordance with Article 51 of the Law on Insolvency (Bankruptcy),
                                                 a bankruptcy case must be considered within 7 months of the day
                                                 the petition was received by the arbitrazh court. Liquidation
                                                 proceedings by law are limited to 6 months and can be extended by
                   Moscow,                       6 more months (art. 124 of the Law on Insolvency (Bankruptcy)).
Time (in years)      Saint            2.0        Therefore, the time dictated by law is 19 months. However, in
                  Petersburg                     practice, liquidation proceedings are extended several times and for
                                                 longer periods. One reason for extension, for example, is that not all
                                                 mechanisms were used to collect on the debt, and court decisions
                                                 on this issue become effective only after appeals. Additionally, time
                                                 is needed to execute judicial acts.

                                                 Total cost of the insolvency proceedings will be around 9% of the
                                                 value of the estate, including:
                                                 - Fees of attorneys will be around RUB 1,000,000

       age 19, with one year of work experience.
     Is a full-time employee.
     Is not a member of the labor union, unless

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
