Note: The “distance to frontier” measure shows how far, on average, a state is at a point in time from the best performance achieved by any Nigerian state on each of the 4 Doing Business indicators
measured in Nigeria since 2010. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the frontier. The horizontal bars show the change in the distance to frontier from 2010
to 2014. The 5 states improving the most are highlighted in yellow. Today, the national frontier of good practices for starting a business is defined by Abuja, FCT (6 procedures and 17 days) and Kebbi
(cost of 44.4% of income per capita); for construction permits, by Adamawa (8 procedures), Jigawa (28 days), and Sokoto (cost of 173.5% of income per capita); for registering property, by Kwara (7
procedures), Jigawa (23 days) and Yobe (cost of 7.7% of the property value); and for enforcing contracts, by Lagos (40 procedures), Jigawa (261 days) and Katsina (cost of 26.0% of the claim value).
