Project Background:
The development thinking underlying both PIFRA I (closed on May 31, 2005) and the ongoing PIFRA II project, is that a government’s financial
control, reporting, and audit systems form the backbone of sound public financial management. This in turn affects better governance, and hence
improves the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditure, while increasing the potential for economic growth and poverty reduction.
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project development objectives are to: (a) build capacity to improve the accuracy, comprehensiveness, reliability, and timeliness of intra-year
and year-end financial reports at all levels of government; (b) improve public financial management, accountability, and transparency; (c) enhance
the capacity of public sector managers to use credible financial information for better and more informed decision-making; and (d) facilitate over-
sight of the use of public monies, and increase the national and international credibility of the government’s financial stat ements and assurance
processes. Additional financing emphasized transition and ownership of IT systems to the relevant government agencies i.e., Auditor General,
Ministry of Finance (MoF), and Controller General of Accounts.
    Component 1. Financial Accounting and Budgeting Systems (FABS): ensures support for FABS operations, strengthening the capacity of FABS
     to produce fiscal reports, integrating FABS into the Medium Term Budgetary Framework, and linking both systems to overall Public Financial
     Management (PFM) reforms. Aims to establish a firm relationship between budget and accounts, and allow the Ministry of Finance to use the
     SAP system as a platform for further PFM reforms.
    Component 2. Capacity Building and Upgrading of the Office of Auditor General: develops (a) central and field audit capacity to implement
     new methodologies by providing TA and training, and expanded/upgraded office space, equipment, and IT support; (b) an integrated audit
     management information system to improve audit control, reporting, and follow-up between the central and decentralized audit directorates;
     and (c) a comprehensive staff training program and upgrading of the training facility.
    Component 3. Project Management: includes financing of the PIFRA Directorate and sub-directorates at provincial headquarters, O&M costs
     such as hardware and software maintenance not covered under counterpart contributions, and activities under the aegis of federal and pro-
     vincial finance departments to reinforce the delivery of the fiscal management capacity building part of the project through those offices.

Results Achieved:
    Effective and transparent fiscal administration: this is facilitated by the rollout of a Medium Term Budgetary Framework which is supported
     by FABS.
    Effective and transparent financial reporting, control, audit: annual financial statements are prepared within six months of the close of the
     year. AGP-certified annual accounts submitted to president & governors within eight months of end of fiscal year.
    Effective corruption reducing measures related to accounts and budget control: bill-tracking generally shows improvement in the proportion
     of payments made within 3 days. Pension call centers established with increasing use by retirees, and pension payment direct to bank ac-
     counts introduced.
    Implementation of critical activity of SAP upgrade and award of contract for Procurement of Audit Management Information System will
     ensure achievement of target results and long term sustainability.
    Use of country systems for foreign aided-projects: Currently 17 Bank-funded projects are using on-line SAP system. Efforts are being made
     to replicate this achievement to other donor-funded projects.

Project Background:
Punjab is one of the most urbanized regions of South Asia. Institutional and systemic obstacles pose significant challenges to the governance and
management of urban areas. The government of Punjab (GoPunjab) is approaching the long-term urban reform agenda in three stages. In the first
stage, which is largely complete, reforms aimed at improving the operating environment for urban development were initiated. As a second step,
GoPunjab is currently focusing on strengthening urban governance - the institutions and management systems. Based on these policy and govern-
ance improvements, it plans to focus on service delivery improvements in the third stage of its urban strategy.
The project builds on the policy reforms already undertaken by GoPunjab, and focuses on supporting the management and accountability im-
provements envisaged under the second stage of the government’s urban agenda. The principal beneficiaries of the project are the five largest
cities (city district governments, or CDGs, and their agencies) in Punjab.
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project development objectives are to support Punjab’s cities in strengthening systems for improved planning, resource ma nagement, and
accountability, and to improve the province’s capacity to respond promptly and effectively to a crisis or emergency. Project components are:
    Component 1. Performance Grant: focuses on two areas of urban governance: (a) resource planning and management, seeking to improve
     decision-making, consolidate revenue sources, and strengthen resource mobilization; and (b) transparency and voice in the preparation,
     monitoring, and evaluation of plans and programs in urban areas. This component will provide an annual grant to the project cities, based on
     achievement of specified annual targets against a set of Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) in selected governance areas.
    Component 2. Project Implementation and Capacity Building: supports the cities and province to achieve the annual DLIs.
    Component 3. Contingent Emergency Response (with zero allocation): will support rapid response to disaster events by allowing for rapid
     reallocation of credit proceeds from other components under streamlined procurement and disbursement procedures, or by channeling addi-
     tional funds, should they become available as a result of the emergency.

Results Achieved:
    CDGs and their service delivery entities have adopted the entire urban area as their planning boundaries.
    Annual development budgets have been consolidated.
    Financial transfers from the province to all city entities are being reported to CDGs.
    Development of business procedures in procurement, public disclosure, and grievance redressal is underway.
    Action Plans for enhancing self-collected own-source revenues have been developed by CDGs and Water and Sanitation Agency (WASAs).
    Urban Immoveable Property Tax (UIPT) Automation including digitization of property ownership records and field validation has been com-
     pleted for Sialkot, and is in various stages of implementation in the five project cities.
    A capacity building and training plan, and a training manual on operationalizing the Environmental and Social Management Framework
     (ESMF)have been developed. This is to ensure building requisite capacity for application of ESMF in 10% of all civil works contracts of CDGs
     and WASAs. Trainings of city officials are now underway.
    Development of the Financial Management Information System (FMIS) for DAs and WASAs has commenced.

Project Background:
The Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) lag behind other regions of Pakistan across a wide range of social and economic indicators, and
have the lowest level of urbanization. Moreover, post-9/11 events have severely impacted FATA and led to acute destabilization of the region.
Based on the recognition that existing rural-tribal society in FATA and its scattered settlement pattern is not conducive to the provision of facilities
and civic amenities in an efficient and cost-effective manner, the government has launched its flagship Tribal Areas’ Rural -to-Urban Centres Con-
version Initiative (TARUCCI) program. It envisions setting the stage for an overall socio-economic transformation by providing a range of basic
services to improve the quality of life in the fourteen urban centers across FATA. The project aims to develop the implementation framework for
TARUCCI, and pilot the approach in Khar town, Bajaur Agency.
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project development objective is to improve urban services and management in Khar, Bajaur Agency, and develop a framework for urban
management in FATA. The project is envisaged as an urban community driven development (CDD) operation, where investment needs are being
identified and prioritized by the citizens of Khar town.
    Component 1. Priority Infrastructure Investment Projects: supports priority infrastructure investments in Khar town in Bajaur Agency. Sub-
     projects to be supported under this component will include rehabilitation, reconstruction, expansion, and upgrading of urban municipal in-
     frastructure and services, including water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, streetlights, drains, roads, firefighting, and a general
     bus terminal.
    Component 2. Technical Assistance and Implementation Support: to a) design and develop an overall urban management framework to be
     implemented under the TARUCCI program in all 14 towns in FATA; and b) detail the implementation plan for the pilot center (Khar, Bajaur
     Agency) being supported under this project. It will also support strengthening of the already established TARUCCI Project Management Unit
     (TPMU), and building key competencies within it for the effective oversight of project activities, and the FATA Secretariat’s Directorate of L o-
     cal Government & Rural Development (LG&RD) for efficient implementation of investments. Reinforce the delivery of the fiscal management
     capacity building part of the project through those offices.

Results Expected and Achieved:
Plan for Khar developed, including: (i) priority service delivery needs based on feedback received from the local community through focus group
discussions and a household survey; (ii) vital baseline information on service delivery coverage and quality; (iii) Geographic Information System
maps with spatial representation of population distribution, growth trends, and existing services; (iv) urban structure plan analyzing likely growth
and development scenarios; and (v) scope and targets for service delivery improvements to be achieved through infrastructure sub-projects car-
ried out under the Project;
    An urban management framework (institutional structures, business processes, and financial management guidelines), and implementation
     plan developed for FATA.
    450 solar powered street lights have been operationalized in Khar.
    900 piped water supply connections provided/restored in Khar.
    2.3 Km of all-season road access provided within 500 meters of places of residence to beneficiaries in Khar.

Project Background:
Punjab, with 60 percent of the total population, holds the key to Pakistan’s progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals. Punjab’s
overall health outcomes are comparable to the national average or slightly better than other provinces, but the pace of change remains slow and
uneven with significant disparities among regions, rural and urban areas, and by economic status. The quality of care in government facilities is
sub-optimal, resulting in low use of health services provided by the public sector. The government of Punjab has prepared the Punjab Health Sector
Strategy (HSS) 2012-2020, based on the health system framework, outlining a clear strategic direction focused on results. The project envisages
supporting implementation of the reforms and strengthening the health system to undertake stewardship functions devolved under the 18th
Amendment to the Constitution.
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project development objective is to support implementation of the Punjab Health Sector Strategy by focusing on improving coverage and use
of quality essential health services, particularly in low performing districts of Punjab. The project focuses on building the capacity and systems to
strengthen accountability and stewardship in the Department of Health (DoH), and uses a results-based approach (Disbursement Linked Indica-
tors). The project is also supported by US$20.0 million from the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF) and US$1.5 million for impact
evaluation of the pilots. The project has four components:
    Component 1. Improving Health Service Delivery: the objective is to enhance coverage, quality and access to an essential package of health
     care services including outreach and community level interventions for primary health care (PHC). The Bank’s technical en gagement and
     monitoring will focus on the following thematic areas: integrated management of maternal, neonatal and child health and lady health worker
     programs, nutrition services, and HIV/AIDS preventive services.
    Component 2. Enhancing Efficiency and Effectiveness of the Health System: the objective is to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of the
     health system by strengthening ongoing initiatives with a focus on management and accountability and improving quality of care through
     regulations and standardization of services (PHC contracting out, results-based district management contract, governance and accountability
     mechanisms).
    Component 3. Strengthening Provincial Department of Health management capacity: the objective is to strengthen and reorganize the cur-
     rent DoH management system to improve stewardship, fiduciary, and monitoring functions.
    Component 4. Improving the Capacities in Technical Areas for Equitable Health Services: this component supports innovative pilots to guide
     policy development in results-based financing and alternate financing approaches, besides strengthening existing analytical capacities in
     technical areas (results-based financing pilots in two districts, piloting of alternative financing models, impact evaluation for results based fi-
     nancing pilots).

Results Expected:
The success of the project in meeting its objectives will be measured by the following outcome indicators disaggregated by income quintile and
district, where appropriate, and in line with the project’s strong pro-poor focus, particularly in low performing districts of Punjab: (1) fully im-
munized children 12-23 months of age; (2) births attended by skilled health personnel; (3) modern contraceptive prevalence rate; (4) children 0-
24 months of age receiving basic package of nutrition services; (5) issuance of a certificate of registration for public and private health facilities;
and (6) community satisfaction.

Project Background:
Pakistan is one of three countries currently battling polio (Afghanistan and Nigeria are the other two) and it continues to face virus transmission
across the country. There were 198 confirmed cases in 2011, up from 144 in 2010. The number of cases declined in 2012 to 47 for the first nine
months of the year. But there were 93 cases in 2013, and have been 15 so far in 2014, as of late February. Therefore, there is a serious need to
revisit the country’s polio eradication strategy, because it is not delivering.

The project is the third in a series of partnership operations since 2003 providing financial resources to the government of Pakistan to help it fight
polio. All operations have been supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the United Nations Fund (UNF), which have committed to
‘buy down’ Bank financed credits, on achievement of agreed performance measures, verified by third parties. With the availabi lity of other funding
sources to fight polio, the Bank is supporting the strengthening of routine immunization, which will contribute towards eradication.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project development objective is to assist Pakistan's efforts to eradicate polio through supply of the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) for the country's
Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs).The project has assisted the government of Pakistan's Polio Eradication Initiative by decreasing the
number of polio cases and ultimately eradicating the disease in Pakistan. Bank funds only financed procurement of OPVs through UNICEF. The
operational cost is met through other partners, and implementation is supported by technical partners (WHO and UNICEF).

Results Achieved:
As of October 2013, 844,110,830 children immunized with OPV during SIAs in the project period (86,888,501 in 2013, and 146,700,000 in 2012).

Project Background:
Health indicators for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) have been improving but remain poor in comparison to countries in the region. Health facilities in
KP lack equipment, medicines and other essential supplies. The frequent and continuous emergencies and crises faced by the province have had a
severe impact on health care provision. Militants have attacked facilities, carried out vandalism (theft of expensive equipment), and there is coer-
cion, killing and kidnappings of health personnel. Provision of health services is also hampered by lack of qualified personnel, vacant posts and
high levels of absenteeism. People in the province are not satisfied with the quality of health services delivered in the public sector institutions.
The project was implemented in six crisis-affected (security compromised and floods) districts of KP for a period of three years. It is expected that
by the end of the project there will be: a) increased use and coverage of primary and secondary health care services in the districts; b) an adequate-
ly equipped and functional health infrastructure; c) improved supervision and timely use of allocated resources through key management deci-
sions based on evidence; and d) increased community satisfaction with publicly provided health services.
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
    The project development objective is to improve the availability, accessibility, and delivery of primary and secondary health care services at the
    district level. The project consists of three components:

      Component 1. Revitalizing health care services: the primary health care centers will be reorganized into hubs, and support will be provided to
       enable delivery of a comprehensive package of health care services. Management of all facilities in the hubs will be outsourced through a
       competitive process to a private firm/non-governmental organization, which will be responsible for a comprehensive package of care to the
       communities. The secondary (District Head Quarters - DHQ) hospitals in the project districts will also be improved.
      Component 2. Rehabilitation of Health Infrastructure in the Districts: some health facilities damaged during the crisis will be rehabilitated to
       enable service delivery. No new facilities will be constructed, and only existing infrastructure will be rehabilitated.
      Component 3. Establish and operationalize a robust monitoring and evaluation system at district and provincial levels: This component will
       support operationalizing the monitoring and evaluation systems to guide project implementation at the district level, and dissemination of
       the results through province-wide analysis. It will also support operationalization of the District Health Information System (DHIS), and pe-
       riodic evaluations.

Results Expected:
The project implementation has not yielded measurable results to date as there have been considerable delays in implementation. The project still
has serious internal issues compounded by factors outside of the control of Department of Health. However, the key performance indicators in-
clude: access to a defined basic package of health, nutrition, and reproductive health services, births attended by skilled health personnel, modern
contraceptive prevalence rate, children with severe acute malnutrition provided adequate nutrition services, community satisfaction.

Project Background:
Pakistan’s electricity sector faces a large gap between supply and demand. Widespread load shedding – disconnecting the electric current when
demand is greater than supply – is prevalent, affecting economic growth. A shift over the past decade towards expensive fuel oil has also increased
the cost of electricity generation. Expanding hydropower generation is therefore fundamental to address Pakistan’s long -term energy issues. The
project is an important element of the Bank’s energ y sector strategy of supporting strategic investment projects in generation and transmission
infrastructure that contribute to the structural shift to a low-cost, low carbon fuel mix. The project involves constructing a power house, modifying
a tunnel, and installing three 470 MW power units (1410 MW) on an existing dam located 60km north-west of Islamabad on the River Indus. It will
add 3,840 GWh of low-cost renewable energy by June 2018, during peak summer months when shortages are at their worst.
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
    The project development objective is to facilitate a sustainable expansion in Pakistan's electricity generation capacity. The project would also
    strengthen the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA)'s capacity to develop the country's hydropower resources. The project has
    five components:
   Component 1. Construction of Power House: covers civil works, including a power house, a penstock, and modification of intake tunnels
    (Number 3 and 4).
   Component 2. Power Units: covers cost and installation of turbines, generators, transformers, ancillary electro-mechanical equipment, and a
    short transmission line.
   Component 3. Social Action & Environmental Management Plan: covers implementation of SAP, EMP, Dam safety and monitoring, and glaciers
    monitoring.
Results Achieved:
   Electricity supply of 3,840 GWh of renewable energy annually to the central grid.
   Availability of 1,410 MW of additional power generation capacity during peak summer demand period.
   Reduction in the overall production cost of energy due to low-cost, low carbon energy by 2.3 percent.
   Preparation of a large hydropower project on the Indus River and successful completion of an agreed capacity building program for WAPDA.

Project Background:
Balochistan is the largest of Pakistan’s four provinces, covering 44 percent of the country, but with the lowest population density. It is Pakistan’s
least developed province, with 47 percent of the population estimated to live below the official poverty line. Agriculture is the mainstay of Balochi-
stan’s economy, accounting for some 60 percent of its GDP and employing around two thirds of the labor force. Balochistan is unique in terms of
the different types of irrigated agriculture practiced and issues related to sustainable use of scare water resources (annual average rainfall is less
than 200 mm). The irrigated area in Balochistan is about 1.7 million hectares, of which 0.83 million ha are watered by perennial irrigation and the
rest by either flood diversion, spate irrigation, or water harvesting systems. Climate change has impacted water availability, and Balochistan is
subject to periodic drought and floods. Better management of these scarce resources remains critical for rural development and reducing poverty.
The Pishin Lora Basin is a major river basin in Balochistan spread over five districts with a population of about 1.2 million.
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project development objective is to support efforts by the government of Balochistan to improve the management of scarce water resources in
the Pishin Lora Basin (PLB) by reducing the overall impact of the present water crisis. Key indicators are: (i) increased surface water availability
and reduced groundwater depletion; (ii) increased water productivity; and (iii) expanded local capacity and participation of farmers to implement
schemes and formulate plans for sustainable water resources development and watershed management. The project has three components:
      Component 1. Partial Restoration of Water Storage Capacity to the Bund Khushdil Khan (BKK) Reservoir: to help restore the hydrological
       balance in the basin by partially restoring the BKK reservoir’s storage capacity, facilitating the recharge of the aquifer, and improving conve y-
       ance and water management efficiency at the farm level in the BKK command area. Alternatives to improving conveyance and on-farm intro-
       duction of new technologies will be offered to the BKK watershed, and rangeland will be rehabilitated.
      Component 2. Small-scale Irrigation Schemes: to improve operation of approx. 15 small-scale irrigation schemes (SSIS) in the Pishin Lora
       Basin. Activities will include: improving existing karezes, providing flood protection, lining irrigation channels, and building associated struc-
       tures such as flow division and small storage tanks. Will also provide greater focus on farmer participation through on-the-job training to de-
       velop skills for operation and maintenance.
      Component 3. Institutional Capacity Building, Further Studies, and Preparation of the Next Phase: to enhance technical, administrative, and
       managerial capacity of the Irrigation and Power Department and other water management-affiliated departments through training, technical
       advisory services, and study tours on water management. Will also support formation and capacity building of farmers organizations and
       community organizations.

Results Achieved:
    The project has overcome numerous obstacles, ranging from security and conflict to land acquisition, as well as deteriorating capacity since 2011.
    Most project activities are complete.
      Around an 84 percent average increase in conveyance efficiency in small scale irrigation.
      Over 30 percent increase in crop yields.
      50 percent increase in crop intensity.
      54 percent increase in cropped area.
      Quality of works completed is very good, and certain capacity has been built in engineering.

Project Background:
    Natural gas is a vital source of energy in Pakistan, representing 49 percent of the country’s total primary energ y supply. Natural gas is transmitted
    and distributed by two companies, Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd. (SSGC) and Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd. (SNGPL), in the southern and
    northern parts of the country. Pakistan has high levels of unaccounted for gas (UFG – the difference between metered gas received by a gas utility
    and volume of gas delivered to its consumers). UFG is a major contributor to the gas supply crisis. It is typically 1-2 percent in OECD countries,
    compared to around 11 percent in Pakistan. UFG is mainly a result of the dilapidated gas distribution network, inaccurate metering, and theft.
    Most recent FY12 data records the UFG number is 10.4 percent for both the northern (SNGPL) and Southern (SSGC) networks put together. The
    value of this UFG at the estimated weighted average well-head price in FY12 is US$325 million nationwide. The value of furnace oil import that
    could be avoided if all UFG was available for power generation in FY12 is US$2.2 billion (based on heat rates of Pakistan's IPPs for gas-fired and
    FO-fired generation). Additionally, the UFG problem is becoming increasingly intolerable in view of the growing gas and power shortages.
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
    The project objective is to enhance the supply of natural gas in Pakistan by reducing the physical and commercial losses of gas in the pipeline
    system.
       Component 1: UFG Reduction: This component will finance Goods and Works that will help reduce unaccounted-for gas (UFG) in the gas
        distribution system, including system segmentation and pressure management, pipe replacement and repair, cathodic protection, and ad-
        vanced metering systems.
       Component 2: Appliance Efficiency Pilot Project: This component will finance modern, energy efficient gas appliances and/or retrofit appli-
        ance components for residential consumers in a pilot project.
       Component 3: Technical Assistance: This component will finance assistance to the implementation agency for improving its organizational
        capacity and customer orientation and for managing the Project.

Results Achieved:
    The project has overcome numerous obstacles, ranging from security and conflict to land acquisition, as well as deteriorating capacity since 2011.

Project Background:
In August 2010, Pakistan experienced terrible floods - a body of water the size of Britain travelled across the country. The flooding had a cata-
strophic effect on households all over the country. More than 20 million people were affected. In response, a two-phased unconditional cash trans-
fer program, the Citizen’s Damage Compensation Program (CDCP), was designed to support flood-affected families. Phase-I was co-financed by the
federal and provincial governments and Phase-II by the World Bank, DFID, USAID, and the government of Italy (US$580 million, of which US$125
million provided by IDA). Phase II provides two payments of PKR20,000 (US$213) to flood-affected households, identified through provincial
housing damage data (subject to third party verification) followed by biometric verification with the national ID database for enrolment in the
program, through more than 95 registration centers that were set up in all flood affected districts. Each enrolled household received a debit card
issued by commercial banks at the registration center, where they could also withdraw payments. Beneficiaries could also access any ATM in the
country to make withdrawals. Registration centers had a counter to record grievances over eligibility, updates to national identity cards, and
payments.

The CDCP program is a worldwide success story and has become a flagship program for the government of Pakistan. It was the basis for a Future
Disaster Response Action Plan (FDRAP), approved by Pakistani prime minister, which builds on lessons learned from CDCP and other international
best practices to provide cash assistance for early disaster recovery. The design of CDCP was also used as a blueprint for provincial responses to
floods in 2011 and 2012.
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
To support the recovery of flood-affected households by assisting the government of Pakistan in strengthening the implementation of its Citizen’s
Damage Compensation Program. The project has two components:

    Component 1. Effective Delivery of the Cash Grants to Flood-Affected Families: provides cash grants to eligible households in two installments
     through the commercial banking system.
    Component 2. Strengthen Program Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation: provides technical assistance to enhance program management,
     transparency, and accountability at the federal, provincial, and local levels through capacity building, communication and public information,
     and monitoring and evaluation, as well as accessible advisory services for beneficiaries.

Results Achieved:
    Payments (PKR 40,000) to an estimated 1.2 million households (against the target of 1 million).
    77 percent of beneficiaries express satisfaction with program delivery (against the target of 70 percent).
    99.3 percent of beneficiaries pick up their benefit within 72 hours of delivery (against a target of 85 percent)
    Management Information System, grievance, and evaluation systems are in place and functioning.

Project Background:
The government of Pakistan established the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) in 2008 to help the poor cope with income shocks by provid-
ing them with monthly cash transfers and other complementary programs to enhance human development and income-generating opportunities.
BISP was set up as an autonomous institution, unanimously approved by parliament in August 2012. Over the last 6 years, the program has
evolved into a modern social safety net system. In 2009, capitalizing on analytical and operational work in the country, the Bank supported
strengthening BISP through a Social Protection Development Policy Credit (US$150 million) together with a Social Safety Net Technical Assistance
Project (US$60 million). This support enabled the government to establish appropriate institutional, governance, and accountability arrangements
for providing targeted safety nets to the poor. The TA project, among others, supported the national roll-out of a targeting system using the Proxy
Means Test (PMT)-based Poverty Scorecard (PSC) via a door-to-door census. The project also assisted the government to create a National Poverty
Registry comprising information on more than 27 million households (approx. 170 million people), identifying 7.2 million eligible families (approx.
35 million people), and providing payments to more than 4.8 million families using modern payments technology. To expand coverage of safety net
cash transfers and to support operationalization of conditional cash transfers linked to primary education, the project was restructured with addi-
tional financing in March 2012, following a results-based financing approach.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project aims to support expansion and strengthening of the country's safety net, with particular focus on the BISP. The project components
are:

    Component 1. Establish a National Targeting System and Expand Coverage of the Basic Safety Net System: to develop and strengthen the
     national targeting system to support nationwide coverage of safety net beneficiaries.
    Component 2. Strengthen Safety Net Operation: supports institutional development and implementation of the communication strategy;
     grievance redressal for cash transfers; strengthening payment and reconciliation mechanisms; and the design and roll-out of Co-
     responsibility Cash Transfers (CCT) linked to primary education of beneficiaries’ children.
    Component 3. Enhance Safety Net Program Management, Accountability, and Evaluation: supports setting up program control and accounta-
     bility mechanisms through a management information system (MIS); third party monitoring and evaluations; and use of technology for pro-
     gram administration, especially for payments and grievance redressal.
    Component 4. Develop the Social Protection and Strategy Monitoring: supports the design of the institutional and legal framework for execut-
     ing the National Social Protection Policy (NSPP), and design and implementation of monitoring mechanisms for federal and provincial social
     protection programs.

Results Achieved:
    65 percent of cash transfers received by beneficiaries in bottom quintiles 1 and 2 (against 46 percent baseline, 70 percent target);
    Poverty scorecard applied to 27 million households (target achieved);
    87 percent of beneficiaries satisfied with program implementation (above target of 70 percent).

Project Background:
Balochistan has always ranked bottom in the country in education and other key social indicators. Challenges in the education sector are numer-
ous. They include low access, in a geographically widespread area with small, sparsely populated communities; large gender disparities; quality;
limited private sector participation; and poor institutional capacity of the public sector. Recognizing the numerous, complex issues facing the
sector, the government of Balochistan (GoB) committed to testing different small-scale models of public-private partnerships in the delivery of
primary education under the Balochistan Education Support Project (BESP). The project is implemented by the semi-autonomous Balochistan
Education Foundation (BEF), an apex financing body with a mandate to support public-private partnerships and community partnerships in educa-
tion. The project tests a community-led education delivery model in the province.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The objective of the project is to promote public-private and community partnerships to improve access to quality primary education, in particular
for girls. The project consists of three components to be implemented under partnership arrangements between BEF and three distinct types of
implementation partners: community schools, private schools, and technical assistance partners:

    Component 1. Establishing New Community Schools in Rural Areas. To provide school-aged children with access to quality primary education

Project Background:
Balochistan is geographically the largest province of Pakistan, comprising roughly 48 percent of its land but with the lowest share of population, at
around five percent. The province has been severely affected for many years by security and political conflict, harming economic growth. The
situation is exacerbated by poor communication and road infrastructure, as well as weak governance structures. Floods in 2010 and 2011 have
added to the economic difficulties of the province. Balochistan has always ranked the lowest in the country in education, with access to schools
limited to only 60 percent of its settlements. Existing schools lack basic facilities and learning materials. Education indictors for girls are the lowest
in the country, with girls’ Net Enrollment Rate (NER) only 40 percent, and in some parts of the province as low as seven perc ent.

In response to a request by the government of Pakistan, a Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) was established to finance critical investments in sup-
port of reconstruction and peace building in crisis-affected areas of Pakistan, which included Balochistan province. A Balochistan Development
Needs Assessment (BDNA) was conducted by the Bank in 2012 and the government requested funds to support access to girls’ education under the
MDTF.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project development objective is to improve access to education and retention of children in schools, with a special emphasis on girls, in the
province of Balochistan. The main components of the project are:

    Component 1 – Construction of building facilities for 130 shelterless girls’ schools: the aim is to improve provision of school infrastruc ture
     and help the government to: a) confirm functionality of schools through third party assessment; b) establish criteria to prioritize schools on a
     needs basis; and 3) involve communities in school management.
    Component 2 – Provision of missing facilities for 200 girls’ schools: provide missing facilities including toilets; boundary walls; additional
     rooms; blackboards; furniture and drinking water in girls’ primary and middle schools identified for rehabilitation.
    Component 3 – Establishment of 150 new government primary schools with community participation: this component supports government
     policy to establish new gender free schools on a demand basis, with active community participation in the management of schools to ensure
     local support and protection for the facility, children and teachers.
     Component 4 – Technical Assistance (TA) to the Education Department for implementation and monitoring at the district level: support the
     establishment of systems and procedures for effective planning and implementation of construction and rehabilitation activities; introduce
     new or innovative approaches for community-government partnerships; establish robust monitoring systems, including by third parties;
     technical assistance; and the development of a communications strategy.

Results Achieved:
    Construction has started on 49 out of 130 shelterless schools, 26 completed.
    107 out of 200 schools are undergoing rehabilitation.
    School sites have been selected for approximately 65 out of 150 new schools to be started with community partnership. Teacher recruitment
     completed.
    Approximately 44,000 children enrolled in the improved facilities.

* As of February 28, 2014

Project Background:
Pakistan's performance in school participation has been poor in absolute terms, relative to other countries in the region, and relative to developing
countries at its level of per capita income. Based on existing trends, Pakistan is unlikely to meet the Millennium Development Goals of universal
primary education by 2015. Sindh is one of the four provinces of Pakistan where the education indicators remain low. In 2010/11, net enrollment
rates (NERs) at the primary (ages 6–10, grades 1–5), middle (ages 11–13, grades 6–8), and high school (ages 14–15, grades 9–10) levels in the
province were 62 percent, 36 percent, and 23 percent, respectively. Evidence suggests that children from poor households and girls in rural areas
experience the largest participation shortfalls. There are also significant differences in school participation rates across the province's 23 districts.

In FY2007/08, the Sindh government initiated a multifaceted, medium-term sector reform program for primary and secondary education called
the Sindh Education Sector Reform Program (SERP). The Bank provided financial support to SERP through the Sindh Education Sector Develop-
ment Policy Credit (SEDPC) in FY2007/08 and the Sindh Education Sector Project (SESP) between FY2008/09 –FY2011/12.

SERP II is an evolutionary next step by the government, shaped by the lessons learnt in the delivery of the previous programs. One of the key
lessons was that to raise government school performance, additional and potentially more powerful actions to strengthen administration systems,
governance and accountability, are required. Under SERP II, the government plans to maximize school reform efforts by simultaneously improving
governance and management of service delivery.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project development objective is to raise school participation by improving sector governance and accountability, strengthening administra-
tive systems and measuring student achievement. It is a results-based financing project with 10 Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) priced
equally. A specific investment credit is proposed to support SERP II over the four-year period FY2011/12–FY2015/16. The project will reflect the
general design features of SESP and is expected to have two components:

    Component 1. Results-based financing of the Sindh government's SERP II: under the results-based component, which is expected to consti-
     tute at least 95 percent of the total credit, the project will disburse against Disbursement Linked Indicators, agreed with the government and
     with yearly targets.
    Component 2. Technical Assistance: it is expected to finance selected, well-defined implementation support and capacity-building activities,
     as well as efforts to strengthen fiduciary, safeguard, monitoring and evaluation systems. It will also finance independent inspections, audits
     and evaluations of selected reforms and activities under SERP II.

Results Achieved:
Results of the first year of implementation will be available in June/July 2014. The project is still waiting for a legal opinion from the province.
Implementing entities – the Education and Literacy Department of Sindh (ELD), and the Reform Support Unit (RSU) - are working to catch up on
delays caused by late signing.

* As of February 28, 2014

Project Background:
This project recognizes the government of Sindh’s strong interest in strengthening technical and vocational education and training (TVET); that the
labor force’s lack of skills poses significant constraints; and that the TVET sector faces substantial challenges. Project de sign takes into account the
need for both structural reforms to strengthen the quality and relevance of TVET (components 2 and 3), and short-term improvements in the
provision of training (component 1).

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project development objective is to support the government of Sindh in strengthening its training programs to improve the skills and employ-
ability of trainees. The project includes three components:

    Component 1. Supporting the provision and relevance of short-term vocational training to 45,000 targeted trainees: through private and
     public training providers selected through a competitive process.
    Component 2. Results-based support for competitively selected programs and training providers: to develop market-driven training with a
     focus on curriculum development and equipment provision. (19 percent of funding)
    Component 3. Technical assistance to strengthen capacity of the Sindh Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (STEVTA) to
     implement component two activities.

Results Achieved:
    Over 30,000 youth are currently enrolled in short term vocational training programs financed by the project. The next round of training is
     expected to be launched in May 2014.
    70 training programs competitively selected. Institute Management Committees (IMCS) with private sector representation have been estab-
     lished in each of the selected training institutes. One of the four Disbursement Linked Indicators has been achieved, and disbursements have
     been made accordingly.
    A technical assistance firm is in the process of developing demand-responsive curricula and equipment lists for the training programs select-
     ed under component two of the project.

* As of February 28, 2014

Project Background:
Pakistan’s performance in education has generally been poor relative to other countries in South Asia, and relative to ot her developing countries at
its level of per capita income. Shortfalls persist in school participation, attainment, and student achievement in Punjab province. In 2010/11, net
enrollment rates (NERs) at the primary, middle, and high school levels were 70 percent, 37 percent, and 25 percent, respectively. The main con-
cern is for children who never go to school: in 2010/11, 27 percent of 6-10 year olds, and 19 percent of 11-15 year olds, had never been to school.
The story for educational attainment is mixed. Students tend to complete primary education (up to grade 5), but are less successful in transitioning
to and completing secondary education (grades 6-10): from 2010–11, 92 percent of 15–19 year old school-goers completed primary school,
whereas only 50 percent of 20–24 year old school-goers completed secondary school.

The Punjab Education Sector Reform Program (PESRP) has been underway since 2003. Building on the institutional, administrative, and program
foundations of PESRP, the provincial government developed its next medium-term reform program, the Second Punjab Education Sector Reform
Program (PESRP II) to accelerate the pace of progress towards its education sector goals.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project development objective of PESRP II is to support the education sector reform program of the government of Punjab to increase child
school participation at multiple levels, as well as student achievement. The project includes:

    Component 1. Results-Based: promoting student outcomes, as well as teacher quality and performance, through initiatives that include (i)
     introducing test-based teacher recruitment; (ii) strengthening the system of field-based advisory support to teachers in the classroom in poor
     schools with low achievement; (iii) fixing and reallocating teaching posts and teachers at the school level; and (iv) offering supplemental cash
     transfers tied to attendance in rural districts where there has been poor secondary school attendance for girls.
    Component 2. Technical Assistance (TA): finances essential advisory, technical, and capacity-building support.

Results Achieved:
    PKR 3.4 billion has been provided to schools in eight districts to meet non-salary related spending in the first phase of implementation.
    150,000 tuition-replacement vouchers given to poor children in urban slum areas to access private schools.
    District and school performance report cards distributed to all schools in the province for better accountability.
    130,000 candidates have been tested to qualify for a teaching post in the province.
    Close to five million students in grades 5 and 8 of public and private schools are being tested annually.
    More than 393,000 girls are receiving cash stipends for attending middle and high schools in the worst performing districts of the province.

* As of February 28, 2014

Project Background:
The Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) is the most underdeveloped region in Pakistan with over 60 percent of its population living below
national poverty line. Most people depend on subsistence agriculture and livestock, and the visible lack of progress means that even small shocks
translate into large increases in destitution that deepen poverty.

Transport in the crisis area of FATA depends solely on roads. The total network is about 6,578 km, of which about 66 percent is paved and primari-
ly comprises single lane roads. Accessibility provided by the network is limited – road density is low (0.24 km/square km) and FATA does not
compare favorably with rest of Pakistan (0.32 km/square km). The project aims to improve connectivity in the Bajaur and Orakzai Agencies of
FATA by building all weather-paved rural roads on existing non-motor accessible earthen tracks.

The project focuses on early recovery priorities agreed between the FATA authorities and the World Bank as the administrator of the Multi-Donor
Trust Fund (MDTF). (The project supports Pillar1: Restoration of Damaged Infrastructure and Disrupted Services of the MDTF Financing Strategy).

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project development objective is to increase year-round access for the rural population in conflict hit areas.

    Component 1. Infrastructure building: construction of rural roads and related structures.
    Component 2. Project management: supporting engineering design; contract administration and construction supervision; as well as safe-
     guards related to consultant services and other project management activities, through the financing of incremental operating costs.

Results Achieved:
The project aims to improve connectivity through construction of about 50 km of all-weather paved rural roads. The expected outcome is an in-
crease in the share of population with all season access and increase in number of motorized trips taken by beneficiaries living along the rural
roads. The anticipated results will support governmental efforts to help maintain economic activity and improve social and political stability in
FATA.

Project Background:
The project carries out emergency rebuilding of priority roads damaged during the conflict in the Province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP). It focuses
on early recovery priorities agreed between the government of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and the World Bank, as administrator of the Multi-Donor
Trust Fund (MDTF).

Given the deep crisis, exacerbated by devastating 2010 floods, the project’s first priority was the restoration and improveme nt of pedestrian and
vehicle access to some of the province’s poorest areas in the Swat Valley. The project aims to rehabilitate priority damaged roads and bridges to
make them fully operational, guaranteeing access 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to improve access and mobility. The project would benefit
about 300,000 people. The expected outcome is improved traffic flow, resulting in reduced vehicle operating costs and travel time for road users.
(The project supports Pillar1: Restoration of Damaged Infrastructure and Disrupted Services of the MDTF Financing Strategy).

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project development objective is to enable the population along the project corridor to benefit from year-round improved access and mobility
through reconstruction of priority damaged roads and bridges in the conflict hit areas.

    Component 1 – Infrastructure rebuilding involving reconstruction and/or improvement of strategic roads and bridges; and
    Component 2 – Project management providing support for contract administration, construction supervision and safeguards-related consult-
     ant services and incremental operating costs.

Results Achieved:
    Highly satisfactorily implementation progress.
    15.5 km of the provincial highway S-3B reconstructed.
    Due to the reconstruction of 15.5 km of road, several social and commercial activities have been established, including: three schools; three
     medical and health care centers; eight grocery stores; two auto workshops; one restaurant; and three farms.
    Improved traffic flow resulting in reduced vehicle operating costs and travel time for road users.

Project Background:
Karachi Port’s Eastern Wharf is extremely restricted in its operational capacity. Vessels carrying heavier bulk like cement a nd rice have to be
lightened at deep-water berths outside the port (berths one to five) in order to reduce draught and proceed to resume operations at berths located
inside the port with lesser draft (berths 22 and 23 with draughts of 7.3 meters). Given that the waterfront berths 15 to 17A are out of service, there
is increasing congestion and delays to vessel operations. The rehabilitation of berths 15 to 17A will make it possible to dredge to a depth of 16
meters, create a larger apron area with new bollards and a wide paved area, as well as a uniform quay wall. The new facility will also provide an
ample backyard area, permitting flexible management of the new port infrastructure.
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project development objective is to replace the lost port capacity and reduce shipping costs to the Pakistan economy through the reconstruc-
tion of the failed berths at Karachi port, and increase the effectiveness and efficiency of port operations, while enhancing environmental sustaina-
bility. The project has two components:

    Component 1. Financing reconstruction of berths 15 to 17A on the East Wharf at Karachi Port.
    Component 2. Institutional strengthening, addressing three main areas:
    (i) Sub-component 1: preparing a five-year business plan and vision document that covers capital investments, operations, human resource
     development, land management, information technology and port user representation.
    (ii) Sub-component 2: strengthening port environmental management to eventually comply with ISO international standards.
    (iii) Sub-component 3: improving financial management and planning to meet IFRS accounting standards and effectively utilize port reve-
     nues.

Results Achieved:
    Reduction in the ship-waiting-to-service time ratio for the project berths. This will be measured after the project births become operational.
     The civil work for reconstruction is progressing well, with the contractor achieving nearly 55 percent progress by end January 2014. Two
     berths expected to be handed over for operations by July 2014, while the remainder will be ready by December 2014.
    Improvement in occupancy and rate of cargo handling at the project berths. To be measured after they become operational.
    Increase in through-put of the project berths. This will be measured after they become operational.
    Consultant firm hired to prepare the Karachi Port Trust’s (KPT) Strategic/Business Development Plan and is expected to commence work by
     end March 2014.
    Development and implementation of an environmental management system. Consultant firm has done a gap analysis. Documentation is
     completed, master trainers have been identified and the training of trainers is underway.
    KPT’s financial audits fully compliant with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). KPT has fulfilled the require ment to move
     towards IFRS-compliant accounts well before the target date. KPT’s fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011 financial statements were IFRS compliant. The
     subsequent statements are also being prepared to comply with IFRS.

Project Background:
The project is designed to support the rehabilitation and modernization of the Jinnah Barrage on the Indus river system, while reinforcing ongoing
reform to the water, irrigation and drainage sector through support and the monitoring of progress. Jinnah Barrage is one of the most important
structures in Pakistan’s irrigation system, handling all the Indus River’s water. It provides water to the Thal Canal, which covers an area of 2.1
million acres in a zone of arid desert, where crop production is only feasible with irrigation. About five million people in five districts live in the
area and their livelihoods, directly or indirectly, depend on irrigation from canal. Underground water is saline in some places, and the local popula-
tion depends exclusively on the canal for drinking water.
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The overarching project objectives are to assist the borrower in: (i) rehabilitating and modernizing Jinnah Barrage and carrying out affiliated
works to enable reliable and uninterrupted supply of water for over 2.1 million acres of farmland, benefitting about 600,000 farm families for
irrigation and domestic water users; and (ii) build capacity to improve water resources and irrigation system management.

    Component 1: Rehabilitation and Modernization of Jinnah Barrage. Financing of rehabilitation and modernization of Jinnah Barrage, imple-
     mentation of social and environmental management plans, and construction supervision and support for the project’s preparatio n and im-
     plementation.
    Component 2: Improvement and Modernization of the Irrigation and Water Management System. Financing of improvements in irrigation
     and water management systems, including development of management information system; monitoring and decision support system; mod-
     ernization of water management equipment and facilities; and preparation of future irrigation and water distribution improvement projects.
    Component 3: Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) of the Project Impact and Social and Environmental Management Plans. Financing of M&E
     activities to provide continuous feedback to the government Project Steering Committee (PSC), the World Bank and implementing agencies
     on the project’s performance and impact

Results Achieved:
    Main contract for civil and electro-mechanical infrastructure is under implementation. The subsidiary weir on the left half of the barrage was
     completed last year. The contractor started work on the right side of the barrages in October 2013 and is on track for in-time completion.
    Variation orders to replace all barrage gates with new gates have been issued. The contractor is manufacturing the gates and replacement of
     the gates started at beginning of 2014.
    Total of 54 water supply schemes are identified of which 42 would be constructed under the project and about 4 are constructed by the
     Public Health Engineering Department (PHED).
    The Punjab Rural Support Program (PRSP) has been contracted to carry out wheat seed distribution. This year PRSP carried out seed distri-
     bution in two districts, Layyah and Muzafargarh. The seed packages were distributed during October 7 to November 7, 2013 in 706 villages.
     In total, 35,637 farmers were provided about 96,263 bags of wheat seed and 4,750 bags of Canola seed.

Project Background:
The direct beneficiaries are about 580,000 farm families (4.0 million across Punjab). About 17,500 families would be direct beneficiaries of high
efficiency irrigation systems (HEIS), about 90,000 families would benefit from the laser leveling system, and about 475,000 families from the
watercourse improvement program. A very large population would be indirect beneficiaries of the project: about 13 million additional person days
of employment as farm labor for agricultural operations. More women farmers are likely to opt for the HEIS as it does not require night irrigation,
as well as other field work generally not considered culturally appropriate for women e.g., diversion of water from channels, tilling etc. HEIS can
easily be operated by one person and require just a few hours of water during the day. In contrast, water supply according to the traditional wara-
bandi method of irrigation goes over a 24 hour rotation period, and about half of the shareholders get water at night.
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project’s main objective is to improve the productivity of water use in irrigated agriculture. This will be achieved throug h improved physical
delivery efficiency and irrigation practices, crop diversification and effective application of inputs, which will translate into greater agricultural
output per unit of water used. The project contributes to increased agricultural production, employment and incomes, higher living standards and
positive environmental outcomes.
    Component 1: Installation of High Efficiency Irrigation Systems. Financing construction of high efficiency irrigation systems such as drip,
     bubbler, sprinkler, over an area of about 120,000 acres. Also provide precision land leveling equipment for improving land leveling for higher
     productivity of water.
    Component 2: Improvement of Community Irrigation Systems. Financing improvement of watercourses in canal irrigated areas, as well as in
     the rain fed areas. The watercourse level water users associations are established to receive support for improving about 9,000 watercourses.
    Component 3: Improved Agriculture Technology/Practices and Monitoring and Evaluation. Financing improvement of irrigation agronomy,
     demonstration of and assistance in improved and modern technologies and methods to increase agriculture production. Assistance in crop
     diversification and training, covering training of service providers and farmers, training of trainers, and establishment of farmers’ infor-
     mation desk. Monitoring of project impact, and of the environmental and social action plans.
    Component 4: Project Management, Supervision, Technical Assistance, Training and Strategic Studies. Financing project management, con-
     struction supervision, checking delivery of works, quality and certification of payments, strategic studies, technical assistance and training to
     staff, etc.

Results Achieved:
    For installation of High Efficiency Irrigation Systems (HEIS), works are currently ongoing on about 1,653 acres and HEIS have been commis-
     sioned on an area of about 9,500 acres.
    For laser land leveling, about 1,190 laser units have been provided to the beneficiaries. Laser leveling units are highly demanded and all
     3,000 targeted units would be delivered before June 30, 2014. It has been agreed that given the high demand by farmers, the number of units
     to be provided under the project would be increased and an additional 4,000 units will be provided under the project. The remaining gov-
     ernment of Punjab-owned laser units (about 122) would be dis-invested.
    About 1,594 watercourses have been improved, and work is at various stages on about 996 watercourses.
    Rehabilitation and improvement of 762 schemes have been completed and work is in progress on about 163 schemes in non-canal command-
     ed areas.

Project Background:
A major part of Sindh’s population lives in rural areas, where poverty is pervasive. The rural poor tend to be employed mostly as agriculture wage
workers. Irrigation and drainage are crucial to Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture, without which the countryside would be dese rt or salt fields. The
Indus Basin Irrigation System is now the largest integrated irrigation network in the world. Returns to irrigation are high in Pakistan but invest-
ment for the last 30 years has been weak. Despite the large need to expand water supplies, improve water management and control, and to up-
grade and modernize the century old irrigation system, investment has not been forthcoming and the network has deteriorated. The government
must maintain a minimum level of spending on the sector to avoid total collapse of its irrigation and drainage systems, which would return the
countryside to desert that would be hard, if not impossible, to ever reclaim. The Water Sector Improvement Phase-I Project would make a start
through a mix of institutional strengthening, capacity building and investments in the irrigation sector. This project consolidates the irrigation
reforms program and makes it sustainable through participatory irrigation management practices.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project development objective is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of irrigation water distribution, particularly with respect to relia-
bility, equity and user satisfaction in three Area Water Boards namely: Ghotki Canal, Left Bank Canals and Nara Canal. The project covers about 1.8
million hectares, or more than 30 percent of the irrigated area in Sindh, one of the poorest regions of the country.

    Component 1. Community Development and Capacity Building: finances capacity building for the Sindh Irrigation and Drainage Authority
     (SIDA), Area Water Boards, and Farmer Organizations, enabling them to perform their responsibilities according to the Sind Water Manage-
     ment Ordinance of 2002.
    Component 2. Rehabilitation and Improvement of Irrigation and Drainage System: finances rehabilitation of main and branch canals, distribu-
     taries/minors (secondary level canals) and drainage system. Improved and modern water measurement and accounting system installed
     throughout the canal systems in Ghotki, Nara, and Left Bank canals.
    Component 3. Management Plans for Major Irrigation & Drainage infrastructure: finances a feasibility study for rehabilitation of the Gudu
     Barrage, and assistance to prepare studies for rehabilitation of Sukkur and Kotri barrages; preparing a regional master plan to deal with
     floods and drainage issues on the left bank of the Indus river; and designing a measure to improve the Indus delta and the coastal zone.
    Component 4. Monitoring and Evaluation of the Project Impact and Environmental Management Plan: finances monitoring, evaluation and
     supervision of the environment management plan and social action plan.
    Component 5. Project Coordination, Monitoring, Technical Assistance and Training: finances project coordination, monitoring of implementa-
     tion activities, management and supervision of procurement by an independent project management consultant/procurement agent, and
     technical assistance and training.

Results Achieved:
    A large number of distributaries and minor canals in the Ghotki and Left Bank Canal Area Water Boards areas have been improved.
    Farmer organization training in operational areas.
    Many farmer organizations have held elections, exposure visits and participated in farmer festivals.
    Women’s participation in farmers organizations enhanced;
    2,259 women land owners in selected minors and distributaries have been identified.
    41 percent of these women have been successfully mobilized in their local farmer organizations.

Project Background:
The Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF) was formed in 1999 with World Bank funding and support, and has successfully financed PPAF-I
and PPAF-2, which includes three tranches of additional financing. PPAF has worked through the creation of strong outreach mechanisms in 119
(of 134) districts of Pakistan. These have built partnerships with over 70 Partner Organizations (PO) that have, in turn, organized over 80,000
Community Organizations (COs), which serve as a platform for the rural poor to access finances, skills, infrastructure, health, and education. PPAF-
III contributes to the following Millennium Development Goals (MDGs): (i) improving incomes for the poorest and reducing the proportion of
people living on less than $1/day (Goal 1, Target 1); (ii) reducing the proportion of people who suffer from hunger (Goal 1, target 2); (iii) ensuring
that boys and girls alike are able to complete primary school (Goal 2, Target 3); (iv) promoting gender equality and empowering women (Goal 3,
Target 4); and (v) reducing the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation (Goal 7, target 10).
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project development objective is to empower the targeted poor with increased incomes, improved productive capacity, and access to services
to achieve sustainable livelihoods. As part of the lessons learned under PPAF-I and II, this program built in a stronger focus on the most vulnerable
and poorest households.

    Component 1. Social Mobilization and Institution Building: the objective of this component is to target and empower the poor by supporting
     their organization into three tiers: community organizations; village organizations; and union councils at the area level, to build voice and
     scale to deal more effectively with local government bodies, other development programs and markets.
    Component 2. Livelihood enhancement and protection: the objective of this component is to develop the capacity, opportunities, assets and
     productivity of community members to reduce their vulnerability to shocks, strengthen their businesses and improve livelihoods.
    Component 3. Micro-credit access: improve availability and access of the poor to micro-finance to enhance their capacities, productivity and
     returns from livelihood initiatives. In most areas, the intention will be to improve access to existing microfinance (both PPAF financed and
     other sources).

Results Achieved:
    Approximately 10 million vulnerable and marginalized people have benefitted from the program interventions, over half of them women.
    315,000 micro-loans were provided with an 83 percent return on investment (ROI).
    125,000 children (45 percent girls) were enrolled in 896 project-supported schools and 6.5 million patients (55 percent women) were treat-
     ed for various ailments in 482 project-supported health facilities.
    A total of 407,700 individuals, of which 61 percent were women, were trained in different skills.
    Productive assets have been transferred to 47,400 ultra and vulnerable poor (50 percent women).
    Moreover, 4,600 community infrastructure sub-projects have been initiated in program areas benefiting approximately 2 million people.

Project Background:
The tertiary education sector in Pakistan has suffered from many years of neglect, resulting in poor performance and results compared to coun-
tries with similar development and income levels. This is one of the factors affecting Pakistan’s competitiveness, economic growth, and poverty
reduction objectives. To address challenges in higher education, the government has developed a higher education development program (out-
lined in the second Medium Term Development Framework for Higher Education for 2011-2015 (MDTF-HE II)). This reflects accomplishments
from the first MTDF and adjustments to its priorities, providing a vision for the sector’s medium -term development. The project is a response to
the government’s request for continued financial support by the Bank to implement its tertiary education reform program, buil ding on the experi-
ence of the Bank-financed Higher Education support Project (HESP). It s upports the implementation of the first phase of the government’s higher
education development program ( outlined in the MTDF-HE II), and uses results-based financing.
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project objective is to improve teaching, learning and research conditions to enhance access to, quality and the relevance of tertiary education.
It supports government reform in tertiary education under two components:

    Component 1 - Program Financing. This consists of four sub-components, aligned with the government’s overall program: (i) improved fiscal
     sustainability and expenditure effectiveness; (ii) enhanced quality and relevance of teaching and research; (iii) improved equitable access;
     and (iv) stronger governance and management. Payments are made against 10 key agreed results, according to disbursement linked indica-
     tors (DLIs). Each of the above four sub-components is supported by at least one DLI.
    Component 2 - Capacity Building, Policy Design, and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E): aims to strengthen capacities for program implemen-
     tation and M&E systems. It finances essential technical assistance (TA) and capacity building activities, carefully selected and sequenced with
     Component 1.

Results Achieved:
    1,500 additional faculty members recruited on the Tenure Track System.
    Over 1,700 additional students in public and private Higher Education Institutions (HEIs).
    54 Quality Enhancement Cells (QECs) performing satisfactorily in HEIs. QECs are a focal point to improve academic, teaching and learning
     standards.
    18 additional Offices of Research, Innovation, and Commercialization (ORICs) performing satisfactorily in HEIs. The main objective of the
     ORICs is to promote public-private partnerships in research, including commercializing the products of university research.

Project Background:
Pakistan is one of the world’s most arid countries, with an extensive system of canals and hydraulic structures which are its lifeline and the back-
bone of its economy. Pakistan faces many challenges, however, regarding the availability and management of its surface and groundwater re-
sources, including: (a) low water productivity in the agricultural sector; (b) low water storage capability; (c) acute power shortage requiring
further development of hydropower resources; and (d) increased vulnerability to drought and floods, the economic, social, and ecological impacts
of which are expected to be amplified by climate change; and (d) water pollution.
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
    The project aims to improve the management and investment planning of water resources in the Indus River Basin. It has three components:

      Component 1. Capacity Building of, and Support to, Federal Institutions in Water Resources Planning and Management: will support capacity
       building for federal institutions involved in water resources planning, management, and development.
      Component 2. Improvement in Water Resources Management and Development: support the Water and Power Development Authority
       (WAPDA) to undertake the following activities: upgrading existing tools, databases, models, and water resources management systems; un-
       dertake sediment management studies for the Indus river system, and prepare a power investment plan for the upper Indus.
      Component 3. Project Management and Additional Studies.

Results Achieved:
    The project has already met most of its expected development outcomes, enhancing the capacity of the relevant institutions to use modern water
    resources management tools. Specific outcomes include:

Project Background:
The government of Punjab views the project as a flagship in its efforts to improve the quality of government services provided to the population.
The traditional land records system had changed little for hundreds of years. Under that system, land records were in the possession of the pat-
wari (village accountant) with little to no transparency or quality control. The land records were maintained in sacks and moved from place to
place as the patwari carried out his functions. The result was long delays to obtain copies of land records by land owners, and lengthy periods to
carry out land transactions. Further, the traditional land records system was a major source of bribes and corruption, and rated very poorly in
customer satisfaction surveys. The weaknesses of the traditional system increasingly hampered the development of modern markets for land and
real estate. The first half of the project focused on: (i) development, testing and proving the land records software; (ii) introduction of relevant
legal and regulatory reforms; and (iii) introduction of institutional changes including creation of a Land Records Cadre.
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
    The project development objective is to improve the land records service delivery of the Province of Punjab, contributing to long-lasting tenure
    security and more efficient operation of land markets. The project upgrades the land records management system for the province by revising
    current business processes and associated laws and regulations, establishing Service Centers where land records are maintained and available to
    the public in digital form, and establishes linkages between the land records system and the system for registration of deeds. The project has four
    components:

      Component 1. Business Process Improvement and Capacity Enhancement.
      Component 2. Development and Deployment of the New Land Records management information system focusing on development, testing
       and implementation of the land records software, data entry and verification of existing paper-based land records, and construction and
       equipping of new Land Records Service Centers (LRSCs);
      Component 3. Service Delivery and Information Campaigns focusing on operation of the new LRSCs and stakeholder outreach.
      Component 4. Project Management

    For more information on the project, please see http://www.punjab-zameen.gov.pk/.

Results Achieved:
      Records of rights (fards) provided to customers within a 30 minute target.
      Time required for land transactions reduced from two to three months to generally less than one week.
      High level of customer satisfaction with the new system, in excess of the 95 percent target.
      A greater sense of tenure security coming from use of the new automated system.
 The automated land records system has been developed, tested, and proven in practice. As of January 2014, 98 Service Centers were operational.
Data entry is now being completed in the last cohort of 12 districts. The work of data verification and quality control is proceeding apace and is
now complete in over half of all revenue estates in the province. The number of revenue estates that are now online is 9,123 or 35 percent of the
total.

Project Background:
Years of regional instability underpinned by decades of poor governance have shaped the crisis unraveling in the North West border areas of
Pakistan. Militants in the Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) have exploited frustrations, aggravating high
levels of vulnerability. To help tackle this situation, the government of Pakistan (GoP) requested the Bank support preparation of a Post-Crisis
Needs Assessment (PCNA) resulting in a peace building strategy for FATA and KP (2010). Recognizing the need for a harmonized approach, the
government and donors also asked the Bank to administer a Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) for the crisis-affected areas in KP, FATA, and Balochi-
stan. The Governance Support Project for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa FATA and Balochistan is one of the MDTF Projects.
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
    The project development objective is to strengthen the capacity of government departments in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), FATA and Balochistan
    to help support efficient delivery of the PCNA program in KP and FATA and related development programs in Balochistan.

      Component 1: strengthening of the PCNA Implementation Support Units (ISUs), provision of technical assistance, and institutional building of
       government departments:
      (a) ISUs are operational and being further strengthened through hiring of the sector specialists.
      (b) FATA ISU providing technical assistance for the MDTF Roads project in FATA.
      (c) Skill and capacity building actions begun at both KP and FATA.
      (d) PCNA Newsletter has been issued to spread information about government reforms.
      Component 2: Rapid Response Facility (RRF):
      (a) FATA Tribunal operational since February 2012 and has disposed of more than 50 criminal and civil appeal cases.
      (b) Support to operationalize the KP Judicial Academy cleared for funding. The goal of the Academy is to enhance judicial competence and
       efficiency through education.

Results Achieved:
      The ISU conducted 200 post crisis needs assessment (PCNA) orientation sessions with line departments, donors, academics and civil society
       in Balochistan, FATA, and KP.
      Development Partners Forum/Steering Committee established which convened forums in KP and FATA.
      Evaluation strengthened for PCNA monitoring and results reporting in Balochistan, FATA, and KP.
      Social accountability reforms started in KP, FATA and Balochistan seeking citizen engagement in governance. In KP, the Judicial Academy
       conducted seven training sessions for 184 judges; the Ombudsman’s office disposed of 328 complaints in 2013; a KP Charter of Good Gover n-
       ance was prepared that played a critical role in enacting the KP Right to Information (RTI) law; plus support for an anti-corruption law.

Project Background:
The most critical constraint to improving service delivery in Punjab is the weak management performance of departments responsible for provid-
ing public services. Citizens face significant challenges to access government services due to the strongly entrenched position of field officials and
other structural handicaps, such as distance, language, cultural practices, and a lack of information about services. Without good administrative
data, it is difficult to assess whether government programs are achieving their goals, learning lessons and holding government agencies to account.

Punjab Public Management Reform Program (PPMRP) is a subset of the government’s Governance Reform program that focuses on add ressing the
above mentioned constraints to service delivery. The program will help improve transparency and resource management of the targeted depart-
ments of Punjab and focus specifically on improving service delivery by helping Punjab strengthen performance management of the departments
responsible for providing public services, procurement and collecting tax.

The instrument used for this operation is a Program for Results (PforR) credit, which by design provides financial and non-financial incentives to
deliver envisaged results, and supports counterparts along the reform process through the agreed results targets linked to disbursements. Dis-
bursement-Linked Indicators (DLIs) have been carefully selected to provide incentives on critical roadblocks to improving the program’s effective-
ness, efficiency, and sustainability. The PPMRP is the first Bank operation that will utilize the PforR lending instrument in the public management
sector.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The program development objective is to improve transparency and resource management of targeted departments of the province of Punjab. The
project have the following three components:

    Component 1. Transparency and Access to Services: to improve citizens’ access to information provided by ta rgeted departments and facili-
     tate access to key services.
    Component 2. Performance monitoring: to support performance monitoring and make performance information available for decision-
     making.
    Component 3. Resource mobilization and value for money: to im prove the province’s capacity to mobilize resources and better manage e x-
     penditure through better urban immovable property tax collection.

Results Achieved:
    The Steering Committee headed by chairperson of the Planning and Development Board has been formed with the function of overseeing
     program implementation. The first steering committee meeting was held on Dec 17 th, 2013 and decisions taken on key activities as per
     PPMRP’s aims and objectives.
    Citizen feedback engagement (with the Citizen Feedback Model already functional in all of Punjab) and smart monitoring pilots are in the
     process of being scaled up to additional services and departments. Departments of Health, Education, Livestock and Agriculture have
     launched a number of smart phone and ICT based pilots to improve monitoring and data collection.
    Work is underway to use ICTs to better manage the government’s procurement related activities. Latest departmental requiremen ts have
     been incorporated in PPRA MIS and the beta version of the management information system is in its development phase.
    Work on digitization of property records for better tracking and management of Urban Immovable Property Tax is well underway and show-
     ing good progress.

Project Background:
This project was prepared to support the creation of employment opportunities and sustainable jobs in the conflict-affected Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
(KP) and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) region. The region ranks considerably lower in socio-economic indicators than most parts of
the country. Rates for both literacy and the participation of women in the labor force are low. Economic activity in the region is mostly dominated
by small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which suffered tremendously during the militancy crises and 2010 floods: almost 9,000 enterprises were
damaged, rendering 40,000 people jobless. The project therefore aims to address the core strategic objective of stimulating employment and liveli-
hood opportunities, as highlighted in the 2010 Post Crisis Needs Assessment (PCNA) done jointly by the Bank and development partners. It also
promotes the economic empowerment of women by assigning priority to eligible enterprises owned and managed by women.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project development objective is ‘to support the Government of Pakistan in the economic recovery and revitalization of th e crisis affected
areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), by creating sustainable employment opportunities
through rehabilitation of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), investment mobilization, and institutional capacity buildi ng’.
The project aims to support the creation of employment opportunities and sustainable jobs for the people of KP and FATA. It has three broad
components:
    Component 1. SME Development. This component includes a matching grants program with technical assistance (TA) to support SMEs that
     have been adversely affected by the ongoing crisis in order to enhance their productive capacity and restore lost employment. This compo-
     nent will also promote economic empowerment of women by assigning priority to eligible enterprises owned and managed by women.
    Component 2. Attracting Investments from the Diaspora. The main objective of this component is to mobilize private investment to jumpstart
     the rehabilitation of businesses and reconstruction of infrastructure, thereby creating employment.
    Component 3. Institution Building to Foster Investment and Implement Regulatory Reforms. This component will support capacity building of
     both KP and FATA governments to improve the business climate and attract investment to the region.
The SME development component is being implemented by the KP office of Small and Medium Enterprise Development Authority (SMEDA), and
the implementation of the second and third components are being done by the dedicated cells of the KP and FATA authorities.

Results Achieved:
    US$4 million disbursed in matching grants to 665 SMEs across KP and FATA, including 14 women entrepreneurs.
    Around 3,200 direct and indirect jobs created through the rehabilitation and upgrading of SMEs.
    One investment road show in Karachi to showcase investment opportunities for the private sector in KP and FATA

Project Background:
Building on the initial results of the Economic Revitalization of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and FATA Project (ERKF), the government of Khyber Pakh-
tunkhwa (GoKP) asked the Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) for support to strengthen the province’s critical value chains in two economic sectors:
marble and horticulture (food processing). These were picked following analysis and stakeholder consultation that highlighted their potential for
growth, job creation, and contributions to the provincial economy, given KP’s natural endowments and clim ate. Despite this promise, the two
sectors only operate at a basic level, relying on primitive technology that results in high degrees of waste (80 percent in marble and 40 percent in
horticulture).

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The proposed development objective of this project is to improve the competitiveness of the marble and food processing sectors in KP by
providing shared infrastructure and relevant skills along the marble sector value chain and by addressing knowledge and coordination
gaps along the food processing sector value chain. CIPK has three components:
     Component 1: Increasing productivity and employment in the marble sector. The objective of this component is to increase the economic
      value added of the marble sector by improving the extraction and processing stages within the value chain. The subcomponents below will take
      place at a common location which is Marble City in Risalpur, KP.
Subcomponent 1.1: Establishing a machinery pool.
Subcomponent 1.2: Strengthening the Common Facility and Training Center (CFTC).
Subcomponent 1.3: Providing access to markets.
     Component 2: Supporting the development and enhancing the impact of food processing cluster. The objective of this component is to assess
      the constraints and opportunities in KP’s food processing sector, by undertaking the following three activities:
    i.      Value chain prioritization and analysis.
   ii.      Feasibility studies.
  iii.      Cluster development program.
     Component 3: Institutional capacity building. This will entail strengthening institutional capacity of KP-PMU, Department of Mines and Min-
      erals (GoKP), Pakistan Stone Development Company (PASDEC) and mines associations in KP to ensure effective implementation of the pro-
      ject, including supporting a review of KP’s mining rules and regulations.

Results Achieved:
Results of the first year of implementation are not yet available. The implementation progress has been so far good, including staffing at PMU,
completion of the procurement plan and operations manual, etc. Procurement activities under component 1 commenced during February 2014.
Expected results are as follows:

    25 marble mines will enhance production by 40 percent through the use of new technologies. 750 direct and indirect jobs will be created for
     relevant skills developed by the project in KP’s marble sector.
    Improved sector knowledge by identifying two priority public sector-shared infrastructure interventions for KP’s food processing sector.

Project Background:
The project aims to improve the well-being of unserved and underserved low income communities. Starting with two agencies (Mohmand and
Bajaur), it is now operational in South Waziristan Agency as well, following military operations to reestablish access, and as the government helps
displaced families to return. The selection of these agencies in FATA was based on: (i) lack of visible progress and the perceived lack of interest
from the authorities to redressing disparities, which undermined public trust in the ability of government institutions to meet the needs of the

Project Background:
This project aims to reach unserved and underserved low-income communities in Southern KP. Implementation will be focused on three districts
(DIKhan, Tank and Lakki Marwat) in order to concentrate project coverage, effectively monitor the process and its impact, and demonstrate the
potential of the approach. The selection of these districts is based on several factors, including: (i) prevailing low human development indices, even
before the onset of the militancy crisis (all three districts are amongst the poorest 25 districts in the country); (ii) proximity to the Tribal Agencies
of FATA (in particular the South Waziristan Agency, which is under ongoing military operation); and (iii) all three districts were recipients of the
largest number of Internally Displaced People (IDPs) who left the Tribal Agencies during the military operation in 2009.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:

Project Background:
The province of Balochistan has experienced several significant natural disasters over the past ten years. Annual recurring floods between 2010
and 2013, as well as earthquakes, have had a major impact with damages and losses exceeding US$620 million, or 6 percent of provincial GDP.
Following the enactment in April 2010 of the 18th constitutional amendment and the resulting devolution of a number of federal functions to the
provincial governments, the provinces have been given disaster management responsibilities within the overall national framework. This trans-
lates into increased responsibility for Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Balochistan to urgently address the various disaster risk
management (DRM) challenges in the disaster-prone province. Through the Balochistan Disaster Management Project (BDMP), the Bank is sup-
porting the government of Balochistan to address the various institutional and capacity issues at PDMA.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project development objective is to strengthen the capacity of PDMA Balochistan to prepare for and respond to natural disasters. The project
comprises four components:

    Institutional Strengthening of PDMA Balochistan (US$2.5 million): This component will support PDMA Balochistan in strengthening institu-
     tional disaster risk management capacity and emergency response systems.
    Hazard and Risk Assessment (US$1 million): This component will support hazard and risk assessment in the provincial capital, Quetta.
    Development and Piloting of Community Based Disaster Risk Management (CBDRM) Program (US$1.5 million): This component will support
     PDMA Balochistan in establishing and piloting a CBDRM program to engage local communities on risk management activities and guide initia-
     tives to improve DRM awareness.
    Contingent Emergency Response Component: In the event of a natural disaster in Balochistan, critical emergency response and recovery costs
     in the province may be supported through this component upon activation.

Results Achieved:
    Improved disaster response mechanism at PDMA Balochistan:
    Provision of critical human and technical resources, along with office automation and improved connectivity, has been achieved in the initial
     phase which has led to better coordination with stakeholders, reduction in time for issuance of alerts and dedicated skilled manpower for
     Provincial Emergency Operations Center (PEOC).
    Updating of Provincial Disaster Management Plan and drafting of Emergency Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) is underway.

Increased awareness of the hazard and risk environment in Quetta:
    Baseline data for risk assessment comprised of information on physical infrastructure and social indicators is being collected.

Enhanced capacity at PDMA Balochistan for implementing CBDRM initiatives:
   Over 1000 flood and earthquake awareness information packages have been disseminated to local communities and district governments
    with particular emphasis on reaching out to schools.
   The project is also collaborating with Promoting Girls Education in Balochistan Project to create disaster awareness in public schools in 12
    other districts of the province.

Project Background:
Laraib Energy Limited (LEL) is a special purpose company incorporated in Islamabad, under the laws of Pakistan, dedicated to develop, construct,
operate and maintain the 84 MW run-of-the-river New Bong Energy (NBE) hydro power plant, in Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJ&K), 120 km from
Islamabad. The project is Pakistan's first private hydro independent power producer (IPP). It sells electricity to the National Transmission and
Despatch Company Limited ("NTDC"), Pakistan's state-owned transmission company, under a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA). NTDC's
payment obligations under the PPA are guaranteed by the government of Pakistan ("GOP"). The total project cost was US$233.6 million funded
with a 75:25 debt to equity ratio. The project sponsor is the Hub Power Company Limited (Hubco), with a 75.54 percent stake in the company.
Hubco owns and operates a 1,292 MW thermal plant in southern Pakistan which was the first IPP in the country. Laraib entered into a turnkey EPC
contract with SAMBU Construction Co. Limited, a Korean EPC contractor, for the construction and delivery of the power plant. Sambu subcontract-
ed Hyundai Engineering Co. Ltd. for the design and Andritz Hydro for the supply of electromechanical equipment. The project was completed on
time and within budget and the commercial operation date was achieved on March 23, 2013. In November 2009, IFC committed a US $35 million ‘A’
loan which had a grace period of 4 years and final maturity in November 2024. The full commitment has been disbursed and is earning an interest
rate of 6-month Libor plus 4.75 percent.
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
    Create a framework for hydro IPPs and have a strong demonstration effect (standards, procedures and contractual documents established in
     this project are expected to be replicated in other hydro projects in Pakistan).
    Support economic growth through lower cost of generation and meeting incremental demand for power.
    Contribute to energy security of supply by increasing the installed capacity using a domestic renewable resource.
    Lower the average economic cost of power generation in Pakistan.
    Provide significant environmental benefits compared to alternative thermal power options in terms of displacing greenhouse gas emissions
     of up to 220, 000 tons of CO2 equivalent.
    Create jobs during the construction and operation phase.
    Reduce reliance on imported fuel oil, thereby improving the country’s trade and current account deficits .

Results Achieved:
The key expected results and targets are provided below. As the power plant has not yet completed one full year of commercial operations, most of
the targets are expected to be achieved later in the year:

    Target Power Generation (p.a.): 470 GWh per annum.
    Target Total Employment/ Temporary: 400 jobs (achieved 470 temporary jobs in 2011).
    Target Total Employment/Direct (#): 60 direct employees (achieved 34 in 2011).

Project Background:
Habib Bank Limited (“HBL” or “bank”) is the largest bank in Pakistan in terms of assets, with a market share of approximately 16 percent. It had
around US$14.5 billion in assets and US$1.2 billion in shareholder’s equity as of September 30, 2013. IFC’s relationship with HBL started in 2006
through a US$50 million, eight year, tier 2 sub debt. The purpose of the project was to strengthen the capital base and suppo rt the bank’s turna-
round and expansion post privatization. This engagement paved the way for IFC Advisory Services to help HBL improve its training infrastructure
and processes. A trade finance facility (GTFP) was initiated with HBL in 2007 with a US$20 million line, which has been enhanced over time to
US$100 million. IFC entered into an Advisory Services agreement with HBL in June 2011 to provide capacity building in SME banking, which con-
cluded in June 2013. The objective was to build HBL’s capacity to adopt best practices in SME banking and then test and refin e its “small business
banking” by piloting some activities. IFC helped the bank to: a) develop a value proposition for SMEs; b) reengineer its cred it and risk process; c)
strengthen staff skill levels; and d) pilot its SME banking services. Subsequently, IFC launched a Rural Banking Advisory project with HBL in July
2013 to help develop new agri/rural products aimed at farmers and rural SMEs. This will improve access to finance in the rural finance market. IFC
is also in the process of signing an advisory agreement with HBL to help develop women-targeted products. The project is expected to launch in
April 2014 with an objective to help position HBL as a women market champion in Pakistan, both as an employer and as bank for women in Paki-
stan. HBL is committed to capturing the full spectrum of the female market and become the bank where women want to bank, work and invest.

On the investment front, IFC is discussing a potential loan with HBL of around US$150 million to help fund the bank’s expansi on outside Pakistan
as well as growth in critical areas such as agriculture; women-targeted lending; SMEs; and sustainability finance.
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
    The sub debt was expected to: (i) support the ongoing turnaround and restructuring of HBL with impacts on financial stability, banking sector
    strengthening and institutional capacity; (ii) enhance risk management capabilities; (iii) strengthen the bank's capital base and expansion of lend-
    ing, thus contributing to economic growth, employment and private sector development. Development impact indicators to be monitored includ-
    ed: (i) overall financial condition of the bank; and (ii) healthy loan portfolio growth.

Results Achieved:
IFC engagement with HBL has resulted in:

      Improved financial stability of a systemic bank, benefiting the sector as a whole. HBL has become the largest bank in the country in terms of
       total assets and deposits, bigger than the state run National Bank of Pakistan. HBL loan portfolio grew at a compounded annual growth rate of
       around five percent since 2007 and the bank generated a return on equity of 16.4 percent in third quarter FY13, despite macroeconomic chal-
       lenges being confronted by the nation.
      IFC SME Advisory Services was completed in June 2013 which has helped HBL develop its SME business. As a result, HBL has disbursed
       29,427 new SME loans amounting to US$1,118 million and has opened 115,308 new SME deposit accounts since Sept 2011. There has already
       had a demonstration effect; another large bank has engaged IFC to improve its SME banking, while discussions with other medium to large
       commercial banks are underway.
      GTFP facility helped the bank to finance trade commitments of over US$518 million since inception, supporting trade of essential commodi-
       ties such as oil and gas, agricultural products, chemicals, among others.
      HBL has developed an environmental and social management system screening against host country laws and IFC exclusion list which is
       likely to have a strong demonstration effect in the country given HBL’s size and outreach.

* IFC converted US$25 million loan into equity in December 2012.
* As of January 31, 2014

Project Background:
K-Electric (formerly: Karachi Electric Supply Company) is the only private integrated power utility in Pakistan that is the exclusive supplier of
electricity to the city of Karachi - the largest city in Pakistan with a population of some 20 million. KESC is large (over 11,000 employees, 2.3 mil-
lion customers and US$2.8 billion in assets), operationally complex (vertically integrated with an extensive transmission and distribution network
and around 2,000 MW generation capacity), and operates in a charged and challenging political environment. KESC was privatized in 2005 when a
71.5 percent stake was acquired by Al-Jomaih and National Industries Group (the original sponsors). In order to co-finance a US$937 million in-
vestment plan by KESC, which included development of new 800MW gas fired power generation plants, and the rehabilitation of existing facilities,
IFC committed a US$125 million 10 year ‘A’ loan with the right to convert US$25 million into equity. Asian Development Bank (ADB) also partici-
pated in the project with a parallel loan of US$150 million. IFC’s investment supported one of the largest private investment s in the power sector in
Pakistan, without the customary backstop by sovereign guarantees. In September 2008, the original sponsors invited the largest private equity
firm in the Middle East - Abraaj Capital - to partner through an equity investment of US$361 million, taking management control of KESC. IFC and
ADB facilitated the ownership transition and supported the Abraaj-led turnaround plan by re-profiling the existing loans. Subsequently, IFC also
exercised its conversion right in December 2012 and subscribed to US$25 million common shares of KESC for a 2.5 percent equity stake. Since
IFC’s investment, Abraaj-led management has successfully implemented the turnaround plan and achieved significant operational and financial
improvements, despite challenging circumstances. For its part, IFC supported KESC by providing swift and targeted support for its often ground-
breaking initiatives, and also by maintaining close coordination with key stakeholders to help them understand and address key challenges faced
by KESC. In further IFC support, advisory and investm ent teams are currently working together to develop KESC’s renewable energy initiatives.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
    The targeted development objectives of IFC included: i) eliminating load shedding and meeting incremental demand for electricity in the Karachi
    area; ii) enabling new residential and business customers to be connected to the grid thus reducing their cost of obtaining power; iii) significant
    reduction and technical and commercial losses of electricity; iv) improved quality of service to consumers; v)reducing carbon emissions through
    development of more efficient and cleaner gas fired generation; and vi) demonstrating the benefits of privatization in the country and region.

Results Achieved:
IFC’s investment achieved a number of targeted development objectives, including:

      Significant reduction in electricity load shedding to four to five hours a day with uninterrupted supply to low loss and industrial customers,
       whereas blackouts of 12 to 18 hours a day continue in other parts of the country.
      Meeting incremental demand for electricity through an addition of around 1,000 MW in generation, increasing access to electricity for resi-
       dential, commercial and industrial customers.
      Steady reduction in electricity losses to approximately 26.5 percent from 38 percent at the time of privatization.
      Improved quality and reliability of customer service with significant reduction in complaints and response time.
      Improved efficiencies both by way of low cost and efficient generation through new plants, and reduction of electricity losses.
      Reduction in carbon emissions through cleaner natural gas-fired generation.
      Demonstrating the benefits of private sector investment in state owned utilities in the country and region.
      KESC’s turnaround has facilitated economic growth through sustainable and reliable supply of power to the largest city in Pakistan, which is
       also the nation’s industrial and financial hub.

Project Background:
Star Hydro Power Limited (SHPL) is a special purpose company for construction, operation and maintenance of a 147 MW run-of-the-river hydro
power plant situated 120 km north of Islamabad, near the village of Patrind in the city of Muzaffarabad. SHPL will be the second hydropower
independent power producer (IPP) in Pakistan. It has an off-take agreement to sell electricity to the National Transmission and Dispatch Company,
the state-owned transmission company, under a 30-year power purchase agreement. SHPL is 80 percent owned by Korea Water Resources Corpo-
ration (K-Water) and 20 percent by Daewoo Engineering and Construction Company Limited. The total project cost is approximately US$436
million, including contingencies. In December 2011, IFC committed a US$60 million ‘A’ loan which has a grace period of up to 66 months and final
maturity of up to 17 years, including grace period. In 2012 MIGA issued a guarantee for US$148.5 million to cover an equity investment in SHPL by
K-water, acting on behalf of itself and Daewoo, incorporated in Pakistan through KDS Hydro Private Limited of Singapore. The coverage is for a
period of up to 20 years against the risk of breach of contract.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
The project will: i) help increase much needed generation capacity using a domestic renewable resource, thereby increasing security of energy
supply; ii) ease the severe energy demand-supply deficit in the country and the resulting drag of power shortages on economic growth; iii) help
diversify the generation mix away from thermal power and contribute to lowering the average economic cost of power generation in Pakistan; iv)
provide significant climate change and environmental benefits compared to alternative thermal power options in terms of displacing greenhouse
gas emissions; v) create jobs during the project construction and operating phase; vi) reduce reliance on imported fuel oil and help to offset trade
and current account deficits. Further, by providing long term guarantees to a much needed infrastructure project, MIGA will play an important role
in the overall project financing at a time when international commercial insurers are not open to long term guarantees in Pak istan. MIGA’s sub-
stantial experience in guaranteeing power sector projects in challenging environments provides a significant source of comfort to the sponsor.

Results Achieved:
It is expected that the company will achieve the following results with the help of IFC and MIGA investment:

    Provision of clean power for 310,000 customers by 2017.
    17.0 percent in economic rate of return.
    Generation of 100 permanent jobs.
    Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) of about 280,000 tons of CO 2 per annum.

Project Background:
Packages is Pakistan's premier integrated pulp and paper mill and packaging materials manufacturer with a paper and board capacity of 271,400
tpa (tons per annum), converting capacity of 158,069 tpa and plastics capacity of 20,000 tpa as of December 2012. It is widely acknowledged as a
market leader in the local market and known for its sophisticated and high quality packaging. Its principal raw material for paper and board pro-
duction is wheat straw and waste paper. Packages’ main clients include major multinationals operating in Pakistan such as Uni lever, Nestle, P&G,
Colgate and Tetrapak. Along with the equity investment, IFC has provided advisory services to Packages to increase waste paper collection from
the local market, and help the client reduce reliance on imported waste paper. This advisory project was completed in FY13.

Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
IFC’s equity financing enabled Packages, a long standing IFC client, to strengthen its balance sheet by reducing reliance on debt taken for the ex-
pansion project that had exposed it to interest rate volatility and significant rollover risk. IFC financing helped provide the necessary stability to
endure the global financial crisis.

Results Achieved:
    Environmental Improvements and Climate Change Benefits: with IFC’s support, Packages was able to undertake programs designed to have a
     positive impact on climate change (waste paper collection, closed loop system for water and waste heat recovery systems at the plants). It
     helped reduce carbon emissions related to burning of wheat straw; transportation saving on shipping of waste paper from other countries;
     and elimination of approximately 450,000 cubic meters of landfills annually, thus avoiding typical hazards from land filling such as contami-
     nation of ground waters, residual soil contamination after landfill close, contribution to inefficient use of land space and off-gassing of me-
     thane, a potent greenhouse gas generated by decaying organic wastes.
    Private Sector Development: the new mill, located away from the key centers of commercial activity, has generated significant economic
     activity in what was previously an agrarian-based and under-developed part of the country. The increased procurement of wheat straw has
     positively impacted farmers’ incomes, who used to burn wheat straw for disposal.
    Stamp of Approval: a key development, not anticipated at time of IFC investment, has been the creation of a 2013 joint venture between
     Packages and Stora Enso Oyj, one of the world’s largest pulp and paper manufacturer in the world. IFC facilitated the provisi on of a $90 mil-
     lion guarantee by MIGA to Stora Enso for investment in Packages’ paper and board subsidiary, BSPL.
