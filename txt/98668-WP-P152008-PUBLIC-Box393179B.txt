Executive Summary

Objective of the Report

This report commences the review and documentation of the New Ireland Old Age and Disability
Social Pension. The report has been drafted following a visit to New Ireland Province between 21st
and 25th of July by a team from the World Bank and the Australian Department for Foreign Affairs
and Trade (DFAT), and subsequent meetings with the Department for Community Development and
related agencies in Port Moresby1.

The New Ireland Old Age and Disability Pension is a successful social protection initiative which has
now has been in operation in New Ireland Province for six years. This is a significant achievement.
Significant credit is due to the Honorable Sir Julius Chan and the New Ireland Provincial
Administration for initiating and supporting the development of social protection in Papua New
Guinea.

The primary objective of the report has been to review the New Ireland Old Age and Disability
Pension scheme. The review has focused on the design and operation of the scheme, including the
payment modality, and the effectiveness of coverage of both the old age pension and disability
components. The economic and social impact of the pension on recipients’ wellbeing, the wellbeing
of their households and their communities has not been reviewed in detail, although limited
qualitative research through focus group discussions has been undertaken as part of the review.

The second objective of the report has been to draw key lessons from the New Ireland experience
with the implementation of the social pension, which may inform the implementation of the
national social pension. Within this context, the review has been undertaken having consideration
for two contexts: the New Ireland social pension is a stand-alone social protection scheme, and
secondly New Ireland as the potential pilot location for the proposed national age and disability
social pension in Papua New Guinea. The design of the National Old Age and Disability Pension and
related funding has not been reviewed.



Key Findings


1. Programme coverage


It is estimated approximately 84% of the population aged 60+ in New Ireland is currently receiving
the old age pension. It is estimated approximately 17% of the disabled population in New Ireland
is currently receiving the disability pension.

There appears to be gender bias in respect to enrolment in the old age and disability pensions.
Whilst 92% of eligible men appear to receive the old age pension, only 75% of eligible women
appear to receive the pension. There is likely to be significant gender bias in enrolment in the
disability pension. 62% of disability pension recipients are men and 32% are women. The UNESCAP
review of disability in Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP 2012a, 2012b), suggests levels of disability are
likely to be higher for women than men

2. Receipt of payments by beneficiaries


It appears nearly all beneficiaries enrolled in the Old Age and Disability Pension receive their
payment, however receipt of payment is not presently audited. Constraints to payments being
made appear to be primarily operational. These constraints resulted in no payment being made in
2012 and a double payment in 2012 and 2013 combined. The constraints also result in a single
annual payment which is not in accordance with the operational guidelines.



3. The New Ireland Social Pension as a basis for the further development social protection in
   Papua New Guinea


The review concludes the New Ireland social pension scheme, with modifications, can provide a
suitable basis for the old age component of the national social pension. However, the current age
verification and disability assessment processes, the recurring annual (re)enrolment and payment
process and the database limitations indicate the programme in its present form will require
strengthening in order to ensure there is an appropriate platform for the further development of
social protection in New Ireland and the piloting of a national social pension. .

The review concludes the New Ireland social pension scheme does not provide a basis for the roll-
out of the disability component of the national social pension. The roll out of the old age
component of the New Ireland programme has been more successful than the roll out of the
disability component. This is not a criticism of the New Ireland government. Rather, it is a reflection
of the significantly greater complexity in implementing a disability pension than a universal old age
pension.

The review concludes it may be appropriate for the Department for Community Development to
consider sequential roll out of the two components of the national social pension, with an initial
focus on developing capability to roll out the age pension and the progressive development of
capacity to develop and manage a disability pension.



4. Recommendations to Enhance the New Ireland Old Age and Disability Pension

The following table (Table 1) summarises the recommended enhancements to the New Ireland Old
Age and Disability Pensions. Recommended enhancements span scheme design, the operation of
the old age pension and the disability pension, the payment modality for both pensions and data
management for the scheme. The objective of the enhancements is to both strengthen the New
Ireland scheme as a stand-alone social protection initiative, and to better enable New Ireland to be
used as the pilot location for the national social pension.

5. Implications of the New Ireland Experience for the National Social Pension

This report has been drafted prior to the finalisation of the strategy for the national social pension.
The discussion regarding the implications of the findings for the roll-out of the national social
pension is, therefore, preliminary. Key implications are summarised in Table 2.

6. Risks

The ADB review of social safety nets in Pacific Island countries noted: “Hastily implemented
programmes seldom reach their intended target groups, incur excessive costs and have other
unplanned results”. Two key risks have been identified:

Programme failure:
This can take two forms:

    -      Failure to achieve coverage: If the social pension is not implemented appropriately there is
           a significant risk of failing to achieve coverage.
    -      Funding over-run: Conversely there is a significant risk of cost over-run. This can occur in
           respect to operating costs if scheme operations are not established effectively. More
           significantly though there is a serious risk of substantial cost over-run if eligibility and
           verification are not managed carefully, in particular for the disability pension. It is
           considered there is a higher risk of program failure for the disability pension than the old age
           pension.

Multiple and incompatible processes and systems
Papua New Guinea is a diverse society, with a challenging geography. Failure to develop systems
and processes which are able to manage effectively within this diverse and complex environment is
likely to result in the emergence of multiple systems and processes, which may be incompatible,
difficult to scale, and difficult to oversee centrally.

7. High-Level Road Map

The following high-level steps are recommended to implement the old age pension and disability
pension. The discussion regarding the roll-out of the national social pension is preliminary pending
the finalisation of the national social pension strategy.

The suggested high-level road map (refer Table 3) is based on the progressive implementation of the
old age pension and the development of capacity to implement the disability pension, with the
subsequent implementation of the disability pension. A time line has not been included at this
time.

1. Introduction

This report commences the systematic review and documentation of the New Ireland Old Age and
Disability Social Pension. The focus of the initial review has been the design and operation of the
scheme, including the payment modality, and the effectiveness of coverage of both the age pension
and disability components. The economic and social impact of the pension on recipients’ wellbeing,
the wellbeing of their households and their communities has not been reviewed in detail, even
though some qualitative research through focus group discussion has been undertaken. This will
require further research.

The report has been drafted following a visit to New Ireland Province between 21st and 25th of July
by a team from the World Bank and the Australian Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT),
and subsequent meetings in Port Moresby. The purpose of the visit to New Ireland was to develop
an understanding of the New Ireland social pension, in particular to determine whether the scheme
can form the basis for the development of a national social pension. The purpose of the interviews in
Port Moresby was to develop an understanding of current capacity to roll out a national social
pension. The design of the national Old Age and Disability Pension and related funding has not been
reviewed.

The objective of this report is to draw key lessons from the New Ireland experience with the
implementation of the social pension, which can inform the implementation of the national social
pension. Within this context, the review has been undertaken having consideration for two contexts:
the New Ireland social pension is a stand-alone social protection scheme, and secondly New Ireland
as the potential pilot location for the proposed national age and disability social pension in New
Guinea. The report discusses the potential for the New Ireland social pension enrolment process,
data management and operational systems and payment modality to be used as the basis for the
piloting of the national scheme.

Data collection for the report was undertaken using a series of key informant interviews in New
Ireland and Port Moresby and beneficiary focus groups in New Ireland2, analysis of New Ireland
beneficiary payments data, and a review of relevant documents.

The report is structured as Follows;

          Section 1: Introduction
          Section 2: Briefly discusses key social protection concepts to frame the review of the New
           Ireland Social Pension programme
          Section 3: Reviews the New Ireland Social Pension programme
          Section 4: Discusses potential enhancements to the New Ireland Social Pension programme
          Section 5: Discusses implications of the New Ireland experience for the development of a
           national social old age and disability pension

2. Context: Social Protection and Social Safety Nets

2.1.    Conceptualising Social Protection

Conceptualising Social Protection

The New Ireland Old Age and Disability Pension is a social protection programme. Social protection
has become a key priority in development (UNDP, 2011). However, there is no universally accepted
definition of social protection (Gentilini & Omamo, 2009). Nevertheless, an assessment of the
effectiveness of a social protection initiative should be grounded in the conception of social
protection underpinning (explicitly or implicitly) the scheme, in addition to specific scheme aims as
specified from time to time.

One approach to the definition of social protection is to focus on the categorisation of interventions,
for example:

         “Protective programs that offer relief from economic and social deprivation,
         including alleviation of chronic and extreme poverty…. include humanitarian
         relief in emergencies, and targeted cash transfer schemes;

         Preventive programs (that) are put in place before a shock (ex-ante) and are
         designed to avert deprivation or to mitigate the impact of an adverse shock,
         and include mechanisms such as health and unemployment insurance and non-
         contributory pension schemes;

         Promotive programs (that) enhance assets, human capital and income earning
         capacity among the poor and marginalized, such as skills training and active
         labor market programs;

         Transformative interventions (such as) those aimed at addressing power
         imbalances that create or sustain economic inequality and social exclusion, and
         include legal and judicial reform, budgetary analysis and reform”. (Blank &
         Handa, 2008)

Another approach is to use a multi-faceted definition, for example:

         “Social protection is defined as the set of policies and programs designed to
         reduce poverty and vulnerability by promoting efficient labor markets,
         diminishing people’s exposure to risks, and enhancing their capacity to protect
         themselves against hazards and interruption/loss of income”
         (Fualautoalasi-Walter & ADB., 2012)

         “…the set of public actions aimed at tackling poverty, vulnerability and social
         exclusion, as well as providing people with the means to cope with major risks
         they may face throughout life.” (Kidd, 2012)


A third approach, which has been adopted for this report, is to focus on the conceptual framework
rather than programme activity or objectives. Brunori and O’Reilly, in a recent review of definitions


                                                                                           15 | P a g e
The New Ireland Social Pension Scheme


of social protection for the 2010 European Report on Development (Brunori & O’Reilly, 2010),
identified three frameworks within which social protection is commonly conceptualised. The
frameworks are not mutually exclusive; rather they imply a primary focus for social protection
initiatives:

    1. Human Rights: This approach was pioneered by the International Labour Organisation3 and
       conceptualises social protection within the context of the development of social rights such
       as equality, inclusion and non-discrimination
    2. Risk Management (Social Risk Management): This approach was developed by the World
       Bank (Pritchett, 2005) and conceptualises social protection as a response to unstable
       scenarios in respect to poverty alleviation, which allows vulnerable households to invest
       and accumulate assets, and, consequently, to escape poverty
    3. Pro-Poor Economic Growth: This approach conceptualizes social protection as an efficient
       means of stimulating pro-poor economic growth (OECD, 2009)

The Old Aged and Disabled Pension Program programme is part of a set of policy initiatives in the
Health section of the Malagan Declaration Forward. The section states: “We will ensure the right of
every New Irelander to have a healthy life by continuing the Old Aged and Disabled Pension
Program…”

The Old Age and Disabled Policy Implementation Guidelines (2010) state the framework for the
social protection initiative is Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The objective
of the programme is stated as assisting the elderly and disabled to meet their basic needs (2010, p5).
Within this context, the program is universal in scope, and is neither means-tested nor targeted.

The appropriate conceptual framework within which to assess the effectiveness of the social
pension programme is as a Human Rights initiative.

The programme has been rolled out across New Ireland and has been in continuous operation for
several years. Population coverage is therefore important: do the beneficiaries covered by the
scheme represent the population intended to be covered by the programme. Is there equal, non-
discriminatory access to the programme, and to what extent has universal coverage been
achieved.



2.2.    Social Safety Nets

The New Ireland Old Age and Disability Pension is a social safety net. Social safety nets are non-contributory
transfers (both cash and non-cash) targeted to the poor and vulnerable4 and are increasingly being recognized
as effective tools to reach out to the most vulnerable 5. Social safety net programs can be categorised into

formal and informal safety nets. Formal safety nets are provided by the State and legally guarantee individuals
access to economic or social support whereas informal safety nets (typically provided through social
networks), provide the likelihood of support to individuals to assure them of attaining or remaining above the
designated minimum standard of living but with no guarantee (Paitoonponga, Abeb, & Puopongsakorna,
2008).



The New Ireland Old Age and Disability Pension is a formal social safety net providing a cash
transfer. Determining whether recipients actually receive cash payments made by the New Ireland
government is therefore important.

An appropriate indicator of effectiveness is whether payment policy has been implemented as
approved (even though there may not be a statutory obligation to effect the payment).



2.3.       The Social Protection Floor and Staircase

The objective of a social protection floor is to provide a base for the implementation of programmes
which have inter alia a wider scope and services as the New Ireland economy progressively develops.
The ILO has proposed a two-dimensional model (refer Figure 1) for the development of a social
protection regime: a social protection ‘staircase’ (ILO, 2010b, 2011) comprising two axes:

          A Social Protection Floor (horizontal coverage), providing access to essential health care for
           all, income security for children, assistance to the unemployed, underemployed and poor,
           and income security for the elderly and disabled.
          Building on the first floor (vertical coverage), providing more extensive and comprehensive
           social protection coverage.

The model seeks to take into account national constraints whilst promoting a basic universal level of
social protection at a reasonable cost, even in resource constrained circumstances (Harris, 2013).

guarantees for elderly and disabled New Ireland residents7. Within the wider context of the
further development of social protection in New Ireland and in Papua New Guinea generally, a key
question to be addressed is whether the New Ireland programme provides a basis, and within the
context of the scope of this report, an operational basis, for the further development of social
protection in New Ireland and Papua New Guinea.

3.1.       Social Protection in Pacific Island Countries

Social protection in most Pacific Island countries is typically informal and reliant on ‘traditional
safety nets’ embedded in extended land-based, cooperative kinship or clan-based communities
(Ellis, 2012; Ratuva, 2005).

The widely held view that traditional Pacific Island community traditional safety nets work well
and should not be disturbed, does not appear to be sustainable in the face of rising poverty levels
and social change. As Ellis (2012) notes, traditional safety nets are based on ‘spare capacity’; the
majority of clan members must contribute in order for redistribution to be effective. Migration,
urbanisation and remittances affect traditional safety nets. In addition, the effectiveness of
traditional safety nets can be uneven. Traditional systems seem to be more effective at addressing
shocks that affect individual households (for example funeral expenses) and less effective at
responding to extensive poverty or widespread shocks (Kidd, Samson, Ellis, Freeland, & Wyler,
2010).

There appear to be an increasing number of vulnerable groups who may not be adequately
covered by traditional social safety nets (Kidd, et al., 2010). Traditional networks are being
subjected to increasing strain and are poorly suited to the widespread hardship faced by
communities across the Pacific region (ADB, 2010). Churches, NGO’s and community groups in most
Pacific Island countries provide some welfare services, but their coverage is limited and uneven
(ADB, 2010). The need to augment traditional safety nets with formal social protection systems is
being increasingly accepted by Pacific Island countries.

Currently, the main social protection instrument in Pacific Island countries is the contributory
national provident fund which usually only benefits workers in the formal sector (ADB, 2010). New
Ireland is at the forefront of the development of social protection in the Pacific.

The New Ireland Old Age Pension is one of a several non-contributory old age pension schemes in
Pacific, the other countries being the Cook Islands, Nauru, Niue, Samoa, Kiribati and Fiji8 (Kidd, et al.,
2010).

New Ireland has implemented one of the few non-contributory disability schemes in the Pacific.
Disability schemes have also been implemented in two Pacific countries: the Cook Islands and Nauru
(Kidd, et al., 2010). Fiji previously included disability categories as part of the Family Assistance
Programme. However the categories were general and tended to be used as a basis for providing a
benefit to poor households, rather than as a means of providing disability or chronic illness support.
When the Family Assistance Programme was restructured as a poverty benefit, categorisation was
abolished. The government of Fiji is currently considering options for potential disability pension

The New Ireland Social Pension Scheme


3.2.      New Ireland Old Age and Disability Pension


a) Background


The New Ireland Old Age and Disability Pension was initiated by Sir Julius Chan when he was re-
elected New Ireland Governor in 2007 (Manase, 2014). This is a significant achievement.
Significant credit is due to the Honorable Sir Julius Chan and the New Ireland Provincial
Administration for initiating and supporting the development of social protection in Papua New
Guinea.

The programme was developed by the New Ireland government with no external assistance: “We
started implementing the programme from nowhere, not knowing what to do; we rolled out the
program through trial and error” (Lapauve, 2014). The programme has now been in continuous
operation since 2009.



b) Programme Design


The Old Age and Disability Pension is a universal, categorical social safety net which provides
income support for old age and disabled New Ireland residents who have lived in the Province for
at least ten years. Entitlement to the benefit is not means tested and is not conditional on welfare
status. The programme provides partial floor-level income support and is not intended to provide a
transfer sufficient to cover all living expenses for the beneficiary or dependents. The percentage of
beneficiary or household expenses typically covered by the programme is not known.

The programme is a single scheme with a single annual payment of K360 (K30 per month9). The
Implementation Guidelines state the pension is to be paid in two tranches of K180: before 15 May
and before 15 November each year. However, due to operational constraints the pension is
currently paid once annually in cash (in the amount of K360). Individual payment envelopes are
prepared by the Provincial Government in Kavieng and are delivered to beneficiaries through the
LLG and Ward structure.



c) Eligibility


The programme operates as a single pension, with two categories of eligibility.

i.      Old Age Pension
 “Any man or woman who is 60 years and above during the time of the payment” is eligible to
participate in the programme (New Ireland Provincial Government, 2010).

Eligibility is not evidentiary, but is determined by the Ward Councillor and the Chairman of the
Village Planning Committee. Determination is by discussion, typically using key dates. Applicants

are not required to provide documentary evidence of date of birth. Most elderly New Ireland
residents would not be able to provide a birth certificate.

ii.      Disability Pension
All disabled New Ireland residents are eligible for the disability pension. There is no minimum or
maximum age. Assessment of disability is undertaken by the Ward Councillor and the Chairman of
the Village Planning Committee, using the Old Age and Disabled Policy Implementation Guidelines.

The Guidelines define disability as “an illness, injury or condition that makes it difficult for a
person to do things that other people do. This includes disabilities caused by accidents and
amputees”. (New Ireland Provincial Government, 2010). Several examples of types of disability are
provided in the Guidelines, these are intended to be illustrative. There is no eligibility assessment
form10 and currently no training is provided to Ward Councillors or Village Planning Committees on
disability assessment. There is, therefore, significant scope for individual interpretation and
application.



3.3.       Programme Operations


a) Operations
The programme has been developed with minimal resources. The New Ireland Government has
adopted a continuous learning approach to the management of the scheme and has adapted
systems and processes progressively over the past six years. In particular, greater focus has been
placed on verifying eligibility for the old age pension. During the first year in which the benefit was
paid beneficiaries self-selected. As a consequence a benefit was paid to 16,776 recipients. The
eligibility process was reviewed in 2010 and the number of benefits paid was reduced by 42% to
9,738. The New Ireland political and administrative structure is used for the determination of
eligibility and the distribution of the social pension. New Ireland has 9 LLGs and 138 Wards, with an
average of 2-5 villages per Ward. Each village has a Village Planning Committee (VPC)11. All LLGs,
Wards and VPCs participate in the operation of the programme.

The New Ireland government currently has three full time staff dedicated to management of the
programme. In addition LLG, Ward and Village personnel are involved in eligibility assessment and
benefit distribution. The record of beneficiaries is held on a central database which was developed
by a volunteer. There is no full-time IT support. Subsequent to the departure of the volunteer an
issue has emerged with the database. As a consequence the database cannot be interrogated and
no new beneficiaries can be added. The 2014 pension payment is being undertaken manually.



b) Processes
The programme uses a repeating annual, rather than a continuous process. Beneficiaries are
currently re-enrolled in the scheme annually (refer Figure 2). The process used to manage the
pension programme has three components. In general terms during the first quarter of the year the
Ward records are updated. During the second quarter the database is updated and payments are

prepared. During the third quarter payments are disbursed and acquitted by the Ward Councillor12.
If the New Ireland government does not have adequate funds, payments are not made.

                            beneficiaries
                                                Preparation




The current process is manual and labour intensive, and requires significant time and labour
commitment by the New Ireland Administration, Ward Councillors and village leaders. The
principal driver of the current process is annual beneficiary re-certification by Ward Councillors and
village leaders, and the subsequent manual payment. If beneficiaries were certified using age
verification documentation provided by the beneficiary (for examine a birth certificate or baptism
certificate), annual re-certification would not be required. If electronic payment was used to
disburse funds manual payment would no longer be required. Beneficiaries could then apply to join
the scheme on reaching the age of eligibility and could then remain in the scheme until death.



i.        Determination of Eligible Beneficiaries
The annual process commences with Ward Councilors, in conjunction with the Village Planning
Committees and Ward Recorders, preparing a list of residents who are 60 years or older, or who
are disabled. The previous year’s list is used as a basis for the new listing. In order to capture data
for new beneficiaries, the Provincial Administration provides an information form to Ward
Councilors which is completed when the beneficiary first commences receipt of the pension. Data
on the form is used to create the database record. Verification of eligibility is undertaken at the
Ward level, in conjunction with the Chairman of Village Planning Committee. The determination of
beneficiaries who have died is also undertaken at the Ward level. Each of the 138 Wards completes
the listing each year.

The list of potential beneficiaries prepared by Ward Councilors is forwarded to the LLG for review
and on-forwarding to the Provincial Administration.

ii.      Database Update and Payment Preparation
 Following receipt of the updated Ward lists, the Provincial Administration updates the database
of recipients and calculates the funding required. The Provincial Treasury is advised of the funding
requirement. Funds are paid into a trust account.

Following the receipt of funds the Provincial Administration prepares a payment envelope for
each beneficiary and updates the database. Payment sheets are also prepared for each Ward and
village.

iii.    Disbursement of Payments
The payment envelopes and payment sheets are progressively distributed, using a security escort
to LLGs and then on-delivered to Ward Councilors, who then distribute to beneficiaries. The
beneficiary must be present in the village on the day the pension is disbursed. For security reasons

villages are not advised in advance of the day the team will be visiting the village to distribute the
pension envelopes.

Signatures are obtained from beneficiaries when the pension envelope is collected. A review of
payment records indicates, however, the beneficiary does not always sign on their own behalf.
There appear to be instances of a third-party signing on behalf of the beneficiary. Concerns were
raised by the New Ireland Administration in respect to payments collected by beneficiary
representatives, as there is evidence of instances where LLG and Ward Officers disbursing the
payments have been signing off payments on behalf of beneficiaries.



c) Issues identified by New Ireland Administration


The Provincial Administration has identified two significant issues with the current process13:

i.      Data management
The collection of information and annual updating is manual. Updated information is entered into
a database. However, the database is not accessible in the field. In addition, the Provincial
Administration does not have a full time resource to manage the database and develop the
information architecture. Issues with the database resulted in no payments being made in 2012 due
to the need to access database entries and cross-check double entries. A double payment was made
in 2013 for 2012/ 2013. In addition, due to current issues with the database, the 2014 payment
sheets are being processed manually.

ii.     Monitoring and Accountabilities
The process of collecting and recording information and distributing and accounting for pension
payments involves multiple parties. This creates complexity in respect to program monitoring and
the management of accountabilities for payments to beneficiaries and data. Within this context,
handing large amounts of cash in the field also creates complexity (and expense) due to the need to
ensure security and to acquit for funds and return of funds not disbursed to the Provincial
Administration.



3.4.    Programme Coverage14

As at the 2011 Census, the New Ireland population was 194,06715. The New Ireland Pension had
8,362 beneficiaries in 2013 (refer Figure 3), which equates to 4.3% of the Provincial population16.

a) Beneficiary Characteristics


 i.       Age Distribution of Pension Recipients
The average beneficiary age for old age pension recipients is 70 years and the modal age is 64
years. If the age of eligibility for current New Ireland recipients is raised to 65 years, it is likely up
to 66% of New Ireland old age pension beneficiaries would no longer be eligible. The age
distribution of old age pension recipients is similar for female and male recipients18.

Approximately 10% of disability recipients would also qualify for the Old Age Pension. The
percentage of current old age pension recipients who are disabled is not known. The mean age of
disability recipients for whom age was recorded was 36 years19. The age distribution was very
broad.



b) Programme Coverage


i.       Old Age and Disabled Population20
Approximately 4.6% of the Papa New Guinea population is aged 60 years and older21. The level of
disability in Papua New Guinea is not known. Estimates of disability in proximate countries suggest
the level of disability could range between 2.9% and 12%. To a significant extent levels of disability
are a function of the definition of disability used. The United Nations Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) has reviewed disability in the Pacific Region (ESCAP,
2012a, 2012b). Estimated levels of disability are shown in Table 4.

   Refer Appendix One for the age distribution. 15% of old age beneficiaries have a recorded age <60. These
records were excluded from analysis of age.
19
   Analysis of the age distribution of disability pension recipients is indicative as age was not recorded for 73%
of recipients.

   The estimate of programme coverage assumes the age distribution for the New Ireland population is similar
to the distribution for PNG generally

The average estimated level of disability for Melanesian countries is inflated by the Vanuatu
estimate. The reason for the significant difference in the level of disability between Vanuatu and the
other Melanesian countries is not known, but is considered likely to be due to definitional
differences. Importantly, estimating the level of disability is complex and the percentage of the
population estimated to be living with disability does not necessarily reflect the percentage of the
population for whom formal financial support for disability is provided. As an example, it is
estimated 16.6% of the New Zealand population is living with disability. However, approximately
1.5% of the population receives a disability benefit payment22. These recipients comprise 25% of
those receiving support for disability (usually paid as an allowance incremental to another transfer
payment). Therefore 5% of the population receives formal financial support for disability. However,
50% of those receiving support are over 65 years of age. Allowing for the different population age
structure between New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, an estimate of 3.5% of the population likely
to be eligible for disability support is considered a reasonable basis to use to calculate coverage. In
addition, if Vanuatu is excluded from the Melanesian estimate, the average is 3.5%.

A level of 3.5% has been used for the disability coverage estimate.

ii.       Coverage
It is estimated approximately 84% of the population aged 60+ in New Ireland is currently receiving
the old age pension23. It is estimated approximately 17% of the disabled population likely to be
covered by a disability benefit is currently receiving the disability pension24.

   If age has been misreported for the 15% of the old age beneficiary recipients for whom an age of <60 was
recorded, the coverage estimate will rise to 94%

iii.     Gender Bias and Exclusion
There appears to be gender bias in respect to enrolment in the old age pension. Whilst 92% of
eligible men appear to receive the old age pension, only 75% of eligible women appear to receive
the pension.

There is likely to be significant gender bias in enrolment in the disability pension. The gender
balance for disability in New Ireland is not known. Currently 62% of disability pension recipients are
men and 32% are women. The UNESCAP review of disability in Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP 2012a,
2012b), suggests levels of disability are likely to be higher for women than men.



c) Receipt of the pension by beneficiaries25


Receipt of the pension by beneficiaries is not audited. Available data indicates nearly all
beneficiaries receive their pension. Constraints to payment of the pension are primarily
operational. These constraints resulted in no payment being made in 2012 and a double payment in
2013.

The New Ireland Provincial Administration advised in 2012/ 2013, 875 envelopes were returned,
indicating the beneficiary had not received payment26. This indicates a low level of non-receipt of
the pension. Analysis of the beneficiary database suggests that, with the exception of Murat LLG27,
2% of old age beneficiaries and 5% of disabled beneficiaries did not receive their pension in 2012-
2013,

Beneficiaries do not currently receive the pension in accordance with policy. A single payment is
made due to the administrative complexity in determining eligible beneficiaries, preparing payments
and then distributing payments to villages.



d) Potential Old Age and Disability Pension Commitment


Full coverage at K30pm for both the old age and disability pension may require an increase in
funding of apx. K2.6m - an increase of approximately 85% over the current funding level). The
potential annual funding commitment has been estimated using the old age and disability estimates
(assuming eligibility for the old age pension remains at 60 years). As shown in Table 5, two payment
scenarios have been estimated: K30pm and K60 pm28.




25
   Database records for the complete years 2012 and 2013 were used as these are the most complete records.
26
   It is not clear whether 2012 and 2013 payments were combined in the same envelope.
27
   High levels of non-receipt were recorded for Murat LLG (>50%). The reason for level of apparent non-
receipt has been raised with the New Ireland Administration

It is estimated the population aged 60+ in Melanesian countries will rise to 7.2% by 2025 (Hayes,
2009). This would result in an increase in funding for the old age pension to approximately K5m
(assuming the benefit amount is constant).

The current definition of disability used in New Ireland allows wide latitude in interpretation. In
addition there is no protocol for the assessment of disability. There is therefore potential for a
significant increase in the number of disability pension recipients. If the number of recipients of
the disability pension was increased to estimated disability level in Vanuatu the number of
beneficiaries could rise to approximately 23,000. This would result in an annual funding
commitment of K8.28m. Whilst this scenario is unlikely, the current definition and assessment
protocol allow for very wide interpretation of disability.

3.5.       Beneficiary Perspective of the Social Pension

Several focus groups29 were held with beneficiaries in villages proximate to Keviang. The objective
of the focus groups was to develop an initial understanding of beneficiaries’ perspectives of the old
age pension and the disability pension. Key findings from the focus groups are summarised below.

1. Eligibility for the social pension

Age Verification
Focus group participants did not have birth certificates. Most participants estimated their date of
birth. However, most participants stated they had a baptism certificate. There was no consistent
method by which participants determined their age. Several participants stated they knew their age
because their name was written in the Ward Record. Other participants related their age to a
significant event. The Ward Councilor at one of the villages stated that, if she doubted the age of
the applicant she ‘eliminated them’ from the list.

Village records do not appear to be a reliable source of date of birth (or death). The Ward
Councilor advised the record book in one of the villages visited had been lost. In another village, the
record book was held at another location and could not be viewed.

Determination of Disability
Whilst focus group participants’ understanding of old age was consistent (even though the
determination of age may vary), understanding of the concept of disability was more nebulous.
Participants were asked to describe their understanding of disability and how disability can be
assessed. The Ward Councilor in one focus group defined disability as ‘people who are unable to
work for themselves’. This is similar to the definition in the Old Age and Disabled Policy
Implementation Guidelines. The Ward Councilor also noted there was no formal process for
determining disability and that she sat with villagers and discussed with them whether there were
households with members who may be disabled. The (understandable) difficulty Ward Councilors
and villagers had conceptualising, defining and assessing disability is likely to be a primary factor in
the limited enrolment of disabled villagers in the pension programme.

In one village several focus group participants stated there were members of the village who were
disabled but who were not receiving the pension. Participants in one focus group stated they knew
of people who had pretended to be disabled in order to receive the pension.

2. How beneficiaries learned about the social pension
Focus group participants stated they learned about the pension through a variety of channels.
However, the most common method by which beneficiaries learned about the social pension was
by communication from the Ward Councilor. Some beneficiaries learned about the pension via the
radio. Interestingly, several focus group participants who were aware of the pension programme
went to see the ward Councilor or Chairman of the Village Planning Committee to enroll in the
programme. These participants also stated they had estimated their date of birth.

The New Ireland Social Pension Scheme


3. Contribution of the social pension to well-being


Most participants stated they did not use the funds solely for their own well-being, but as a
contribution to the well-being of the household. Most participants stated they had been in receipt
of the pension for 2 – 4 years and stated the pension was ‘helpful to old people’. Funds were
typically used to provide food, medicine, and clothing and to pay for school fees for the grand-
children. Several women in one of the focus groups stated they used the payment to purchase
goods for sale at their trade-store. A number of participants who had bank accounts stated they
saved some (typically between a third and a half) of the pension payment in their bank account.
Participants who did not have bank accounts stated they saved part of the pension at home. Overall,
however, participants stated the benefit funds only lasted two-four weeks (men in one village stated
the pension lasted about two months).

Focus group participants were consistent in noting the pension made a positive contribution to
their well-being and the well-being of their household, in particular contributing to basic needs
(food) and ensuring children in the household were able to receive an education (school fees). The
reported use of the benefit to support the household (in particular grandchildren’s education) is
consistent with findings in other countries that universal old-age pensions, in addition to supporting
the beneficiary and reducing poverty, also resulted in better care and support for young children in
recipient households (ADB, 2010, p. 15)

The duration of the contribution to wellbeing is currently brief due to the single annual payment.
The focus groups did not explore the contribution of the pension to the wider community or to
social networks. Also, the focus groups did not explore the use of the pension by sole occupant
households. A follow up interview was held with a male old age pension recipient who is no longer
working. The recipient had previously cut copra to earn income. He now lives alone, his children
having moved away. The children occasionally send money to him. He stated the pension met his
needs and provided medicine, food and clothing.



4. Issues encountered by beneficiaries


Participants stated they were not aware of any instances in which they had not received a pension
payment due to the funds going missing between the Provincial Government Office in Kavieng and
their village.

Participants frequently stated that the inconsistency of the timing of the payment was an issue, or
they missed the payment because they were not home. The date of the payment not being known in
advance was also an issue as beneficiaries needed to be in the village in order to receive the
payment. Several focus group participants stated either they had not received funds, or they knew
of pensioners who had not received funds due to their not being present in the village on the day
the team came to the village to distribute the pension payment.

5. Potential enhancements to the pension programme suggested by beneficiaries


Focus group participants were asked ways they considered the social pension could be improved. A
range of suggested improvements was offered. However, four improvements were suggested by
multiple focus groups:

Increase pension payment frequency: Most beneficiaries stated they would prefer to receive their
pension at least quarterly

Pay the pension to a bank account: Beneficiaries in the two villages which had access to banking
services stated that the payment of the benefit to a bank account would be preferable.

Separate the pension to two programmes: Several participants stated they considered the
programme should be split into two programmes: an old age programme and a disability
programme, and elderly villagers who were also disabled should be able to receive a larger payment.
Participants in two villages noted that disabled villagers who were supporting a family should be able
to receive a larger payment.

Increase the pension payment level with inflation: All participants noted the amount of the
payment was low, particular given the increasing price of goods in stores.

4. Potential Enhancements to New Ireland Old Age and Disability Pension
   Programme

The development and continuous operation of the programme by the New Ireland Provincial
Administration is a significant achievement, in particular as this has been undertaken with limited
resources and no external assistance.

Findings from the operational review, coverage review and beneficiary perspective indicate the
social pension programme will require strengthening to ensure there is an appropriate platform
for the further development of social protection in New Ireland and the piloting of the national
social pension.

The following enhancements to the Old Age and Disability Pension programme are recommended in
order to strengthen the programme in New Ireland and to enable the New Ireland Provincial
Administration to pilot the national social pension30.

It is recommended five elements of the programme are strengthened:
      1. Design of the program,
      2. The old age pension eligibility verification and registration processes
      3. The disability pension assessment and enrollment processes
      4. The payment modality
      5. Data management.

The New Ireland Provincial Administration is currently exploring several of the suggested
enhancements.



4.1.    Programme Design
1. Review the benefit amount
When the social pension was initiated in 2009 the benefit amount was set at K30pm (approximately
K1 per day31). Since inception the inflation rate in Papua New Guinea has varied between 6.9%pa
(2009) and 3.8%pa (2013)32. The benefit amount has, however remained constant. The value of the
pension has therefore diminished in real terms.

Recommendation: Index the social pension to the CPI to ensure benefit value remains constant
over time.



2. Separate the old age and disability pension into two programmes
The Old Age and Disability Pension a single programme, with two benefit categories: old age and
disability. The management of an old age pension is considerably more straightforward (and also
less expensive) than the management of a disability pension. Specialist skill is required to determine

   The set of recommended enhancements should not be regarded as a being in any way a criticism of the New
Ireland Provincial Administration

and assess disability. This skill typically requires formal training. By contrast the verification of age is
straightforward and does not require specialist expertise.

In addition, because disability can occur at any age and can range in severity, it may not be
appropriate for there to be a nexus between the amount of the benefit paid to old age recipients
and the benefit paid to disabled recipients. In addition, it may be appropriate to consider a range of
benefit levels for disabled recipients, depending on inter alia the level of disability.

As discussed in section 3.4, there is evidence a number of elderly beneficiaries are disabled (even
allowing for the current difficulty in assessing disability). Focus group participants raised the issue of
an elderly pension recipient who was also disabled, requiring greater assistance. It may be
appropriate to consider enabling old age pensioners who are also disabled, to receive a disability
pension payment.

The relative simplicity of enrolling old age beneficiaries is likely to be one of the key reasons the old
age component of the programme has been more successful than the disability component. This is
not surprising given the limited resources currently available to identify and assess disability.

Recommendations:
   - Separate the social pension into two separate programmes: An old age pension and a
      disability pension
   - Allow disabled people over the age of 60 years to receive either a higher pension or both
      the old age and disability pensions.



3. Implement continuous enrolment
Electronic payment, combined with documentary verification of age provided by the beneficiary, will
enable a shift from the current annual recurring process to a continuous enrolment process.
Continuous enrolment will enable beneficiaries to receive their payment on eligibility, rather than
having to wait for the update cycle. Continuous enrolment can be implemented by the beneficiary
going to the Provincial Administration offices, or through the Ward Councilor.

Recommendation: Implement continuous enrolment following the re-development of the
database and the migration to electronic payment and introduction of document based eligibility
verification.



4.2.    Old Age Pension Eligibility Verification and Registration

Approximately 15% of old age pensioners (and 73% of disability pensioners) do not have age
recorded in the database. When this is combined with the 15% of old age pensioners for whom it
appears age has not been recorded incorrectly, or who are incorrectly classified, it is evident there
are high levels of error in the database. This is likely to be due to inadequate beneficiary
documentation, enrolment error or input error.

1. Require documentary evidence of age
Currently age verification for the old age pension does not require documentary evidence. Initially
self-verification was used. However this resulted in over-enrolment of old age beneficiaries. The
verification process was subsequently changed to verification by the Ward Councilor and village

                                                                                               32 | P a g e
The New Ireland Social Pension Scheme


leaders.The most common age verification used by Ward Councilors is agreement with the
beneficiary. This process is both time consuming and places the burden of age verification on the
Ward Councilor, rather than on the applicant.

Ward Records are unreliable. Birth certificates are currently unavailable for most elderly New Ireland
residents (it appears only 10% of births are currently registered with the Civil Registry)33.
Documentary evidence is, however, available. Birth certificates will become available as the Civil
Registry project progresses34. In addition the National ID will have date of birth recorded35. Hospital
birth records are available for residents born in hospital. In addition, the vast majority of New
Ireland residents are baptized and baptism records are available (albeit currently in paper form)36.

Recommendation: Shift from verification of age by the Ward Councilor to documentary evidence
of age provided by the applicant for the old age pension. Agreement with the churches will be
required to enable baptism records to be provided. A communication and education programme
will be required to assist applicants. Acceptable documentary evidence can include: Birth Certificate,
National ID card, hospital birth records, baptism certificate. As a last resort community verification
can be used (with reference to significant events etc.).



2. Enhance linkage to Civil Registry and Church Records
Reliable verification of age, and verification of death is fundamental to a sustainable old age pension
programme to ensure only eligible beneficiaries enroll in the programme and cease to receive a
pension on death. Present processes require strengthening. In the short term government
documentary evidence of age and/ or death may not be available. These will be available in the
medium to longer term. However Church based evidence of age and (in most cases) death does
appear to be available. Church records may also be able to be used in the short term to provide
evidence of death.

In order to facilitate a shift from age verification by the Ward Councilor to applicant provided
documentary evidence of age, closer operational relationships will be required with the Civil Registry
Office and Churches. The Civil Registry is currently being decentralized and Registry Offices are
being established in each Province. The target date for completion of the rollout is March 201531.
Each Office will be able to issue birth certificates. In addition to the establishment of Provincial
Registry Offices, the Civil Registry is seeking to strengthen the role of the Ward Recorder. The Ward
Recorder role is currently unpaid and is appointed by the Ward Councilor (a political appointment37).
The Civil registrar is seeking to implement paid Ward Registrars, reporting to the Provincial Registrar,
with Ward records audited periodically. The Ward registrar will record births, deaths and marriages
in the Ward.

Recommendation: Establish operational relationships established with the Provincial Civil Registry
(once established) and Churches in New Ireland in order to develop processes for applicants for
the old age pension to obtain documentary evidence of age. In the short term the Ward Councilor

may need to continue to be responsible for the determination of death. To reduce the impost of
Ward Councilors, it may be appropriate to sample check pensioners 65 years and older each year.



3. Undertake a baseline survey
Whilst the primary objective in establishing the old age pension is human rights based, the New
Ireland Provincial Administration also has the objective of assisting elderly New Ireland residents to
meet their basic needs. At this time the economic and social impact of the social pension on the
well-being of pensioners, their households or their communities is not fully known. In addition to
providing (albeit ex post) information in respect to the impact of the current old age pension, the
baseline survey will form a basis for subsequent programme monitoring and evaluation, and will also
be able to be used nationally as the old age pension is rolled out across Papua New Guinea.

Recommendation: Conduct a base-line survey38 to develop an understanding of the welfare and
social impact of the old age pension on beneficiaries, their households and their communities.
The University of Queensland has been commissioned by DFAT to undertake a study to explore
relational aspects of vulnerability and access to cash transfers for social protection in New Ireland39.



4.3.     Disability Pension


1. Strengthen the capacity for disability assessment
As discussed, coverage estimates indicate it is likely there is currently under-coverage of the New
Ireland disabled population.

In addition, there are is also the related issue of the assessment of disability. This issue is complex as
it involves the determination of a conceptual model of disability, the development of a workable
definition of disability and the development of a consistent, efficient and effective means of
assessing disability.

There is, at present, no comprehensive form available for use by Ward Councilors to support the
assessment of disability40. There is no training for Ward Councilors in the assessment of disability.
Determination of disability is currently undertaken ad hoc by Ward Councilors and village leaders,
most of whom are unlikely to have the skills required to effectively assess disability.

In order to strengthen disability assessment and disability management several initiatives are
currently underway, both in New Ireland Province and nationally. The establishment of the New
Ireland Disability Organisation33 will create capacity which can, in turn, support the strengthening of
capacity for disability assessment in Wards and villages. In addition, the New Ireland Provincial
Administration is working with the Department for Community Development Office of Disability to



38
   This can, potentially be undertaken as part of the current World Bank technical assistance to DfCD
39
   It is expected the study will explore a range of vulnerabilities including inter alia: poverty and food security;
access to health care, education, and social support for the aged and those living with disabilities; health,
safety and income security for women and children, the impacts of economic change and changing state-
citizen relationships on traditional systems of social support
40
   The Department for Community Office of Disability does have a tool for the collection of information on
disability

                                                                                                       34 | P a g e
The New Ireland Social Pension Scheme


develop a disability database41 and with local NGO’s42 to strengthen the capacity for disability
assessment43. The Department for Community Development is working with the Department of
Health to determine a definition of disability appropriate for use by the Civil Registry Office44. At this
time it is not known whether this definition will be able to be used by trained field-staff to assess
disability. New Ireland disability policy may also need to be reviewed in order to further develop the
definition of disability.

Recommendations:
   - Strengthen the New Ireland Provincial Administration social pension management team
      through the recruitment of an appropriately skilled and experienced disability officer
   - Develop a plan to enhance the disability assessment capacity, both at the Provincial
      Administration level and at the Ward level. This may require strengthening linkages with
      the Department for Community Development Office for Disability, the Department for
      Health and local disability management and support services.
   - Revise the definition of disability (this may be best undertaken within the context of the
      development of the national disability pension and the establishment of consistent
      eligibility criteria for the disability benefit)
   - Develop a robust and workable disability assessment protocol (including the
      documentation of disability)
   - Develop and implement training for Ward personnel who may be involved in the
      assessment of eligibility for the disability pension.



2. Centrally review new enrolments to the disability pension
There are currently few recipients of the disability pension (estimated 1,100 – 1,200), in absolute
number and relative to both old age pension recipients and the disabled population of New Ireland.
There are currently issues in respect to the definition of disability, the capacity of Ward Councilors
and Village leaders to assess disability and the likely number of disability beneficiaries. There is a
risk of large-scale (and potentially rapid) enrolment in the disability pension which will not be able to
be managed effectively by the New Ireland Provincial Administration and which may lead to
significant funding uncertainty and the potential for a funding blow-out.

Recommendation: Pending strengthening of the disability pension eligibility and assessment
processes, the New Ireland Administration should review (at least on a sample basis) new
enrolments in the disabled pension in order to monitor eligibility assessment.



3. Undertake a survey of disability in New Ireland
At present the extent of disability and patterns of disability in New Ireland are not known. The likely
funding requirement for a disability pension (and the likely support requirement) is currently not
known. A survey of disability in New Ireland is required to provide insight into the nature and extent
of disability and individual, household and social support capacity, and will provide insight into
required forms of disability support and location.

Recommendation: Undertake a Provincially representative survey of disability in New Ireland45 to
complement the work currently being undertaken to build a database of disability in New Ireland
and to increase capacity to support disabled New Irelanders.



4.4.       Payment Modality
1. Transition from cash to electronic payment of benefits
Cash payment delivered to each beneficiary is expensive, requires a large human resource
commitment in LLGs and Wards, has a high administrative overhead to prepare payment envelopes,
is time consuming, inefficient and have a high security risk. Beneficiaries do not know in advance
when payment will be received. This reduces the efficacy of the benefit as recipients are unable to
plan use of funds. The current payment modality limits the ability of the New Ireland Provincial
Administration to pay the social pension in accordance with policy and prevents an increase in
payment frequency to quarterly or monthly (preferred by pension recipients). The New Ireland
Provincial Administration is aware of the issues with cash payments and has discussed potential for
migration to electronic payment with Westpac (Government bankers)46. Both BSP and WBC offer
basic bank accounts suitable for the receipt of benefit payments41.

Recommendation:
   - A policy decision is taken to transition from paying pensions in cash to paying pensions
      electronically, by credit to a bank account, debit card or mobile phone. This will require a
      change to policy #12 (Administration of Payment) that states payment is to be
      administered at LLG level.
   - The migration from cash-based to electronic benefit payment will need to be progressive.
      In order to achieve electronic payment to a bank account for all pensioners, the
      completion of the construction of mobile phone towers will be required47. In addition,
      interoperability48 will be required to enable payment of benefits to accounts held with a
      range of financial services providers.



2. Increase the payment frequency
Beneficiaries interviewed stated they would prefer quarterly or monthly payment. There is evidence
quarterly or monthly payment provides a greater welfare benefit.Migration to electronic benefit
distribution will enable payment frequency to be increased

Recommendation: Change policy to pay benefits monthly or quarterly.

4.5.    Data and Data Management


1. Recruit a data manager
The current (open source) database and weak data management capacity is a significant constraint
to the further development of social protection in New Ireland Province. The Provincial
Administration is aware of the constraint and has requested support to resolve current database
issues and to further strengthen the data management capacity. This will require the recruitment of
an appropriately skilled data manager to develop the information architecture and database
capability. The development of database capability can be undertaken independent of the
development of the national social pension, or in conjunction with the national pension, with a view
to the development of a platform which can be migrated to a central platform or replicated in other
Provinces (depending on the systems architecture to be used for the national programme). The
latter course of action is considered to be the most appropriate.

Recommendation:
   - Recruit a data manager who can work with the New Ireland Provincial Administration and
      the Department for Community Development to resolve current database issues and to
      further strengthen the data management capacity in order to support the enhancement of
      the New Ireland social pension and the related piloting of the national pension.
   - If an expatriate data manager must be recruited, it is recommended a PNG national is
      hired concurrently to work with the expatriate data manager to ensure capacity
      development, with intention that the PNG national will assume responsibility for data
      management over time.



2. Expand the information collected from beneficiaries
The current dataset contains very limited information: beneficiary name, location, birth year, status,
and type of benefit. There also appears to be significant inaccuracy in the information collected (or
coded to the database). The dataset has limited capability to support the further development of
social protection in New Ireland. Initial enrolment in the current old age or disability programme
provides an opportunity for the collection of information which can be used to develop a nuanced
understanding of the recipients and recipient households and can also be used for the further
development of social protection programmes. In addition, beneficiaries do not have a unique
identifier. To date this is unlikely to have been an issue. However, as social protection progressively
develops in New Ireland and across Papua New Guinea, the risk of duplication increases. The
National ID may provide an appropriate unique identifier. If the National ID cannot be used, a
separate unique photo ID with a unique identifier will be required.

Recommendation:
   - Implement a unique identifier for each beneficiary
   - Develop an application form which incorporates a unique identifier and which enables the
      collection of individual and household level information (including, for example, a
      household roster, sources of income and household assets)
   - Progressively reenroll beneficiaries using the updated form

3. Strengthen the database and related systems
The current database is not working. In addition, it may be difficult to transfer files from the current
database to a bank payment system without further development of the database. The database
needs to be developed using an appropriate scalable platform which can be sustainably managed
locally. It is possible that, in the migration to a national social pension, an open-source platform may
no longer be appropriate. The New Ireland government is aware of the requirement for an accurate
database to support programme implementation49 and the constraints resulting from the current
(2014) requirement to process eligibility and payments manually50.

Recommendation:

       -   As a matter of urgency the current database needs to become operational and useable.
           Technical assistance may be required.
       -   Review the database platform as the national programme is developed.



4. Audit receipt of payments
There is currently no independent audit to check whether beneficiaries have received their benefit.
The verification of benefit receipt is currently by signature. However, there is currently no means of
ensuring the person who signs for receipt of the payment is the beneficiary. A review of the paper
records indicated that, at least in some instances, the person signing is not the beneficiary. It was
observed that the same signature had been recorded for multiple beneficiaries. This may be due to
beneficiaries being illiterate.

Recommendation: Implement a sample check of beneficiary payment receipt as part of the New
Ireland Provincial Administration audit cycle.

b) Tentative Sequencing
It is recommended the implementation of the potential enhancements be grouped into four phases,
commencing with the revision of policy, the commencement of a baseline survey and the
strengthening of data management capability (and related systems). These are pre-conditions to the
implementation of subsequent changes. Following this it is recommended documentation be
strengthened as this is a pre-condition to migration to electronic payments: current beneficiaries will
need to be re-enrolled and new beneficiaries enrolled, documentation obtained (and bank accounts
opened). It is also suggested that, until the disability pension is revised, as a risk management
measure new enrollments to the disability pension be reviewed by the New Ireland Administration.
In order to implement document based age verification, enhanced links to the Civil Registry and
churches will be required. Following the review of policy, strengthening of the data management
and documentation, electronic benefit payment can be implemented and following this continuous
enrollment can be implemented as all systems required will be in place and operational. Because
the review and strengthening of disability assessment capability may require significant time and
resources, it is recommended this is implemented as a separate set of in conjunction with the

                                                                                                39 | P a g e

4.6.    Conclusions in respect to the suitability of the New Ireland Social Pension as a
        basis for a National Social Pension

This review concludes that the New Ireland social pension scheme, with modifications, can
provide a suitable basis for the old age component of the national social pension. The New Ireland
age verification and disability assessment processes, the recurring annual (re)enrolment and
payment process and the database limitations indicate the New Ireland old age pension and related
processes and administration will require strengthening if it is to be used as the platform for the
pilot of the national social pension.

The review concludes the New Ireland social pension scheme does not provide a suitable basis for
the disability component of the national social pension. As discussed in the review of the New
Ireland social pension, the implementation of a disability pension is significantly more complex than
the implementation of an old age pension.

5. Considerations for a National Social Pension Programme

The Department for Community Development was tasked by Cabinet in 2009 to investigate and
report on a possible social protection model (DfCD, 2014). Several possible social protection models
were examined: traditional social safety nets, institutional care, social insurance, social credit and
savings, and the social safety net. The social safety net was recommended as the most appropriate
model for Papua New Guinea. The recommendation was accepted. Government is now seeking the
development of an Old Age and Disability Pension.

The social pension strategy to finalise the parameters of the pension and to develop the
implementation strategy (within the context of the wider social protection policy) is currently
being finalised. At this time the transfer modality has not been finalised and may be either cash or
in-kind (or a mix of both), although a direct cash transfer to a bank account appears to be the
preferred transfer modality (DfCD, 2014). The minimum age for the pension will be 65 years. Types
and forms of disability to be covered by the programme have yet to be determined. In addition
payment amount and frequency have yet to be finalised.

Whilst acknowledging there are significant aspects of the national social pension which have yet to
be finalised, on the assumption that enhanced New Ireland old age and disability programme will be
broadly congruent with the national old age and disability programme, the following observations
are made in respect to several key elements of programme design and implementation. Key risks
are also discussed and a high-level roadmap is suggested.



5.1.    Implications of the New Ireland Experience for the National Social Pension

The New Ireland Government has several years’ experience with the development and
management of an old age and disability social pension. This experience has been gained through
trial and error and the New Ireland community development team now has extensive practical
experience. It is recommended this experience be drawn on for the development of the national
programme.

New Ireland would appear to be the most logical location to pilot the national social pension. The
suggested enhancements to the New Ireland pension are recommended to both strengthen the
current programme in New Ireland and to provide a basis for the use of the New Ireland programme
as a pilot for the national pension, allowing that policy, strategy and programme parameters have
yet to be finalised.

The New Ireland Old Age and Disability Pension has been developed to meet the objectives of the
New Ireland government. It is, therefore, possible that the national programme may not have same
programme objectives and parameters as the New Ireland programme.




                                                                                         42 | P a g e
The New Ireland Social Pension Scheme


a) Programme design
The New Ireland experience suggests it may be appropriate for the social pension to be separated
into two programmes: and old age pension and a disability pension, with an initial focus on rolling
out the disability pension51.

Implications:
   - It is recommended the approach suggested for the New Ireland Provincial Administration
        in respect to applicants providing documentary evidence of age is also adopted for the
        national programme, with birth certificate, National ID card, hospital records and baptism
        certificates being accepted records. It is recommended community verification is only
        used in locations in which document-based verification cannot be used.
   - It is also recommended a clear and workable definition of disability be developed, along
        with a national protocol for assessing disability and the development of appropriately
        skilled capacity in each Province to assess disability. The requirement for services to
        support the disabled is important, but is separate to the transfer payment.



b) Eligibility Assessment and Verification
The recommendations which have been made in respect to the New Ireland social pension are also
relevant for the national social pension.

Implications:
   - Age must be able to be determined reliably and efficiently, and should be the
        responsibility of the applicant, not the LLG or Ward.
   - In addition death needs to be recorded accurately to ensure possibility of phantom
        beneficiaries52 is minimised. Electronic payment can assist with reducing the number of
        phantom beneficiaries. However, the bank may not be aware of the death of the account
        owner unless notified.
   - The role of Ward Recorder is a key role in ensuring births and deaths are recorded.
        However, the role of the Ward Recorder is currently voluntary and is not, in its present
        form, considered a suitable basis for the determination of age, or of death. During the
        field visit in New Ireland the team asked to review to Ward record for three records. In
        one instance the book had been lost. In another instance it was unavailable, in a third
        instance the Ward recorder was unavailable. The intention to strengthen the role of the
        Ward Recorder to become a Ward Registrar is supported. At present this role appears to
        be a weak link in the chain.
   - Disability will need to be assessed professionally. It is not considered appropriate for
        untrained Ward Councilors to use personal judgment to assess disability, without
        verification. Capacity development may be required in order to enable the professional
        assessment of disability.

c) Payment Modality
Payment of the pension to beneficiaries must be able to be delivered reliably and safely for both the
payer (DfCD) and the payee (the beneficiary).

Implications:
   - It is recommended that, as a matter of policy the DfCD only pay the social pension
        electronically, either directly to the beneficiary’s bank account (the preferred modality) or,
        if it is not possible to use bank accounts by electronic transfer to an intermediary (for
        example the provision of a voucher to beneficiaries which can be cashed at the Post Office
        in the nearest town).
        Payment in of the pension in cash directly by DfCD is not considered to be a viable option
        for the national scheme.



d) Capacity development
The New Ireland experience indicates that scheme parameters must be determined and adequate
capacity developed in order to deliver the programme within parameters. It has been possible for
the New Ireland Provincial Administration to learn from experience, and the national scheme will be
the beneficiary of this experience. It has also been possible for New Ireland to adjust payment
frequency according to funds available and operational capacity. However, this will not be possible
for a national scheme. The complexity of developing and rolling out a national scheme, even if rolled
out progressively by Province, will require scheme parameters to be finalised, operational processes
developed and documented and capacity developed, both centrally and in each Province, prior to
the commencement of the programme in the province.

Implications:
   - The Department for Community Development will need to develop capacity in order to be
        able to develop, deploy and manage the national social pension. Capacity will need to be
        developed centrally and in each Province. This is a matter of priority. International
        expertise may be required.
   - It is recommended a Capacity Needs Assessment be undertaken for DfCD, both at the
        central level, at the Provincial Level and at the District/LLG/ Ward level.
   - It is recommended that all international consultants should have a national equivalent
        who will work with the international consultants in order to develop the management
        cadre required to sustainably manage the social protection system in Papua New Guinea.



e) Organisational infrastructure
A replicable and scalable organisational model and related infrastructure will be required. The New
Ireland programme has been developed with a small staffing and limited discrete infrastructure.
Going forward the New Ireland programme will require additional staffing and systems capacity.

Implications:

    -   Given the geographic and socio-cultural complexity in Papua New Guinea, it is considered
        the national social pension will not be able to be readily managed centrally and significant
        operational decentralization will be required. Consequently, resourcing will be required in
        each Province with linkage back to the central office in respect to both systems and
        processes and delegations. The resourcing requirement, reporting structure, skills sets

                                                                                         44 | P a g e
The New Ireland Social Pension Scheme


         (and related training) have yet to be determined and developed. It may be appropriate for
         the proposed Provincial organisation structure to be piloted in New Ireland.
     -   Within the context of the above, rollout in each Province is a function of the willingness of
         the Provincial Administration to implement the social pension, and the administrative
         capacity to manage the scheme. A methodology will be required to determine
         organisational capacity. It is strongly recommended the social pension only commence in
         a Province if the organisational capacity to enroll beneficiaries, to manage scheme
         operations and to effect payment is in place and has been tested.



f) Data Management
Data management will be fundamental to the success of the national pension. If data is not
managed effectively there is a significant risk of large scale over-payment, with little capacity to
determine which beneficiaries are eligible for receipt of the social pension.

Barca and Chirchir, in a recent review of single registries and integrated MIS (Barca & Chirchir, 2014)
noted integrating data and information management of social protection programmes through a
single registry and associated integrated MIS can lead to more equitable distribution of resources,
facilitate oversight of multiple schemes and establish links with other services and increase efficiency
of delivery by avoiding duplication, integrated operations and scale. Barca and Chirchir also argued
data integration is primarily a policy issue requiring political and institutional arrangements, rather
than an issue requiring ‘technical fixes’. As Barca and Chirchir also note, development of an
integrated data management environment is more feasible when there is a ‘solid system for national
identification (Civil Registry or social security number)’ (Barca & Chirchir, 2014, p. 2).

DfCD does not, at present, have a data management environment which can be used for the
management of the national social pension. Development of an appropriate database environment,
information architecture and information management processes, will be a critical component in the
successful development of the national social pension.

Robust and high capacity data networks are still being developed in Papua New Guinea and the Civil
Registry is currently being strengthened and a national ID implemented. It may not be possible, at
this time to establish a single database for the social pension if the pension is to be implemented
prior to the finalisation of the national ID, Civil Registry and, in particular due to the likelihood of
high levels of local use of the data base for data changes and information53.

Implications:
   - It is strongly recommended that, as a matter of priority, the information architecture
        required to support the social pension, centrally and in each Province, is developed. The
        New Ireland database cannot be used as the basis for a national programme.
   - It is recommended that, if a distributed architecture is required in order to commence the
        social pension at the Provincial level, the data management architecture be designed with
        the intention of migrating to a single database as soon as is feasible.
   - The development of the data management architecture and systems infrastructure,
        ensuring there is a cadre of adequately trained and skilled staff, both at the central office
        and the Provincial offices will be critical. The New Ireland government, for example, has

53
  Experience in Fiji suggests Social Welfare field-staff are likely to require regular access to the database and
access constraints due to limited bandwidth can cause significant processing delay and frustration leading to
time consuming and expensive workarounds.

                                                                                                     45 | P a g e
The New Ireland Social Pension Scheme


        developed a beneficiary database using a volunteer. However, subsequent to the
        departure of the volunteer it has not been possible to resolve issues with the database
        which has resulted in 2014 benefit payment sheets being constructed manually.



5.2.    Risks

The development of a national social protection system has risks.

The ADB review of social safety nets in Pacific Island countries noted: “Hastily implemented
programmes seldom reach their intended target groups, incur excessive costs and have other
unplanned results. This is because governments often lack the information, resources and
institutional capacity to implement such programmes rapidly and effectively.” The review also
noted: “Poorly designed social safety nets run the risk of setting up perverse incentives; at their
worst, they can set up opportunities for fraud, political capture, or poverty traps, or simply waste
resources” (ADB, 2010, p. 18).

These risks can be reduced to two key risks: program failure and multiple and incompatible systems
and processes.



a) Programme failure
There is a significant risk of programme failure. This can take two forms:

Failure to achieve coverage
If the social pension is not implemented appropriately there is a significant risk of failing to
achieve coverage. In addition the New Ireland programme appears to have experienced gender bias
toward male recipients.

Funding over-run
Conversely there is a significant risk of cost over-run. This can occur in respect to operating costs if
scheme operations are not established effectively. More significantly though there is a serious risk
of substantial cost over-run if eligibility and verification are not managed carefully. Eligibility for
participation in the social pension should not be based on personal judgment, but on robust,
auditable criteria which are consistently applied across a known population.

At this time reasonable estimates can be made of the likely population which would be eligible for
the old age pension. However, other than the application of global averages, there is no basis for
the estimation of the likely disabled population in Papua New Guinea. If not carefully implemented
there is a risk the scheme could become effectively an open cheque-book.

It is considered there is a higher risk of program failure for the disability pension than the old age
pension. This risk is closely linked to the assessment modality, in particular if the assessment of
disability is undertaken ad hoc (as is currently the case with the New Ireland social pension). This is
likely to lead to either high levels of exclusion error – or high levels of inclusion error due to poor
assessment, inconsistent assessment and (possibly) bias in respect to assessment. Objective and
consistent assessment by trained personnel, using standard criteria is required.




                                                                                            46 | P a g e
The New Ireland Social Pension Scheme


b) Multiple and incompatible processes and systems
That Papua New Guinea is a diverse society, with a challenging geography, is a truism. Failure to
develop systems and processes which are able to manage effectively within this diverse and
complex environment is likely to result in the emergence of multiple systems and processes, which
may be incompatible, difficult to scale, and difficult to oversee centrally.

One of the most effective means of ensuring efficiency and control can be maintained in a diverse
environment is to give priority to the development of a robust and standardised information systems
environment, using a common architecture, with development controlled centrally. This will ensure
the information systems architecture is closely linked to common documented and auditable
systems and processes.

If an appropriate architecture is developed, an effective combination of central control and local
operations can be achieved. If an appropriate architecture is not developed the operational
environment may become gridlocked due to an inflexible operating environment, or control will be
undermined and the national social pension may become a series of inefficiently managed, locally
interpreted social transfers, with a related increased risk of fraud and fund misappropriation



5.3.    High-level Road Map

The following high-level steps are recommended to implement the old age pension and disability
pension. However, this review has been undertaken prior to the completion and circulation of the
strategy for the national social pension. The discussion regarding the implications of the findings for
the roll-out of the national social pension is, therefore, preliminary.

The suggested high-level road map is based on the progressive implementation of the old age
pension and the development of capacity to implement the disability pension, with the subsequent
implementation of the disability pension. A time line has not been included at this time.

a) Programme Design


The review recommends the Department for Community Development consider sequential roll
out of the two components of the national social pension, with an initial focus on developing
capability to roll out the age pension and the progressive development of capacity to develop and
manage a disability pension.



b) Old Age Pension

1. Finalise the Old Age Pension Programme Design
It is important that the design of the old-age pension must be completed prior to detailed
development of systems and processes. It is suggested the parameters of the old age and disability
pension are finalised sequentially as the determination of the parameters of the disability pension
may take time to finalise. Following the finalisation of programme design, the drafting of policy and
enabling legislation can be completed.




                                                                                           47 | P a g e
The New Ireland Social Pension Scheme


2. Determine the budget and funding for the Old Age Pension
Costings have yet to be developed for the progressive roll-out of the old age pension. Full
implementation costings have been developed for the old age component of the national pension,
with eligibility at 60 or 65 years and a monthly payment of K30 and K60.



3. Undertake a baseline study in New Ireland
In order to determine the welfare and social impact of the programme and to provide a baseline
for the implementation of the national social pension, it is recommended a provincially
representative baseline study is undertaken in New Ireland Province. The study should be able to
provide a baseline for elderly New Ireland residents who are not in receipt of the social pension, in
addition to residents who are in receipt of the pension. The study can then be replicated as the
programme is rolled out in other Provinces. The baseline survey will form a basis for subsequent
programme monitoring and evaluation.



4. Further develop the New Ireland programme
The recommended enhancements are, with the exception of the separation of the old age and
disability pensions into two programmes, primarily operational.

The enhancement of the New Ireland old age pension provides an opportunity to trial a range of
programme enhancements in order to determine a final pension design. It is recommended
consideration be given to developing several variants of the old age pension modality (for example
enrolment processes, payment frequency, payment amount, linkage to other social protection
programmes) and testing these in New Ireland.



5. Strengthen the Department for Community Development capacity to implement the social pension
An assessment of DfCD capacity (central and Provincial) will be required, both at the Head Office
in Port Moresby and at the Provincial Offices selected for the initial implementation of the social
pension. The Department for Community Development is implementing several major programs: the
National ID programme in conjunction with the National Statistics Office, the redevelopment and
decentralization of the Civil Registry, the implementation of the social pension. Capacity to
implement the social pension nationally is limited. Provincially, there is (with the exception of New
Ireland Province) either very limited or no capacity in the Provinces to implement a social pension.
DfCD capacity will require significant strengthening.

Resource planning and an operational architecture will be required which allows for the
progressive growth of resourcing as the social pension is deployed nationally. It is recommended
this is structured progressively:

       Determine the requirements at Provincial level, using New Ireland as a basis
       Determine central requirements to support the initial set of Provinces
       Progressively develop capacity as further provinces added.

is suggested an appropriately skilled and experienced project manager be employed to lead the
implementation of the social pension (refer Appendix Four for the draft Terms of Reference). In
addition to the project manager it is recommended the following initial resources will be contracted/
recruited:

                                                                                          48 | P a g e
The New Ireland Social Pension Scheme


       IT specialists: to develop the systems architecture, operating platform and database (both
        front end and back end) in conjunction with the government computing service
       Payments specialist: Whilst electronic payment is recommended as basis for payment, it
        may not be possible to implement a single national architecture due to environmental
        complexity and development of telecommunications and payments systems and payments
        systems interoperability
       Documentation specialist: The development of the old age pension (and disability pension)
        will require the development of operational processes. These will need to be documented
        as standard operating procedures (SoP). Specialist resource will be required to draft the SoP
       HR specialist: (including training): A large number of staff will need to be recruited and
        trained. Standard roles will need to be defined, standard and objective selection criteria
        determined. Staff will also need to be trained to implement the SoP
       Audit specialist: to develop the audit cycle and programme for beneficiaries and payments
        systems
       Disability pension specialist: to finalise the design of the disability pension may be required

It is recommended that, if it deemed is necessary to recruit international specialists in order to
develop initial organisational capacity, local counterparts are also hired with the intention of
developing sustainable organisational and management capacity.



6. Document Policy, Procedures and Processes
There is currently no documentation or Standard Operating Procedures to support the old age
(and disability) programmes. The development of documentation is a significant task which will
take time to complete. Documentation will need to include inter alia:
     Pension policy
     Age verification protocols and protocols for the determination of death.
     Payments protocols
     Application and operational processes
     Grievance processes



7. Develop database and systems
The development of appropriate systems architecture and database capability is fundamental to
the success of the social protection programme. The issues with the New Ireland database are a
constraint to further development of the old age and disability programme in New Ireland. If not
defined carefully there is a risk of multiple systems which cannot communicate and which are
difficult to upgrade. The example of the Department of Social Welfare in Fiji is illustrative of the
issues which can arise and which can be very difficult (but possible) to resolve, if sustainable and
appropriate systems architecture is not implemented.

It is recommended the Department for Community Development implement a single database,
which can be accessed locally. The database will need to enable progressive roll-out of the social
pension and the introduction of new programmes over time. Once implemented, the New Ireland
database will need to be migrated to the central database. Consideration will also need to be given
to the network architecture. The experience of the Civil Registry in implementing the
decentralization of the registry may provide insight into the architecture required for the social
pension system.

                                                                                          49 | P a g e
The New Ireland Social Pension Scheme




8. Determine the Provincial Roll-out Programme
At this time it is not possible to determine the provincial implementation programme. Roll-out will
be contingent of the willingness of provinces to participate in the social pension and Provincial
capacity to implement the programme.

It is recommended an assessment model is developed in order to determine Provincial capacity to
implement to the social pension. The model will need to include assessment of:
       Telecommunications capacity
       Payment systems capacity (related to telecommunications capacity)
       Provincial operational capacity

It is recommended that the decision to implement in a province be contingent on payment and
telecommunications capacity being adequate. Provincial capacity can be developed, however
payment systems capacity must be in place prior to the commencement of enrolment and the
payment of benefits (assuming a policy decision is made to require electronic payment).

It is recommended the Provincial roll-out programme include the following activities:
       A baseline study prior to implementation
       Development of operational infrastructure
       Recruitment and training of Provincial Community Development staff
       Implementation and testing of the database of information technology platform
       Community awareness raising
       Commencement of enrolment

If continuous enrolment is used, implementation of the social pension in Provinces will be able to be
undertaken progressively.



b) Additional activities to implement the Disability Pension


In addition to the activities required to develop the capacity to develop, implement and manage the
national social pension, commencing with the old age pension, there are several additional activities
which will be required in order to develop the disability pension.

1. Define disability and develop a protocol for disability assessment
The design of the disability pension has yet to be finalised. In particular, a workable definition of
disability and the protocol for assessing disability have yet to be determined.



2. Undertake a prevalence study of disability in Papua New Guinea
The extent of disability in Papua New Guinea is, at present, poorly understood. It is therefore
difficult to determine the likely scope and funding requirement for a disability pension. It is
recommended that, following the determination of a definition of disability, a study of the
prevalence of disability in Papua New Guinea is undertaken to the number of disabled persons likely
to be covered by the disability pension.




                                                                                          50 | P a g e
The New Ireland Social Pension Scheme


3. Determine the budget and funding for the Disability Pension
The cost of the disability pension is likely to be significantly higher than the cost of the old age
pension, both operationally and in respect to programme funding. The costs associated with age
verification (assuming documentary verification) will be borne by the applicant. However, it is likely
the cost of disability assessment will need to be borne by the State.

It is considered likely the Department for Community Development will need to work with the
Department of Health and disability support agencies to finalise the definition of disability,
programme parameters, the disability assessment protocol and the operational processes for the
assessment of disability. At this time it is not possible to determine the process by which disability
will be assessed. Capacity to assess disability in Papua New Guinea is, at present, inadequate54. It is,
however, recommended that disability assessment be undertaken by suitably skilled personnel. It is
considered unlikely Ward Councilors will have the skill necessary to assess disability.

 Appendix One: Dataset used to Estimate of Old Age and Disability Pension Coverage

 In order to develop an estimate of programme coverage, an initial analysis has been undertaken to
 determine the likely coverage of both the old age and disability components of the pension
 programme. The analysis has been undertaken using currently available data. The findings are
 tentative55.

i.    Development of dataset
  A dataset was constructed using the payment spreadsheets for 2012, 2013 and 2014 (year to date).
  The Provincial Government provided spreadsheets for seven LLGs (refer Table 7). Data was not
  provided for two LLGs (Tikana and Konoagil). 2014 payments data was not available for LLGs other
  than Namatanai and Murat. Namatanai data was only available for 2014.

 The following process was used to create the dataset

      1. Individual LLG payment sheets were merged to create a consolidated dataset of 13291
         discrete records.
      2. Additional variables were added (refer Table 8)
      3. Two data sets were then created: a dataset of payments by beneficiary by year and a
         dataset of unique beneficiary records.




 55
    In order to undertake a comprehensive analysis, the complete database will need to be accessible and
 current (2014) beneficiaries validated.

                                                         receipt of the payment


 The payments dataset was used to analyse receipt of the pension. The dataset of unique records
 was used to examine beneficiary characteristics and coverage.



ii.    Unique Records
   The annual beneficiary payments data cannot be used to determine the extent to which the likely
   beneficiary population is receiving a pension payment as the number of beneficiaries is recalculated
   each year. The variance in the number of beneficiaries is greater than the estimated population
   change. This suggests that changes in the number of beneficiaries receiving a payment are likely to
   result primarily from listing rather than eligibility.

 The beneficiary record for each of the years 2012-2014 was used to create a set of unique
 beneficiary records. The assumption underpinning the development of a single set of records was
 that, over time it is likely more beneficiaries will be captured, even if they are not captured each
 year. The likely beneficiary count will be slightly overstated as there is no way of knowing whether
 beneficiaries who are not recorded in subsequent years have died. Nevertheless the set of unique
 records is considered to be a reasonable basis for approximating the number of beneficiaries and the
 characteristics of the benefit recipients for the seven LLGs for which data was available.

 Beneficiaries do not have a unique identifier. Unique records were developed by de-duping (family
 name+ given name+DoB+ location). The set of unique record therefore comprises the set of
 recipients with a unique name, age and village.

 As noted above, there are two LLG’s for which there no data was available. It was assumed the two
 LLG’s for which data was not available are likely to have a beneficiary population similar to the
 average of the seven LLGs for which data was available. The average number of beneficiaries for the
 years 2012-2013 was 8,476. As shown in Table 9, scaling up the number of unique records to
 account for the missing LLGs results in an estimate of 8601 pension recipients; the estimation is
 therefore considered to be reasonable.

iii.     Incomplete Records
    The datasets comprise complete and incomplete records. De-duping the dataset enabled instances
    of incomplete data by year to be corrected. There are, however, records which are not complete.
    There were a very few instances of location or name not being recorded. However, as shown in
    Table 10, there are a significant number of beneficiaries for whom age has not been recorded, in
    particular recipients of the disability pension.

iv.    Old Age Population and Age distribution
   Age was recorded for approximately 85% of old age pension recipients. An age was lower than 60
   was recorded for a 15% of old age pension recipients. It is not known if the age of these recipients
   has been miscoded, or the benefit type has been miscoded. . The age distribution for old age
   pension recipients is shown in Figure 4. Miscoded recipients have been excluded.

Appendix Three: Focus Group Discussions

Several focus groups of beneficiaries were undertaken during the field visit to New Ireland Province.
Focus group discussions were held in three villages. The findings are therefore indicative and data
saturation was not achieved. The focus groups were undertaken with beneficiaries in rural villages.
Four focus groups were held in three villages. Two focus groups were held at villages along the
Boluminski Highway. The villages were between 30 – 45 minutes’ drive from Kavieng. The highway
is sealed and villages have mobile phone access and access to local banking services. Both villages
were next to the highway. The third village visited was on the west coast. The road was not sealed
and there was no readily accessible banking service and no mobile phone tower.

Focus groups were moderated by members of the field-team, with support from New Ireland
Provincial Administration staff involved in the management of the pension programme. The Ward
Councilor and Chairman of the Village Planning Committee were present for two of the villages. The
focus groups and participants are summarized in Table 11.

                     Total                      19          19


Households and sources of income
Few participants stated they lived alone or solely with their spouse. Most participants stated they
lived in households with adult children and school age grandchildren. This appeared to be the most
common domestic arrangement. Typical sources of household income were primary production:
gardening, marketing, copra, oil palm, betel nut, or fishing/ hunting. Some participants stated they
earned income from employment in primary production.

Use to Banking Services
There was a bifurcation in the use of banking services. Nearly all beneficiaries who lived along the
Boluminski highway stated they had bank accounts and regularly used the account and were able to
access their BSP or WBC account at the local store through an ATM or in-store banking. The
ownership and use of a bank account was part of the daily life of these focus group participants.

By contrast, beneficiaries who lived in Lamasmus village on the other side of the island typically
stated they did not own a bank account. The village does not have access to banking services.
Villagers stated the village had not been visited by either BSP or Westpac in the last two years. These
villagers stated they preferred to receive their pension in cash.

Ownership and use of a mobile phone
All participants in villages along the Boluminski Highway owned and used mobile phones, mostly for
making and receiving phone calls. Most participants in Lamasmus village did not own a mobile
phone. More men than women reported ownership of a mobile phone.

Appendix Four: Draft Terms of Reference for Social Pension Project Manager

                         Social Protection Project Management Specialist
                    Department of Community Development, Papua New Guinea

Background

The Department of Community Development is developing social protection in Papua New Guinea.
The development of social protection will commence with the development of a social safety net. It
is expected there will be two initial components to the social safety net: a universal old age pension
and a disability pension. It is intended the implementation of the social pension will commence with
the development of the old age pension. The social protection policy, and within this context the old
age and disability policy is currently being developed by the Department for Community
Development.

Papua New Guinea does not currently have a social protection system. An old age pension and
disability pension have been implemented in New Ireland Province. The New Ireland programme is
currently being enhanced with the intention the programme will become a pilot for the national
programme.

The implementation of the social pension in Papua New Guinea poses unique challenges. In addition
to currently limited operational capacity to develop, implement and manage a social pension, Papua
New Guinea has a very diverse social environment and a challenging physical environment.
Implementation of the social pension will therefore require the de novo development of operational
capacity which spans all aspects of the development, implementation and management of a cash
transfer based social safety net, both centrally in Port Moresby and in each of the twenty-two
provincial-level divisions in Papua New Guinea. The development of the social pension will be
undertaken within a context of rapidly developing payment systems, telecommunications and
information technology capacity.

In order to support the Department of Community Development, a suitably skilled and experienced
project manager is sought. The project manager will lead the implementation of the social pension
in Papua New Guinea and will work alongside a national counterpart. It is expected the national
counterpart will progressively assume responsibility for the ongoing management of the social
protection programme in Papua New Guinea.

Responsibilities

The role is not responsible for social protection policy.

The key responsibilities are operational. The project manager will report to [the Deputy Secretary]
and will be accountable for:

1) The development of both Head Office and Provincial operational capacity, including:
       o All operational systems and processes
       o Information systems and databases [in conjunction with the Government Computing
          Service] required to manage the programme
       o Payment systems (electronic transfer payment modalities will be used) required to
          effect payment to beneficiaries
       o Development and documentation of Standard Operating Procedures
       o Development of the audit programme

                                                                                         58 | P a g e
The New Ireland Social Pension Scheme


       o   Determination of Head Office and Provincial staffing, and the selection and training of
           staff
       o   Implementation of a workable and effective monitoring and reporting system to
           measure the timeliness and quality of outputs
       o   Liaison with government agencies, CSOs, donor organization and the Bank of PNG to
           optimize synergies and collaboration to achieve the intended results.


2) Management of the progressive roll out of the old age pension and subsequently the disability
   pension
      o Development of the national roll-out program including time-lines, budget, inputs
           required, staffing and performance indicators
      o Progressive roll-out in each of the twenty-two provincial-level locations


Duration and Contract Modality

The post is for a fixed term of [three years] with no expectation of extension. The successful
applicant will be contracted as a consultant by the Department of Community Development. The
incumbent will be based at the Department in Port Moresby and is expected to travel frequently
within Papua New Guinea.

Qualifications

An advanced tertiary qualification in an appropriate discipline coupled with a minimum of 10 years’
experience in large-scale social protection project management. Papua New Guinea has a very
diverse cultural environment. The project manager must be able to work successfully in this
environment. Knowledge of socio-economic issues in PNG which includes various vulnerable groups,
in particular women, and the strategies employed to address these are important to this role.

Competencies:

   o   Highly developed communication skills in English.
   o   Highly developed cross-cultural communication and interaction skills, including with
       international consultants and rural and low income households.
   o   Demonstrated ability to develop organisational operational capacity in multiple locations and
       implement social protection programmes in a complex environment.
   o   Experience at working in Pacific Island countries would be an advantage


Working Style:

   o   Able to work in a complex environment and to manage uncertainty
   o   Ability to work collaboratively both within the organisation and across organisations
   o   A strong commitment to the capacity development of national staff
   o   Integrity and high ethical standards
   o   Cultural, gender, religion, race, nationality and age sensitivity and adaptability




                                                                                        59 | P a g e
