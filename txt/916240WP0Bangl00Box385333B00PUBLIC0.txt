World Bank Group – Bangladesh Partnership: Country Program Snapshot


Overview

Progress has continued in Bangladesh on reducing extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity
through human development and employment generation. This needs to be further consolidated in the
near-term by sustaining Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and remittances growth recovery, creating jobs,
containing inflation, and making progress on improving the quality of service delivery in health and
education. To sustain growth in the near- and medium-term, private investments need to increase
significantly. At the same time, the quality of public investment needs to be substantially enhanced to
alleviate the infrastructure constraints on private investments and to expand service delivery. Moving
forward in the immediate future, stronger attention is needed to (i) swiftly complete the transition in the
garment industry, (ii) finish the critical ongoing road development projects, (iii) enact the Public Private
Partnership (PPP) law, and (iv) award contracts to build Special Economic Zones (SEZs).

Commendable progress on poverty reduction and shared prosperity. There is no survey-based evidence
on what has happened to poverty since 2010. But most simulations done by the Planning Commission suggest
poverty incidence is likely to have declined to less than 25 percent in FY14, compared with 31.5 percent in
FY10.1 Employment and wage growth are likely to have boosted shared prosperity—i.e. increased the income
of the bottom 40 percent. According to the U.N. Development Program’s Human Development Report for
2014, Bangladesh has graduated from the Low Human Development (LHD) category to the Medium Human
Development (MHD) category. The challenge now is consolidating its position by accelerating economic
growth in an inclusive and sustainable manner.

Growth recovery has begun with the return of political stability. Economic activities in FY14 suffered
setbacks due to political turmoil and declines in remittances and the private investment rate. However, the
Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics provisionally estimated FY14 GDP growth at 6.1 percent, compared with six
percent the previous year. Increased agriculture and service sector growth outweighed the decrease in
industrial growth. How growth in FY14 (a very abnormal year) exceeded growth in FY13 (a relatively normal
year) is not well understood.

Inflation is still high but stable. Overall consumer inflation increased to 7.4 percent in FY14 from 6.8
percent in FY13, driven by an increase in food prices. Part of the rise was due to supply disruptions caused by
the political unrest of late 2013. The gap between rural and urban food inflation narrowed. Stable
international oil prices and prudent monetary management helped reduce non-food inflation from 9.2
percent in FY13 to 5.5 percent in FY14.

Foreign exchange reserve accumulation has continued despite remittance declines in FY14. Despite a
lower trade deficit, reflecting a rise in export growth, the current account surplus narrowed last fiscal year
because of a 1.6 percent decline in remittances. The overall balance of payment surplus increased from $5.1
billion in FY13 to about $5.5 billion in FY14, creating an upward pressure on the nominal exchange rate. The
Bangladesh Bank (BB) remained active on the buying side of the foreign exchange market to prevent any
significant nominal exchange rate appreciation, although the real effective exchange rate has appreciated by
8.5 percent. BB interventions perpetuated foreign exchange reserve build up, reaching over $21 billion by
mid-September, which is equal to over six months of imports.

Monetary management remained on course. Monetary management was challenged by fast reserve
accumulation, but the Bangladesh Bank managed to keep reserve and broad money growth within target by
stepping up sterilization operations. BB’s net domestic assets and reserve money targets were met. Private

sector credit growth remained subdued, reflecting both the impact of lingering political uncertainty and the
reluctance of bankers to extend loans due to a high level of non-performing loans. With comfortable banking
sector liquidity, deposit and lending rates have declined. BB raised the banks’ cash reserve ratio by 50 basis
points to 6.5 percent in late June 2014.

Credit and risk management status in the banking sector is unsatisfactory. Asset quality in the state-
owned commercial banks deteriorated in FY14. While their aggregate stock of assets and share in the total
assets of the banking system has declined, deposits continued to grow at a healthy rate, thus ensuring
adequate liquidity. High liquidity levels are also reflected in below average loan to deposit ratios. The
Bangladesh Bank has begun implementing the new provisions related to lending and banks’ exposure to stock
markets.

Fiscal policy plagued by revenue collection and development budget implementation shortfall.
Overall, the fiscal deficit in FY14 has been kept in check despite underperformance in tax collections due to
weak imports and slow economic activity. Public debt as a share of GDP has remained on a downward path.
The overall FY15 budget deficit target is less than 5 percent of GDP, notwithstanding somewhat ambitious
revenue targets. While the fuel subsidy has declined, there has been little visible improvement in the quality
of Annual Development Program (ADP) implementation. Yet the size of ADP in FY15 is envisaged to increase
by 34 percent relative to the FY14 revised ADP.

Good progress in the garment industry, but the overall pace of structural reforms is slow. While the
fourth review of the IMF’s Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement has been successfully completed, the
pace of structural reforms has remained slow. Significant progress has been made towards improving
conditions for factory workers, including amendments to the labor and export processing zone (EPZ) laws,
capacity building of the government in assessing factory safety, and agreement on common standards to
assess structural building safety. Speedier progress is needed in the implementation of the new value-added
tax (VAT) law, liberalization of exchange regulations, infrastructure management and financial supervision.

Growth and inflation outlook is favorable. Growth for FY15 is projected at 6.2 percent, with positive
indications including political stability since early January, signs of an uptick in remittance inflows from last
year’s decline of less than two percent, continued strength in exports if compliance reforms are speedily
implemented, and buoyant consumption. Key factors for sustaining growth are macroeconomic stability,
better governance in the banking system, development of markets for long term finance, further trade
liberalization, and stronger attention to efficient implementation of infrastructure investments with
necessary institutional changes relating to regulation and policy formulation. Underlying inflationary
pressures, as reflected in non-food inflation, are expected to maintain a downward trend on continued policy
restraint. Achieving this will depend on international price trends as well as domestic supply conditions and
macroeconomic policies.

Moving forward, stronger attention is needed to swiftly complete the transition in garments, finish
the critical ongoing road development projects, enact the PPP law and award contracts for building
Special Economic Zones.

In garments, much more needs to be done for effective implementation of wage increases and the new
labor legislation, recruiting more factory inspectors and completing building inspections, followed by
swift remediation measures such as relocation of closed factories. So far, inspections have been completed in
about 50 percent of factories, resulting in 17 of them being closed. Non-availability of land, gas and electricity
as well as the reluctance of workers to move to new locations have emerged as major impediments to
relocation.

There is also a need to focus on speedy completion of transformational ongoing projects in the road
and energy sectors, particularly the Dhaka-Chittagong and Dhaka-Mymensingh highway; Double Tracking of
Dhaka-Chittagong Railway; the Padma Bridge; the Dhaka metro rail, and the two Bibiyana gas field based
large power plants.. The government should prioritize the most transformative projects and provide all
necessary resources for completion within a specified timeline.

    The government also should enact the PPP law and equip the PPP office with staff having knowledge
    and experience in developing, negotiating and supervising public-private partnership projects. A
    proper legal framework providing internationally attractive guidelines and incentive policies is essential.
    PPP cannot be managed as a part of the day-to-day bureaucracy.

    In addition, there is an urgent need for the government to finalize the awarding of contracts for the
    economic zones proposed to be developed under the Bangladesh Economic Zone Authority while
    ensuring the related services such as power, gas, good road-connectivity, and security are available on the
    developed land.

Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity
Commendable progress on poverty reduction. There is no survey based evidence on what has happened
to poverty since 2010. 2 However, it is reasonable to assume that the sustained GDP growth rate in excess of 6
percent, a decent 3.3 percent agricultural growth and remittance growth of 6.7 percent on average since 2010
contributed to maintaining the 1.74 percentage point annual decline observed during 2000-2010. There has
also been corresponding improvements in several social indicators such as life expectancy and the fertility
rate. Poverty incidence based on Bangladesh’s national poverty line is projected to have declined to 2 4.47
percent by 2014. 3 The UNDP’s Human Development Report 2014 finds a significant decline in Bangladesh's
Multidimensional Poverty Index from 0.292 in 2007 to 0.237 in 2011. 4 This remarkable progress in poverty
reduction is attributable to decline in the population growth rate and a changing age structure, increase in
labor income, internal and external migration, improved connectivity and the government’s targeted safety
net program.5

The income of the bottom 40 percent is likely to have continued to increase because of increased
employment and wages. Total domestic employment is estimated to have increased from 51.9 million in
FY10 to 56.5 million in FY13. The shortfall in GDP growth relative to the Sixth Plan target reduced the overall
domestic job creation, but manpower exports abroad more than compensated. As a result, the total number of
additional labor who found employment in the domestic market or abroad exceeded the number added to the
labor force. Consequently, the unemployment rate is likely to have decreased. Agricultural real wages have
continued to increase.6

Consolidating the gains in human development and moving further up remain as big challenges which
Bangladesh needs to tackle relentlessly. In the Human Development Index 2013, Bangladesh's ranking
improved by one step relative to 2012.7 Bangladesh graduated from Low Human Development (LHD)
category to Medium Human Development (MHD) category. In 2012, Bangladesh was below Congo, Solomon
Islands, Sao Tome and Kenya at the top of 45 LHD category countries. In 2013, Congo, Sao Tome and
Bangladesh graduated to MHD, with Bangladesh ranking third from the bottom in this list. Countries like
Nepal, Kenya, Pakistan, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Ethiopia continued to be in the LHD category.

      Poverty measurement cannot properly be done without collecting household consumption data throughout a year
      so that seasonal effects do not distort the measurements. BBS is considering increasing the frequency of
      household income and expenditure surveys, but has so far not been able to ensure a sustainable source of
      funding for such surveys.

      The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and income indices
      used to rank countries into four tiers of human development. It is a summary measure of average achievement
      in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent
      standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions.

Bangladesh graduated despite an increase in the cutoff point for the MHD category from 0.535 in 2013
to 0.550 in the 2014 index. It surpassed not only last year's cutoff point but also its increase this year. This
testifies the robustness of the magnitude of increase in Bangladesh's HDI 2013 score relative to HDI 2012.
Bangladesh’s recent progress has been impressive on both gross national income (GNI) per capita and life
expectancy (Table-1).

GNI per capita has grown rapidly because of growth in GDP per capita and remittance per capita.
Sustained acceleration of GDP growth, declining population growth rate and continued growth of the stock of
Bangladeshis working abroad contributed to growth in GNI and remittance per capita. Most recent research
evidence reconfirms that remittances contribute significantly to poverty reduction – directly by augmenting
the income of the receiving families and indirectly by contributing to local level development. 8

Bangladesh has made impressive gains in the health Millennium Development Goals, increasing the
odds of surviving through childhood and pregnancy and controlling the burden of communicable
disease. The health sector (government and NGO providers) has continually incorporated proven cost-
effective interventions, which have contributed to the impact of health services. The development of a highly
pluralistic health system environment characterized by the participation of a multiplicity of different
stakeholders and agents and by ad hoc, diffused forms of management has contributed to these outcomes by
creating conditions for rapid change.9 With donor support, the government has focused attention on
expanding access to services and strengthening governance.

Bangladesh has improved access and completion at all levels of education, especially at the primary
level. As a result of massive expansion of supply, targeted stipends to bring the poorest and girls into schools
and continued investments in education, Bangladesh achieved almost universal access in primary education.
The primary net enrollment rate (NER) is most recently reported as 93 percent. Enrollment in pre-primary is
low at 23 percent (2009). Primary, lower secondary and secondary education completion have systematically
increased over time. In 2010, 36 percent of people aged 41–50 had completed primary education; the figure
among people aged 15–19 was 76 percent, indicating that the share of primary school completers had more
than doubled in 30 years.10
Still, the health and education systems remain challenged on the governance front, particularly in holding
civil service employees accountable for performance. The strong centralization of authorities and decision-
making is considered a reason. There is therefore no reason for complacency. Bangladesh made it to MHD
category before (2007 for instance), but later slipped back due to both methodological changes and
slowdown in progress on human development. A recent International Labor Organization (ILO) report finds
that 53.4 percent of youth leave primary school before completion. 11 The combined effects of the ongoing
demographic transition and the growing labor force participation of women is increasing the size and share

Return of political stability spurs growth recovery. During the first half of FY14, the Bangladesh economy
weathered severe disruption in production, transport and service delivery. The second half was remarkably
stable, although political uncertainties lingered on, resulting in a deceleration in private investment growth
that constrained the transmission of the relative macroeconomic stability into higher economic growth.
Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) provisionally estimated FY14 GDP growth at 6.1 per cent (Figure-1).
Most analysts expected the economic growth in FY2014 to be between 5.5-6.0 percent in view of political
unrest in the first half of the fiscal year and the trends of associated growth correlates (Box 1). 12



                                                Box 1: The Growth Debate
The consensus forecast earlier was that GDP growth in FY14 would dip below six percent. These forecasts were based on a storyline
that hinged on weak growth in private consumption and stagnant or even declining private investments. These two components
account for nearly 93 percent of GDP.
BBS data reaffirmed the composition of growth scenario sketched on the basis of proxy indicators and anecdotal evidence. Yet the
bottom-line is very different. Growth is estimated to have been higher than last year despite declining private consumption and
investment rates. Part of the explanation may be an over-estimated public investment, amounting to 986 billion taka (more than $12
billion) in FY14.

BBS estimates public investment from budget data. The public investment data reported in the national accounts show large variance
from the government budget. Not all government expenditures classified as “capital” expenditures (recapitalization of state o wned
banks, for instance) constitute creation of real wealth. Such capital expenditures are not investment expenditures from a national
point of view. The items constituting investment expenditures (based on the revised FY14 budget) amount at best to 510 billion taka
(about $6.5 billion). This leaves unexplained 476 billion taka (more than $5 billion) that could be attributed to investments by public
enterprises and local governments from own sources. Most large public enterprises run an operational deficit. Local governments
rely on central government transfers to meet their operating and investment costs. It is therefore difficult to see how the public
enterprises and local governments could possibly fund such large investments, equivalent to 3.5 percent of GDP, from their own
sources.

It is possible that the proxies and methods used to estimate production and expenditures work well in a normal year, but fail to
capture the impact of disruptions in an abnormal year.


According to BBS, growth was driven by the industry sector, notwithstanding a decline in industrial
growth from 9.6 percent in FY13 to 8.4 per cent in FY14. Industrial growth decline reflected slower growth of
manufacturing from 10.3 percent in FY13 to 8.7 percent in FY14. The construction sector registered a growth

rate of 8.6 percent, the highest in the last five years despite prolonged disruption in activities in the first half
due to hartals, or labor actions, and blockades. Agriculture growth is projected to have improved to 3.4
percent from 2.5 percent in the previous year. This is not implausible, given good harvests of aman and aus
rice.

The biggest surprise is the growth rate estimated for the services sector, which increased to 5.8 percent
in FY14 from 5.5 percent in FY13. All the nine sub-sectors are projected to have grown at a higher rate
relative to FY13. Political turmoil affected the services sector most badly, yet the BBS estimates show a
significant improvement in the performance of sectors that were presumably more adversely affected by
political unrest - land transport, wholesale and retail trade, hotel and restaurant and real estate, renting and
business activities.

On the expenditure side, the share of private consumption in GDP declined by about 1.5 percentage
points, while the share of private investment declined by 0.36 percentage points (Figure-2). Remittances
declined by 1.6 percent (Figure-3). The public investment rate on the other hand increased from 6.6 percent
of GDP in FY13 to 7.3 percent of GDP in FY14. The deficit in external resource balance (export minus import)
in FY14 shrank significantly, with an increase in export-GDP ratio from 19.5 percent in FY13 to 19.8 percent
in FY14 while the import-GDP ratio declined from 26.8 percent to 25.2 percent. National savings stagnated at
30.5 percent, although still 1.85 percentage points higher than the domestic investment rate. The excess of
national savings over investments reflect weaknesses in the domestic investment climate. Bangladesh is not
able to redeploy its entire national savings in the domestic economy. An emerging economy like Bangladesh
is expected to have deficit in its current account driven by strong imports of capital machinery and
intermediate inputs. While imports appear to have recovered relative to last year, the growth rate is still in
single digits, a significant part of which came from increase in food and other consumer goods imports.

The FY15 budget has set a very ambitious 7.3 percent growth target. Achieving that will require the total
investment to GDP ratio to rise by over five percentage points—from 28.7 percent in FY14 to 33.8 percent
(new 2005/06 base). This cannot happen without a major rise in the private investment rate. The other
source of growth could be increased capacity utilization, but the potential is limited. According to the recently
released Enterprise Survey (ES) 2013 by the IFC, Bangladeshi manufacturing firms report very high levels of
capacity utilization. Average capacity utilization for Bangladesh is 84 percent, while the average for 122
countries with ES data is 73 percent. 13 Labor productivity increases in Bangladesh historically come mostly
from capital accumulation. Total factor productivity (TFP) growth has remained rather small. Findings of an
Asian Development Bank (ADB) study also suggest that the gap between actual output and estimated
potential output is small.14

Inflation is still high but stable. Overall inflation increased to 7.4 percent in FY14 relative to 6.8 percent in
FY13, driven largely by an increase in food inflation (Figure-4). For the first time in FY14, year-on-year
inflation came down below seven percent in June, but the average for the whole year has exceeded the seven-
percent target. Food inflation increased in FY14 while non-food inflation declined. These were closely linked
with the political turmoil experienced in the first half of FY14. The food supply chain was severely disrupted
due to nation-wide and regional strikes (hartals) and blockades. At the same time, non-food inflation declined
in the face of lower domestic demand. In addition, the exchange rate of the taka currency was stable and
broad money growth declined.

The rising trend of food inflation towards the end of FY14 is largely explained by the higher retail
price of rice. Indeed, during the harvest season of boro, rice prices at retail level were significantly higher
than the same period in the previous year. The widening gap between wholesale and retail rice and flour
prices after January 2014 suggests that middlemen in the food distribution network may have raised their
margins to make up for losses during the disruptions. One notable feature of recent food inflation is the
narrowing gap between rural and urban food inflation. The higher rural food inflation could be due to higher
purchasing power due to rural wage growth and expanded safety net coverage. 15

Non-food inflation declined from 9.2 percent in FY13 to 5.5 percent in FY14. The decline encompassed
all sub-categories of non-food inflation—clothing and footwear, rent and lighting, household equipment,
transport and communication, medical care, and recreation and entertainment. It therefore looks very much
like a demand-driven phenomena in which remittance decline, a slow pace of economic activity due to
uncertainties and structural bottlenecks, and prudent monetary management contributed. Stability in global
oil prices helped contain the cost-push to non-food inflation.

The exchange rate has remained stable at between 77-78 taka per U.S. dollar in recent months, while
the difference between the unofficial market rate and the inter-bank rate has remained very small, indicating
a very stable foreign exchange market. The difference between the Real Effective Exchange Rate based
nominal rate and the inter-bank rate has shrunk in recent weeks, indicating that the nominal exchange rate is
in line with the economic fundamentals. BB’s interventions in the foreign exchange market have limited the
loss of external competitiveness by stemming any significant nominal appreciation of the taka. However,
because of a small nominal appreciation and higher domestic inflation, the real effective exchange rate
appreciated by 8.5 percent in FY14 relative to FY13. 17

Monetary management remained on course. BB succeeded in keeping the FY14 broad money and reserve
money growth below target rates of 17 percent and 16.2 percent respectively. Broad money growth slowed to
16.1 percent while reserve money growth increased to 15.5 percent relative to FY13. BB had to contain
growth of net domestic assets to counter the overshooting of target for net foreign asset growth. Private
sector credit growth remained subdued at 12.3 percent (Figure-6). Policy rates were not changed despite
pressures from stakeholders. With ample liquidity created by BB purchase of foreign exchange, sterilization
operations had to be stepped up, which adversely affected BB profitability. To mitigate the rise in BB’s
interest costs, the Cash Reserve Requirement was increased from six percent to 6.5 percent in June 2014 after
more than three years. BB conducted Treasury bill auctions regularly. With excess liquidity, the T-bills were
in high demand, which resulted in declining interest rates on instruments of all maturities. Weak private

                     Weak corporate governance, especially in state-owned banks, leads to sub-optimal
                     loan decisions. The government passed the Bank Company (Amendment) Bill, 2013,
                     amending key provisions in order to improve good governance and bring discipline
                     in the banking sector. Bangladesh Bank’s supervisory and regulatory capacity is still
                     weak (compliance based instead of risk based) and this needs to be strengthened to
                     improve efficiency and stability of the banking sector. Another critical issue is the
                     high cost of finance, as well as the low level of access to finance for small and medium
                     enterprises (SMEs) and agriculture. Access to affordable finance is identified as one
                     of the top four obstacles for doing business (2013 Doing Business report). In
                     particular, long term finance (only 19 percent of total lending in June 2013) is
                     limited, particularly for exporters and SMEs, while the financial sector remains
                     ineffective in its capacity to perform its term transformation functions.



The banking sector faces risks due to low capital base in State-owned Commercial Banks (SCBs) that
account for a quarter of the assets of the banking system. Asset quality in the SCBs deteriorated in FY14.
The deterioration reflected both the impact of disruptions caused by political unrest and the lagged effects of
poor lending decisions in the past. With more than 70 percent of financial system assets in the banking
system, banking assets to GDP at 77 percent and deposits to GDP at 60 percent, risks in the SCBs are
systemically significant. Reasons why include:
         Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of the scheduled banks stood at 10.68 percent 18 at the end of June,
             compared to 11.52 percent six months ago.
         Nine banks failed to keep minimum required capital. Their capital shortfall collectively stood at
             119.33 billion taka (about $1.5 billion), which pulled down the overall capital base of the banking
             sector.
         The banking sector faced a capital shortfall of 8.48 billion taka (about $110 million) in the first
             half of 2014 against the required capital of 645.42 billion taka (more than $8 billion).
         Capital shortfall in the SCBs stood at 14.42 billion taka (about $180 million with 8.65 percent
             CAR as of June 30, 2014 while shortfall in the four state-owned specialized banks rose 75.42
             billion taka (more than $950 million) in the first half of 2014 from a shortfall of 63.82 billion taka
             (more than $800 million) as of December 31, 2013. Their CAR was a negative 13.68 percent as of
             June, 2014.

     The average CAR is significantly lower in Bangladesh than other countries in SA like India (14.20 percent),
     Pakistan (15.40 percent) and Sri Lanka (14.50 percent). Banks in Bangladesh hold low level of risk weighted
     assets.

The trade volume improved during January—June of 2014. Average daily turnover reached 6.2 billion
taka (about $80 million) in January 2014, exceeding the 6 billion taka threshold for the first time after
2011, when the average daily turnover was 6.6 billion taka following the 2010 market crash.
Movement in the average daily turnover also was an outcome of the euphoria associated with the January
2014 national election. The average daily turnover started declining from February and reached its lowest at
3.02 billion taka in May 2014. Daily turnover started picking up again from early August and crossed the 6
billion taka mark again on September 4, 2014. Recent episodes of volatility in emerging markets have so far
had negligible impact on Bangladesh’s financial mark ets, with continued strong performance in stock markets
helped by a return of foreign portfolio investment flows.

Bangladesh Bank has begun implementing the new provisions related to lending and the banks’
exposure to stock markets under the amended Banking Companies Act. It has also taken steps to
implement the plans to strengthen the bank resolution and lender of last resort frameworks. The financial
policy for FY14 sought to strengthen credit and debt markets by taking steps to improve corporate
governance and supervisory capacity, stimulate higher demand for government securities, and broaden
financing options. The enhanced authority given to BB over the appointment and dismissal of senior
management in SCBs in the 2013 revisions to the Bank Companies Act has been exercised, providing a clear
signal to the industry. The temporary relaxation of loan classification and provisioning policy introduced

particularly of SCBs, have become non-performing again. BB has set financial improvement plans with the
four SCBs and Basic Bank, which include differential ceilings on loan growth. Debt markets are becoming
active with several recent auctions over-subscribed and a sharp fall in devolvement from 26.6 percent in the
first half of FY14 to 5.3 percent in the second half.

remained on a downward path with external debt at about one half of total public debt.

Having surpassed budgetary targets for three years
in a row prior to FY13, the National Board of Revenue               Figure 11: NBR Revenue Growth (y-o-y, %)
(NBR) faced a revenue shortfall in FY14, when 30
compared to the budget target, for the second 25
straight year (Figure-11). Although tax revenue 20
collection gained some momentum in the second half, it
failed to recover fully from the slowdown experienced in 15
the first half of FY14, resulting in weaker revenue growth 10
relative to FY13 across most revenue categories. As a
                                                            5
result, NBR targets were revised downward in FY14 for
the first time since FY09. Although efforts from non-NBR 0
and non-tax sources have also lagged behind the target
growth in FY14, they maintained performance at 0.3 and            Source: National Board of Revenue
1.8 percent of GDP as in FY13. NBR attempted to boost
tax collection by launching a drive focused on collection of unpaid taxes by tax dodgers and through
resolution of pending tax related disputes in a speedy manner, with limited results.

     This shift in the composition of domestic debt towards costlier non-bank domestic sources is a concern in view
     of interest payments emerging as one of the major sources of non-development expenditures.

Sluggish expenditure growth compensated for a shortfall          30                  Figure 12: Percentage of ADP

(Box 3). The sluggish growth is attributable mainly to low
implementation of the Annual Development Program (ADP)           26
and restraints on subsidies, transfers and net lending.
Progress on the implementation of ADP was slow in the first      24

breakthrough could be achieved in addressing the year-end

There has been inadequate visible improvement in the             18

Implementation is the main challenge in the FY15
budget. The overall FY15 budget deficit target is prudent
(less than five percent of GDP), notwithstanding somewhat
ambitious revenue targets. Revenue-GDP ratio is projected
                                                                      Source: IMED, Ministry of Planning
to increase by over one percentage point. This is not beyond
the realm of possibility since such an increase was achieved
in FY11, but it has been rather rare. The Expenditure-GDP
ratio is projected to increase by about 0.7 percentage
points—slightly less than the 0.8 percentage point annual
increase achieved on average in last five years.

Improving the quality of ADP implementation is difficult when the number of projects keep
increasing. The size of ADP in FY15 is envisaged to increase by 34 percent relative to the FY14 revised ADP.
Usual problems of too many projects with too little allocation have not been addressed. The FY15 ADP
includes 959 new projects in addition to the 1,034 ongoing ones. Of the unapproved new projects, 683 are
proposed to be financed from domestic sources with 276 expected to be funded from external sources. Most
of the unapproved projects are for constructing rural roads, bridges and culverts, and expanding power
distribution lines that are generally undertaken by some ministries and agencies under pressure. Expenditure
on subsidies in FY15 are projected to decline to 260.5 billion taka (about $3.3 billion), compared with 323.8
billion taka (more than $4 billion) in FY14 conditional on upward adjustments in fuel and electricity prices.
The government has committed to provide budgetary transfers of subsidy cost to the state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) on a regular basis and improve financial reporting by SOEs. The government released the full FY14
budget allocation of 134.5 billion taka (about $1.7 billion) to settle part of the past liabilities of Bangladesh
Petroleum Corporation (BPC) and Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) to banks and other
creditors.

                                           Box 3: Fiscal performance deficit in Bangladesh

Despite recent gains, tax collection in Bangladesh remains below that in other Asian countries: Vietnam (24 percent), China (18 percent),
India (15 percent), Nepal (13 percent), and Sri Lanka (13 percent). Bangladesh ranks behind the others in the collection of both direct
and indirect taxes relative to GDP, while its collection of international trade taxes relative to GDP exceeds the others. With comparatively
high nominal tax rates but low revenue yields, Bangladesh’s revenue productivity for personal inc ome tax and the VAT is very low
compared with other countries in its region because of excessive use of a variety of tax incentives, structural flaws in the main taxes, and
weak tax administration.

A similar pattern exists on the expenditure side. In FY13, total public expenditure to GDP ratio in Bangladesh was 16.9 percent,
compared with 26.2 percent in Vietnam, 28 percent in India, 17.2 percent in Nepal, and 19.3 percent in Sri Lanka. Opportunities, policies,
and finance are not the binding constraints on expenditure effectiveness in Bangladesh. The binding constraint is implementation.
According to a recent ADB portfolio review, no less than half the project time elapses by the time 20 percent of funds get released,
primarily because of poor project readiness. Apart from procedural constraints, there is a capacity problem in the planning cell of
executive agencies and line ministries. Delays in procurement and recruitment of consultants remain endemic in infrastructure projects.
Low level of delegation of power in the government approval system also contributes to delays. Resettlement and land acquisition delay
project implementation by 2 to 2.5 years.



Steady implementation of the new VAT and stronger revenue administration will be needed to go
beyond the cyclical recovery in revenue in FY15. Bangladesh will enter FY15 on the heels of a
disappointing revenue performance in FY14. In the FY14 budget, the government set an ambitious revenue
target of 1.36 trillion taka (about $17 billion), which was 25.2 percent higher than the FY13 actual. Achieving
this would have been very challenging even under normal circumstances. Economic slowdown exacerbated
by shutdowns and strikes made its achievement even more difficult, resulting in only 10.5 percent revenue
growth in FY14. The revenue growth slowed across the board, although the deceleration was dominated by
trade based taxes that grew by only 3.2 percent. Both VAT (domestic) and income tax revenue growth have
been well below the rates of growth required to achieve their respective budget targets. The government has
already reduced the Advance Income Tax on exports which will remain effective throughout FY15. In this
context of a weakened tax effort, achieving the one percentage point increase in the tax-GDP ratio will be a
huge challenge. Delay in the implementation of the new VAT law will make it even tougher.

The composition of deficit financing can be improved by ensuring that the net foreign financing target
is met. Foreign financing is a lot cheaper with an effective interest rate of less than one percent. The effective
interest rate on domestic debt is around 11.4 percent. Increasing foreign financing will require a significant
increase in the disbursement rate from the outstanding aid commitment, which is over $19 billion. Meeting
the target will require a 22 percent disbursement rate in FY15. The only way this can be achieved is through
prioritized attention to large and high impact aided projects.

Inability to meet the net foreign financing target will not necessarily mean greater than targeted
reliance on domestic financing because foreign financing shortfall usually arises from the inability to spend
on the aided projects. However, the relationship is not one-to-one. A domestic bank financing target of about
350 billion taka (about $4.4 billion) is rather large and may constrain private credit growth if private
investment demand picks up. It may also challenge achieving the inflation target. The government will need
to tread carefully on this front.

The current IDA portfolio consists of 31 projects (two of which are not yet effective), for a total
commitment of $6.5 billion (end August 2014). The IDA portfolio is dominated by investment operations
and one P4R operation. Within the IPF portfolio, Bangladesh makes regular use of results-based
disbursement practices: four projects use Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) as the basis for fund
release and three other operations use performance-based mechanisms to trigger fund releases. The
Additional Financing (AF) instrument is used frequently (four AFs were approved in FY13-14 with a
commitment value of $608 million). The recipient-executed trust fund portfolio, with $541 million in
commitments, is strategically aligned with country assistance strategy (CAS) priorities. Out of 29 approved
Recipient Executed Trust Fund projects, 15 are stand-alone and 14 are co-financing instruments with IDA
operations.

With respect to sectoral composition, human development and infrastructure operations account for
about two-thirds of total IDA and trust fund portfolio commitments , with the remaining third divided
between private sector, governance, and rural development investments. About 84 percent of IDA/trust
fund commitments (projects greater than $5 million) are rated in the satisfactory range. About 16 percent of
commitments are classified as poor performers. Portfolio proactivity and realism was 100 percent at the end
of FY14. The FY14 disbursement ratio was 23 percent, and compared favorably to the South Asia Region
average of 19 percent.

IDA and the International Finance Corporation (IFC)are collaborating in both advisory services
and investment finance. Joint advice has been concentrated on economic zones, export processing
zones, banking sector reforms and tax modernization. On the investment side, IFC and IDA a r e
e x p l o r i n g co-financing opportunities for private s e c t o r sub-projects, as well as joint financing
opportunities for public p rivate partnership projects and economic zone development. IFC and IDA also
are actively engaged in supporting efforts to attract foreign investors relocating from China, with the
goal of drawing 15 million jobs to Bangladesh.

Analytical and Advisory Activities
The World Bank is regarded as a source of high quality analysis on key development themes. In the
past year, the Bank has produced a number of core analytic reports that were widely disseminated and well
received by the government of Bangladesh, the development community and local stakeholders. Launched in
November, 2012 the Country Economic Memorandum “Bangladesh: Towards Accelerated, Inclusive and
Sustainable Growth-Opportunities and Challenges” examined future sources of growth in the context of rapid
urbanization. In order to reach sustain Middle Income Country status by 2021, a remittance rate of eight
percent and GDP growth rates of 7.5—8.0 percent must be achieved and sustained. To do this, the report
emphasized increasing investments in physical infrastructure and human development by managing rapid
and unplanned urbanization, creating an enabling environment for expanding labor intensive economic
activities, and promoting safe migration.

The Bangladesh Poverty Assessment Report (June 2013) “Assessing a Decade of Progress in Reducing
Poverty, 2000-2010” documented Bangladesh's remarkable progress in reducing poverty from nearly 63
million people in 2000 to 47 million in 2010. The report found that the main drivers behind reducing poverty
over the past decade were growth in labor income and steadily dropping fertility rates. The report concluded
that eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity in the future will require coordinated multi-
sector action to increase agricultural productivity, promote more jobs in the manufacturing and service
sectors, and improve targeting and efficiency of safety net programs.

The Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (October 2013) suggested actions centered around four pillars to
sustain and accelerate export growth: 1) breaking into new markets through improved logistics and better
exploitation of dynamic markets in Asia; 2) breaking into new products through a more neutral trade policy,
attracting more investment, promoting and developing services trade; 3) improving worker and consumer
welfare by improving skills and implementing worker safety measures; and 4) building a supportive
environment by sustaining sound macroeconomic fundamentals and strengthening institutional capacity for
strategic policy making.

At the sector level, a flagship Education Sector Review, "Seeding Fertile Ground: Education That
Works for Bangladesh" (March 2014), covered issues related to access for the hardest-to-reach children,
public policy actions needed to enhance learning outcomes at primary and secondary levels, and the
importance of foundational and behavioral skills in addition to market related skills. The review was
prepared with substantial stakeholder input and was disseminated at the division level to reach regional
practitioners and policy makers.

The Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund supports cutting-edge studies on climate change
impacts and adaptation. “Impact of Climate Change on Climate-Sensitive Diseases and Implications for the
Health Sector” analyzed the impacts of climatic variability on health in Bangladesh to inform health policy-
makers on emerging challenges in the region. As Bangladesh is highly vulnerable for natural disasters, the
Bank has also been providing non-lending technical assistance related to earthquake resilience. A stakeholder
consultation process (involving 51 ministries and agencies) has generated recommendations related to
managing earthquake risks and produced a number of practical user-friendly tools: Dhaka Earthquake Risk
Profile and Atlas, Legal and Institutional Arrangements Framework Guidebook, Dhaka Risk Sensitive Land
Use Planning Guidebook, Data Sharing Platform Roadmap, and Information, Education and Communication
Action Plan. This non-lending technical assistance is providing the analytic foundation for a pipeline urban
resilience operation (FY15).


International Finance Corporation (IFC)

IFC has a large Advisory Services program in Bangladesh, with approximately $13 million a year in
funding provided by the U.K. government, the European Union, the Norwegian Agency for Development
Cooperation, the Dutch and other donor financiers. IFC works in areas that are important for the Bangladesh
economy, such as agriculture, infrastructure, financial markets and energy efficiency.

Expanding the availability and affordability of finance: Since 1990, IFC has been involved as an equity
investor to Bangladesh’s first leasing company, first mortgage finance company, first independent power
project, the first SME bank, the first private equity fund, the first foreign direct investment in the insurance
sector, and the first mobile payment platform. IFC provides debt, equity, and guarantee products in sectors
such as financial markets, infrastructure, agribusiness, and manufacturing, and in companies that generate
employment, fuel growth, and spur innovation. IFC works to enhance the capacity of the financial
intermediaries to increase access to finance for SMEs; supports product standardization and new product
development, and promotes environmentally friendly financing. Examples include: the SME Market
Segmentation Database; Environmental Risk Management Guidelines; and the Sustainable Energy Finance
loan product.

Improving business environment: IFC partners with different government agencies to carry out
transformative reforms that help create an enabling business environment for domestic and foreign
enterprises. In keeping with the government’s agenda for a “Digital Bangladesh,” IFC’s projects promote
efficiency and transparency in public sector agencies through e-governance, for example, establishing the
online tax payment portal, and automating registration process of businesses. As a result of IFC’s efforts,
Bangladesh has leaped ahead 21 places from the previous year in the ease of starting a business ranking of
Doing Business Report, 2014. IFC has also supported the adoption of alternative dispute mechanisms
(arbitration and mediation) in Bangladesh to relieve pressure on the court system and accelerate appeals
procedures. It also has helped form Business Initiative Leading Development (BUILD), which is a platform for
public-private dialogue, with support from key private sector agencies. Responding to BUILD’s
recommendations, the government has carried out 24 business reforms. In order to strengthen the capacity
of the bureaucracy, IFC has helped introduce Regulatory Impact Assessment, which will help review the
impact of new laws and regulations, and business process re-engineering, which will deal with the measures
in issuing licenses and permits under any law. In the past year, IFC has also initiated sector-specific
interventions in the agribusiness sector by partnering with the Ministry of Agriculture. Under this initiative,
several policies and acts will be reviewed and updated to improve the seed industry, upgrade food safety
standards, and attract both domestic and foreign investment.

Promoting sustainability in agriculture: Bangladesh has been identified as one of the most vulnerable
countries to climate change threats. To help ensure food security and climate change adaptation, IFC is
working with partners and farmers in the seeds sector, supporting climate-resistant agriculture. In the
poultry sector, IFC helps farmers convert poultry waste to electricity, creating an alternative energy source
for farms. IFC also trains farmers in farm management to improve their competitiveness and access to
finance. A leading Bangladesh agriculture company was the first instance of the private sector using the IFC-
managed Global Agriculture and Food Security (GAFSP) facility.

Promoting Clean Growth: To reduce environmental degradation and ensure sustainability, IFC is promoting
cleaner production and resource efficiency in the textiles and apparels sector. The first phase of a cleaner
production project with 18 factories in Bangladesh led to savings of $2 million and 1.26 million cubic meters
of water through resource efficiency measures. Estimates show that if the industry’s 1,700 textile wet -
processing units adopt cleaner production measures, they can save up to $70 million and 10.5 billion liters of
water a year – important savings in a country where 31 million people do not have access to clean water.

Drawing from its global and local experience and using a combination of investments and advisory
services, IFC in Bangladesh focuses on sustainable private sector development by providing financing,
enabling a better business environment, and promoting the competitiveness of small and medium
enterprises.

IFC presently has 20 investment clients with a committed portfolio of approximately $500 million (of
which financial institutions comprise 56 percent, telcom 30 percent, agribusiness four percent, textile three
percent). Until 2013, IFC investments averaged $100 million a year. Last year, IFC committed $747 million
including mobilization, with a goal of approximately $1 billion a year by 2015.

Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)

MIGA’s current portfolio in Bangladesh consists of two active projects with a total guarantee
amount of $329 million. The first guarantee of $78 million was issued in 2005 to Egyptian investors
to cover risks related to their investment in Sheba Telecom Pvt. Ltd., a national mobile telephone network.
Since acquiring Sheba, the company has been rebranded as Banglalink, and the network coverage and
capacity have been significantly expanded using new technology and equipment, resulting in a high-
quality mobile telecommunications service and strong subscriber growth. Banglalink’s subscribers
increased from 1.2 million subscribers at the end of 2005 to over 29 million in December 2013.

The second guarantee of $251 million was approved in 2012 to support a financing package arranged by
HSBC of the United Kingdom to Ashuganj Power Station Company Limited (APSCL), a state-owned utility.
The financing is for the construction of the 450-megawatt combined-cycle gas-fired Ashuganj South power
plant, which is expected to provide nearly 12,000 households with electricity. MIGA’s contribution will
provide coverage against the risk that sovereign financial obligations will not be honored, for a period of
up to 13.5 years.

Building Project Phase I)
Project Background: Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to the potential impacts of climate change. To address this challenge,
Bangladesh launched its Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) in 2009 to build a medium- to long-term program for enhancing
resilience to climate shocks and facilitating low carbon and sustainable growth. To support implementation of the BCCSAP, seven development
partners established the Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund (BCCRF) in 2010, pledging about $184 million to the fund.

 Project Development Objective and Components:
 The objective is to support the implementation of the BCCSAP, a ten-year program (2009-2018) aimed at building the capacity and resilience of
 the country to meet the challenge of climate change. Sectoral ministries are implementing five investment projects: (i) cyclone shelters ($25
 million); (ii) solar irrigation ($10 million); (iii) afforestation ($33.8 million); (iv) community climate change ($12.5 million); and (v) capacity-
 building ($200,000).


 Results:
 The Bank is carrying out analytical work related to climate change. One study (climate change and health) has been completed, while the
 remaining are underway (urban flooding, temporal downscaling of climate data, cross-dam development, and innovative flood risk management).
          Expected outcomes include:61 new multipurpose cyclone shelters built in climate-vulnerable areas.
          45,000 farmers provided with access to clean energy services for irrigation pumping.
          17,000 hectares of land reforested or afforested.
          40,000 climate vulnerable people receive resilient investments/advice to build climate adaptive capacity.
 The BCCRF grant for the cyclone shelters will be extended by one year to enable all final shelter constructions to be complet ed.

Project Background:
Brick fields expel into the air more than 9.8 million tons of greenhouse gases annually, due to a combination of old technology, weak
environmental legislation and enforcement, and a lack of corporate responsibility. Meanwhile, growing numbers of motorized
vehicles are clogging up roads and contribute further to poor air quality. Brick kilns and motor vehicles contribute up to 60 percent of
fine particulate pollution in Dhaka during the dry season.

Project Development Objective and Components: The Clean Air and Sustainable Environment (CASE) Project aims to improve air
quality and safe mobility in Dhaka through the implementation of demonstration initiatives in urban transport and brick-making.
CASE components include:
 (i) Encouraging the adoption of cleaner and more energy-efficient brick manufacturing technologies such as converting to improved
kiln alternatives and launching 12 demonstration projects.. The project also encourages research into alternatives to bricks such as
micro-concrete, while helping the government strengthen environmental laws and providing support for the newly- established Air
Quality Management section responsible for air quality monitoring, data analysis and reporting.
(ii) Promoting safe pedestrian mobility in Dhaka by actively rehabilitating and improving sidewalks and constructing foot bridges;
and improving traffic management by upgrading intersections, installing traffic signals and training police in enforcing them.


Results:
              Installation of 11 Continuous Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAMS) in eight cities to monitor major air pollutants and
               generate real-time air quality data.
              Completion of three brick kiln pilot programs, with another three underway.
              Completion of 55 km of sidewalk and road improvement, and 31 intersection improvements,
              Construction of 14 foot bridges, with six others being built.
              Installation of 65 solar-powered traffic signals.
              Designing of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Line 3 underway.

Project Background: Bangladesh’s coastal zone spans over 580 km and includes territory where 28 percent of the
population resides. A higher percentage of the population lives below the absolute poverty line in the coastal area than in the rest of
the country. A recent World Bank study on the cost of adapting to extreme weather estimated that e i g h t million people are
currently vulnerable to inundation depths greater than t h r e e meters due to cyclonic storm surges. This number will increase
to 13.5 million people by 2050, and an additional n i n e million because of climate change. There is an urgent need to
rehabilitate and upgrade protection polders – areas of low-lying land - and enhance the resilience of coastal areas to cyclones, tidal
and flood inundations, and salinity intrusion.
The Coastal Embankment Improvement Project-Phase 1 (CEIP1) as approved in June 2013 and has been effective since November
2013. The main design and engineering consultant was hired in August 2014 and the tender for the construction of the first phase of
polder investments is ongoing.
Project Development Objective and Components:
CEIP1 aims to: (i) increase the area protected in selected polders) from tidal flooding and storm surges, which are expected to worsen
due to climate change; (ii) improve agricultural production by reducing saline water intrusion in selected polders; and (iii) improve
the government’s capacity to respond promptly and effectively to a crisis or emergency.
It calls for upgrading Bangladesh’s embankment system by increasing the area in polders protected from tidal flooding and fre quent
storm surges, which would provide direct protection to those living within the polder boundaries and enhance the resilience of coastal
areas to cyclones, tidal and flood inundations, and salinity intrusion. This, in turn, will enhance people’s livelihoods thro ugh increased
agricultural production during normal weather as well as reduced loss of life, assets, crops and livestock in the event of a disaster.

Expected Results:
         Rehabilitation of 17 polders in six coastal districts: Bagerhat, Khulna, Satkhira, Barguna, Patuakhali, and Pirojpur.
         Improved protection for 760,000 people living within polder boundaries.
         Poverty reduction and stimulated economic development from facilitating the growth o f f farm and non-farm activities in
          the coastal area.

Project Background:
Chittagong, Bangladesh’s second-largest city, suffers from inadequate water production and sewerage systems. The port city’s
water production capacity is only 40 percent of the estimated demand, and the pipe network is run down. A large percentage of
the city continues to access water through shallow tube wells. The quality of this underground water is questionable, with high
salt and iron levels posing health risks to the public. In addition, very little investment has been made into sanitation and storm
water drainage since the late 1980s. Chittagong still does not have a water-borne sewage system or effective storm-water drainage
service. The Chittagong Water Supply and Sanitation Authority (CWASA) lacks both the capacity and finance to establish these
systems. The Bank helped CWASA develop its institutional capacity development program launched in June 2012.
The Chittagong Water Supply Improvement and Sanitation Project was restructured in February 2014 following the mid-term review
held in December 2013.

Project Development Objective and Components:
The project aims to i ncrease access to safe water and improve CWASA’s institutional capacity and investment planning for sanitation
and drainage in Chittagong .
It supports major interventions in treated water production, transmission and distribution including the construction of a Water
Treatment Plant (WTP) in CWASA's development plan and the rehabilitation and extension of the water distribution
system. The support includes studies to update the sewerage master plans and drainage master plans for Chittagong, as
well as capacity building at operational levels to improve the efficiency of overall service delivery
Project performance is primarily driven by major works packages that account for about 80 percent of the restructured project.


Achieved and Expected Results:
          Contract awarded for Kalurghat Booster Station
          Providing 150,000 people with access to improved water sources;
          Cover 85 percent of CWASA’s operation and maintencance cost from direct water sales revenue;
          Prepare $150 million of priority sanitation and drainage investments for financing.

As of August, 2014
Project Background:
Disability in Bangladesh is estimated to cost the country $1.2 billion, or 1.74 percent of GDP, per annum (2008 estimates). It is far
less costly to invest in social care for vulnerable children during childhood than to reverse the effects of neglected human
development in later years. To increase social cohesion and reduce poverty in Bangladesh, the quality of social care services and
economic opportunities for people with disabilities and vulnerable children need to be improved. This is particularly challenging
in a weak capacity environment where implementing entities often lack the requisite technical skills and management tools.


Project Development Objective and Components:
The Disability and Children at Risk Project (DCAR) aims to expand coverage and improve the quality of services for people with
disabilities and children at risk by strengthening and scaling-up government service delivery systems.
Components include supporting the Jatiyo Protibondhi Unnayan Foundation (JPUF) in adding new d isability s ervice c enters
(DSCs) to an existing g o v e r n m e n t program, as well as supporting technical facilities upgrades, providing assistive devices
to the disabled, enhancing outreach to remote areas of the country, and institutionalizing specialist training for service providers.
The project also aims to improve and expand the network of services for children at risk, and strengthen the institutional capacity
of the Department of Social Services (DSS).
Results:
Helped provide 83,700 people with disabilities (including 35,580 women) and 2,574 children (including 1,278 girls) services tailored
to their needs as of June 30, 2014.
Established 20 disability service centers (DSCs) in various district headquarters, as well as seven integrated child protection service
centers (ICPSCs) in divisional cities with an additional four planned to provide crisis management services, referral services,
psychosocial counseling, skills training and development, reintegration services, case management, and health and education
services.

Project Background:
Dhaka’s growing population of 15 million is placing serious strains on the city’s ability to provide basic water, sanitation, and
drainage services. Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) provides water services to about 70 percent of the population
of Dhaka City. However, the quality of these services is inadequate and uneven. In some areas (especially slum areas), services are non-
existent. The existing sewerage network covers only about 30 percent of the city area.

Project Development Objective and Components:
The Dhaka Water Supply and Sanitation project aims to improve stormwater drainage in select catchments in Dhaka, and to improve
DWASA’s planning capacity.
It supports the ongoing rehabilitation work in parts of the Khilgaon-Basabo, Abdullahpur, Shutivola, Shahjadpur, Baunia, Digun,
Mohakhali and Gerani canals in a bid to improve storm water drainage and minimize urban flooding, particularly in the eastern part of
Dhaka. The project also has completed preparation of the Dhaka sewerage master plan as part of the initiative to improve planning in
sanitation, particularly for the identification of key future wastewater collection and treatment investments in the city
Engineering designs and corresponding bidding documents for $45 million of priority sewerage and wastewater treatment interventions
also have been prepared, with work continuing on other steps for institutional strengthening of DWASA.


Results:
          Completion of the Rampura and Kamlapur pumping station is scheduled for December 31, 2014 and June 15, 2015, respectively
          Improved drainage facilities that benefit two million of the targeted four million people.
          Permanent storm water pumping capacity increased by 40 cubic meters, and the capacity of rehabilitated drainage canals increased
          by 120 cubic meters, almost half the target of 250.
            Approval of four master plans by the implementing agency.

Project Background: On November 15, 2007, Cyclone Sidr made landfall across the southern coast of Bangladesh, causing extensive
damage to lives and property. Overall, around 30 districts and nine million people were affected by the storm. Total damage and losses
caused by 2007 Cyclone Sidr were estimated about $1.7 billion
Project Development Objective and Components:
The objective is to support government efforts to facilitate restoration and recovery from the damage to livelihoods and infrastructure
caused by Cyclones Sidr in 2007 and Aila in 2009, and build long-term preparedness through strengthened disaster risk reduction and
management. The project has six components: (i) restoration of the agriculture sector in Sidr/Aila affected areas; (ii) improvement of
existing multipurpose shelters and construction of new disaster shelters; (iii) rehabilitation of coastal embankments; (iv) strengthening
the capacity of the government’s disaster risk reduction management; (v) monitoring and evaluation to ensure effective implem entation
of the sub-projects; and (vi) a project management component to support the government in coordinating all project related activities,
strategic studies for the preparation of future operations for the long-term disaster risk reduction program, technical assistance and
training, as well as providing emergency support for future disasters during implementation.


Results:
   Efforts to restore the agriculture sector have exceeded beneficiary targets, with crops by 33 percent, livestock by 13 percent and fisheries
    by 30 percent.
   Rehabilitation work on the existing 240 shelters has been completed, along with construction of 104 new shelters.
   Repair work on the 260 km of coastal embankments has been completed.
   According to the impact evaluation survey carried out in 2013, a majority of households have reported increased income in the past two
    seasons due to project interventions. In addition, there has been a 36 percent reduction in poverty incidence.

Project Background:
Rural poverty continues to be significantly higher and more extreme than urban poverty in Bangladesh, with more than 70 percent of the
population residing in rural areas. While the decline in extreme poverty in rural areas has been impressive – from 37.9 percent in 2000
to 21.1 percent in 2010 – the poverty level remains almost three times that of urban areas. Rural poverty and food security thus remain
critical policy areas with emphasis on the need for growth to be broad-based and pro-poor.
The Notun Jibon project builds on its predecessor, the Social Investment Program Project (SIPP), which developed an inclusive,
transparent and accountable planning tools and governance structure, and established a web-based management information system
that records performance at the village level.

Project Development Objective and Components:
The project aims to improve the livelihoods of the rural poor, especially the left-out poor and vulnerable households in selected districts.
It supports poor and ultra-poor in the 16 poorest districts of Bangladesh through community financing for livelihood support,
community infrastructure, and skills-development training for youth. The project also seeks to empower the poor and strengthen
community-level organizations by supporting small-scale, demand-driven community investment sub-projects that are prioritized,
implemented, and managed directly by the rural poor.



Results:
 Comprises 657,593 eligible households in 3,262 villages in 16 districts
 Women are 94 percent of the project beneficiaries are women, helping them hold decision-making status in their villages and
     households.
    Project beneficiaries have almost doubled their average monthly household income compared to the project baseline, and have on
     average a 28 percent higher monthly income compared to the control group.
    Benefited 887,250 households through 4,282 community infrastructure and social services sub-projects.
    Created about 36,000 jobs for youth under the project.
    About 36,000 jobs for youth have been created under the project.

As of August, 2014
Project Background:
The Bangladesh government allocates about 2.2 percent of GDP to education, but just 0.2 percent is dedicated to tertiary education.
With 85 percent of the tertiary education budget feeding into recurring expenditures, development programs for promoting and
establishing research and innovation in higher education institutes (HEIs) remain under-funded. Additionally, there is still no effective
mechanism linking university research with industry and business at home or abroad. Low connectivity and inadequate information
and communications technology penetration further limit knowledge exchanges and collaboration among HEIs and their researchers
with local and global research platforms.
The original International Development Association (IDA) credit for the Higher Education Quality Enhancement Project (HEQEP) was $81
million. IDA has provided an additional funding of $125 million to scale up existing project activities, provide support to create industry-
university linkage, and establish a quality assurance mechanism in Bangladesh’s universities.

Performance Development Objective and Components:
The project aims to improve the quality and relevance of the teaching and research environment in higher education institutions by
encouraging both innovation and accountability within universities, and by enhancing the technical and institutional capacity of the
higher education sector.
It promotes academic innovation among eligible public and private universities through a competitive funding mechanism known as
the Academic Innovation Fund (AIF) granted through four windows: ( i ) improvement of teaching and learning; (ii)
enhancement of research capabilities at the universities; (iii) university wide innovations including establishment of a technology
transfer office (TTO); and (iv) innovation and university-industry collaboration. The project also has established the Bangladesh
Research and Education Network (BdREN) that connects universities to a high- speed data communications n e t w o r k , enabling
teachers, researchers, and students to access the latest knowledge and, inter-university video classes, and engage in collaborative
research.
Results:
             Awarding of 329 academic innovation grants to 27 public and nine private universities.
             Fully functional BdREN connectivity at the University Grants Commission (UGC) and in six universities.
             The UGC digital library is fully operational, providing 38 member universities (31 public, seven private) access to more
              than 17,000 e-resources (research databases, e-journals, e-books).

Project Background:
Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in improving access to and delivery of public health services. The country conducted the
world’s largest measles-rubella campaign earlier in 2014, covering 53 million children. The World Health Organization recently declared
Bangladesh a polio-free zone. Bangladesh is also on track to achieve child and maternal mortality Millennium Development Goals. Still,
significant development challenges remain in the health sector. F i g u r e s f o r malnourished women and children in
Bangladesh are on a declining trend, but remain high. Public spending on health is low in comparison to other countries.

Performance Development Objective and Components:
 The Health Sector Development Program (HSDP) aims to enable the government of Bangladesh to strengthen health systems and
improve health services, particularly for the poor.
 It supports the government in providing essential health services including reproductive health, family planning and antenatal care;
scaling up emergency obstetric and newborn care services; and ensuring 24-hour services in district hospitals and selected health
centers. The project also aligns multiple development partners to the country’s priorities in health, nutrition, and population, and uses
country systems for implementation and monitoring. It strengthens health sector planning and resource management, human
resource development, pharmaceuticals management, health information systems and the maintenance of health care facilities. In
addition, HSDP seeks to improve the control and treatment of both communicable and non-communicable diseases through the
provision of vaccinations, scaling up HIV/AIDS interventions for the most-at-risk groups, and improving the quality of treatment for
tuberculosis and the control and treatment of malaria in 13 highly-endemic areas. For non-communicable diseases, HSDP aims to
improve awareness of cardio-vascular disease risks, provide better diagnosis and management of diabetes, and improve screening for
cancer.
Results:
             Reduced maternal mortality by 40 percent, down to 194 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2010.
             Helped bring basic vaccination coverage of children younger than 23 months to approximately 80 percent in 2013.
             Skilled birth attendants were at 34.4 percent of births in 2013, up from 18 percent in 2007.

(As of August , 2014)
Project Background:
 Agriculture provides livelihoods more than 60 percent of the population of Bangladesh. Despite Bangladesh’s success in reaching
near self-sufficiency in food production, people living in the flash flood and drought-prone districts in the northwest and the
saline-affected tidal surge areas in the south struggle to earn a living or produce enough food to eat. These regions suffer from
higher poverty than the national average. The link between unfavorable agricultural environments, where farmers lack knowledge
and technology, and chronic poverty, coupled with food insecurity, is abundantly clear in these areas.
Project Development Objective and Components:
 The Integrated Agricultural Productivity Project (IAPP) aims to enhance the productivity of agriculture (crops, livestock, and
fisheries) in selected agro-ecologically-constrained and economically-depressed areas.
It seeks to use use technology and training to enhance agricultural production in the northern and southern districts affected by
flash floods, drought and tidal surge areas affected by saline. The project focuses on alleviating poverty and increasing food
security through increased production of major crops such as cereals, diversification of high-value non-cereal crops such as fruits
and vegetables, and development of non-crop agriculture such as fishery, poultry, and livestock. Livelihood Field Schools improve
farmers’ understanding and skills base, and also demonstrate the use of new technologies.. IAPP also aims to release new and
improved crop varieties and more productive fish species, and help farmers increase crop intensity by conserving and utilizing
surface water and improving the availability and efficient use of irrigation water.
Results:
          The Department of Agriculture Extension formed 4,990 Livelihood Field Schools and conducted more than 24,074 demonstrations on
           various crops and improved technologies.
          The Department of Fisheries formed 1,328 fish farmer groups and conducted 4,260 demonstrations on improved fish
           varieties and production technologies..
          Improved agricultural technologies adopted by more than 128,000 farmers, including improved irrigation for 11,970 ha.
          Release for use of 10 improved production packages for crops and three for aquaculture, as well as five improved crop
           varieties – two wheat, two rice and one mustard.
          Distribution to farmers of 537 tons of certified seeds of different crops.

    As of August 2014
Project Background:
Bangladesh has enormous need for investment in infrastructure. Facilitating public-private partnerships is an important step in
reducing the investment gap by way of leveraging private resources and project management expertise. Due to the ongoing preference
for shorter term financing, and with limited capacity, local financial institutions are not keen to finance infrastructure projects for
longer terms such as 10 to 15 years. As a consequence, infrastructure development programs, which tend to be long-term in
nature, are suffering, and the country needs International Development Association support with new lending facility to bridge the gap.
The Investment Promotion and Financing Facility (IPFF) aims to increase private sector investment in infrastructure by working with
local financial institutions, selected based on pre-set eligibility criteria. Financial institutions that have agreed to finance a sub-project
with a private sector sponsor can apply through Bangladesh Bank, the project’s implementing agency.
Project Development Objective and Components:
The objectives of the project are to: (i) supplement the resources of Bangladesh financial markets to provide term finance for
infrastructure investment projects; and (ii) promote the role of private sector entrepreneurs in infrastructure development. The project
provides technical assistance in two streams: (i) for institutional strengthening of the Public Private Partnership (PPP) Office and (ii) for
identifying PPP sub-projects and completing upstream activities such as feasibility studies, transaction support, and preparation of bid
documents. The overarching goal is to increase eligibility of the sub-projects for IPFF funding and impart good practices in project
development in Bangladesh.

Results:
            Delivery through public-private partnerships of eight fully-operational power plants adding 228 MW of electricity to
             the national grid and to industries of Dhaka and Chittagong export processing zones, with another 300MW coming by April
             2015.
            Financing of three central water treatment plants in export processing zones of Chittagong, Adamjee and, Commilla.
            Financing and start-up of an inland terminal container in Chittagong, as well as a nation-wide fiber optic cable network

As of August, 2014
Project Background:
Bangladesh's information and communications technology (ICT) industry has developed over the past decade, with telecommunications
generating total industry investments of $4.5 billion since 2002 and providing about eight percent of the government’s total revenue per
annum. In stark contrast, the information technology (IT) industry has remained relatively nascent, with total industry output estimated
at $300 million per annum. The government recognizes Bangladesh’s significant competitive advantages in the ICT industry that could be
tapped into for economic and social development. At the same time, the government also recognizes the need to leverage electronic
government (e-government) for public services delivery and to facilitate its reform efforts. The lack of shared IT hosting infrastructure,
governance policies, and standards and structures present a major barrier to providing seamless electronic services and improving the
public sector’s effectiveness and efficiency.
Project Development Objective and Components:
The project aims to catalyze growth of Bangladesh's IT and enabled services industry for employment creation and export
diversification, and to establish basic e-government foundations to support public sector modernization.
Components include using IT to improve the government’s efficiency and effectiveness by enabling all ministries and agencies to have a
shared data center for hosting their systems, exchanging information and collaboration, as well as improving the public sector's
ability to secure data through information security policies, guidelines, and standards.
Expected Results:
   Creating 30,000 direct jobs, including 9,000 for women.
   Improving Bangladesh’s ranking on the World Economic Forum’s Network Readiness Index by at least five places

As of September 15, 2014
Project Background:
A reliable and authentic national identification system can serve as an efficient and secure data platform for delivering multiple
public services. The Election Commission Bangladesh (ECB) has established a national identity database (NID) and issued each registered
adult an NID card. These paper laminated cards lacked durability and could easily be forged. The information stored on them was limited
to simple biometric data such as name, address, finger print , signature and a photograph. Upgrading to “smart” NID cards would be used
to realize the full potential of an effective system.
The Bangladesh parliament passed the National Identity Registration (Amendments) Act of 2013, boosting implementation of the
project.
Project Development Objective and Components:
The Identification For Enhanced Access to Services (IDEA) project aims to establish a secure, accurate and reliable national
identification system in Bangladesh to serve as the basis for more efficient and transparent service delivery.
Components of the IDEA project include upgrading data quality, issuing digitalized NID cards with robust security features;
and supporting the ability of the National Identity Registration Wing (NIDW)’s ability to administer the program. The system will
reduce transaction costs for private sector service providers due to the greater reliability and efficiency in identifying clients,
maintaining their own databases of customers and fulfilling legal know-your-customer requirements.


Results:
           First online data sharing/verification system between two public sector agencies in Bangladesh in 2013
           Eventually will provide 90 million citizens with secure and reliable means of identification
           National and local government systems will use the NID verification system and related services, with 771 staff members trained.

Project Background:
Within Bangladesh’s public sector, local governments have always been relatively minor players, with a tiny share of sub -national
expenditure to the total government expenditure and a more trivial percentage of the total government revenue collected. Nonetheless,
local governments – especially at the lowest tiers – are key features of the governance landscape. In recent initiatives, successive
governments have affirmed their intent to devolve powers to lower levels and allocate more autonomy and resources to local
governments. Changes have shown that empowered Union Parishads (UPs, the lowest tier of local governments) and engaged
constituents can make effective decisions, both transparently and accountably. Consequently, there is an increasingly strong
government-led push towards decentralization.
Project Development Objective and Components:
The Local Governance Support Project II (LGSP II) aims to strengthen Union Parishads to become accountable and responsive, supported
by an efficient and transparent intergovernmental fiscal system. It provides UPs with direct block grants, along with full discretion to
decide their spending priorities. Through a participatory process involving open planning and budget sessions, members can debate
spending needs and question spending efficacy. The project design prescribes block grants only to be distributed to the UPs with a clean
audit issued by private auditors; and the project introduced a nationwide performance grant system with clear criteria and transparent
assessment. The project strengthens the capabilities of UPs in participatory planning, budgeting, financial management and procurement.
It also ensures they are held accountable through independent audits and disclosure requirements.
Results:
           Disbursed an equivalent of $254.73 million, which exceeds the mid-term target, with performance grants distributed to
            3,348 UPs during FY2013.
           Established a comprehensive management information system for strengthening capacity of monitoring, evaluating and
            supervising local governments.
          Trained more than 60,000 public officials, including UP chairmen and members, on local government functioning during
           FY2013.

Project Background:
Despite strong economic growth and a steady decline in poverty in Bangladesh over the past decade, natural disasters regularly cause
serious damage to the country’s infrastructure and agricultural sectors, severely affecting food access and food availability for the poor
and vulnerable. The expected increase in the frequency and intensity of weather-related shocks makes it imperative that the government
enhance its preparedness to address food insecurity in disaster-prone areas. The Public Food Distribution System (PFDS) is a core
element of the government’s food security strategy. The modern food storage fac ilities proposed for construction under this project
could considerably improve the efficacy of the government’s emergency response and recovery efforts in disaster -prone areas, and if
grain stocks are properly managed, could enhance the efficiency of its PFDS at the same time.

Project Development Objective and Components:
The Modern Food Storage Facilities Project’s ( MFSP’s) overall objective is to increase the grain reserve available to households to meet
post-disaster needs and improve the efficiency of grain storage management.

Components include improving the storage capacity for grain by financing the construction of modern steel silos for rice and wheat that
will be built in accordance with social and environmental sustainability parameters and safeguards compliance criteria. In addition, the
project will facilitate households’ access to domestic silos for food grain and seed storage to improve household -level food security
during and after natural disasters. It also will finance investments in small-scale storage at the rural household level, which is expected to
bring important benefits to the farming community in the form of safer storage of rice seed (which is more valuable than commercial
grain). Another component will finance costs required to ensure adequate overall management of the project, monitoring and evaluation
of the activities implemented, and capacity enhancement of selected stakeholders.

Expected Results:
             Increased availability of grain stocks (400,000 metric tons at the end of the project)
             Increased number of households whose grain needs can be met (4.5 million)
             Decreased grain storage cost (from $800 to $300 per ton)
             Reduced loss in grain stocks (from 17percent to three percent losses)

As of August 2014
Project Background:
Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated and rapidly urbanizing countries in the world. The population density and high urban
growth are putting great pressure on basic urban services, particularly on local governments, district towns or municipalities and city
corporations that are entrusted to provide such services. Bangladesh has 331 urban local bodies (ULBs), comprising 10 city corporations
and 321 municipalities. Despite progress in the decentralization reform agenda, the capacity of these urban institutions is still weak: they
have limited fiscal autonomy and decision- making powers, inadequate own source revenues and weak systems of accountability. The
bank has supported basic urban services development and capacity building of ULBs through the Municipal Services Project (MSP)
completed in 2012. The Municipal Governance and Services Project (MGSP) is designed to build on the MSP experience.
Project Development Objective and Components:
The objective is to improve municipal governance and basic urban services in participating ULBs, and improve the capacity of recipients
to respond promptly and effectively to an eligible crisis or emergency. The project comprises the following four components:
       Municipal Governance and Basic Urban Services Improvement ($246.35 million).This provides ULBs located along the three growth
           corridors and three district towns in the South with (i) a base allocation to 26 pre-selected ULBs annually for the first five years; (ii)
           performance-based allocation that demonstrate performance improvements in municipal planning, social accountability, public
           financial management and revenue mobilization for four years starting from the third year of project implementation ; and (iii)
           financial support for operation and maintenance.
       Demand-based Financing for Urban Services ($171.50 million). This provides demand-based sub-credits by the Bangladesh Municipal
           Development Fund (BMDF) to all ULBs for 90 percent of eligible urban services improvement investment costs based on transparent
           and objective eligible criteria, at an 80-20 grant to loan ratio.
       Capacity Building and Implementation Support ($53.91 million). This provides capacity building support to ULBs, the Local Government
           Division, and the MGSP implementing agencies, namely, the Local Government Engineering Department and the Bangladesh
           Municipal Development Fund.
       Contingent Emergency Response ($0). This will support, at the government’s request, response and reconstruction activities fo llowing a
           natural or man-made major disaster by re-allocating the IDA credit to this component.
Expected Results:
The Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) and 26 participating ULBs have signed their respective implementation
partnership agreements.
 LGED started to disburse operations and maintenance grants for the first year while the Bangladesh Municipal Development Fund
(BMDF) has appraised 25 sub-projects, three of which have been reviewed by the Bank.

Project Background:
Agriculture and the rural non-farm economy, which together contribute 55 percent of GDP, are the main sources of livelihood for rural
people in Bangladesh. Raising agricultural productivity and improving the economy of the rural non-farm sectors is crucial to
ensuring food security, generating employment and reducing poverty in rural Bangladesh. Agriculture in Bangladesh is
characterized by a “yield gap,” w h i c h i s the difference between the amounts produced and the potential for production. Weak
technology carries much of the blame for this gap, as farmers lack the machinery and information systems to store their products post-
harvest or to process them into high-value commodities such as jam or fruit juice. Lack of crop diversification, deteriorating and
declining cultivable land, and poor linkages to markets also leads to loss of potential sales.


Project Development Objective and Components:
T h e p r o j e c t aims to improve the effectiveness of the national agricultural technology system, as measured by increase in
agricultural productivity and farm income in selected districts.
It has established an autonomous Krishi Gobeshona (Agriculture Research) Foundation that has financed applied agricultural research
projects, resulting in outcomes translated into technical bulletins for farmers. In addition, the project set up Commodity Collection and
Marketing Centers to act as commercial forums for farmers and local stakeholders, and to help in negotiating better prices for their
products. It also helps producers organize themselves into g roups and diversify production by self- selecting market options and
the products they wish to invest in, with 8,000 farmers organized into 400 groups.

Results:
              Agriculture productivity increased by 14-52 percent for crops, 55-65 percent for livestock and 60-76 percent for
               fisheries.
              Increase in income by 112 percent for marginal farmers, 31 percent for small farmers and 23 percent for medium farmers.
              New agricultural technologies adopted by 2,198,564 farmers (43 percent of the farm households in the project area), of
               which more than half are considered to be sustained adopters (for more than one season).
              Funding and implementation of 199 applied research projects.
              Establishment of 732 Farmers Information and Advisory Centers.
              Mobilization of 390,000 farmers into 20,000 Common Interest Groups linked to markets.
               Training of 12,245 traders and farmers in commercial agricultural practices

Project Background:
The garment industry in Bangladesh accounts for 75 percent to 80 percent of Bangladesh’s export earnings, and has also played a
significant role in providing economic benefits to poor and vulnerable women. Today, around 80 percent of the garment workers are
female. Yet, the number of poor women from impoverished north-western districts joining the garments sector is much lower than
the number of women garments workers from other parts of the country. Female garment workers constitute a highly vulnerable
group, with few support systems in place that provide them adequate training or social services. For these women, their first few
months in the city and at the factory are the most hazardous, deterring many women who are in desperate need of work from joining
the industry.
Project Development Objective and Components:
The Northern Areas Reduction of Poverty Initiative (NARI) aims to help poor and vulnerable women from lagging areas of
Bangladesh gain access to w o r k opportunities in the garment sector by providing technical and life skills training,
transitional housing and other support to help them adjust to urban life and formal sector employment.
The project (nari means women in Bangla) will recuit about women from five districts i n northern Bangladesh for an orientation
course to help them make informed decisions about beginning a new life in one of three e xport p rocessing z ones (EPZs) in Dhaka,
Karnaphuli, or Ishwardi. The women will be settled into newly-built complexes, with transitional housing facilities at dormitories,
giving them time to develop social networks and support systems. The project also provides three months of training in skills for the
garment industry, allowing women to enter factories as semi-skilled workers. Trainees also will receive life-skills training, covering
topics such as adjustment to city life, savings and remittances, safety and security, rights and responsibilities at the work-place,
finding appropriate housing, contract negotiation, and health and fertility.
Expected Results:
      The first 900 selected candidates will be inducted into the dormitories and training centers by February 2015
      Around 10,800 women will gain formal employment, and networks will be established for continuing the flow of    potential
       workers.
      Three months of training will be provided and the employment bureaus will place the trainees into employment.
      The women will also be accommodated in transitional housing facilities for six months.

Project Background:
Bangladesh had made remarkable progress in primary education in the last decade. The net enrollment rate (NER) reached around 80
percent while the gross enrollment rate (GER) reached above 90 percent, and gender parity had been achieved. Despite the impressive
progress, cycle completion rate of the children enrolled in primary, as well as transition rate to secondary level, remained as concerns
with only around 60 percent of the children enrolled completed grade 5, and among them only 44 percent moved on to the secondary
level. Poverty along with educational background of the family, remoteness of the society and distance from the school, were the main
reasons for dropping out. The quality of education remained a bigger concern; many schools were overcrowded, while teacher
qualifications and motivation remained low and exams mostly tested memory recall and rote learning.
Project Development Objective and Components:
The Third Primary Education Development Project (PEDP III) aims to increase participation rates in primary education and reduce social
disparities; increase the number of children completing primary education; improve the quality of the learning environment and the
measurement of student learning, and improve the effectiveness of resource use for primary education.
It builds on the experience and successes of previous programs but stands out from them because its financing is linked to s p e c i f i c
results being achieved on the ground. Funds are disbursed when d isbursement-linked i ndicators (DLIs) covering nine areas are
met. The DLIs for quality enhancement cover: ( i ) development of an 18-month diploma program and teacher training; ( i i ) the
development and incremental introduction of competency-based examinations; ( i i i ) merit-based teacher and head teacher
recruitment; and (iv) timely distribution of textbooks (within a month of the start of the academic calendar), including an updated
curriculum. The DLIs supporting reduction in disparities include: (i) the widespread introduction of pre-primary education,
especially in disadvantaged areas; and (ii) needs-based infrastructure development to reduce overcrowding in schools and improve
the quality of the facilities as well as school-level planning. Two other DLIs are set for enhanced sector financing and effective program
monitoring and reporting.
Results:
          By the project’s mid-term, 24 out of the 27 DLI milestones have been fully met.
          Completion of the 2013 round of the National Student Assessment (grades 3 and 5).
          Large-scale try-out of revised textbooks and teachers’ editions (all subjects, grades 1 -5).
          Formulation of an information communications and technology strategy for multi-media classrooms, digital learning, and
           teacher training.
          Completion of “efficiency gains analysis” to feed into construction design for schools;
          Proportion of schools preparing and receiving funds for SLIPs rose from 29 percent in 2012 to 61.6 percent in 2013
          Launch of nationwide electronic Government Procurement for 20 percent of the FY 2013/14 contracts.

As of August, 2014
Project Background:
Public procurement expenditures constitute over 70 percent of the annual development program (ADP) in Bangladesh. Thus
procurement plays a pivotal role in the development agenda of the government. It is well- documented that weaknesses in public
procurement have a cumulative negative effect on investment and economic growth. Poor public procurement skews investment
toward areas where rent-seeking is prevalent, rather than toward the areas that need it most for poverty reduction and development.
Procurement was identified as the main reason for poor utilization of aid and development programs in the country. Given this context, the
government initiated a systemic procurement reform in the country starting 2002, with the focus on legislations, followed by extensive
capacity development and electronic procurement.
Project Development Objective and Components:
The Public Procurement Reform Project II (PPRP-II) aims to improve the performance of the public procurement system, focusing
largely on the key sectoral ministries and their implementing agencies.
 It follows on the successes of the first PPRP that supported the enactment of procurement laws and rules. The four components of PPRP
II deal with comprehensive capacity development, procurement performance monitoring, electronic procurement, and social
accountability.
 Objectives include the four key government agencies involved – the Roads and Highways Department (RHD), Local Government
Engineering Department (LGED), Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board (BREB) and Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) –
rapidly expanding electronic procurement with a target of 100 percent by 2016, including on-line procurement performance monitoring.
In addition, PPRP-II has launched a social accountability and behavioral change communications campaign to demystify
procurement at the grassroots level.
Results:
          Invited 70 percent of tenders through electronic procurement in four key agencies in 2014, up from three percent in 2012.
          Awarded 70 percent of small-value contracts at decentralized levels within the initial bid validity period in 2013, up from 10
           percent in 2007.
          Published 75 percent of contracts awards on Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU) website in 2014, up from 15 percent in
           2007.
          Published 100 percent of bids invitations in newspapers in 2012, up from 70 percent in 2005.
          Trained more than 10,500 officials, of which 3,500 were provided with a three-week procurement course.

feed the family. As a consequence, these children were deprived of a key opportunity to escape poverty. The second Reaching Out-of-
School Children (ROSC) project helps restore that opportunity.
Project Development Objective and Components:
The project aims to improve equitable access, retention and completion in quality primary education for out-of-school children in
selected under-served areas.
ROSCII reintegrates out-of-school children into education through Ananda schools established a upazilas (sub-districts) with high
poverty and low enrollment and completion rates. Called Schools of joy, they provide education stipends to lessen the burdens on
families, and also distribute free books, stationery, and school uniforms. The schools blend formal education with non-formal
m e t h o d s : ROSC students tend to be older students and teachers observe a flexible schedule, with students taught by a single
class teacher until they are ready to join mainstream secondary schools. The project also tries to empower disadvantaged rural
communities to establish, own, and manage their own Ananda schools with support from the government and local education non-
government organizations.
Results:
              Enrollment of 343,109 out-of-school children (50 percent girls and 79 percent from disadvantaged families) in 14,032
               Ananda schools established in 148 of the most disadvantaged upazilas.
              Average grade retention rate stands at 67 percent, with the attendance rate at 86 percent and teacher absence rate below 15
               percent.
              Most Ananda schools have water and sanitation facilities, and 80 percent of teachers at them are women. most
             For the first time, ROSC students participated in the 2013 national learning assessment for primary level.

Project Background:

Only about 42 percent of rural households in Bangladesh have access to grid electricity, and even these consumers suffer frequent
and prolonged power cuts. Currently, electricity supply is about 6,500-7,000 MW, against a peak demand of about 8,500 MW. The
dispersed nature of rural settlements and the numerous rivers that crisscross the country make grid electrification in many areas of
Bangladesh both difficult and expensive. Despite steady progress in enhancing coverage, it is clear that reliance on grid
electricity alone will not allow the Bangladeshi government to realize its vision of universal access to electricity by 2021.

Project Development Objective and Components:

The second Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development (RERED) project aims to increase access to clean energy in
rural areas of Bangladesh promote more efficient energy consumption.

It builds on the success of RERED I by supporting solar home systems and other renewable energy options in remote rural areas, where
grid electricity is not economically or geographically viable. The World Bank initiative led to support from other donors, with more
than 50,000 solar homes systems now being installed every month to make it the fastest-growing solar home systems program in the
world. The implementing agency is the Infrastructure Development Company Ltd. (IDCOL), a government-owned financing institution,
and 47 partner organizations are installing solar home systems through a micro-credit scheme it supervises. The project is also
supporting renewable energy-based mini-grids, solar irrigation pumps (replacing diesel pumps), dissemination of improved cook stoves,
and biogas digesters for cooking.
Results:
             Provided 3.19 million remote households and rural shops with solar home systems, with more than 50,000
              s y s t e m s now installed every month.
             Increased access to electricity in Bangladesh by 11 percent. Dissemination of improved cook stoves has started with a
              target of one million rural households.

Project Background:
Only about 42 percent of rural households in Bangladesh have access to grid electricity, and even these consumers suffer frequent and
prolonged power cuts. Currently, electricity supply is about 6,500-7,000 MW, against a peak demand of about 8,500 megawatts (MW).
Despite the supply shortages, electricity availability and the number of consumers have grown steadily over the last decade because of
less system loss and some added generating capacity. While the government and other sources made substantial investments to extend
the rural low-voltage system network to support new connections, the rural medium-voltage distribution system and the associated
transmission system received relatively less attention during the last decade of system load and grid expansion. As a result, the rural
electricity system is now over-loaded and experiences frequent load-shedding, leading to higher technical losses and services
interruptions.
Project Development Objective and Components:
The objective is to reduce system losses and enhance capacity in the rural distribution network, primarily in the eastern par t of
Bangladesh.
The project aims to rehabilitate and bolster the distribution network of the Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board (BREB) in support of
reducing systems losses and enhancing capacity for carrying electricity when additional power generation is available. The project is also
expected to support transmission enhancements by the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB).


Results:
While the project became effective only recently, bids have been invited for line materials for the rehabilitation work, and a design for grid
substations has started.

Project Background: Despite Bangladesh’s remarkable progress of lifting 16 million people out of poverty in the past decade, i t
remains a stubborn problem with about 47 million people living in poverty and 26 million in extreme poverty. To support the
poor and vulnerable, the g o v e r n m e n t spends up to two percent of GDP annually on its public social safety net programs.
However, 70 percent of poor people still do not receive any safety net support, mainly due to shortcomings in identifying poor
beneficiaries and program administration.

Project Development Objective and Components:
 The Safety Net Systems for the Poorest (SNSP) project aims to improve the equity, efficiency and transparency of major social safety net
programs to benefit the poorest households.
 It supports the five major safety net programs implemented by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, including the
Employment Generation Program for the Poorest (EGPP), Food for Works (FFW), Test Relief (TR), Gratuitous Relief (GR) and
Vulnerable Group Feeding (VGF) programs.
The project offers performance-based partial reimbursement of government spending under the major safety net programs, with
determining indicators that include allocating increased resources to the poorest, particularly poor women; introducing an
objective targeting system better to identify the poor; improving implementation and monitoring capacity; and enhancing accountability
mechanisms.
In addition, it will introduce modern program management information systems for improved planning and monitoring efficiency. a n d
support the Statistics and Informatics Division in developing the Bangladesh Poverty Database to better target safety net service
delivery and contribute to improving coordination among various safety nets implemented by different ministries.
Expected Results:
             More effective safety net programs for four million households (18 million poor people)
             Creation of the Bangladesh Poverty Database

Project Background:
Special measures taken over the last couple of decades have enabled more Bangladeshi children than before, especially girls, to
continue their education at the secondary level. But it still remains a challenge for children from low-income families to access a
good-quality education in Bangladesh.




Project Development Objective and Components:
The Secondary Education Quality and Access Enhancement Project (SEQAEP) aims to improve the quality of secondary education in
Bangladesh,, systematically monitor learning outcomes and increase access and equity in 215 project upazilas (subdistricts).
It provides stipends and tuition to disadvantaged girls and boys based on proxy means-testing (PMT) and incentives to students,
teachers, and schools in 125 upazilas so that they perform better. Eligible students receive stipends of from $15 to $40 a year if they
maintain 75 percent average attendance, achieve a passing grade in final examinations and remain unmarried until they complete Grade
10.
The project also includes measures to provide water and sanitation facilities in schools, and strengthen school management and
accountability systems while helping with reading skills. Financial rewards are given to the teachers and institutions that consistently
increase the number of students appearing in and passing the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examinations.
 Results:
            The pass rate in SSC examinations was higher than 85 percent
            Supported 5.1 million student-years (55 percent girls) under the stipends program.
            Awarded more than 100,000 students for academic performance while supporting some 150,000 students in English and
             mathematics and about 810,000 students in reading skills.

As of August, 2014

Project Background:
Despite a wide road network and large investments in it, rural roads in Bangladesh need regular repair and rehabilitation. The quality,
construction, and carrying capacity of parts of the secondary and tertiary road network is poor. In 2000, only 37 percent of the
population lived within two kilometers of an all-season road. About 13,000 km of upazila (subdistrict) roads (out of 36,500 km) were all-
weather standard, and most of the rural union roads remained unpaved. As a result, large portions of the secondary and tertiary
road network remained impassable during the rainy season.


Project Development Objective and Components:
 The second Rural Transport Improvement Project (RTIP II) aims to improve rural accessibility in project areas (covering 26 districts),
 and to strengthen institutional capacity for sustainable rural road maintenance.
 It builds on the success of RTIP 1, which covered more than 44,000 square km in 21 districts, in developing rural trade and transport
 infrastructure by focusing on the physical improvements of inter-linked roads, small bridges and culverts, growth center markets, and
 river jetties. The project’s improved roads, many built by destitute women, make it easier for children to go to school, expe ctant
 mothers to reach hospitals in an emergency and local farmers and consumers to reach markets. It also has contributed to developing a
 comprehensive rural road transport safety framework to help reduce the alarming number of injuries and fatalities that occur, and
 expanded coverage to improve road connectivity in the countryside.
Results:
      Maintained or improved 3,000 km of rural roads, 120 growth centers and 30 jetties. Created 50,000 person years of employment,
       and 30 percent of the employees were poor women.
      Better rural roads helped reduce travel times for motorized vehicles by 65 percent on average during the monsoon
       season, and 58 percent during the dry season.

 As of August, 2014
Project Background:
National rural water supply coverage in Bangladesh is estimated to be around 97 percent, but water quality issues and contamination
by arsenic have effectively lowered this figure to around 83 percent. Arsenic is the single largest threat to safe water service
provision in Bangladesh. The quality of sanitation coverage is another area of concern, with only 37 percent of latrines being
hygienic. The poor infrastructure and facilities for water and sanitation services, along with increased demand, is making it difficult to
provide reliable water and sanitation services.
Project Development Objective and Components:
The Bangladesh Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (BRWSSP) aims to increase the provision of safe water supply and hygienic
sanitation to the rural areas of Bangladesh, where shallow aquifers are highly contaminated by arsenic and other pollutants such as
saline, iron, and bacterial pathogens.
It calls for scaling up piped and non-piped water facilities to provide safe and clean water to villagers in some 383 Union Parishads
(local governing units) with acute arsenic contamination and low coverage for safe water supply. The project also seeks to provide
hygienic sanitation facilities, and is financing the construction of 125 piped water supply schemes and 14,000 water point sources in
hot-spot upazilas (subdistricts) where piped water supply is not geographically or economically possible. In selected disaster-
affected areas, the project is supporting the government’s emergency disaster response mechanism through expanded water supply
services. To fight the poor sanitation, it intends to provide financial incentives for the poor to construct hygienic latrines, build local
private sector capacity so that markets can better react to rise in demand; and increase the government’s role in ensuring that latrines
are maintained and accessible to all.


Expected Results:
           •   Increase access to improved water sources for 1.65 million people.
           •   Construct or rehabilitate 20,000 community water points.
           •   Provide 71,000 new piped household water connections.
           • Increase access to hygienic latrines for 1.7 million people.
However, initial delays in mobilizing the project preparatory activities make it unlikely the project will achieve all its targets before the
closing date of June 30, 2017. Therefore, project restructuring is needed.

Project Background: Electricity demand in Bangladesh has increased at an average rate of 10 percent per annum in recent years, with
peak demand reaching about 9,000MW. Yet per capita generation remains among the lowest in the world (321 kwh), and present
generation capability at 7,600 MW falls far short of peak demand. Although the supply situation has improved recently, load shedding and
outages occur during peak times in irrigation/summer season t h a t a f f e c t households, commercial enterprises and heavy industries.
The sector is financially weak, access to capital is severely constrained and prices do not cover costs, necessitating large
g o v e r n m e n t subsidies to keep t h e key institutions operational. Increasing shortages of natural gas, the primary fuel for power
generation, have added to the sector’s challenges.
Primary Development Objective and Components:
The Siddhirganj Power Project (SPP) aims to increase electricity supply to the Bangladesh grid network by constructing a 335 MW
Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP), as well as an 11 km 230 kV power evacuation system, and a 60 km 30-inch gas transmission
pipeline.
The combined cycle design for the power plant is a comparatively cleaner technology with lower carbon emissions and higher thermal
efficiency.
Expected results:
            When complete, the power plan will add 335 MW of electricity generating capacity to the national grid.
Mechanical completion of the gas supply line will be achieved on September 30 to provide initial gas supply. The government is
working to secure an additional $165 million to finance the additional capital cost of the combined cycle power plant and
associated supports.

Project Background: The Bangladesh economy has been registering steady economic growth of around six percent over the past
decade. As local and global economic shifts continue toward industry and services, demand for skilled manpower is expected to rise at
home and abroad. A labor-surplus country, the Bangladesh government is increasingly focusing on workforce development through
technical and vocational education training (TVET). This is a timely response as the country prepares to accommodate and capitalize on
the ongoing demographic dividend. However, poor training quality, low employability and inadequate wages plague the TVET sector,
requiring interventions for addressing these issues.
Project Development Objective and Components:
The Skills Enhancement and Training Project (STEP) aims to strengthen selected public and private training institutions to improve
training quality and employability of trainees, including those from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds.
I t is designed to address the key issues concerning T V E T by ensuring that the programs offered are relevant to labor market
needs by incorporating views from industries and civil society. The project provides performance grants for institutions and stipends
for students from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds. Those receiving a stipend must maintain 75 percent annual
attendance and 45 percent pass marks in the annual examinations.
Results:
               Stipends provided to 96, 345 diploma students from 93 polytechnic institutions, with the share of female recipients
                increasing to 15 percent from 10 percent.
               Deployment of 980 full-time contractual teachers in 50 public polytechnics, filling up 95 percent of vacant teaching posts.
               Training provided to 46, 076 people, 25 percent of them women. Diploma course pass rate increased from 50 percent in
                2010 to 64 percent in 2013.

                   Oversight
Project Background:
The main public financial management challenges in Bangladesh are the development of a comprehensive, automated financial
management information system with appropriate controls, the development of a new chart of accounts capable of reporting standard
classifications of expenditures, low levels of professional budgeting, accounting and auditing capacity, a dual budgeting process,
timeliness in preparing audit reports and low capacity for budget oversight.
Project Development Objective and Components:
The Strengthening Public Expenditure Management Program (SPEMP) seeks to strengthen and modernize budget institutions and
improve the formal institutions of financial accountability, with a focus on the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General (OCAG) and
the parliamentary bodies that deal with the allocation and monitoring of government resources.

There have been three recipient-executed projects so far:

     (i)       The Deepening Medium Term Budgeting Framework and Strengthening Financial Accountability project ($52.5 million)
               aimed to improve the financial management information system, introduce a multi-year and performance perspective to
               budget preparation, provide professional training and strengthen the macro-fiscal framework, including debt
               management.

     (ii)      The Strengthening of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General project ($13.03 million) intends to enhance the
               quality, scope and follow-up of audits, and create a cadre of internationally accredited professionals in OCAG.

The Strengthening Parliamentary Oversight project ($4.2 million) provides technical support to the three financial oversight committees
and the Parliamentary Secretariat.

Results:
           All 59 line ministries adopted a medium-term budget framework in 2010 and established budget management committees, and six
            developed medium-term strategy and business plans while two submitted annual performance reports.
           The audit backlog was eliminated and reports brought up to date; 5,550 audit objections were settled.
           A macroeconomic database and modeling framework was developed for macro-fiscal forecasting.
           Training in public financial management for 14,170 public servants, and 78 OCAG officials passed the Chartered Institute of Public
            Finance and Accountancy certificate-level exam.
           The OCAG completed eight pilot audits, with six more in progress.2010 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability

Project Background:
Illegal trade in wildlife is largely controlled by criminal gangs that poach flagship species such as tigers and elephants in one country,
stockpile them in another, and then trade them beyond the South Asia region. Thus, no single country can manage or eliminate
poaching or the illegal wildlife trade on its own. Since wild animals cannot be confined to national boundaries, a single country also
cannot manage a contiguous cross-border wildlife habitat effectively. This makes the control of the illegal trade of wildlife and wildlife
parts a challenging multi-country affair.
Project Development Objective and Components:
The project aims to assist participating governments in building or enhancing shared capacity, institutions, knowledge and
incentives to collaborate on tackling the illegal wildlife trade and other selected regional conservation threats to habitats in border
areas. It has a two-pronged approach that calls for (i) capacity building to address the illegal wildlife trade through regional
cooperation; and (ii) habitat protection and management to generate regional conservation benefits and address the human-wildlife
conflict.
Components are:
           Building capacity to address the illegal trans-boundary wildlife trade by bringing about regional collaboration in
            combating wildlife crime through strengthened legislative and regulatory frameworks and well-equipped specialized
            agencies and systems, as well as relevant training and awareness programs for staff responsible for enforcement of wildlife
            laws and regulations. Bangladesh and Nepal are participating in the first phase (with the Nepal project amounting to $3
            million) and Bhutan joined in the second phase.

         Promoting wildlife conservation in Asia through establishing a virtual regional center of excellence; improving existing
          park infrastructure; conducting species monitoring and recovery programs; preparing and implementing endangered
          species recovery plans; protecting inviolate areas for species conservation; implementing real-time field-based monitoring
          systems; developing landscape scale imaging platforms; strengthening enforcement of laws and regulations; and carrying
          out innovative research projects in wildlife conservation.
Results:
        Established a hotline for reporting illegal wildlife trafficking and other wildlife related crimes to the Wildlife Crime Control
         Unit (WCCU) in the Forest Department’s head office and seven divisional offices.
        Successful arrests of 171 wildlife crime offenders and rescue of 5,253 animals by the WCCU.
        Inter-agency coordination among WCCU, Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), Border Guard, Coast Guard, Customs, Police, and the
         Ministry of Foreign Affairs in combating wildlife and forest crime.
        Ongoing preparation of management plans for protected areas.
        Completion by 30 Forest Department officials of the Certificate Training Course on Wildlife Management at the Wildlife
         Institute of India.
        Ongoing census of Bengal Tigers in the Sundarbans using camera trapping.
        Ongoing implementation of 34 subprojects totaling $8.7 million on habitat improvement, eco-tourism development and
         human-wildlife conflict mitigation

As of August 2014
Project Background:
Low revenue mobilization in Bangladesh is a critical constraint to the government’s development aspirations. The level of tax
collection was 10.4 percent of GDP in 2012. Additional problems in tax administration include manual systems, governance
issues and lack of skilled staff. A new VAT tax law to take effect in 2015 will broaden the base and limit exemptions.
Project Development Objective and Components:
The objective is to improve revenue mobilization and transparency in administering the VAT.
The project seeks to strengthen organization of the core VAT functional areas including: VAT tax registration; tax return filing and
processing; tax payment; taxpayer accounting; tax refund; tax audit; tax collection and enforcement; tax appeal; and taxpayer services. It
also will develop and deploy an integrated VAT management system that will establish a central processing center and a contact center
operated by the private sector on contract. In addition, a communications campaign and other steps will prepare the public for the new
VAT law and strengthen institutional capacity of the National Board of Revenue, the Economic Relations Division and the Anti-Corruption
Commission.

As of August , 2014
Project Background:
 Bangladesh is the terminal floodplain delta of three large rivers: the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, and the Meghna – with over 90 percent
of their catchment areas situated outside the country. Each year during the monsoon season, 20 p e r c e nt t o 30 percent of
Bangladesh is flooded. While this creates opportunities for highly-productive farming and fishing systems, these are balanced by the
risks of deep flooding, erosion and drainage. By contrast, in the post-monsoon period, soil-moisture content declines rapidly and the
water deficit needs to be compensated by irrigation. Salinity intrusion, water-logging and the arsenic contamination of groundwater
aquifers further exacerbate the problem. Much work has been done in recent decades to prepare for disasters, but water
management remains a critical issue.
Project Development Objective and Components:
T h e W a t e r M a n a g e m e n t I m p r o v e m e n t P r o j e c t ( WMIP) aims to e n h a n c e water resources management in Bangladesh by
u p g r a d i n g infrastructure and institutions through rehabilitating damaged water infrastructure, piloting the role of local
communities and enhancing the institutional performance of the principal water institutions, particularly the Bangladesh Water
Development Board (BWDB) and the Water Resource Planning Organization (WARPO).
It supports the government’s goal to decentralize the authority of the BWDB and hand over its management responsibilities to community
organizations, where feasible. By taking the emphasis off flood control and focusing more on water management, the project shifts
responsibility from technicians and bureaucrats to a wide variety of community stakeholders who may participate at any stage of the
project development cycle. It also aims to rehabilitate the BWDB schemes damaged by the 2007 floods, and later on by a 2009 cyclone,
and to reform government institutions involved in the water sector by improving governance and transparency to enhance their
ability to better manage water systems.
