                      Section 4, “The Process Step-by-Step,” begins with establishing the objectives
                      of a scorecard project and ends with the development of final reports.


                      Section 5, “Measurable Outcomes,” describes results. This section covers four
                      case studies that relate outcomes from the perspectives of 5.1) a company; 5.2) a
                      chamber of commerce; 5.3) an institute of directors; and 5.4) a stock exchange.


                      Section 6, “Building on Scorecards,” contains a discussion of follow-on projects
                      and what happens after a scorecard project is completed.


                      Section 7, “Annexes,” contains 7.1) sample indicators; 7.2–7.4) model scorecards;
                      7.5) a feedback form; and 7.6) references.


                      Section 8, “Cross-References,” helps you identify existing scorecard projects and
                      locate 8.1) takeaway points and a discussion of scorecards by 8.2) the type of theme
                      or issue, 8.3) the type of scorecard user, or 8.4) country or region. For example, you
                      can use the cross-references to find a discussion on how to choose benchmarks,
                      examples of scorecard projects implemented by a stock exchange, or examples of
                      scorecards in Asia. This section also includes indexes of 8.5) figures and 8.6) tables.

There are three ways to conduct a scorecard assessment:                      often use a mix of approaches.
1) external assessments done by individuals outside the
company who collect and analyze data; 2) self-assessments,                   External assessments
particularly when the scorecard is on a Web-based platform;                  External assessments may be undertaken with or without
and 3) assisted self-assessments, a mixed approach. Table 4.3,               the participation of the company. In Example 4.25 on page

The choice of approach depends on the goals of the scorecard                 and information.

             The OECD Principles refer primarily to listed companies. Yet most companies are closely held or family-owned businesses,
             which face their own specific governance challenges. The scorecard example in Table 7.2 is for family-owned businesses. It is
             a spreadsheet program, which allows easy data collection and permits an immediate calculation of results.

The engagement of companies is of great importance to the success of a scorecard project. For this reason, it is important to
solicit feedback from corporate users to ensure that the scorecard and the scorecard project are properly designed and that
they are constantly improved. Table 7.3 is a sample feedback form that can be given to companies either after pilot testing or
after having completed a scorecard.37

The form is designed to elicit feedback on the format and content of the scorecard as well as on the process and outcomes.
Feedback forms can be administered annually after the completion of a set of scorings and inform a discussion in prepara-
tion for subsequent years’ scorings.
