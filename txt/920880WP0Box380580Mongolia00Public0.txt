THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

which had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100,
with 100 representing the best performance (the frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2015 report for

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

      without the need for involvement by the new business.

      The following documents should be submitted at GASR:
      1. Application form
      2. Company statutes
      3. Founders' official decision to start the company in writing
      4. Payment slip of the registration fees
      5. The name confirmation obtained in the previous visit
      6. Financial start-up balance sheet
      7. Copies of ID of founders

      Other related information:
      • If there are more than one founder, founders’ meeting minutes and
      decision from the founders meeting are required.
      • For business activities that require licenses must be registered first
      and update registration information after obtaining licenses from
      respective authorities.
      • If equity is non-financial asset, list of assets (if above Tg 5 million, the
      asset has to be evaluated by the Property evaluation agency) and if
      financial, the receipt of cash transfer to legal entity’s bank account is
      required.
      • The address for a legal entity can be the founder’s residential address.
      If the property is in applicant’s possession, a copy of property title and
      if the property is rented, a lease agreement (a notarized copy is
      required if the lease is signed with an individual and a signed and
      stamped copy is required if the lease is signed with a legal entity) is
      required.
      • Form UB 03, founder’s decisions, meeting minutes, decisions from
      founder’s meetings, and articles of association have to be signed by
      founder(s).
      • A slip to open a bank account should be picked up from the Service
      windows # 1 and 2 and open a bank account at any bank.

      Apply for social security with the Social Insurance Department

      Registration for social security with the social insurance department at
      the district is free (There is no regulated fee/payment for registration
      with social insurance office).
      Even though it is free of charge, the cost to pay for Social Insurance

      Now the social security office can get all the information concerning the
      company directly from the registration office. But one still has to
      register with the social security office separately so they could issue the
      social insurance certificate.
