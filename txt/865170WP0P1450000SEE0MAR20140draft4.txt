  Box 1. Data for shared prosperity in SEE6

  The unavailability (to the Bank and to the broader research community), comparability and quality
  of microdata are concerns in SEE6. To the extent that they affect the main data sources typically used
  for the analysis of poverty and shared prosperity (household budget surveys, labor force surveys),
  these issues limit the analysis and lessons that can be drawn regarding living standards, growth,
  poverty and inclusion. For this note, the analysis uses the latest available data in SEE6 countries,
  which in some cases (Bosnia and Herzegovina, FYR Macedonia) date to the pre-crisis period. The
  countries’ transition towards the adoption of the Survey of Income and Living Conditions (SILC)
  as a tool to monitor living standards, in line with the acquis communautaire, also poses issues in
  terms of breaks in the series. Finally, concerns for personal privacy under the acquis often limit data
  accessibility, even though the experience of some EU Member States shows that this does not need
  to be the case.

  The data situation by country is the following:

  Albania: Albania’s analysis is based on Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS) produced by
  the Albanian Institute of Statistics (INSTAT). They were conducted in 2002, 2005, 2008 and 2012,
  all with donor funding. The latest two sets of data (2008 and 2012) are publicly available on the
  INSTAT website, while the previous ones, collected with WB funding, are available on the LSMS
  website. Moving forward, the main constraint for monitoring both poverty and shared prosperity in
  Albania lies, as in the past, in the frequency of the surveys and availability of donor funding. Access
  to other surveys, namely the Household Budget Survey and Labor Force Survey, has been thus far
  limited.

  Bosnia and Herzegovina: the Household Budget Surveys (HBS) are conducted by the three
  statistical agencies in the country: BHAS, the Agency for Statistics of Bosnia and Herzegovina; RSI,
  the Republika Srpska Institute of Statistics and FOS, the Federal Office of Statistics. HBS’s have
  been conducted in 2004, 2007 and, in a pioneering extended format aimed at capturing the main
  SILC indicators, in 2011. These surveys have all been externally funded and failure to mobilize
  complementary national funds delayed implementation of the EHBS in 2010. Concerns remain
  regarding the ability of the country to conduct regular HBS’s, even though there are plans for the
  introduction of SILC with IPA funds. Data are not publicly available and access is typically regulated
  through Memoranda of Understanding that limit how the data can be used.

  Kosovo: The Kosovo poverty and shared prosperity analysis is based on the Household Budget
  Surveys conducted annually by the Kosovo Agency of Statistics since 2003. The latest available data
  refer to the year 2011. The main concern about the Kosovo HBS data is comparability over time. The
  HBS data for 2009 to 2011 are comparable, but comparability with other years is compromised by
  changes (largely improvements) in the survey instrument and sampling frame. A secondary concern
  is the limited access by others to the HBS data. Although KAS is very cooperative in sharing HBS
  data with the World Bank, its access policies for other organizations and local researchers are very
  restrictive, which limits the range of analysis conducted.

  Macedonia has also produced Surveys on Income and Living Condition (SILC), in line with EU
  countries. Official poverty numbers are now being calculated with the SILCs using an income-based
  relative poverty measure, which break the series of the traditional welfare measures based on the
  HBS. There are several data challenges for FYR Macedonia. HBS data concerns for rounds after
  2008 limit the analysis to up to that year. For the SILC, microdata access was granted on-site at the
  Statistics Office to the World Bank, but the available rounds of 2010 and 2011 do not allow for the
  calculation of the shared prosperity indicator given the still short series.

  Montenegro: Montenegro’s analysis is based on Household Surveys conducted by the Institute for
  Strategic Studies and Prognoses in years 2002, 2003 and 2004 and on the Household Budget Survey,
  harmonized with international standards and recommendations of EUROSTAT and with the UN.
  It has been conducted annually since 2005 by MONSTAT, the Statistical office of Montenegro.
  The latest available survey is 2011. At this time there are no pressing concerns with respect to the
  Montenegro HBS.

  Serbia: Since 2007, poverty in Serbia has been monitored through data from the Household Budget
  Surveys conducted annually by the Statistical Office. The latest published poverty figures are from
  2010, even though data have been collected regularly ever since. Different quality concerns have been
  raised. Issues with the small sample size, which leads to difficulties in drawing significant trends with
  the data, are planned to be addressed in 2015. In 2013, the Statistical Office has conducted the first
  round of the SILC survey with support from the World Bank and IPA funding. A second round is
  planned for 2014. The SILC has now become the official data source for poverty figures, though their
  nature is such that they are not comparable to the pre-2010 data.

  Given these data limitations, initial and final years for computing consumption growth rates are
  not consistent across all countries. The main periods and surveys considered for each country are:
  Albania (LSMS 2008–2012), Bosnia and Herzegovina (HBS 2007), Kosovo (HBS 2006–2011),
  FYR Macedonia (HBS 2003–2008), Montenegro (HBS 2006–2011) and Serbia (HBS 2007–2010).
  The different data sources have been harmonized and standardized by the World Bank Europe and
  Central Asia Team for Statistical Development.

  Finally, data on some aspects relevant to understand and monitor shared prosperity do not exist or
  are not accessible across countries. These include data on ethnicity (in some cases available but not
  shared), on land ownership and/or registration and on social capital. A more detailed country-by-

  Box 2. Literature review: Economic growth and the twin goals

  The literature on inclusive growth has established an empirical constant: economic growth is good for
  the poor in the sense that their income growth closely follows that of average income. This literature
  builds on a widely cited research by Dollar and Kraay (2002). Using a cross-country regression
  analysis for a sample of 92 countries over 1950–1999, they indeed find that the relationship between
  the growth of income of the poor and the growth of mean income is one-to-one, holding across
  regions, time periods, income levels and growth rates.

  Having become the standard methodology for the measurement of the poverty elasticity of growth,
  Dollar et al. (2013) recently updated it for the 1967–2011 period. The definition of poor earners
  was widened to include those in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution, in addition to
  those in the bottom 20 percent. The results remained consistent with the original findings: growth
  is good for the poor and their income increases relatively close to mean income, both for the bottom
  20 percent and the bottom 40.

  In an interesting nuance to this line of research, Campos-Vazquez et al. (2013) recently found that
  growth was also good for the very rich. Following the same specifications of Dollar and Kraay (2002)
  and Dollar et al. (2013), they measured the elasticity of growth, not only at the bottom of the income
  distribution but at the top. Using panel data from the World Top Incomes database, they found that
  the top 10 percent of the income distribution grew in proportion to that of the whole population.
  The income of the top one percent grew even more than the average income.

  Building on this literature, Lara-Ibarra and Lopez-Calva (2013) conducted an exercise to estimate
  the elasticity along the income distribution in the Europe and Central Asia region, taking a broad
  view in terms of growth and the incidence of growth. Using data from comparable household surveys
  for ECA countries between 1992 and 2009, they concluded that growth in ECA appeared to be on
  average slightly regressive. Growth did have an effect on poverty, although less than proportional to
  the growth of mean income, and seemed to be less beneficial for poorer individuals than for richer
  ones. While the elasticity at the bottom was lower than one in all specifications, it was above one at
  the top. Their results were consistent with the overall analysis of Milanovic and Ersado (2008), who
  looked at a similar period and found that growth tended to benefit more individuals in the upper
  tail of the distribution. The results are, however, more consistent with Dollar and Kraay (2002)
  and Dollar et al. (2013) when the period is restricted to 2002–2010. This preliminary exercise
  highlights two issues: first, the importance of looking at the incidence of growth throughout the
  whole distribution, and second, the sensitivity of the results to different periods of growth.

Beyond considerations of timing of policies,
with a bigger role for macroeconomic
variables in the short-run, the question of
potential short-term vs. long-term trade-offs
between policies also arises. The framework
proposes that policies should be guided by a
dynamic long-term view in which enhancing the
productive capacity of the bottom 40 percent
will have a positive impact on both economic
growth and equity. Given this long-term view
of a policy agenda aimed at promoting shared
prosperity, it is key to account for the economic,
social and environmental sustainability of the
policies to achieve the goal.

The proposed framework can guide the
thinking on shared prosperity, but can also
be relevant for poverty reduction. First, it is
important to note that there are key differences
between the two goals and their respective
indicators. Promoting the income growth of
the bottom 40 percent is a relative concept
and relevant to all countries across income
levels; furthermore, it does not target specific
households over time but whoever is placed
in the bottom 40 percent in each time period
(anonymous indicator). Poverty reduction,
in turn, is an absolute concept meaning that
poverty can be eliminated by targeting and
pushing above the poverty line a specific set
of the population: the poor. Despite these
differences, both reducing poverty and boosting
shared prosperity aim at increasing households’
income so the framework can guide the
thinking on both goals.

      Box 3. Social capital as an asset: the case of Albania

      Social capital refers to the institutions, relationships, and norms that shape the quality and quantity
      of a society’s social interactions. Social capital provides households with access to networks that could
      facilitate access to jobs, to credit, and to a cushion from asset depletion in the face of shocks Thanks
      to an ad-hoc module in the Albania 2012 LSMS, social capital can be included in the list of assets to
      study for comprehending shared prosperity.

      Results suggest that individuals in the bottom 40 percent have less social capital than those in the
      top 60 percent. These households have fewer networks: only 8 percent of individuals in the bottom
      40 percent declare to participate at least in one association (among a list of 19 groups ranging from
      trade unions to neighborhood associations and religious, cultural and political groups), as opposed
      to 16 percent of individuals in the top 60 percent. When asked if they would contribute in time or
      money to a community project that has benefits for many others in the village/neighborhood but not
      directly for themselves, only 35 percent of individuals in the bottom 40 percent would contribute
      money, as opposed to 46 percent in the top 60 percent. Only 10 percent in the bottom 40 percent
      would contribute time, as opposed to 18 percent in the top 60 percent. And fewer individuals in
      the bottom 40 percent have participated in any communal activities than in the top 60 percent
      (6 percent as opposed 8 percent). The perception of neighborhood safety is weaker for individuals in
      the bottom 40 percent: only 5 percent feel very safe from crime and violence staying alone at home
      as opposed to 12 percent of individuals in the top 60 percent. It is important to note, however, that
      access to networks are not always conducive to better economic opportunities, particularly for socially
      excluded groups as in the case of some ethnic minorities, if the networks are limited to their kin.
