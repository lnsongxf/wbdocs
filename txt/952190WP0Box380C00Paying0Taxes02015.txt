                                         This is the tenth year that the Paying Taxes
                                         indicator has been part of the World Bank Doing
                                         Business project. The journey over the period of
                                         the study has been an eventful and interesting
                                         one and the economic backdrop continues
                                         to present a challenging environment for

                                         Economic Co-operation and Development
                                         (OECD) has put forward proposals for changing
                                         the international tax rules to modernise them
                                         for today’s globalised business and to address
                                         concerns over base erosion and proğt shifting
                                         (BEPS). It is apparent that these proposals are
                                         already changing the way some tax authorities
                                         apply existing rules, leading to new and increased
                                         uncertainty for business, at least in the short
                                         term. Alongside all of this however there are
                                         two simple, mutually supportive objectives for
                                         governments to ensure that there are sufğcient
                                         public revenues for the future, to lay a foundation
                                         for sustained improvements in productivity, while
                                         at the same time incentivising investment and
                                         economic growth.

The Paying Taxes study remains unique. It is the                     This year we have also focussed more on the

their tax systems on a like-for-like basis. The                      information that we collect in addition to the core
results illustrate both successful reforms and                       Paying Taxes sub-indicators. We also include a

Our experience is that the ğndings of our study

governments and interest from the media to                           which we collect. Suggestions for other priority

In our tenth year there have been some
amendments to the methodology which is used
to derive the Paying Taxes sub-indicators and
the ranking. These changes have been made
in response to calls for the data to remain
current, to take into account the potential for

Paying Taxes – trends before and after the ğnancial crisis8



Taxes matter for the economy. They provide the sustainable funding
needed for social programmes and public investments to promote
economic growth and development and build a prosperous and orderly
society. But policy makers face a difğcult challenge in formulating
good tax policies they need to ğnd the right balance between raising
revenue and ensuring that tax rates and the administrative burden of tax
compliance do not deter participation in the system or discourage business
activity. This balancing act is intensiğed during periods of crisis. In an
economic downturn some categories of public spending may automatically
rise, putting pressure on değcits. Governments may at times need to
deliver tax-based stimulus packages while also providing reassurance to
markets that değcits will be reversed and public debt contained.

   Commercial proĺt is net proĺt before all taxes borne. It differs from the conventional proĺt before tax, reported in ĺnancial statements. In computing proĺt
   before tax, many of the taxes borne by a ĺrm are deductible. In computing commercial proĺt, these taxes are not deductible. Commercial proĺt therefore
   presents a clear picture of the actual proĺt of a business before any of the taxes it bears in the course of the ĺscal year. It is computed as sales minus cost of
   goods sold, minus gross salaries, minus administrative expenses, minus other expenses, minus provisions, plus capital gains (from the property sale) minus
   interest expense, plus interest income and minus commercial depreciation. To compute the commercial depreciation, a straight-line depreciation method is
   applied, with the following rates: 0 for the land, 5 for the building, 10 for the machinery, 33 for the computers, 20 for the of ĺce eTuipment, 20 for
   the truck and 10 for business development expenses. Commercial proĺt amounts to 59.4 times income per capita.

Patterns in tax reforms during
the crisis period
Over the nine year period ending in
2012, tax reforms peaked in 2008.
Doing Business recorded 118 changes
implemented that year making it easier
or less costly to pay taxes (Figureb1.4).22
The pace of reform slowed in the
period immediately after the crisis: in
2011 Doing Business recorded only 43
such changes.

on the latest results
The changes in the results since Paying Taxes 2014



Tax policy issues are becoming ever more challenging. There are pressures on tax
authorities to raise revenues, to fund social expenditures but also to ensure that their tax
system fosters business investment. The business environment is complicated and has the
potential to become even more so with complex tax legislation and onerous administrative
obligations. It is not surprising therefore that in the most recent edition of the PwC Global
CEO survey33 nearly two-thirds of CEOs around the world say the international tax system
is in urgent need of reform and 70% say the impact of tax on their company’s growth is
among their top concerns.

Explaining the changes in the
Total Tax Rate

As discussed in the previous sections, the movements in the average Total Tax Rate for the world and the separate
geographic regions between the data published in Paying Taxes 2014 for 2012 and the Paying Taxes 2015 data for 2013 have
been driven by signiğcant changes in a handful of economies. Although all but nine economies exhibited some movement in
their Total Tax Rate between the 2012 published data and the 2013 data, only seven decreased their Total Tax Rate by more
than ten percentage points and only three increased theirs by more than ten percentage points. The relative effects of these
movements on the global average Total Tax Rate is shown in Figure 2.7 below.

Paying Taxesb2015. This is shown in
Figureb2.11.

The main reason for the Guinean
decline is the growth of the economy
since 2005. The case study company
pays an International Monetary Fund
(IMF) minimum forfaitaire tax of
3%bof turnover, subject to a maximum
threshold of GNF 60 million. Before
the increase in GNIpc the company
paid the tax at 3.0% of turnover. Since
the increase, the company pays the
capped amount of GNF 60 million,
which is effectively 1.8% of turnover.
This has reduced the Total Tax Rate by
21.3bpercentage points.

The challenges
of tax reform

The latest results from the Paying Taxes study, discussed
throughout this report, show many economies are
continuing to make progress in tax reform. At the
same time, around the world there is still a lot of
scope for new or further actions to streamline
and simplify tax systems, to reduce economic
distortions and reduce the burden imposed
on business. Tax reform is therefore
set to remain an important topic for
governments around the world for
many years to come.

As shown by the decreases in the sub-indicators for the time to
comply and the number of payments over the course of the study,
and again this year, tax authorities are using electronic systems to
make tax processes easier, more accessible and more reliable for
taxpayers. Where online mechanisms that provide an interface
for ğling tax returns or paying taxes are made available, they are
often welcomed bybtaxpayers.

the underlying complexity of a tax
system, the reliability of the system
and the extent to which it is trusted by
taxpayers and tax authorities. In some
economies companies may still rely on
manual procedures for calculating tax,
particularly for taxes that depend on
calculations and self-assessment by the
taxpayer, such as corporate income tax.
The question as to whether systems
should be voluntary or mandatory
is also an interesting one; making a
voluntary ğling or payment system
mandatory will not resolve any of these
issues and would not be expected to
reduce the compliance time.                                                It should be noted that the existence

around the tax
compliance burden
and how tax systems
are perceived

Reducing the compliance burden to make tax collection
more efğcient brings beneğts for both government and
business. How tax policy is administered is critical to
ensure that tax laws are properly implemented and to
allow taxpayers to meet their obligations easily. Enabling
businesses to spend less time on tax compliance and
more time on building the business and contributing to
economic growth is clearly a valuable objective that is
worthy of additional study and analysis.

Where there are disputes between the
taxpayer and the tax authority that
cannot be resolved, it is important
that there is an independent, ef ğcient
appeals process in place. This may
well become even more important
in the future as the current changes
in international taxation such as
the OECD’s BEPS project may result
in increased disputes between
taxpayers and tax authorities and
between different tax authorities.
Tax authorities may need increased
resources to deal with thesebissues.

75              Paying Taxes 2015. PwC perceptions on how tax systems are changing
The regional breakdown of the
responses shown in Figure 3.10
suggests that post-ğling processes
are felt to be easier in the more
developed economies of North
America and Europe (noting that
with only three economies in the
North America region, a majority is
more easily achieved than in other
regions). South America is where
processes are perceived to be most
dif ğcult. It is interesting to see that
post-ğling processes in the Middle East
are considered to be the third most
diffcult, although the region has the
lowest average pre-ğling time.

As can be seen from Figure 3.11,
geographical pattern is broadly the
same for the efğciency of the appeals
process as it is for the ease of the
post-ğling processes. The one notable
exception is Central America & the
Caribbean where the perception is that
while the post-ğling process is easy to
deal with in the majority of economies,
the independent appeals process is
considered to be ef ğcient in only 20%
of the economies in the region.

Furthermore, as the number of reliefs
and incentives increases, a tax regime
will become increasingly complex. In
the context of the Paying Taxes study,
contributors were asked if a special tax
regime exists for a small to medium
sized company in their economy.
Contributors in 48% of economies
around the world indicated that such a
special regime exists. Interestingly for
those who answered ‘yes’ (and where
the case study company qualiğed under
the special regime) the average time to
comply was 20% higher than for those
who said that no such regime existed as
shown in Figure 3.15.

All Brazilian taxpayers, large and
small, deserve a tax environment
with greater simplicity, fairness and
legalbstability.

Movements to seek these objectives
have been announced by the tax
authorities, political parties and
society as a whole. However, these
efforts at tax reform have always come
up short against the impossibility of
accommodating the demands for tax
revenue from the various government
entities involved.

The leading candidates in the 2014
presidential elections indicated that tax
reforms are part of their plans. We can
only hope that Brazil will overcome the
usual political deadlocks and ğnally
achieve true tax reform, making the
tax system simpler and more efğcient
and increasing the competitiveness
of Brazilian companies in the
international marketplace.
