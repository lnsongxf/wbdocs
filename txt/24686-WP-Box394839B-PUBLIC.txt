                               · EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
I


     (i)    A review of World Bank investments in rural water and sanitation (RWSS) since 1977
    suggests that the Bank is missing an opportunity to tum these investments into improvements in
    health among project beneficiaries. The Bank has put increasing emphasis on rural water and
    sanitation (RWSS): 15 such projects have been completed; 21 are being implemented; and 19 are ·
    in the pipeline. However, these stand-alone pr~jects represent only. part of the total RWSS
    pictµre. Many RWSS investments are in non-stand-alone projects or project components funded
    through social investment or agriculture development funds or implemented in conjunction with
    urban water and sanitation infrastructure projects: These "other" RWSS investments total 94: 24
    completed, 49 in implementation~ and 21 in the pipeline. The Bank's Office of Evaluation and
    Development (OED) (1999) estimates that these investments are worth $3,452 million. Often
                                                                      0

    thef are planned and implemented essentially apart from the Bank's health and water and
    sanitation sector. Responsible task managers may be unaware of the body of knowledge about
    the:relationship between water and sanitation and health and not well-versed in ways to design
    and implement RWSS projects so that health effects are likely to be obtained.          ·

    (ii)    The crux of the matter is that RWSS projects will not achieve the health effects that one
    might assume would result from the provision of safe drinking water and sanitation unless these
    projects include hygiene, sanitation, and health interventions leading to key improvements in
    personal, household, and community hygiene behavior. Water and sanitation infrastructure by
    itself does not bring health benefits; although it brings other valuable benefits and creates
    conditions favorable to health.                             .


                                        PURPOSE AND METHOD


    (iii)    The review was carried out by the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) Regional Studies
     program for the express purpose of making RWSS projects' more health-results oriented. The
     number of "other" RWSS projects or project c·omponents is particularly high in the ECA region:
     ofa total of 14 projects, three are stand-alone and 11 fall into the "other" category. As the ECA
     region expands its work in RWSS, there is a need to educate and support bank project staff. In
     addition, a survey to of Bank staff, conducted by the Rural Water Supply Thematic Group in
    May 1997, identified a strong interest among a range of professionals working in RWSS to
     determine the best design, implementation, and monitodng procedures· for the hygiene,
     sanitation, and health components 'of RWSS projects. Finally, ECA health-sector studies have
     noted that RWSS interventions that promote improved hygiene may be the most cost-effective
    Sanitation. Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects

 way to improve the poor health of rural populations, particularly with respect to water-borne
 diseases.

(iv)    The authors of the study reviewed professional literature on best practices and lessons
 learned in RWSS and all available reports on the World Bank RWSS projects or project
 components. They interviewed Bank task managers on the current status of activities in
 implementation as well as internationally recognized experts in research and training outside the
Bank. Finally, fieldwork was conducted to assess the performance of the hygiene, sanitation, and
 health component of a well-designed RWSS project in implementation (the Ghana RWSS).


                                       WSS AND HEALTH


 (v)     The United Nations designated the 1980s as the International Drinking Water Supply and
 Sanitation Decade to respond to severe deficiencies in water and sanitation coverage in
 developing countries. At the outset of the Decade, 1.2 billion out of a total Third World
 population of 2.2 billion (China was not included in the statistics at the time) were without·
 access to safe drinking water; 1. 7 billion had no proper means of excreta disposal. As a result, an
 estimated 10 million people a year were dying from diseases directly related to poor sanitation.
 The Water Decade realized significant achievements-water-supply coverage was extended,
 some water-related diseases declined steeply, and low-cost technologies were developed-
 however, sanitation did not fare so well. Advances in sanitation coverage did not keep pace with
 population growth during the Decade, and since 1990, rural sanitation coverage has declined (to
 34% in 1994). Today, according to the World Health Organization, 3 billion people are without
 adequate means of excreta disposal; 3 .3 million die every year from diarrheal diseases, and, at
 any one time, 1.5 million suffer from parasitic worm infections stemming from human excreta
 and solid wastes in the environment.
                                                                                                  -
(vi)     Countries in the ECA region face problems with RWSS coverage. In most Central and
Eastern European countries and in the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union,
water is piped into the homes of 90% of urban dwellers, but rural coverage is much lower, as is
rural sanitation. For example, only 45% of the rural population of Kyrgyzstan has access to
running water, and, even in urban areas, one-third of the extremely poor are not connected to
piped water, and sanitation facilities are even more limited. Moving westward, rural water
 supply coverage is 32% in Romania and only 18% in Moldova. Because the ECA region deals
 largely with developed countries, complacency may set in regarding the impacts of adequate
water and sanitation on health. However, Murray and Lopez (1977) have shown that poor water,
 sanitation, and hygiene are still among the ten most important risk factors for burden of disease
throughout the ECA region.

(vii)   Water supply and sanitation improvements affect health primarily by interrupting or
 reducing the transmission of disease agents. Increasing the quantity of water allows for better
 hygiene (for example, hand washing, food washing, and household cleaning.) Improving the
 quality of water reduces the ingestion of pathogens. Providing a safe means of excreta disposal
 reduces the number of pathogens in the environment and is of utmost importance-more
 important than improvements in water supply. In fact, improvements in sanitation and hygiene
                                                  ii
    Sanitation. Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects

 have been shown consistently to result in better health, as measured by less diarrhea, reduction in
 parasitic infections, increased child growth, and reduced morbidity and mortality (Feachem et al.
 1983; Esrey et al. 1991; Hutley et al. 1997).

(viii)    The level of sanitation in a given community is extremely important. It is the community
  level of sanitation that has an impact on individual health, rather than an individual's possession
  of a safe excreta removal system (Ahmed et al.1994). Sixty to 75% coverage is recommended for
  optimal health effect. Likewise, the whole community should practice safe hygiene practices.
  Unsafe practices of a few can threaten an entire community.

 (ix)    Research also shows that an increase in the quantity of water has a greater impact on
 health than improved water quality. This is so because an improved water supply makes it
 possible (or at least a lot more feasible) for people to adopt safe hygiene behaviors (Caimcross
  1992). However, improvements in the quantity and quality of water supply-as well as
  improved sanitation-do not automatically result in improved health. The addition of hygiene
  education is often required to see health impacts (Esrey 1994). The most critical hygiene
  behaviors to target are safe disposal of feces (especially for young children), hand washing
 techniques and timing, and safe source selection, transport, and use of water (Bateman and Smith
  1991).

 (x)    Studies of 144 WSS interventions (Esrey et al. 1990) found that WSS improvements were
 associated with a median reduction of 22% in diarrhea incidence and 65% in the rate of deaths
 due to diarrhea. Improved excreta disposal and hand washing were associated with reduced
 mortality rates of 60% for children under five and reductions of schistosomiasis by 77%,
 ascariasis by 29%, and·trachoma by 27-50%.

 (xi)    RWSS investments are cost-effective. Each dollar spent in a rural water system provides
 four times the population coverage afforded by an investment in urban water (OED 1999).
 Furthermore, the hygiene components of water and sanitation projects are highly. cost-
 effectiveness in preventing diarrheal disease. A recent study estimated that hygiene behavior
 change interventions, carried out in communities where people already have access to adequate
 water and sanitation, cost $3 per case of diarrhea averted, $700 per death averted, and $20 per
 DALY (disability-adjusted life year-a measure that combines deaths and cases averted) saved.

(xii)    Over twenty years of development experience by the Water and Sanitation for Health
 (WASH) project sponsored by the U.S. Agency for International Development pointed to the
 need to link water, sanitation, hygiene. Any temptation to delink these components should be
 resisted as long as health improvement is a goal. In the absence of improved sanitation and
 hygiene practices, there is very little chance that a RWSS project will significantly impact health.


                            ESSENTIAL PROJECT DESIGN ELEMENTS



(xiii)   Much more evidence is available, but it has taken time for the results of research to
  impact project design. During the Water Decade, service coverage and construction were
  .emphasized, and performance monitoring focused on infrastructure targets. It is now clear,
                                                  iii
     Sanitation. Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects

 however, that sanitation and hygiene behaviors are equally-if not mor~important in disease
 prevention. A RWSS project should no longer be measured solely by numbers of standpipes,
 household connections or pit latrines (the hardware of the project). Hygiene and sanitation and
 social and individual behaviors (the software of the project) should also be monitored to ensure
 that health objectives are met. Because hygienic practices are so important for achieving lasting
 health benefits and thus maximizing project impacts, WSS projects should not confine their
 objectives to provision of infrastructure but should include hygiene, sanitation, and health
 activities.

(xiv)     The most basic means of assessing the success of any RWSS program is evidence of
  sustained improvements in health (Cairncross 1992). On the basis ofexperience, it is possible to
  identify the strategies that increase the likelihood of sustainability.

 •    An· effective program of health promotion should be aimed at creating an environment
      enabling people to live in healthier surroundings and to adapt healthier lifestyles. This kind
      of program includes infonnation, education, and communication (IEC) as well as advocacy
      activities to bring about changes in policy, legislation, and economic and other incentives.

 •    Because the health promo~ion component of RWSS falls within tl;ie scope of the ministry of
      health and often the ·ministry of education, inter-sectoral collaboration· is called for.
      Likewise, RWSS projects can benefit generally if Bank infrastructure, environment, and
      health departments cooperate.

 •   Community participation leading to community empowennent on issues that concern
     residents is another key strategy. Participatory activities should involve women, men, girls,
     and boys from different socioeconomic and cultural groups, should extend to planning and
     implementation, and should infonn health promotion approaches.

 •     A demand-responsive approach is now the preferred alternative to the traditional supply-side
       approach. It may be thought of as an extension of community participation. In this
     . approach, citizen demand guides key decisions, including investments to be made.
      Sustainability appears to be higher in communities where a demand-responsive approach was
       used and where demand was expressed directly by household members, not traditional
       leaders or community representatives,

 •    Setting goals and monitoring progress toward them is essential, but it is not ·an easy matter.
      International organizations have struggled for years with the difficulty of measuring health
      effects. The International Research Centre (IRC) for Water Supply and Sanitation advocates
     .the decentralization of monitoring and evaluation so that responsibility is placed with those
      who have a vested interest in positive change. It stresses the need to use simple indicators,
      limit their number, and retarget monitoring when necessary and to plan for the use of·
      monitoring from the beginning~including the orientation and trajning of those involved.
     ·Other organizations and the Bank's OED have also developed recommended objectives and
      monitoring indicators.

                                    REVIEW OF BANK RWSS PRO.lECTS ·



     (xv)·· The study reviewed 44 of the Bank's 149 completed, ongoing; or planned RWSS.projects
      or projects with rural water S\lpply project coQJ.ponents. 'fhe 44 includedl2 projects carried out
      between 1977 and 1986 and evaluated by the Bank's Office of Evaluation and Development
      (OED), none of which were from ECA. The study reviewed 32 projects prepared or
      implemented between 1991 and 1999. Of these 32, 16 are from ECA. Of the 16 ECA projects
      reviewed, three are stand-alone RWSS projects (Kazakhstan,· T,urkmenistan and Uzbekistan
      RWSS projects); and two are pilot RWSS projects conducted under preparation of the
      Kazalchstan and Uzbekistan RWSS projects. The remainder of the 16 ECAprojects reviewed,
      i.e. Jteven projects, are ECA non-water sector projects with rural water supply (and sometimes
      sanitation) components. These are generally rural development projects and s,0cial funds. Non-
      w~ter sector projects with RWSS components in regions other than ECA were not reviewed.· The
      annexes, of_the study include brief descrjptions of ll10st of these .projects.

    (xvi)    Of the ECA projects reviewed, the stand-alone proj~cts are very new;: none is up and
      runQing. The "other" projects, non-water sector, are. also rel~tively new with none completed.
     'H:owever, because non-sector projects account for roughly 50% of the ECA investm~nts in
      RWSS, they warrant investigation. All were thoroughly reviewed, with special attention to
      choice and application of· key performanqe monitoring indicators; the degree to which
      community-based approaches to gathering information and evaluating performance have been
      applied; design and implementation of hygiene, sanitation, and health activitie!); and monitoring
      and evaluation. Non-ECA RWSS projects were reyiewed for key policies; hygiene, sanitation,
      and health components; service and financial options; training investments; and participation.
     The.annexes of the study include detailed descriptions of the ECA projects,

    (xvii)     The key findings of the review are listed below.

      •       Examples of .completed World Bank RWSS projects with documented h~alth impacts are
              very rare. Most projects report improved health as an impact but very few have baseline
              information or monitoring sufficient to make this claim. Several factors account for this.
              World Bank RWSS projects have multiple objectives, such as poverty reduction, institutional
              reform, utility efficiency, cost recovery, improved service delivery, and health
              improvements. Non-water sector projects with RWSS components, by definition, have
              µiultiple sectoral objectives and thus an. added layer of performance monitoring indicators.
              Since task managers are required to limit performance monitoring indicators to around six,
              monitoring indicators related to sanitation, hygiene, and health may not be included. This is
          · . true for those RWSS projects with and those without· a hygiene,. sanitation; and health
              component..

      •      Non-water sector, "other," projects with RWSS components are often well placed to
             implement the hygiene, sanitation, and health promotion activities that would enhance the
             benefits of the water supply investment. They tend tq adopt approaches to project design and
             implementation that differ from traditional RWSS projects. · ·For example, social
          :. development projects utilize demand-responsive approaches, community-based activities,

                                                        v
      Sanitation. Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water SuJJ..PlV and Sanitation Projects

       and public awareness and educational promotion. However, the review found only one social
       fund in the ECA region, Moldova, which proposed hygiene, sanitation, and health activities.

  •    Most of the Bank's RWSS projects riow in implementation with hygi~ne, sanitation, and
       health components include the key ingredients :for success with the exception of a well-
       defined monitoring and evaluation program.

  • .. Participation .of beneficiaries and stakeholders and use of the demand responsive approach
       have been increasing in the World Bank RWSS projects.

  •    Bank RWSS projects typically allocate about 10% of the total project cost to the hygiene,
       sanitation, and health component. No information was found on the cost to implement the
       monitoring and evaluation program for any RWSS project or its components.

  •    Bank-wide, it is very rare for policy issues or training related to strengthening of the public
       health policies, institutions, and staff to be included in RWSS projects. ECA is in the
       forefront ·with, thre.e R WSS projects (stand-alone and ~'other"). emphasizing .training arid
       institutional capacity building of the public health services, including surveillance and health
       and water quality moQitoring.

  •      In ECA region projects, when there was a public. health sj>ecialist on the R WSS project
      . (stand alone and "other") team, the project had a hygiene, sani~tion, and health component
        and health indicators. When there was no public health presence, even for projects of a very
        similar nature, there was no hygiene/sanitation component.

  •   RWSS project design in the ECA region has been significantly guided by the results of social
      needs assessments. Pilot projects that further investigated issues uncovered by such
      assessments. and that demonstrated new community-based ~pproaches to R WSS were also
      very useful in preparation ofECA RWSS projects.

(xviii)   The study's recommendations focus· on improving_ the hygiene, sanitation, and health
   aspects of RWSS.                                                                   ·

 (xix)    The tint recommendation is directed to operational staff at· the Bank: ·if health
   benefits are an objective of a RWSS project or component, in.elude hygiene, sanitation, and
   health interventions. This demands that you think about health from the start. Get good
   ba5eline information and include health specialists on · the project · team.        Related
   recommendations   arelisted below.

      • Conduct social analyses and use pilot projects to guide project design.
      • Include the ministry of health as a key partner.
      • Include institutional strengthening, capacity building, and training aimed at the public
          health sector, in the project.

 (xx) .The second recommendation, also directed to operations staff, underlines the
  importance of monitoring and evaluation: when the project gets underway, immediately set
  up a monitoring and evaluation program. This implies a number of related recommendations.

      •      Establish baseline information on knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to water
             supply and sanitation, and on health status during project preparation.
      •      Monitor and evaluate health impacts using a combination of quantitative and qualitative
             methods. Health statistics are fine if you have them but hygiene and health behaviors
             can be used as proxies effectively, and at less expense.
      •   · Consider using a two-tier approach to performance monitoring. The· first tier is the half
             dozen indicators for the entire project. The second tier is more detailed and is used by
             the borrower staff arid managers to monitor a wider range range of inputs, outputs, and
             activities.                                                   ·
      •      For many projects, a community-based monitoring program is. the best choice of
             methodology.· It should be participatory, and benefi~iaries need to u9derstand the reason
           . for monitoring.
      •      Document project impacts in project files

(xxi)     The third major recommendation. is addres.sed to the Bank as an institution: require that
  all projects with significant investme,:its in rural water supply and a goal of improved health,
  include hygiene, sanitation, and health interventions .. Related recommendations follow.

      •     Provide clinics for staff new to water, sanitation, hygiene, and sanitation.
      •     Include staff from non-water sector, "other," projects with RWSS components in Bank
            committees and working groups on the topic ..
      •     Ma:ke tools for designing and implementing hygiene, sanitation, and health interventions
            readily available.                                                                    ·
      •     Support the use of interdisciplinary teams.
      •     Conduct a Bank-wide review of the non-water sector, "other," projects with rural water
            supply investments and investigate the use, and impact, of hygiene, sanitation, and health
            int~rventions.


(xxii)    The authors of the study hope that the findings and recommendations will spur discussi9n
  of these important issues and lead to adoption of approaches to. RWSS that will .insure greater
  health impacts from Bank investments.

                      ... ·METHODS
1.1 '. Every year, millions of the world's poorest people die from preventable diseases caused
by inadequate water supply and excreta disposal, or sanitation, services. ·Women and children
are the main victims. Burdened by the need to carry water fong distances every day, sometimes
up to eight hours, they jpust also endure the indignity and sickness tlu!.t result from a lack of
hygienic sanitation. Unreached by public services, people in rural areas make their own
inadequate arrangements or pay excessively high prices to water vendors for meager water
supplies of dubious quality.· Their poverty is aggravated and their productivity impaired, while
their sickness puts severe strains on health services arid hospitals.

1.2      Human waste is a major polluter of surface and ground water resources. Scarcity of
water is a major consideration throughout the world. Industrialization, tourism, and food security
may. be threatened, unless water resources are protected and conserved. These and other
environmental and economic considerations provide a solid rationale for improving water and
sanitation services for the poor. However, the present study focuses on health considerations--,-
the potentilll impact water supply and sanitation programs can have on the health conditions of
beneficiaries.    '     · ·    ·        · ·                                      ·


                                         STUDY OBJECTIVES



1.3 . Thus, the goal of the study,"which is funded by the World Bank's Europe and Central
Asia (ECA) Regional Studies Program, is to improve the design and implementation of World
Bank rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) projects in order to achieve greater health
ben~fits. ECA health-sector studies have ~oted that RWSS interventions that promote i~proved
health and hygiene practices may be the most cost-effective way to improve poor ·health
conaitions of rural populations, particularly with respect to Waterborne diseases. These findings
accord with the professional· literanire (see Chapter 2), which emphasizes that full health benefits
from water and sanitation projects can be attained only if hygiene and sanitation are an integral
part of such projects.                                          ·

1.4      The study meets a need expressed by Bank personnel. A survey of Bank staff interests in
RWSS, conducted by the Rural Water Supply Thematic Group in May 1997, identified a strong
interest among a range

hygiene, sanitation, and health components ofRWSS projects.

1.5      Within the ECA region the RWSS portfolio is relatively new but growing with new
stand-alone RWSS projects, as well as new Social Fund or Rural Development projects or larger .
urban projects that have a RWSS component. As ECA expands its work in RWSS, there is a
need to educate and support project staff. This need has arisen, not only because there are more
projects; other factors also come into play: the unsatisfactory performance of a number of RWSS
projects bank-wide; the increased attention to RWSS' in ECA and the unique characteristics of
ECA countries where RWSS projects have been jmplemented; the recent development of new
tools that can be used to measure health impacts (e.g., Disability-Adjusted Life Years-DALYs);
and. the developing body of ECA experience/expertise. with social and behavioral aspects of
RWSS projects.                      ·       ·     ·       ·              ·                   '

1.6     Around the world, policymakers and practitioners seek to qeal with the enormous need
for WSS, in part by building on knowledge and experience that are already available. It may
sometimes be difficult for practitioners to· find and share information on the lessons ruid
experiences encountered in the WSS sector-particularly if th,ey come from a non-WSS sector
background. This study is one attempt to bring together the Bank's expe~ience in WSS-with an
emphasis on rural programs-in a useful format for staff. .                         .


                                   THE HISTORICAL SETTING


 1. 7    WSS moved up on the development agenda more than 20 years ago. The 1977 United
 Nations Water· Conference in Mar del · Plate, Argentina, recommended that the 19SOs be
 proclaimed the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (IDWSSD).
 Interagency collaboration in WSS also started in the 1980s, specifically through the Water
·Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council, the World Water Council, and the Global Water
 Partnership. At the time, the picture was dismal: 1.2 billion people out of a total Third World
 population of 2.2 billion (China was not included in the statistics at the time) were without
 access to sare drinking water; 1. 7 billion had no proper means of excreta disposal. As a result, an
 estimated 10 million people a year were dying from diseases directly related to poor sanitation.

1.8      The launch of the .IDWSSD in 1980 gave WSS a publicity bqost and led to conc~rted
efforts to speed up progress. However, it would have required enormous. investments to reach
the Decade's targets of 100% coverage of WSS by 1990. Nevertheless, the past two decades of
investments in the rural and urban water and sanitation sector in developing countries have led to
notable improvements in coverage. During the· IDWSSD, one billion people obtained safe
drinking water and 750 million gained access to improved sanitation facilities~ Significant
progress has also been made towards eradication of diseases directly linked to water supply, e.g.,
dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease). Benefits related to an improved quality of life have been
realized through WSS. For example, the time and energy spent by women and glrls in collecting
water have been reduced, and sanitary latrines have pi;ovided privacy. However, because
extending WSS coverage has not kept pace with population growth, the percentage of people
unserved has not changed substantially.

                                                              . '   .....




   Sanitation. Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects


L9       Global coverage for water supply was 61 % in 1990 for rural and urban areas combined,
but only 50% 'for rural areas. By 1994, rural coverage globally reached 70% .. However,
sanitatiOn did not make similar gains: Sanitation coverage fell in the 1990s from 36% in 1990 to
34%'in 1994, globally. According to World Health Organization estimates, more than 3 billion
people are without adequate means of excreta: disposal, 3.3 million people die every year from
diarrheal diseases, and at any one tim:e 1.5 million suffer from parasitic worm infections
stemming from human excreta and solid wastes in the environment.

 1.10 · · On a more positive note, the 1990s saw the development of low-cost water and sanitation
 tecbnologies-,-providing affordable systems is a key strategy for increasing coverage. A shift in
 WSS projects also became evident in the early 1990s, more notably outside of the Bank than
 within,. from an emphasis on infrastructure (or "hardware") to hygiene, sanitation, and health
 promotion and .education ("software"). The role of the community and participatory approaches
·were also developed during this period. A cautious transition to informed user choice, coupled
 with. a wider range ·of options to choose from, can also be noted. In principle, poorer communities
 and· households should be able to install and use a service they can manage and maintain, without
 depending totally on government.

 Lil     As community participation gained in importance in WSS, gender issues emerged as
critfoal elements. Programs such as PROWESS (Promotion of the Role of Women in Water and
Environmental Sanitation) and research carried out by the International Research Center (IRC) in
The.Hague have addressed gender-specific needs. The IRC's Internet journal, "Women, Water
and. Sanitation," · is a particularly rich source of information on the topjc.
(http://www.irc.nl/products/publications/ajw/index.html)

  1.12. ·Past efforts have also resulted in better quality design and system performance, leading
  to greater use of facilities, and involvement of women in water management. While more is
  known about how to overcome practical gender constraints, real changes in strategies are rare:
. much of women's participation in maintenance and management consists largely of contributing
  labor and time, not exercising control. However, many participatory water systems have been in
  pla6e for ten years or more and it is now possible. to assess what effect real participation has on
  the isustainability of services (VanWijk-Sijbesma 1998). For more information on research on
  this topic, see http://www.irc.nl/home/pben/pbengend;htm.                       ·


                                 THE WSS SITUATION IN ECA



1. l3    Bank work in the health, environment, and water sector~ has found that ECA countries
face problems with RWSS coverage. All National Environmental. Action Plans (NEAPs)
completed in the· former Soviet Union have id~ntified RWSS as one of the top environmental
priorities. Many of the NEAPs in other ECA countries have also found that RWSS is a top
priority. The National Environmental Health Action Plans, where they have been conducted
within the health sector, also have identified inadequate supplies of clean drinking water and
sanitation.a~ a top public health priority (for example, in the Krygyz Republic).

   Sanitation. Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects

1.14    In most Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, and in the Newly Independent
States of the Former Soviet Union (NIS), more than 90% of urban households have access to
piped water supplies, but the coverage in rural areas is much less. Likewise, sanitation coverage
is much less in rural areas. As an ECA example, in the Kyrgyz Republic, social infrastructure is
seriously lacking in rural areas and in many parts of urban areas. Only. 45% of the rural
population has access to running water, and, even in urban areas, one-third of the extremely poor
are not connected to piped water. Sanitation facilities are, if anything, more limited. The rural
population, poor and non-poor, use latrines, as do the majority of the poor in urban areas as weH
(Scott 1998). In Tajikistan, the majority of rural people, which make up 60% of the total
population, obtain water from open irrigation canals for about nine months, when the systems are
operational, and· pay for trucked supplies for the remainder of the year. Formerly, some state
farms had their own pumps and treatment plants, but many ·of these have collapsed. The
problems are not just in Central Asia. Moving westward, rural water supply coverage is 32% in
Romania and only 18% in Moldova (WHO 1999) with similar conditions experienced in other
Eastern European countries.

1.15     Are there any unique features in the ECA region that might be important to note
concerning RWSS? Few data provide direct insight into the impact that the economic and social
transition process has h~d on drinking water quality. Most water pollution is localized and often
linked to discharges of human wastes, rather than to industrial or other economic activities. High
nitrate levels in rural drinking water supplies have been suggested as environmental health
problems in Belarus, Bulgaria, Hungary, Lithuania, Slovakia, Estonia, and Kazakhstan (Hughes
et al. (draft) 1999) but their impact is limited to infants and young children. On the other end of
the spectrum, the transition may have had some positive impacts on drinking water quality. It is
expected that non-point source agricultural pollution has declined. While this does not translate
into immediate improvements in water quality, people who rely on shallow ground water sources
may benefit from such declines in pollution. However, improvements related to declined
economic activity may be elusive for several reasons: (i) the accumulation of pollutants in
sediments and their subsequent release diminishes the effects of relatively short-term emission
reductions; (ii) declining capital stock may defer operations and maintenance measures; (iii) ·
pollution abatement efforts may slack due to the general economic crisis; and (iv) environmental
management and regulation may be weakened. No doubt the transition period has seen times of
weakened public health services that would also contribute to the negative impacts on health.
Furthermore, for 70 years, the former Soviet Union countries regarded water as a free good. This
perception has shaped the attitudes of authorities, water producers, and consumers alike.
1.16     The Environmental Action Program (EAP) for Central and Eastern Europe (1993) points
to. the negative health impacts of environmental degradation as a criteria for setting action
priorities. Because the ECA region deals largely with developed countries, complacency may set
in regarding the impacts of inadequate WSS on health. Some may tend to discount the true
health-as well as environmental and economic-impacts of environmental conditions.
However, Murray and Lopez (1997) have shown that poor water, sanitation, and hygiene are still
among the ten most important risk factors for burden of disease throughout the ECA region.

reviewed documentation on 44 World Bank-financed RWSS projects (see list in Annex 1)
covering two decades (1977-1997); (iii) interviewed Bank task managers and specialists outside
the Bank; and (iv) facilitated a.field.assessment of a successful Bank-financed RWSS project in
Ghana.

1.18   Works consulted forthe literature review of best practices and lessons learned in RWSS
and hygiene, sanitation, and hygiene included:

     •        professional literature on health impacts ofWSS and hygiene and health promotion
              interventions;
     •      . publications from other development institutions, including from UNICEF (the United
              Nations Children Fund), IRC in The Hague, USAID's Environmental Health Project, and
              CARE;
      •       the Bank's literature on RWSS and hygiene, sanitation, and health;
      •       the Bank's Strategic Sanitation Guidelines (for urban sanitation);
      •       Sanitation Guidelines produced by WHO/UNICEF/USAID; and
    · •.   · documents on RWSS projects sponsored by other organizations, to identify best practices
              that have contributed to positive health jmpacts and sustained outcomes.

1.19     Review of 44 Bank-financed stand-alone RWSS projects or projects ·with RWSS
components included 12 projects carried out between 1977 and 1986 and evaluated by the Office
of Evaluation and Development (OED) 1 and 32 projects prepared and/or implemented between
1991 and 1999. Of these 16 are from the ECA region. The authors reviewed all available reports
on the 44·projects, i.e., the World Bank's OED reports (12 OED reports from 1977-1986),
Project Performance Audit Reports (PPARs), Project Completion Documents (PCDs), Staff
Appraisal Reports (SARs), Impact Evaluation Reports (IERs), Form 590 (for Bank Portfolio
Project-Status Reports), and·the Bank's Project Supervision Format (Form 590 and A-M tables).
Task managers were interviewed for first-hand information on the current status of these projects
in terms of performance monitoring updates. The 12 OED-reviewed projects were scanned for
project development. objectives; key indicators of development outcome/impact; and
identification of other performance indicators (see Annex 2). The 32 Bank-financed RWSS
projects were reviewed for their main development objectives and the key indicators of
development outcome/input.                                ·

development projects that include RWSS components (see Annex 5). The methodology for
review was different for the ECA projects because (i) the stand'."alone projects are very new and
none is fully up and running, (ii) the non-water sector projects are also relatively new with none
completed to date, and (iii) the non-sector projects account for roughly 50% of the ECA
investments in RWSS and thus warrant investigation (this may be true for other regions but the
study focuses on ECA). All 11 projects were reviewed for:

1.22 Field work was conducted to analyze the peiformance of the hygiene, sanitation, and

because it met the following selection criteria.

    •   health improvement was its objective;
    •   it utilized a demand-based approach for the sanitation component;
    •   it had been in implementation sufficiently long to see results; and
    •   it was located in a region where other donors are active in RWSS (so that other
        approaches could be analyzed).

1.23 The field work was carried out in two and a half weeks in November 1998. The
methodology and instruments used for the survey were focus group discussion; interviews;
review of results; and site visits and observations. Bank-financed RWWS projects in Ghana are
coordinated with projects financed by Danida and WaterAid. To obtain a total picture ofRWSS,
the consultant preparing the assessment visited 13 communities (8 participating project
communities [three funded by Danida, two by WaterAid, and three by the Bank] and 5 non-
participating communities. Thirty-eight stakeholders at the national, regional, and district levels
were interviewed. A separate report of the field study was prepared and is available through the
Europe and Central Asia Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development Unit (ECSSD).

       CHAPTER 2. THE CONTRIBUTION OF RWSS TO
                  IMPROVED HEALTH

2.1     Water supply and sanitation improvements affect health primarily by interrupting or
reducing the transmission of disease agents. Increasing the quantity of water allows for better
hygiene, i.e., hand washing, food washing, and household cleaning. Improving the quality of
water reduces the ingestion of pathogens.

2.2       The findings of research on RWSS are somewhat counter-intuitive. Most people think
that it is clean drinking water which has the greatest impact on health, when, in fact, research has
consistently shown that health benefits from improved water are less pronounced than those for
sanitation. .Benefits from improved water occur .only when sanitation is improved and only
when optimal water is present (Esrey 1996). The safe disposal of feces (sanitation) is of primary
importance in the interruption/reduction of disease transmission. Improvements in sanitation and
hygiene have been shown consistently to result in better health, as measured by less diarrhea,
reduction in parasitic infections, increased child growth, and reduced morbidity· and mortality
(Feachem et al. 1983, Esrey et al. 1991; Hutley et al. 1997). Research also shows that increases
in the quantity of water has more of an impact on improved hea~th than improved water qua/ity-
again because of the improved hygiene which accompanies the increased water quantity
(Cairncross 1992). However, improvements in the quantity and quality of water supply and
sanitation do not automatically result in improved health. The addition. of hygiene education is
often required to see health impacts (Esrey 1994). Research has identified the most critical
hygiene behaviors to target: safe disposal of feces, especially for young children; hand washing
techniques and timing; and safe source selection, transport, and use of water (Bateman and
Smith1991).

2.3      A major lesson from the International Water and Sanitation Decade was th~ extremely
important role of hand washing in reducing water-related diseases. Results of studies of 144
WSS interventions (Esrey et al. 1990) revealed that demonstrable health impacts affecting all age
groups in most ot the developing world can be expected from improved levels of water supply,
sanitation services, and hygiene education. They found that improvements in WSS were
associated with a median reduction of 22% in diarrhea incidence and 65% in the rate of deaths
due to diarrhea. The studies also showed that improved excreta disposal and hand washing can
reduce mortality rates for children under five years of age by 60% and can reduce cases of
schistosomiasis by 77%, ascariasis (intestinal worms) by 29%, and trachoma by 27-50%.
Numerous other recent studies have also stressed the role of improved hygiene in reducing
disease transmission (Curtis 1997). Many studies have shown that, because they facilitate hand
washing and other important hygiene behaviors, in-house water supplies are associated with
reduced rates of diarrhea (Boot and Cairncross 1993 ).

   Sanitation. Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects


2.4     Review of the literature revealed that international organizations active in RWSS (e.g.,
USAID's Enyironmental Health Project, UNICEF, IRC, CARE, and a number of bilateral RWSS
programs) all include sanitation and hygiene in their RWSS projects. While these organizations
may use different perspectives and approaches, all proceed from the common objectives of
reducing child mortality and morbidity due to water-related diseases and providing more
equitable access to and effective use of water supply, sanitation, and health services. A review of
the experience of worldwide RWSS projects substantiates the research and shows that it is
essential to link water supply and sanitation with health and hygiene education. Only .when all
these components are in place will real and lasting results follow.

2.5     At one time RWSS focused almost exclusively on infrastructure interventions, but
gradually the role of the health sector has increased markedly, as our knowledge of water-related
disease transmission has grown and as more emphasis is placed .on improved sanitation and
hygiene. However, the health sector's role in promoting associated hygiene behaviors and
providing health education has varied widely by institution and has evolved over the past 20
years. Often the driving force in the health sector's agenda is improving child survival.

2.6     Investments in rural water are cost~effective. Each dollar spent in a rural water system
provides four times the population coverage afforded by an investment in urban water (OED
1999). The cost-effectiveness of WSS as an intervention for child ·survival has also been well
demonstrated (Varley 1998). The cost-effectiveness of a health intervention is the cost of
producing a unit of effect using a specific intervention. The most common units of effect have
been deaths averted and cases averted, to compensate for data that focuses only on death rates.
The disability-adjusted life year, DALY2, which was first presented in the World Development
Report (WDR) (1993), combines deaths and cases averted. The WDR concluded that child
survival programs in developing countries should include only those interventions that cost
around $150 or less per DALY saved.         ·

2.7      Rec·ent work has clearly demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of hygiene components.
One recent study (Varley 1998) has shown that hygiene behavior change, when provided to
people ·Who already have access to adequate WSS, is a cost-effective health intervention at
$3/case averted; $700/death averted; and $20/DALY saved. When hygiene behavior change
programs are implemented without safe drinking water and sanitation, the costs per case averted,
DALY saved, and death averted are all more than twice that seen when hygiene is added to
existing infrastructure, but still the cost is $45 per DALY saved, thus also meeting the WDR
criteria. This finding argues strongly for the adoption of an intersectoral approach to WSS
projects in order to realize maximum impacts from investments in infrastructure ..

2.8     A study carried out in Mexico (Fundacion Mexicana para la Sahid 1996), which ranked
120 health interventions by cost-effectiveness, placed the monitoring of water quality first and
water chlorination third, while provision of water ranked 111 th. As indicated by this study, health
benefits drawn from water supply infrastructure come at a steep cost to the health care system,
while water quality monitoring and water chlorination can save many lives at a very low-cost.

of the burden of disease used widely in international comparisons.

   Sanitation. Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects


2.9     It has taken time for the results of research to impact project design. During the Water
and Sanitation Decade, service coverage and construction were emphasized, and performance
monitoring focused on infrastructure targets. This was based on the thinking at the time that
access to clean drinking water and sanitation facilities alone· would achieve a health outcome.
Based on numerous studies that have definitively shown that sanitation and hygiene behaviors
are equally important, if not more so, in disease prevention, than infrastructure (Esrey et al. 1990;
Macy and Lochery 1997), it is clear that a successful RWSS project should no longer be
measured solely by a targeted number of stand pipes, household connections, or pit latrines-the
hardware of the project. Rather, hygiene and sanitation, social and individual behaviors-the
software of the project-should be measured and monitored to ensure that a project objective of
improved health is met.

2.10     Because hygienic practices are so important for achieving lasting health benefits and thus
maximizing project impacts, the development objectives of sanitation improvement programs can
never be confined to the provision of infrastructure, e.g., toilets, by government agencies or
program implementing agencies (WASH 1993 ). Projects increasingly include activities to
motivate people to use latrines (through hygiene and health education) and to make sure that the
latrines are suitable for local conditions and that people are willing to pay for them, participate in
their construction, and to manage and maintain them in good working order. Past water and
sanitation implementation experiences emphasize that people must be convinced of the need for
sanitation so that they will invest their own resources in such improvements.


                           APPROACHES TO RWSS INTERVENTIONS



2.11     The most basic means of assessing the success of any RWSS program is evidence of
sustained improvements in health of the population (Cairncross 1992). Many strategies have
been developed by the World Bank and other development organizations to ensure sustainability
in RWSS programs. Several basic principles underlie these strategies: the development of
demand-driven programs, a focus on expanding participatory hygiene education and health
promotion activities (involving women, men, girls, and boys from different socioeconomic and
cultural groups), user-oriented financial management (Samanta and Van Wijk 1998), and proper
institutional arrangements established through the use of local experts in implementing both pilot
and full-scale projects, thereby enhancing community participation and responsibility for
operations and maintenance (Minnatullah et al. 1998 and McCommon et al. 1990). Strategies
built on these principles have proven to be successful in improving project impact and health
conditions among beneficiaries.

2.12     By the early 1980s, the Bank had come to understand that for RWSS projects to be
successful across a range of objectives, community participation had to extend from the initial
collection of baseline data and identification of user preferences, through the design and
construction stage, to the continued operation and maintenance of the facilities. Behavior change,
community participation, and a communication strategy for sanitation and hygiene education
became integral parts of project design, implementation, and monitoring. UNICEF and the

                                           COVERAGE


  2.13     In recent years, the concept of WSS "coverage" has shifted from an individual to a
  community focus. Research has shown that it is the community level of sanitation coverage that
  has an impact on individual health, rather than an individual's possession of a safe excreta
  removal system (Ahmed et al. 1994). Studies range from demonstrating that 75% community
  sanitation coverage accomplishes a health impact (Batemen et al. 1991) to recent work at the
  World Bank which found that health benefits are realized at a 60% community service level for
  sanitation. Whatever the number, the message is clear--community sanitation behavior has an
  equal or even greater impact on improved health than individual sanitation behavior. The
· potential health benefits will not be fully realized by a sanitation program unless it achieves a
  high degree of coverage in a given community and a high degree of use by households with the
  improved facilities. If 90% of a given community owns latrines, the transmission of excreta-
  related .disease may be maintained by the promiscuous defecation of the 10% who do not, or even

                         WATER SUPPLY, SANITATION AND HYGIENE



2.14     As described above, the main health benefits of improved water supply and sanitation
result from a reduction in fecal-oral diseases, which are spread through a multitude of routes-
most of which can be interrupted through improved sanitation and hygiene. For a number of
reasons, the demand for water supply is stronger than that for improved sanitation--0n both the
government and community level. Hence, in the short term, it may seem expedient to address
only the water supply side of WSS. However, over 20 years of development experience by
USAID's Water and Sanitation for Health (WASH) Project pointed to the need to link water,
sanitation and hygiene has become extremely clear (WASH 1993). Any temptation to delink
these components should be resisted as long as health improvement is a goal. In the absence of
improved sanitation and hygiene practices; there is very little chance that a rural drinking water
supply project will significantly impact health.                                            ·

2.15    In sum, then, promoting good sanitation is more than the installation of facilities .. It also
includes the promotion of skills and practices for healthy living for individuals, families, and
communities: (i) safe disposal of fecal, solid, and liquid waste; (ii) safe collection and storage of
water, especially for drinking; (iii) good personal, domestic, and community hygiene; and (iv)
the control of insects, rodents, and other vectors that can spread disease through water, food, and
soil (WHO 1995, WASH 1993).

2.16     UNICEF Sanitation Guidelines prepared with the assistance of EHP (1997) point out that
there is no single paradigm for a good sanitation program. However, experience indicates that to
be successful, programs must meet certain criteria. They should improve the health of beneficiary
groups; achieve financial, organizational, and political sustainability; maximize the benefits of
investments by reaching the greatest number of people; enhance local institutional and
community capacity for organization and management; and protect the environment.


                             HEALTH, SANITATION, AND HYGIENE



2.17     Improved hygiene is not a natural by-product of increased supplies of water and the
presence of a latrine or toilet. Newly installed sanitation facilities have to be used and
maintained properly for a health impact to be realized (IRC 1998). Hygiene education aims to
ensure the proper use and maintenance of facilities by motivating people to change their
behavior. It is a technical tool for sanitation promotion to be applied when the physical
infrastructure of toilet facilities, water supply, and disposal of domestic wastewater is being
upgraded.

2.18   Experiences with hygiene education indicate that health impacts due to behavior change
programs take time to materialize. This is so because it is not only the potential users of facilities

                                                  12
    Sanitation. Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects

 who need to change their behavior; .behavioral changes are needed at all levels-household,
 neighborhood, and the entire community. Politicians also need to recognize the importance of
 improving hygiene and work to create a favorable political environment. Implementing agencies
 need to allocate adequate resources to put policy into practice. Field workers need to be willing
 and able to understand people's hygiene behavior and to build on existing motives to encourage
 people to change where needed (Cairncross 1992, Curtis 1997).

 2.19    Lessons learned by the World Bank concerning the sustainability of the sanitation
 compbnent of RWSS projects are based partly on the experience of the Second Paraguay Rural
 Water Supply and Sanitation Project (World Bank 1991). This project identified a number of
 needs that must be met for a sanitation program to have a good operation and maintenance: (i) a
 suitable institutional mechanism should be built in to ensure that funds and technology will be
 available for major system repairs; (ii) the transitional gap between the implementation of a pilot
 and full-scale project should be bridged, (iii) procurement issues should be dealt with early in
 project preparation, and problems which arise during execution should be promptly resolved; and
 (iv) adequate and timely supervision and project performance monitoring inputs should be
 maintained throughout the project life, regardless of the status of disbursements.


                                       HEALTH PROMOTION


 2.20. . . futprovements in ~ocial and individual health and hygiene behaviors to realize the health
 benefits of improved WSS require the. use of health promotion and education strategies. Health
 promotion aims to create an enabling environment (physicai, social, political, and economic)
 that increases available. choices and enables people to live in healthier environments an_d adopt
 heait}lier lifestyles (if they choose to do so). Health promotion includes information, education,
 and ::communication (IEC) as well as ..advocacy. activities to bring about changes in policy,
 legislation, and economic and other incentives. According to WHO (Nakajima 1992), health
 promotion incl.udes:                       ' ··                              ·

     •    advocacy of health~supportive policies next to decision- and opinion-makers,. as well as
          the general public, including mobilization ofresources;
    .•    empowerment of people with the knowledge and skills for making positive health
          choices, and the ability to act individually and collectively on their informed decisions;
          and
     •    social support to individual and social change.

  2.21    Traditionally, health education interventions aim to change individual behavior through
  IEC, For some people, the concept of health promotion or health education is still identified with
  p~~suading individuals or target groups to adopt healthier behaviors. However, this approach has
  _had poor results mainly because a gap between·knowledge and practices was found. Individuals
- were regarded as passive· targets of (sometime foreign) health knowledge, attitudes, and
  practices, rather than as actors in a change process that would relate to them and ultimately affect
  them, as well as society.                              .

   Sanitation. Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water Sul!J!lv and Sanitation Projects

2.22    People were also expected to adopt new behaviors in quite adverse environments. For
example, they might be asked to improve hygiene practices in the absence of an adequate water
supply or to avoid abortion as the main method of family planning when contraceptives were not
readily available or to quit smoking in a smoking-promoting environment or to decrease alcohol
consumption when other cheap sources of calories and/or heat were not easily available.
Additionally, frequently, people were asked to change their behavior and lifestyle when they
lacked the prospect of a fulfilling future and thus the motivation to invest in it.

2.23     Nowadays, health promotion carried out by ministries of health aims at improving health
through restructuring, regulation, education, and facilitation strategies to manage social ~hange,
rather than through preaching and manipulation to achieve individual change. Health promotion
is based on a health model focusing on social responsibility with a goal of social change, rather
than on a medical model focusing on individual responsibility with a goal of individual change.
Health promotion aims at changes in policies, legislation, socioeconomic incentives, and
available choices, as well as at improving health-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices.
While the target groups for IEC were mainly mothers and children, patients, groups at risk, and
school children, health promotion targets a varied group of stakeholders with a interest in the
process of change: decision- and opinion-makers, health professionals, school children,
communities, consumers, and groups at risk.

2.24    Extensive research has shown that health promotion may bring about social and
individual changes in knowledge, attitudes, and practices regardless of the epidemiological stage
of a country. IEC campaigns and activities, combined with other interventions, such as regulation
and taxation of products, may contribute to significant improvements in health status.

2.25    Health promotion .is a broad concept. In part, it is supposed to do for health what
marketing does for a product. Marketing is not only advertising, but also developing a 'good
product that buyers want to buy, putting a price on· it, and making it widely accessible. Health
promotion should follow this model by developing its product (health), creating socioeconomic
incentives for consuming it, promoting it, and making it accessible first to those most in need-
groups with poorer health.

2.26     In general, promotion pays off, as is shown by the resources that the private sector
assigns to it, though the relationship between investments in marketing (paid and free
advertising, sales promotion, and direct sales) and sales or returns is not entirely clear. For
example, European countries invest about one percent of their gross national products (GNPs) on
advertising, and the investment grows at the same rate of the GNP. However, the advertising
elasticity is low (less than OJ) (Lambin 1992).

2.27    Marketing social products, ideas, or causes, such as public health or fire prevention, is
more difficult than marketing soap, and ·the results are more difficult to measure.· Some
promotion programs or carnpaigns have had good results, while others.have not. The success of a
promotion program depends not only on the specific program, but also on the socioeconomic
context and society's readiness for change. This is why it is important· that a promotion
program/campaign does not aim . only at changing individual behaviors, but also at
simultaneously changing the socioeconomic context, through policy, legislation, and economic
changes that create an enabling environment for health.

     2.28 ·The experience of the World Bank's ECAregion in health promotion within RWSS and
     health projects (Godinho 1998) is still limited, but some conclusions and lessons can be drawn
     from experience in project preparation and implementation. The majority of projects follow a
     modem approach to health promotion, rather than a health education orIEC approach solely. The
     focus is not only on changing knowledge, attitudes, and practices, but also on changing physical
     and socioeconomic environments.                                                  ·

     .2.29 · · ·Financing is arguably the most innovative contribution some of these projects have made
       to ,the health promotion field. This may reflect both the need for innovation and sustainability in
       a situation of severe scarcity of resources and the competitive advantage of the Bank in this area.
       Hqwev~r, Bank projects in the ECA region, as well as in others, need to have a better
       un4erstanding of the impact of macroeconomic issues on health and of the sociology of the
     . political environment. In addition they need to further develop links between country health and
       assistance strategies and health promotion components and projects, with special attention to
       lagging sanitation efforts.

       2.30     There are not many examples to date of successful health promotion components or
       activities, as measured by decreases in mortality or inorbidity or improvements in knowledge,
       attitµdes, and practices. Most projects are under implementation (some in the initial stages), but
     , also.there are problems with evaluation. The move from mega-projects or components to more

     · 2.3.~    Clearly the health promotion component of a RWSS project falls within the scope of the
       m~nistry of health and often the ministry of education. This illustrates the inter-sectoral
       collaboration that is required for a RWSS project to be successful. The collaboration expected of
       Bank clients should be modeled by the project team. RWSS projects, once considered the domain
       of infrastructure, now are more broadly ·seen as inter-sectoral projects. Indeed, some
       international organizations situate their RWWS projects in the health sectors of their

organization, e.g., USAID. The early .development of stand-alone RWSS projects in ECA, as
will be discussed later, demonstrated the benefits to project design of cooperation between
infrastructure, environment, and health departments within the Bank.·


                                  COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION



2.33    Participation is a way to empower people, and it may be accomplished in different
degrees. In demand-driven approaches, citizen- or consumer-expressed needs guide key
decisions, includ,ing decisions on investments. A specific change process may be participatory,
but not demand-driven. Recently, World Bank projects have been integrating three participatory
modes for increased stakeholder participation in project preparation and implementation: (i)
information sharing, (ii) consultation, (iii) and collaboration. Some of the ECA health promotion
components have improved stakeholder participat.ion to the point of developing partnerships.

2.34    Amstein (1969) identified the following eight rungs on the ladder of citizen
participation: (i) manipulation; (ii) therapy; (iii) information; (iv) consultation; (v) placation; (vi)
partnership; (vii) delegated power; and (viii) citizen control. The first three could be considered
non-participatory. To manipulate is to influence, especially with intention to deceive .. By therapy,
the author meant the classical model where one is told what to do to improve health. Information
is a one-way process, and therefore the degree of ·participation is low. Even when citizens are
provided with information, they may not receive it or understand it; and they do not have the
possibility of giving feedback. However, citizens may be empowered if they receive, understand,
and accept the information provided.

 2.35     The next three rungs on the ladder~onsultation, placation, and partnership-imply
 increasing degrees of participation: the various stakeholders may at least have a say
 (consultation) in decisions that concern them; they may be called to negotiate some decisions
 (placation); or they may become partners in decision-making and other steps of the process. On
 the last two rungs of the participatory process--delegated power and citizen control~itizens
.hold power. The concept of empowerment, which is one of the main tenets of health promotion,
 refer~ to the six upper rungs. Citizens are empowered by having more information on issues that
 concern them and by being abl~ognitively, verbally, economically, and socially-to
 participate or take the lead in processes that will ultimately impact on them.

2.36    CARE (1993) has summarized its experience with community participation. The
organization found that for long-term benefits and sustainability of the hygiene and sanitation
component, social preparation is essential. Social preparation is a process of creating increased
awareness of the health benefits associated with WSS, facilitating behavior and attitude change;
educating the community to accept the WSS system along with all its social, institutional, health,
and technical implications; and initiating the functions of a WSS committee and training
members to b.e responsible for long-term operations and maintenance before the facilities
construction phase begins. What CARE calls social 'preparation is what this paper describes as
health promotion.

 2.37   CARE's experience has led the organization to identify approaches that lead to success.
 These seek to ·

    ·•       Encourage and enable community members · and health officials to participate in
             planning, implementing, and managing the· .WSS s.ervices and facilities, with field
             officers acting as facilitators rather than implementers;
     •      Increase facilitators' emphasis on health promotion through health education at the
             community level and at illstitutional levels 'in every stage of the project;       .
     •       Identify and buiid local leadership skills as a way to enhance participation and help
             transmit community development and health promotion activities and messages to
             beneficiaries;       .                                                       ·
    ·•       Recognize the need for and encourage the broad participation of all groups withill a
          .. community, especially women, children, and socially marginalized groups;
     •       Maximize the ·use of local resources, and develop community skills in identifying,
             managing, and mobilizing resources;               ·
     •       Include communities in construction activities, and train community members in the
           . techriical.a11d health requirements of operations and maintenance;
     •   · ·Encourage a community sense of ownership and commitment to its WSS facilities; and
     •   • · Build-up community capacity through training· that focuses on ski.Us development to
             encourage and maintain transparency in financial management (e.g., tariff collection) and
             to monitor facility sustainability throughout th~ project life cycle. · ·


                          COMMUNITY CHOICE: THE SWAJAL PROJECT



  2.~8    The Swajal Project is an example of best practice and hands-on experience with an
 ·approach in 'which the community decided whether or not to participate in a WSS project
  (Parameswaran 1998). This rural water supply and environmental ·sanitation project in Lucknow,
 India, implemented by the UNDP-World Bank Water and Sanitation Program, South Asia, New
 Delhi; is the first test of a truly demand-responsive approach. In the Swajal Project, trained
  support organizations, usually NGOs, explain the rules of the game to potential communities,
 w~ich then indicate their interest. The rules call for the community to provide 10% of the capital
 co'sts, 100% of the funding · for operations and maintenance, . and overall management
  responsibility. This process Of explanation and decision-making is known as a "pr~-feasibility"
  study in project parlance. Some communities stay away, not interested in the project approach.

  2.39 · Most communities. approached do express interest a~d are then selected for the planning
  phase. However, admission to the planning phase does not guarantee that the community will ·
  receive a water supply scheme. To be eligible to enter the implementatfon phase, a community
  first has to achieve outputs; such as raising its up'-front cash · contribution and· preparing
  community action plans. The only snag in the initial village selection process is that, even when
· .all the project criteria are fulfilled, it has been somewhat NGO-driven. To overcome this
  problem, the fourth batch of communities has been contacted directly by the project authorities,
  through a communication campaign, and asked whether they are interested in the project. This
  action, hopefully, will take the demand-responsive approach to its logical conclusion-where the
  communities select the support organization and not the other way round.
                                                   17
   Sanitation. Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects


2.40     Choice of technology is an integral feature of the Swajal Project. One of the key outputs
of the 12-month planning phase is successful completion of the feasibility process, where
communities determine, on the basis of informed choice, which technology is most feasible for
them. The engineer from the support organization presents at least three alternative technology
options to the Village Water and Sanitation Committee members and other interested villagers.
The presentation is made by means of illustrations. Indicative capital and operations and
maintenance costs for each technology option are also given. The dialogue goes on for a week or
so until the community finally decides which technology it wants. The main factor influencing its
choice is cost, especially the cost of operations and maintenance. In one case, the community
initially wanted a relatively expensive technology (power pump, overhead tank, and distribution
system) but, after learning of the prohibitively high annual. operations and maintenance cost,
decided finally to select the cheaper option of protected dug wells. In order to make the
community's decision on technology choice more broad-based, the Village Water and Sanitation
Committee's selection is endorsed at a community wide '~Agree To Do" meeting.

2.41     One of the problems the Swajal Project faced is that not all support organizations present
alternate technologies in a user-friendly way. Further, in rare cases, it is the support organization,
not the community, that selects the technology. Cost calculations presented to the community
also need to be refined, and the project authorities are working on this. One of the strong points
of the Swajal Project is that the user communities actually make the investment decisions and
manage the construction funds. At present, communities manage the funds jointly with their
support organization (all construction funds are transferred in allotments to a village .bank
account on the basis of a tripartite agreement among the Project Management Unit, the support
organization, and the concerned Village Water Supply Committee), but there are plans to
empower communities to manage funds independently in phase four of the project.

2.42     Procurement decisions are also made by the communities, with the assistance pf the
support organization. All contracting is managed jointly by the community and the support
organization, and no rigid procedures have been imposed. They are free to contract for materials,
goods, and services from anywhere (in one case, women from a remote hill village traveled 300
kilometers to buy quality pipes) as long as the rates are market determined and the material
conforms to accepted standards. There have been very few delays in procurement so far with this
system. In some cases, however, the support organizations have been more involved in
contracting than the communities. Therefore, the project authorities are moving towards
empowering the community .to undertake all contracting independently in the fourth phase of the
project.

2.43     Finally, transparency is one of the strengths of the Swajal Project. Having communities
managing funds is itself a serious attempt at transparency, but, more than that, most project
villages have prominently displayed details of all project costs, funds received and disbursed, so
that the whole coinmunity knows what is going on. The net effect has been that project
communities now insist that all other government development funds controlled by the pradhan ·
(village headman) should also be dealt with transparently as in the Swajal Project.

                               . DEMAND-RESPONSIVE APPROACH



2.44     The demand-responsive approach for RWSS projects, which has been articulated by. the
World Bank and implemented: by many· international organizations; is an alternative to the
traditional supply-side approach. Its core characteristics are community participation, capacity
building, &nd realistic approaches to cost sharing. In the demand-responsive approach, citizen
demand guides key decisions, including investments to .be made at the comm1,mity level. By
helping to identify and express local demands for water, from an economic, political, and social
standpoint, the demand-responsive· approach can clarify, the potential roles and obligations of
individuals, communities, and the state and non-state actors in the provision of R WSS..       ·

2.45      This approach was developed especially for RWSS projects. Participants at the 1992
Internation~l   Conference on Water endorsed a set of principles advocating the concept of water
  as an economic as well as a social good that should be managed at the. lowest possible level. As
. Katz.and Sara (1997) note, the demand-responsive approach ~'advocates that to manage water as
 ·an economic good, projects should let consumer demand guide key investment decisions.
  Specifically, projects should adopt clear and transparent rules that allow .users to select the level
  of service, technology, and location of facilities that best fit their needs, with a clear
  understanding of the costs and responsibilities that these options bear".

  2.46 · Katz and Sara found that sustainability is higher in communities where a demand-
  responsive approach was employed and where demand is expressed directly by household
  members, rather than by traditional leaders. or community representatives. Training, community
  organization, construction quality, and technology also contribute to sustainability. It is
: espe.cially important to paye a community organization in charge of organizing the process or
  service and/or operating the system, such as a water committee in the case of WSS projects.·

2.47    Experiences world-wide in utilizing the demand-driven approach in sanitation were the
subject of .an international electronic· conference May 17 to July 1, 1999. The three-phase
conference workshop covered characteristics of demand-responsive approaches; how they
operate at the community level; and the role of the state and NGOs in the transition to demand-
responsive approaches. Very broadly, lesson learned, as reported in the conference, are that
successful WSS projects rest on the ability. of stakeholders to enhance, reinvigorate, or build
inclusive local institutions that can mediate conflicts, facilitate the flow of information, and
handle the intricacies of ongoing administratioQ. Detailed results of the workshop are available
on the web (www.oneworld.org/thinktank/water/darep.htm).               ·


                           PERFORMANCE MONITORING INDICATORS



2.48    Like all development efforts, RWSS projects need impact and monitoring indicators and
monitoring systems to evaluate their outcomes. Research has shown that in.order to determine
the success of the hygiene and sanitation component of a WSS project it is essential to have good
crheria, strategies, and indicators for monitoring (Samanta and Van Wijk 1998). IRC has also
found that performance monitoring should be carried outin: collaboration with the community
                                                  19
   Sanitation. Health and Hvgiene in World Bank Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects

and that information should be disseminated to other communities so that what is learned from
the success or failure of one project activity can be used in the design and implementation of
others.

2.49     That being said, the impact of the hygiene and sanitation component ofRWSS is difficult
to measµre. Although health statistics are generally the best reference, attributing cause and
effect is not always reliable. Health improvements· are ·not always clearly manifested in
reductions in disease. Reductions in morbidity and mortality -of children under five are a classic
measure, but new or emerging diseases may have caused other health changes. In areas where
there are multiple factors affecting the health of residents, it is ·difficult to quantify health
improvements of hygiene and sanitation programs (Cairncross 1990). Often it is impossible to
disaggregate data for a specific project area from the national or regional health data available.
The UNICEF Sanitation Guidelines (BHP 1997) point out an additional complication. Efforts to
evaluate and monitor sanitation and hygiene have been deficient, particularly regarding (i) the
link between individual projects and the overall place of sanitation improvement in the national
context, (ii) methods for measuring demand for sanitation, (iii) indicators of facility utilization,
(iv) financing, (v) identification of beneficiary groups' baseline surveys of hygiene beliefs and
practices, and (vi) inter-sectoral linkages.

2.50    International organizations have struggled with the difficulty of measuring the impacts,
particularly the health impacts, of RWSS projects for the past 20 years. Their recommendations
represent years of research and evaluation.             The following paragraphs· highlight
recommendations of two organizations regarding HES design and monitoring-IRC and BHP.
Annex 6 Section B gives more examples of these_ two organizations' indicators.

2.51    IRC plays a lead role internationally in training for monitoring and evaluation of RWSS
projects. Its annual training course "Monitoring for Effectiveness: Improving Community-Based
Water Supply and Sanitation Projects" synthesizes the body of knowledge on the topic. IRC
advocates the decentralization of monitoring and evaluation so that responsibility is placed with
those who have a vested interest in positive change. The IRC monitoring and evaluation
approach

    •    Emphasizes the need for consultation with users and service managers;
    •    Defines indicators based on knowledge of problems faced, and "rear' concerns, or
         objectives and targets;
    •    Stresses the need to keep monitoring simple and cheap--use simple indicators, limit their
         number-and to retarget monitoring;
    •    Focuses on the collection, analysis, and use of data by individuals or groups at the lowest
         practical level;
    •    Limits information flow to what is needed for referral or use at higher levels;
    •    Promotes the extensive use of checks and balances to maintain transparency; and
    •·   Emphasizes the need to plan for the use of monitoring information from the beginning
         and for the orientation and training of those involved.

Technical Assistance Project as part of a series of guides for NGOs. The "Water and Sanitation
Indicators Measurement Guide" (Billig et al. 1999) is aimed at NGOs implementing projects
with water or sanitation components. It suggests appropriate indicators and sources for data;
describes how to calculate the indicators, and discusses programmatic uses and issues related to
each indicator. The impact indicators are:

    •   Percentage of children under 36 months with diarrhea in the last two weeks, where
        diarrhea is defined as more than three loose stools passed in a 24-hour period.
    • Quantity of water used per capita per day where all the water collected by or delivered to
        the household and used for personal purposes is considered.
    • · Percentage of child caregivers and food preparers with appropriate hand washing
        behavior, where appropriate hand washing includes the time at which it is done and the
        technique used.
    • Percentage· of population using hygienic sanitation facilities, where a sanitation facHity is
        defined as an excreta disposal facility, typically a toilet or latrine; and hygienic is defined
        as no feces on the floor or seat and few flies.                                          ·

2.54    The guide recommends that one or more of these indicators should be. used in reports of
WSS projects and should be collected at baseline, mid-term, and final year evaluations. The
guide also presents indicators for annual monitoring and reporting a& shown below. The primary
purpose of collecting and reporting data on these monitoring indicators is to improve program
management, but they also provide valuable insights into the interpretation of the project's
impact on health. The suggested annual monitoring indicators are:

    •   Percentage of ho.useholds with year-round access to improved water source, where
        access means either direct connection to the home or a public facility within 200 meters
        ofthehome.
    •   Percentage of households with access to a sanitation facility.
    •   Percentage of recurrent costs for water supply services provided by the community,
        where recurrent costs refer to the full operation and maintenance costs of the water
        supply system.
    •   Percentage of constructed water supply facilities maintained by the community served,
        where the constructed facilities refer to those established by the project.

2.55    The Bank's OED has developed its own set of recommended objectives for RWSS
projects as follows. Each would require its own performance monitoring indicators:

   •    Health benefits;
   •    Improved household community environmental sanitation;
   •    Improved hygiene practices;
   •    Improved coverage;
   •    Equitable access;
   •    Hygienic use of WSS services;
   •    Poverty alleviation by enhancing productivity;
   •    More efficient use of time saved in collecting water;
   •    Measures of technical assistance effectiveness; and
                                                22

     •   Sustainable scheme management and maintenance.

 2.56 · The study found that the mandate of the organization drives monitoring and evaluation.
'For fo.stance, UNICEF RWSS projects and the RW:SS activities of USAID's EHP have a child
 survival mandate and therefore use predominantly behavioral indicators for diarrheal disease
 prevention as project monitoring indiCators. Some organizations have produced very detailed
 guidelines for the specific behaviors required to maximize health benefits in sanitation projects
 (EHP 1999).                                 -


                         LESSONS LEARNED FROM RWSS PROJECTS



 2.57     A key lesson of the past regarding successful sanitation programming. is that technology
 is .only one small part of the water or sanitation improvement process; human behavior and
·behavior change are the keys to su~cessful programs. Individual behaviors al~me cannot make
 significant changes in the environment; the entire community must be committed.

  2.58    Several organizations have produced some kind of lessons learned document on WSS
  which incorporates research findings and field experience. USAID' s former WASH Project, the
  predecessor of EHP, compiled thirteen years of lessons learned during the Water and Sanitation
  Decade (WASH 1993) and more recent RWSS experience (EHP 1996) from all international
· organizations. In sum, these lessons show that effective sanitation and health programs ·

     •    use a participatory planning process that involves all institutional stakeholders;
     •    stand on their own merit and are not just tacked onto water projects;
     •     incorporate educatfon programs to change' hygienic behaviors;
     •    fit within a well-understood private and public water and sanitation sector framework;
     •     can be expanded without loss of effectiveness or sustainability;
     •    utilize a demand-responsive approach;
     •    offer a range of technology options;
     •   . share costs among users and public institutions;
     •     follow sound financial management practices;
     •     assess sanitation and hygiene beliefs and practices as the basis for planning;
     •     identify behaviors to be changed; and
     •    maximize the impact of health education by using participatory techniques, targeting
          women and children, and using women facilitators.

      CHAPTER 3. THE WORLD BANK'S ROLE IN RWSS
                      PROJECTS

  3 .1    The World Bank has a long history of institutional support to rural infrastructure
  including WSS. Fonner World Bank President Robert McNamara focused the Bank's attention
  on the rural poor, and one of the six essential elements of the then new rural plan was assured
  availability of water. In 1978, the United National Development Program (UNDP) and the World
· Bank launched the first global program designed to apply appropriate WSS technofogies. The
  program promotes low-cost national WSS technologies for poor people in rural and peri-urban
  areas, as an alternative to costly conventional sewerage and piped water systems. Also in 1978,
  the Paraguay Rural Water Supply Project was approved by the Bank; it was the first stand-alone
  RWSS project.. It and others to follow, demonstrated the Bank's commitment to the UN-
 ·sponsored International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade. During the IDWSSD the
  Bank became more active in RWSS, and lending volume has steadily increased. Bank lending in
  the 1980s was on the order of US$225.5 million. From 1990 through the end of calendar 1998,
  lending for stand-:alone RWSS projects totaled US$1,130 million (OED 1999).

 3.2     RWSS projects, both stand-alone and those which are part ·of urban/rural infrastructure
 projects or which this study has identified among Social Development Fund-supported efforts are
 shown in Table 1. Some of them are described in detail in Annexes 2, 3, 4, an!l 5.

3.3      About half"of the projects in the pipeline are RWSS stand-alone projects; 7.5% ofth.e
urban infrastructure WSS projects also have rural components. RWSS components frequently
appear in other types of projects-Social Development Funds, Rural and Agriculture
Development, and others-'-accounting for the other half of the projects in the pipeline. These
projects · are prepared and managed by various . departments (Social De~elopment, Human
Development, Infrastructure, etc.) and professional staff. The methodologies, rules, and standards
of these "other" projects may differ from those of the RWSS stand-alone projects. Further, they
ar~ not included in.any Bank-wide analysis· of RWSS or health promotion projects. The recent
OED review cif RWSS projects Bank-wide did not include the other projects category. Thi.s lac.k
of scrutiny is of concern because the ~otal of these "other" projects with RWSS compone.nts was
about US$3,452 million bank-wide (OED 1999).

3.4     The regional breakdown in Table l shows that RWSS projects are more numerous in the
Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and Africa (AFR) regions (30% each in the pipeline),
with the Middle East and North Africa (MNA), Europe and Central Asia (ECA) and South Asia
(SA) regions being the lowest.


                                         ECA RWSS PROJECTS


3.5     The authors identified and reviewed 14 ECA projects including RWSS for this study.
(Since the review, an additional 7 projects have been designed or were found to have RWSS
components, bringing the total to 21.)                                ·
                                                 25
        Sanitation. Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects


     3.6      Three of the 14 are stand-alone RWSS projects in Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and
     Kazakhstan. The total investment for the three is US$ l 57 million. (An additional stand-alone
     project is in preparation: RWSS in the Kyrgyz Republic (FYOl), a US$23.6 million investment.
     Thus, the total investment for the four stand-alone projects is US$180.6 million.) The stand-
     alone projects are described in Annex 4.

     3.7     As mentioned, investments in RWSS among "other" projects is quite large. ECA has six
     Social Fund projects that include RWSS, the largest number of such projects by region. The
     authors reviewed each of these for key policies; health, sanitation, and hygiene components;
     service options; financial options; training investments; and participation. The results of the
     review are given in Annex 5. (A seventh Social Fund project with an RWSS component has
     been initiated since the review for this study.) The total investment for the six Social Fund
     projects is US$ l l 8 million; adding the new project brings the total to US$218 million.

     3.8      In addition to the Social Fund projects, there are five projects-most of them Rural
     Development projects-that have water quality improvement as an objective. These are also
     reviewed in Annex 5. (Since the review, five additional such projects have been identified,
     bringing the total to ten.) The total investment is US$276.7 million for the five projects reviewed
     in this study or US$526.5 million counting all ten.

    · 3.9      To determine what the total ECA investment in RWSS, an estimate must be made of the
      percentage of costs of "other" projects that can reasonably be assigned to RWSS. Project
      documents for non-water sector projects indicate that infrastructure, primarily WSS, account for
      at least 50% of project costs. A conservative assumption then might be that investments in
      RWSS activities in other projects total US$183 for the projects reviewed in this study (50% of
      the US$367.8 million). The US183 million exceeds the amount for stand-alone RWSS projects
      (US$180.6 million, counting the Kyrgyz Republic project in preparation). If all identified
      "other" projects are counted, the total RWSS investment in non-water sector projects would
      reach US$372 million (50% ofUS$744.5 million).

     3..10 This is a considerable investment, even if the Poland Rural Infrastructure Project, at
     US$100 million, is deducted, as skewing the findings. Similar results have been noted in other
     regions.


                STAND-ALONE RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECTS:


                                   THE ARAL SEA BASIN PROGRAM



     3.-11    In June 1994, the Bank was party to an agreement to improve drinking water and
     sanitation conditions in the rural areas of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan that were
     designated to be part of the Aral Sea disaster zone. This was the origin ofECA's first stand-alone
I    RWSS projects. The international impetus was concern for the health and economic well-being
I    of people in the region. While health data, like water- quality data may be unreliable, it is clear

                                                     26
I
    Sanitation. Health and.Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects

 that the chief indicator of poor water supply and sanitation conditions, infant mortality rates
 (IMR), were higher in the Aral Sea disaster zone than elsewhere in the three countries. The
 IMRs were very high--often exceeding 50/1,000 births. It was also clear that these unacceptably
.high IMRs and the generally poor health status of these regions were related to lack of access to
 water and poor sanitation and hygiene practices. World· Bank health sector reviews confirmed
 these·suspicions. In addition, civil unrest has exacerbated the impact of poor WSS conditions and ·
 hygiene practices, e.g., in Tajikistan. When this study was designed, it was expected to include
 findings from the implementation experience of all the Central Asian WSS projects. However,
 the Turkmenistan RWSS project was delayed due·to the Bank's suspension of disbursements to
 the country; the Uzbekistan project experienced significant delays in 1998 due to problems with.
 procurement and change of the task manager; and the Kazakhstari full-scale project is still under
 preparation, as is the new project for the Kyrgyz Republic.


                                 SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE ·




 3.12     The review carried out by OED (1999) of all Bank stand-alone RWSS projects
 conducted and completed from 1977 to 1986 comprehensively surveys the successes and failures
 within the sector and shows a 69% rate of satisfactory performance.· Between 1990 and 1996,
 WSS performance overall was 60% satisfactory; in 1997-1998 it increased to 67%. Thus, RWSS
 projects perform slightly better than WSS projects overall. The OED report concludes that the
 RWSS projects studied generally had positive results: large percentages of the target populations
 gained access to water and, although there were wide variation, generally distance to the water
 source decreased and time thus saved increased (time ·spent collecting water decreased
 dramatically in some cases). Unsatisfactory performance was due generally to inadequate
 institutional performance.


                                       HEALTH BENEFITS



 3 .13   The OED review notes that when beneficiaries rely solely on a new system for drinking
 w.~ter (rather than resorting to alternative water sources), positive health outcomes are more
  likely to be found. People continue to use other, less-safe sources range because they lack
  information or training, because the new source is farther away than the old, or because there are
  other social and economic incentives for continuing with alternative water sources. The OED
  study indicates health benefits by users of Bank-financed water systems in Kamataka (India),
, Kerala (India), Paraguay, and Sri Lanka. In Paraguay, deaths due to diarrhea were seven times
  higher in villages not yet served by Bank-financed projects. Cholera epidemics are thought to
  have been a~erted in Paraguay in part due to the project's activities in hygiene education,
  sanitation, and the provision of safe drinking water. An analysis of the Kerala WSS project found
  th~t mortality and morbidity due to water-related diseases were declining in project areas. fa
  Karnataka, more than half of the households surveyed report~d improvement in family health
  since using the new water schemes, and, in Sri Lanka, project beneficiaries reported
  improvement in health in 34% of the households surveyed.
                                                 27
   Sanitation, Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects


3.14 In contrast, the OED study showed that health improvements were illusory in Mali.
Health conditions in the project areas remained largely unchanged and similar to those in the
unserved areas. Instead of using. improved ·sources, people relied on traditional ones when
surface water was seasonally available; in many villages, people were not routinely drinking the
potable water made available under the Bank-financed project; and safe water was contaminated
by being transported in unclean vessels and by being stored in homes where domestic animals
could come into contact with it. These findings demonstrate that health improvements are not
likely to be obtained unless hygiene and health training is an integral part of water infrastructure
construction or improvement in rural areas. The OED also found that improved household health
is more likely in communities that pay careful attention to the design and construction of water
facilities and among households that have enrolled in a hygiene class. Participating in a hygiene
class was also a significant and positive determinant of improved ·health in Sri Lanka and
Maharashtra. The findings from the OED review is further evidence that RWSS projects should
devote as much attention to their sanitation and hygiene components as they do to the technical
components, if health impact is a development objective.

3.15     However, the OED-reviewed projects did not identify health as a development objective,
with one exception-a project that mentioned the goal of improving public health services. An
interesting case of a spin-off effect not intended in project design was the China Project (1985).
In this.project, although health was not a development objective, the WSS and hygiene project
activities led to striking health benefits, which were widely publicized and which thus
presumably created a demand for improved services where there had been none before.

3 .16 Of the projects reviewed .for this study, about half aim at improving health, suggesting
that more recent projects have this development objective. In ECA, all stand-alone RWSS
projects in Central Asia aim at improving health through improving water supply and sanitation
and carrying out health promotion.


                                     STRATEGIC CHOICES


                        '                                                        '


3 .17    Among the OED-reviewed projects deemed effective, the strategic approaches used
include supply-driven mechanisms, community participation, and institutional capacity building.
Project development objectives/impacts were focused mainly on providing the rural population
with (i) improved coverage and access to safe water supplies and adequate sanitation facilities;
(ii) p~verty alleviation through the improvement of living conditions; and (iii) providing
technical assistance through governments for improving the financial and institutional
management and operations and maintenance of their rural water supply and sanitation services ,
and for implementing subsequent projects. In some projects, the implementation of the
sanitation component was given low priority or was ignored entirely (Burundi 1986, Kenya
1978). Most of the projects were the first of their kind in the country (Nicaragua 1978, Parag4ay
1977). Some projects (China 1985, Paraguay 1981, and Zambia 1983) indicated health benefits
as one of the project impact~ (with no justifiable data to back this up, however), even though
health impact objectives were not included among the project's development objectives. With

                                                28
    Sanitation. Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects

 the exception of Kenya 1978 and Tunisia 1982,. the rest of the projects were successful in
 accomplishing their physical and institutional objectives.

  3.18      The more recent projects re.viewed by this study used approaches similar to those.
  mentioned above. Typic;al development objectives include: (i) health benefits through improved
  household/community sanitation and hygiene practices; (ii) improved' coverage, equitable access
   and hygienic use of water supply and sanitation services for rural populations, (iii) poverty
   alleviation by enhancing productivity through more efficient use of time saved in collecting
  water and through' improving health conditions; and (iv) providing technical assistance to
   governments to improve their financial and institutional resources, to train community-levei
  operators and administrators in sustainable management and operations and maintenance of rural
   systems, and to assist in implementing subsequent projects. Because most projects us~d·
· indicators that focused on the infrastructure to be built and the number of beneficiaries (e.g.,
   Ind~nesia 1993, China 1992, Bolivia 1996), it is difficult to monitor oi: assess the expected health
 . impact. However, some projects did use health indicators-for example, the hygienic upkeep of
  water and sanitation facilities and percentage decrease in disease inCidence (Ghana 1994; India-
   Katjiataka 1993, India-M~arashtra 1991, and India-Uttar Pradesh 1996).                            ,,


                                           KEY POLICIES



 3.19     Most projects reviewed aim to improve water supply, while only about a third aini to
 improve sanitation. Other development objectives include health and hygiene improvements,
 institutional development, community involvement in· cost-sharing and decisions on operations
 and maintenance, poverty reduction (especially Social Development Fund projects), and ensuring
 project sustainability. Some projects have the goal of reforming national WSS policy. There is
 no( a high level of success in meeting this goal, but some do achieve significant results. For
 ex;nnple, the OED report (1999) notes that the. Brazil RWSS project (1985) was· instrumental in
 formulating a national policy for providing WSS in rural areas covered by the Ministries of
 Social Action and Health. This new policy helped to promote sector reorganization and to
 increase attention to RWSS.

 3.20     Policy developments include, for example, (i) adoption of a long-term water supply
 investment strategy; (ii) transfer of policymaking for RWSS to the rural development
 department; and (iii) increased government investment in water supply or environmental
 sanitation either in absolute terms or a specific percentage of .increase (India-Maharashta Project
 1991 and India-Karnataka Project 1993).

3.21. In ECA, the stand-alone·RWSS projects and "other" non-water sector projects that have
RWSS components focus mainly on poverty alleviation and improving living conditions of the
rural poor. The three stand-alone projects were historically part of the Aral Sea Basin Program
and were viewed as emergency-type responses to the Aral Sea disaster. As such, they did not
incorporate some elements of the demand-response approach. The key policies supported by the
ECA Social and Rural Development Funds to alleviate poverty are decentralization, community
participation, employment opportunities, private sector involvement in the development process,
and institutional reforms and strengthening.

    Sanitation. Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects


                                    SANITATION AND HYGIENE



 3.22     While half of the projects reviewed include health as a developil}ent objective and/or
 include health and hygiene activities, it is rare for a project to consider strengthening public
 health policies and institutions. Also, only a third of the projects include sanitation activities. At
 best, the lack sanitation and hygiene components in RWSS projects is a missed opportunity; at
 worst, it can jeopardize the realization of health goals. Certainly, the inclusion of a well-
 designed, appropriate hygiene and sanitation component in a water supply infrastructure program.
 could achieve positive health impacts and possibly address environmental concerns as well.

 3.23     All RWSS projects in Central Asia have health components that are designed to improve
 sanitation, hygiene, and health education and promotion. Construction of low-cost water and
 sanitation solutions is coupled with hygiene and health education and promotion activities, with
 the goal of improved knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to water and sanitation. In
 addition, the ECA stand-alone RWSS projects emphasize institution-building activities to enable
 the Ministry of Health's Sanitary and Epidemiological Services to improve water quality
 monitoring and sanitation and hygiene surveillance. These projects, and their health promotion
 components, especially the Uzbekistan RWSS project, also incorporate participatory approaclies.

 3.24 The hygiene and sanitation component of ECA RWSS projects is designed to create an
 enabling environment, as well as to change personal and household-level behaviors. Activities
 focus on: creating structures at local and regional levels to carry out health promotion and disease
 prevention activities and on building skills in areas such as disease prevention and community
 mobilization.

  3:25 The review carried out for this study found that, of the non-water sector projects in ECA,
  only the Moldova Social Investment Fund includes hygiene and sanitation among its subprojects
  or health improvements among its development objectives. The Moldova project health
  development objective states "the infrastructure microprojects will be integrated with programs
  to improve primary health care programs and public health and hygiene education." This finding
  is not surprising, given that Social Fund projects are demand-driven and focused on sub-projects
  identified by communities as their major priorities. Sanitation and hygiene education are not
  priorities for rural community members, although water supply infrastructure projects are.
  However, all Social Fund projects include public communication campaigns to increase
  awareness of. their activities, thus providing the opportunity for health promotion about the
  importance of sanitation and hygiene. It is also interesting to note that the identification teams
··for the four RWSS projects in ECA with hygiene and sanitation components (Kazakhstan,
  Moldova, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) included either a World Bank public· health specialist
  or a UNICEF environment health specialist (Turkmenistan). ·

                                       PARTICIPATION



326       In the late 1980s, perhaps as a result of lessons learned from the IDWSSD's international
experieµce, the World Bank began to incorporate participatory approaches in more of its
projects. Community-based RWSS projects typically include: (i) community involvement in the
design, implementation, and management of WSS facilities; (ii) government promotion rather
than provision of services, (iii) cost recovery of at least part of the capital cost and all normal
operations and maintenance and repair costs; (iv) private sector provision of goods and services;
(vi) maximization of health benefits by integrating water, sanitation, and hygiene education; and
(vii) a .special focus on women as users, planners, operators, and managers of water schemes. It
should :be noted that, during and since the IDWSSD, improved drainage ,to reduce the risk of
exposure to pathogens and to eliminate breeding grounds for vectors has been emphasized as part
of environmental sanitation for communities. These participatory practices are now typically ·
fou~d in World Bank RWSS projects.

3.27    The study found that World Bank RWSS projects utilize numerous methods to monitor
participation, particularly women's participation. These include monitoring the percentage of
communities involved in a project; of individuals in a community involved .in project
management, operations and · maintenance, and decision-making; of women holding key
positions; and of village committees whose membership is at least one-third feminine.

3.28 · Interestingly, newer RWSS projects are incorporating the concept of a community
appr,oach to monitoring and evaluation. For instance, the India~Uttar Pradesh 1996 RWSS
project has adopted community performance in carrying out monitoring and evaluation as a
project monitoring indicator. Specifically, the indicator asks if time savings and health homes
surveys have been undertaken. Similarly, the RWSS Nepal Project 1996 asks if ·a time savings
assessment has been undertaken by communities. This interesting approach is recommended as a
best practice.

3.29    The three stand-alone RWSS projects in ECA emphasize the role of the community in
planning new systems and operating and maintaining them. The Social Investment/Development
Fund programs in the "other" category promote participation in project activities, especially in
selection of communities, project design, . implementation, and management and are more
pro~ctive in ensuring the participation of women. For example, participation of women on
community management committees is often a criterion for project appraisal.


                                    SOCIAL AsSESSMENTS



3.30    Social assessments are one of the participatory tools most frequently used in project
design. Social analysis is key in designing RWSS projects, for it often uncovers areas that need
further investigation. A social analysis supplies information about household needs and
preferences; willingness to pay; knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding ·water and

                                               31
  Sanitation, Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rlfral Water Supply and Sanitation Projects

sanitation-related issues; WSS coverage; basic health data, etc. It .should be remembered that
social assessments should not be carried out only once-at project identification .or
preparation-but should be an interactive process with new surveys added as needed. As part of
the supervision plan, they should be carried out throughout project implementation.

3 .31   Investing in a social assessment to analyze prevailing social capital, particularly the
number and character of active civic associations, may also have an economic justification. All
other things being equal, investing in water systems in communities with high levels of social.
capital within a target region will yield a higher expected economic return.

3.32     All three stand-~lone RWSS projects in ECA conducted needs and social assessments
and carried out pilot projects to demonstrate community-based approaches to WSS. The task
managers believe that the project design benefited considerably from these activities. Often the
assessment results contributed directly to the design. For example, in Uzbekistan, a social
assessment determined that many residents were relying on water vendors for all of their
drinking water needs. Subsequently, during project preparation, a study of usage determined that
60% of the survey sample relied on water vendors and that 85% of the water supplied by vendors
came from unsafe water sources. Consumers were paying as high as 10% of their income for this
service.

3.33  The social assessment and pilot project, which guided the design of the Uzbekistan
RWSS project, yielded other interesting findings.

    •   There was a high willingness among the rural population to improve their current
        sanitation practices.
    •   Households were Willing to make substantial financial contributions for the construction
        of improved latrines.
    •   Capacity building was needed for health services, data collection (specifically the
        Sanitary and Epidemiological Services and Centers of Health), and the coordination of
        relevant sectors.
    •   Health education materials and methods needed improvements, and community health
        workers required training in participatory methods.

3.34     The first two findings were unexpected, although they had significant implications for
the project. · Findings oil sanitation and health led to the design of the community-based
sanitation and health pilot project and the subsequent inclusion of a .sanitation and hygiene
component in the Uzbekistan RWSS project-thus demonstrating the critical importance of
social analysis. This component supports the construction of improved latrines, installation of
hand washing facilities, and health promotion and hygiene education. Based on assessments
carried out during the pilot, the Uzbekistan RWSS Project designed a demand-driven financing
scheme for sanitation and health, which will be managed by municipalities in cooperation· with
the farm committees, and a grant system to promote community-based activities on a competitive
basis, which will be managed by a Regional Center of Health (formerly the Health Education
SeI"Vices ). These financial schemes are expected to contribute to the development of sanitation
and health promotion services in the public, private, and NGO sector.

  3.35    Other social assessments not directly related to a RWSS project can effectively
  contribute to project design. For instance, Morocco 1997 utilized results of a women-in-
  development study that revealed the high priority women attached to the provision of potable
  water close to their homes and its significant .impact on the att~ndance of girls in elementary
  school. This important. link between: RWSS and education was woven into the RWSS project
  (one of it~ development objectives is to "provide complementary assistance to Morocco Basic
  Education Project Loan, ... to achieve enrollment target of 46% and retention rate of 65% by
  2001 in ten rural provinces." The Morocco RWSS project already has had an impact on
  increasing school attendance· and is a best7practice example of utilizing opportunities to create
. spin-off effects from a RWSS project. ·


                                         PiLOT PROJECTS


 3.36     Globally and in ECA, there is some experience to show that pilot projects are an
 effective means to guide project'design and promote community participation. for example, early
 preparation of a project in Sri .Lanka, through a pilot, prepared the community and the support
 orgahizations (N'GOs) to work together . and achieve positive
                                                          .     results. Pilots may be used to test
 innovative community-based approach~s for providing RWSS services. Pilot .activities ·have
 promoted the concept of participation in project preparation and implementation in the three
 stand-alone RWSS projects fo. the Aral Sea Region, including the Uzbekistan Community-Based
 Pilot Rural Sanitation, Health and Hygiene Project and the Kzyl-Orda Pilot Sanitation and Health
 Project.

 3.37     In these projects, social assessments had revealed that the lack of well-designed and
 maii:itained sanitation facilities and' poor hygiene practices were significant threats to health. The
 pilots were designed to test low-cost appropriate sanitation technologies and also to promote
 detP,and for 'better sanitation and hygiene practices. The pilots raised awareness among publi~
 officials about the relevance of improved sanitation and hygiene and willingness to co-finance
 low:..cost sanitation· t~chnologi~s. They also highlighted some policy. areas that need to be
 addtessed-for example, current legislation makes it difficult to form small enterprises' that could
 provide materials needed for WSS, ~.g., latrine slabs. ·                               · ·       ·

 3.3.8   The pilot rural community sanitation project developed during the preparation of the
 Uzbek RWSS Project identified the lack of well-designed and maintained sanitary facilities and
 of good hygiene practices as the· most pressing threats to the population's health. The pilot
 project combined the construction: of improved· on-site sanitary facilities with a campaign to
 inform and educate the population about the proper· use and maintenance of those facilities.·
 Health specialists assisted the farm committees to develop and implement health promotion and
 education activities. Through the farm committees, rural communities made decisions and w.ere
 involved in health promotion and education activities. The pilot project showed that there is high
 willingness among the rural population to improve thefr current sanitation practices•

                               INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT



3.39     The study found that many RWSS projects pay attention to service delivery, utility
performance, and management practices. For example, a performance monitoring indicator from .
Nepal 1996 was the "reduction of unaccounted for water (UAW) from the current rate of 70% to
40% by the year 2000," with UAW as a proxy for management performance. There is a long
tradition of including cost recovery in project objectives. The review of projects for this study
found that a typical performance monitoring indicator in RWSS projects is "water charges
sufficient to cover operation and maintenance and depreciation." Monitoring and evaluation of
service delivery can use proxies such as "average time lapse between breakdown and repairs"
(Indonesia 1993) to indicate the increased capacity of the institutions.                     ·

3.40     However, RWSS projects were less successful in institutional development. According
to the OED, less than half of the projects achieved substantial institutional devefopment impact
and .only about 3 8 % were likely to sustain their benefits. Several obstacles to successful
institutional development were identified. An important obstacle for RWSS is that often no
single government agency is responsible. NGOs therefor often fill the gap, becoming necessary
support organizations. Thus, there is no possiblity of building governmental capacity.      ·

3.41    The role of NGOs in RWSS was debated during the electronic conference mentioned
previously. Practitioners expressed a range of views. In some instances, NGOs were considered
effective players in the RWSS sector, complementing government activities and providing
services in regions far beyond the reach of the state or seen: as a poor risk by the private sector.
NGO strengths typically mentioned were capacity building and training, facilitating and
disseminating organizational technologies, strengthening community institutions, and promoting
micro~finance and income- generating activities. Conference participants sqggested that NGOs
can also play an active role in advocacy, applied ·research, and· policy development, but only
when they have clear links to a grassroots constituency. On the other hand, some in the RWSS
community felt that NGOs should leave RWSS to the public and private sector.and stick to their
"core business" of community organizing, education, and complementing government services.
NGOs were cautioned against trying to bypass or "replace" governments, especially at local
levels.

3.42     These comments focused on the role ofNGOs in providing services. NGOs have been
used in RWSS projects in ways that clearly inatch their special skills: community education and.
monitoring environmental and health conditions in the community. An excellent example of the
.effective use of NGOs the Bank's Uganda Nutrition and Early Childhood Development Project,
which is being implemented by a network of NGOs contracted by the government to motivate
communities and provide health education.          The lead NGOs train community-based
organizations that in tum carry out the mc:mitoring and evaluation activities. The ongoing
participatory monitoring and evaluation developed for the project is considered a best practice in
the World Bank (PREM 1999) and can serve as a useful example to the RWSS sector;


3 .43   Bank-wide, institutional development of public health services is seldom included in
project design. In the ECA region, the strong public health heritage of the former Soviet Union,
                                                34
    Sanitation. Health and Hygiene· in World Bank Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects

  as evidenced in the performance of the Sanitary and Epidemiological :Service (SES), does not
  seem to have influenced the design of RWSS projects. Only the stand-alone projects strongly
  integrate the public health agency into their institutional development activities. Aside from
  them, only one other project so much as mentions the SES. This appears fo be another lost
. opportunity to improve health and refonil public· health services.


                                     TRAINING INVESTMENTS


 3.44 .. All Bank-supported projects in ECA provide training. In general, the training focuses on.
 skills necessary to operate and maintain. infrastructure· investments to.ensure sustainability. It is
 provided at both the community and utility level. The Uzbek and Turkmen RWSS projects have
 provided technical assistance to train teachers, health educators, an_d communication specialists,
 who in tum would develop training activities in schools, health centers, and communities.
 Almost all projects include study tours. For example, the Aral Sea projects include visits to the
 Estonia Health Promotion Services.                 ·

 3.45 .· . Of the "~ther" projects, only the Moldova Social Investment Fund project includes
 training of public health staff. Their training covers both health promotion and education as well
 as environmental monitoring, i.e., water-quality testing. In Social Fund projects, capacity
 bui~ding is often directed 'towards monitoring impacts on poverty. While many Social Fund
 pr9jects include a management structure and maintenance plan for each infrastructure project;
 th~ir approach to operations and maintenance is rather fragmented. They tend to establish
 operations and maintenance at_ the local level. The stand-alone projects, in contrast, are able to
 ad,dress operations and maintenance within . an institutional framework covering a local or
 regional program and thus to·. build institutional capacity. A concern is that the Social Fund
 approach is not aligned with overall Bank policy regarding institutional capacity building.


                                MONITORING AND EVALUATION


 3.46. There was a dramatic shift in development objectives and monitoring and evaluation of
 RWSS worldwide in the late 1980s as prpject objectives shifted from just providing drinking
 w~ter to ·improving sanitation and health as· well. With this came the inclusion of health,
 sanitation, and hygiene components in Bank projects. The first part of Annex 6 (Part A) provides
 th~ performance monitoring indicators ·and their unit of measurement· for the 16 World Bank
 RWSS projects that have clear health; sanitation, and hygiene components. The list documents
 the evohttion in the World Bank from a focus on hardware to consideration of hygiene education
 and gradual inclusion of health impact as a monitoring indicator. Section B of the annex presents
 typical performance monitoring indicators· used by· other development agencies. A comparison
 of these two lists clearly shows that hygiene behaviors and health impacts are monjtored much
 more rigorously ·outside than within the. Bank. This discrepancy is likely due to the fact that
 most of the other organizations reviewed have a direct health mandate, e.g., UNICEF' and so, for
 them, demonstrating health improvements is a necessity.

    Sanitation. Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rural W(lter Supply and Sanitation Projects

  3.4 7 The most common monitoring activities employed in World Bank projects include
  qualitative assessments (beneficiary and social need~ assessments and socioeconomic studies
  related . to poverty) and quantitative assessments (financial disbursements. and physical
  infrastructure, .as measured by secondary data from sector mini~tries and supervision missions).
· Performance monitoring indicators can generally be categorized as financial,. institutional;
  socio/economic, policy, infrastructure, and health. In most projects, input and infrastructure
  indicators predominate. They are measured quantitatively, e.g., water schemes completed,
  boreholes drilled, hand pumps installed, and latrines built.

 3.48    Bank monitoring and evaluation components that measure health-related indicators tend
 to be behavioral :arid· environmental. Health is the implicit objective, but the targets and
 measures applied are observable personal, ·household, and community level behaviors. For
 instance, the China National Rural Water and Sanitation Project 1997 target for the sanitation
 and health component is to achieve "an average 5% point improvement compared to the baseline
 period in key water-related health behaviors." The 1993 India-Karnataka RWSS project set the
 following indicator: "hygiene education management consultant recruited for the project."
 Newer projects monitor health impacts: India-Uttar Pradesh RWSS 1996 and Nepal 1996
 measure health impact through monitoring the incidence of water-related diseases; Morocco
 RWSS 1997 has the following indicator: "reduce by 50% the diarrhea disease rates in young
 children within one year of project completion."

3.49     The OED review concluded that monitoring and evaluation were "seldom incorporated
 within RWSS projects implemented in the period 1977-1986: In contrast, most recent projects
 reviewed for this study did include a monitoring and evaluation system in project design;
 Whether the RWSS projects are monitoring all relevant factors, however, is a question that has
 been the subject of several recent World Bank studies. A recent evaluation of the environmental
 performance of ECA and MNA WSS projects noted a _lack of sufficient and adequate.
 performance monitoring indicators (Bruestle 1999).

  3.50     Similarly, a review of health projects in the Africa Region (Beerling 1998) found that
  "the assessment of actual or potential health consequences of projects happens .on a limited
  scale." However, the author states that this shortcoming is understandable for several reasons.
  "It is very difficult to attribute improvements in health statu~ to separate interventions," and. "in
  the relatively short time span of a project(foµr to.five years) little impact can be measured." In
. some. cases, it is possible to measure the impact of projects, but in RWSS projects it is often
  difficult to prove a direqt cause-effect relationship between specific sanitation and hygiene
  interventions and improvements in health. In most cases it is possible to show improved outputs
  and processes, but projects fail to set appropriate measures of success.                           ·

 3 .51   This study found th~t it is diffici.dt to .coordillate and integrate the monitoring and
 evaluation of physical outputs, (e.g., latrines, piped water system~) and hea~th, san~tation, and
 hygiene activities: Monitoring of input an.cl some process and output indicators is usually good,
 but monitoring and evaluation of social and individual behavior change is less weii defined, and
 the use of health data' as a monitoring and evaluation instrum~nt is almost nonexistent.

 3.52 It is frequently mentioned that, because there are insufficient staff to meet the needs of a
 monitoring program using health data, different measurements of improved health are
                                                  36

of their problem. As a result, most implementation completion reports do not effectively assess
or systematically document project lessons. Information about other project impacts on
beneficiaries may also be lost.

increasingly being used. For instance, the India Kamataka Project 1993 aimed to "create greater .
community awareness of the causes of water and sanitation-related health problems." The
indicators that relate to this development objective are that hygiene education consultants are
recruited and that the percentage of project villages having clean and health environment, as
evident through sampie surveys, is more than 60%. In India's Uttar Pradesh project, a
development objective is to "deliver sustainable health and hygiene benefits to the rural
population through improvements in the rural water supply and environmental sanitation
services." Unlike most other RWSS projects, the Uttar Pradesh performance monitoring
indicators do include health status measurements: heaith impact through incidence of disease.
Interestingly, an objective of the Bank's first RWSS project in Paraguay (1978) was to establish
an educational and promotional program in basic public health. Subsequent RWSS projects from
the 1970s to the 1980s did not often share this objective.

  3 .53 Most task managers agree that the existence of established performance monitoring
  indicators increases the amount of attention managers and supervisors pay to a particular issue.
  Therefore, whatever the intent of a project, it is important to consider carefully what the
  development objectives and performance monitoring indicators should be. Most projects with
  performance monitoring indicators that are related to health status or hygiene behavior also have
  health development objectives. However, the OED found that some projects with health-related
  development objectives did not have corresponding health performance monitoring indicators. Of
· the.14 RWSS projects from the 1991-1997 period, three can be said to have no health objectives
  or related performance monitoring indicators. If an indicator is in place, the corresponding
  development objective is at least implicit in the project. On the other hand, it is not advisable for
  a project to have a development objective related to health--or to any other result-without a
  corresponding indicator. Only one project {India Maharashtra RWSS 1991) set a health-related
  objective without a health indicator, but subsequent Indian RWSS projects did include
  performance monitoring indicators for health, sanitation, and hygiene. Only one project
  {Indonesia 1993) mentioned an indicatOr related to the environment. The indicator is "long term
  environmental benefits" and the unit of measurement is "changes in BOD [biochemical oxygen
  demand], COD [chemical oxygen demand] levels, and coliform content of water bodies in
  subproject areas".

3.54    Two stand-alone RWSS projects {Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) with well-designed
health p~rformance monitoring systems have no health development objectives. Health was a
project goal, but given the complexities of the severely degraded environments and the myriad of
other disease transmission routes in the Aral Sea disaster zone, the project teams were cautious
not to promise too much. These projects include both quantitative and qualitative indicators for
health and hygiene practices and behaviors to focus attention on such behaviors and to increase
awareness of the links between sanitation and health.


                                            CONCLUSION



3.55    In conclusion, this study found that only a few World Bank RWSS projects can provide
documented and unambiguous information about their impact on health. Project implementation
often proceeds without an understanding of the baseline situation of target groups and the nature

       CHAPTER 4. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS


                                            FINDINGS


4.1      Water supply, sanitation, and hygiene should be intrinsically linked if health is a goal.
T~e international body of research and project implementation experience in RWSS is vast and
spans over 20 years of lessons learned. .From this the need to link water supply, sanitation, and
hygiene is abundantly clear. WSS activities to improve hygiene behaviors and sanitation have as
great an impact on health as the water infrastructure itself. In fact, such activities may have an
evert greater impact. Therefore, any temptation to de-link water supply from sanitation or
hygiene, for instance in the interests of a more simplified project, should be resisted as .long as
health, improvement is a project goal.                                               ·

4.2     Becaus~ sanitation behaviors and hygiene are key to achieving health benefits from
improved WSS, the development objectives and performapce monitoring indicators should not be
confined to the provision of infrastructure, e.g., pit latrines. A successful sanitation program
must promote skills and practices for healthy living defined as (i) safe disposal of feces and solid
and liquid wastes; (ii) safe collection and storage of drinking water; (iii) practice of good
personal, household, and community hygiene; and (iv) control of vectors that transmit disease.

43       Documentation .is lacking on health effects of World Bank WSS projects. A review of
completed World Bank RWSS projects provides littie information about the projects' impact on
he!ilth-both those with and those without a hygiene and sanitation component. Documents from
completed RWSS projects often mention improved health as a project impact and outcome but
usu.ally no documentation in the project. files supports this conclusion. This finding does not
mean that World Bank experience runs counter to the experience of the international community
regarding the linkage between health results and WSS projects. Rather it is indicative of the
problems of monitoring and evaluating the impacts of WWS projects in general.

4.4'     Scraps of information on World· Bank RWSS project substantiate the link between
hygiene and health. The Mali RWSS project found that, despite the availability of clean drinking
water sources (provided by the project), the health of the beneficiaries did not improve. It was
determined that people continued' to use a mote convenient-though contaminated-traditional
water source occasionally. Also, hygiene education was documented to be a significant and
positive determinate of improved health in RWSS projects in Sir Lanka and India.

   Sanitation. Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects

4.5      Several RWSS projects now in implementation conducted baseline surveys of water and
sanitation-related health conditions and have established performance monitoring indicators that
measure the incidence of water-related diseases-usually of target groups. It will be very
important to capture the results of these projects in order to begin a more systematic analysis of
project impacts.

4.6     Bank RWSS projects typically allocate about 10% of the total project cost to the
hygiene, sanitation, and health component. No information was found on the cost of
implementing the monitoring and evaluation program for any RWSS project or project
component.

4. 7     Bank WSS projects present challenges for monitoring and evaluating health results.
Other development organizations active in WSS have produced clear guidelines on monitoring
and evaluating hygiene, sanitation, and health components. These are summarized in this report.
However, Bank-financed RWSS projects have multiple objectives, such as institutional reform,
utility efficiency, cost recovery, improved service delivery, as well as ·health improvements.
Non-water sector projects (for example, those using Social Development Funds, etc.) with RWSS
components, by definition, have multiple sectoral objectives and thus an added layer of
performance monitoring indicators. Since task managers are required to limit performance
monitoring indicators to a reasonable number (roughly six}-it has been difficult to produce
meaningful monitoring information related to sanitation, hygiene, and health. Furthermore,
there is little consistence among Bank RWSS projects as to their choice of performance
monitoring indicators. Monitoring and evaluation methods-if they are described at all-appear
to vary greatly as well.

4.8     Community-based monitoring and evaluation hold promise for Bank projects. The
community-based participatory monitoring and evaluation approach that the IRC recommends for
RWSS projects, has not usually been applied in Bank RWSS projects. However, it has been
applied-and with success-in the Bank-financed Uganda Nutrition and Early Childhood
Development Project. The monitoring and evaluation component of this project (health impacts
are monitored) is considered by PREM to be a best practice. Several relatively new RWSS
projects are using this approach. The Uttar Pradesh RWSS ·(India) uses the community's
performance in monitoring and evaluation as the performance-monitoring indicator. Will this
new approach to monitoring and evaluation be more successful in identifying health and hygiene
impacts than past Bank practices? The jury is still out-but the experience of other.
organizations strongly suggests that the approach can effectively document the impacts of the
hygiene, sanitation, and health component.

4.9     Social Fund projects exhibit strengths in participatory approaches in their RWSS
components. The characteristics of a successful hygiene, sanitation, and health component are
well established, based on the experiences of the international development community. Most
World Bank RWSS projects with hygiene and sanitation components now in implementation
have the key ingredients for success except for well-defined monitoring and evaluation programs.
The participation of beneficiaries and stakeholders has been increasing in World Bank RWSS
projects. Use of the demand-response approach is increasing, with projects in Ghana and India
exemplifying best practices. Social. Development Fund projects generally follow demand-driven

approaches and ar~ highly participatory -in _nature. Therefore, much can be learned from the
experience .of this type of investment.
                           '                '




4.10    ECA RWSS proj~cts more oriented to institutional strengthening than RWSS in other
regions. Bank-wide, RWSS projects very rarely include policy issues or training related to
strengthening of publi~ health policies, institutions,- and staff. ECA is in the forefront with four
RWSS projects (stand-alone and "other") emphasizing training and institutional capacity
building of the public health services for surveillance arid health and water quality monitoring.
Unlike many of the Bank's other client countries, the former Soviet Union had a strong public
health system in place before transition. Although the public health system ·has since been
weakened, the ECA region has a strong tradition of public health that should be incorporated into
both rural and urban WSS projects.

4.11     The presence of a public health specialist on project team assures strong hygiene and
sanitation component. In ECA, for both stand-alone and other RWSS projects, when a public
health specialist was on the team, a hygiene. and sanitation component and appropriate health.
indicators were a part of the project. Even among projects of a very similar nature, when there
was no public health .presence, there was no hygiene and sanitation component. Health
specialists should b<.'l part of the proj.ect team if the intent is to achieve and monitor health goals.

4.12 · Needs assessments and pilots improve design of RWSS projects. The desigrt of RWSS
projects in the ECA region has been significantly guided by the results of needs and social
ass~ssments. Also useful were pilot projects that further investigated the issues raised by the
assessments and demonstrated new community-based approaches to RWSS. · Both assessments
and pilots should be use<l in the preparation ofRWSS projects.
    :1                         .   •



4.1~    Non-water sector projects with RWSS contribute significantly to the Bank's portfolio of
RWSS activities but miss opportunities to achieve health goals. Bankwide, non-water sector
("other") projects· with RWSS components are a significant contributor to the sector, although
often beyond the purview ·of the sector strategy or review. The ECA region has more "other"
projects with RWSS·components than any other region. They account for about half of the total
ECA region investments iri RWSS;           ·

4.14     These Social Fund and Rural Development projects tend to adopt approaches to project
design and implementation that differ from traditional RWSS projects, (This is particularly so
for 'Social Develop~ent Funds.) For example; 'Social Development Fund- projects utilize
demand-responsive approaches, community-based activities, and public awareness and
educ;:ational promotion. Both Social Development Fund and other projects often include activities
that'.will have a direct or indirect impact on health and hygiene. However, these impacts are
frequently not acknowledged either in project objectives or in performance indicators. The
"other" projects are often well placed to implement hygiene, sanitation, and health promotion
activities that would enhance the benefits .of the water supply investments. However, the review
found only one Social Development Fund project-Moldova-that proposed hygiene, sanitation,
and health activities.

4.15    Recent RWSS projects strong in monitoring and evaluation. While the older RWSS
projects lacked or had weak monitoring and evaluation indicators, all the most recent (post-1990)
include monitoring and evaluation systems, sometimes quite complex ones.


                                       RECOMMENDATIONS



4.16  Recommendations for activities to address the health, sanitation, and hygiene goals of
RWSS projects are grouped by topic.


                                          OPERATIONAL



• If health benefits are an objective of a RWSS project or project component, hygiene and
     sanitation activities must be included.

•    Baseline ieformation on health status and knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to WSS
     is needed to demonstrate a health impact (or any other impact). This need must be
     considered from the start. Obtaining a baseline requires some lead time. If health is
     introduced into the project only in the later stages, when fundamental decisions have already
     been made~ the chances of having adequate baseline information and a well-designed hygiene
     and sanitation component are greatly reduced.

•    Social analyses should be used to guide project design and implementation. Since it is
     necessary to focus on changes at the household level to realize health benefits from improved
     water supplies, information from social assessments is essential for identifying the behaviors
     that need to be targeted.

• If health benefits are a major justification of a project, it is important that public health
     specialists be involved from the outset to assess the scope and plausibility of health benefits.
     It is easier for them to make a solid contribution if they are involved from the beginning.

•     A careful institutional analysis should be conducted during project preparation to ensure
    · that the project scope does not become unrealistic and overly ambitious.

•    Ministries of health should be involved in project design and implementation, and
     institutional strengthening, capacity building, and training of the public health sector should
     be included as objectives.

•    An attempt should be made to link the RWSS project with other Bank- or donor-financed
     activities to increase the impact of both types ofactivities.

•    A monitoring and evaluation program should be set up immediately. Supervision missions
     should coach clients in the use of monitoring as a 1Jlanagement tool to collect data, track
     project performance, ·and analyze and evaluate the results.
                                                 42
    Sanitation. Healtkand Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water Supplv and Sanitation Projects


•      Bank resources, such as the Rural Water Supply Thematic. Team and the. Water Help Desk
       and specialists throughout the Bank should be called upon to assist in project design and
    ·. implementation.

•     The guidelines for project design found in this report or in the references provided should be
     followed. They are based on 20 years .of experience world wide and are of proven
     effectiveness:


                                         INSTITUTIONAL



•    All projects with significant investments in rural wate~ supply and a goal of improved health,
     'should be required to include hygiene and sanitation components.

•    Bank staff new io WSS and hygiene, sanitation, and health should be provided with clinics..

• ' Staff.fro.,;, ."other" non-water sector projects with RWSS components should be included on
    Bank committees and groups working on WSS.
             '                                                               '



•    Tools for hygiene and sanitation design and implementation-those produced· both by the
     Bank and other organizations-should be made readily available.·                  .

•    The use of interdisciplinary teams should be supported

•    A Bank-wide review of the non-water sector ("other.") projects with rural water supply
     investments should be conducted and the use and impact of health, sanitation, and hygiene
     components should be investigated


                                MON:ITORING AND EVALUATION



•    Baseline information on health status and knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to
     water supply and sanitation should be established during project preparation.

• If health     is an objective and there is a hygiene, sanitation, and health component, health
     impacts should be monitored and evaluated using a combination of quantitative and
     qualitative methods. Health statistics are relatively easy to monitor if they are available, but
     that is seldom the case. Hygiene and health behaviors may be used as indicators (see Annex
     6). Proxies, such as reduction of unaccounted-for water, may be used to measure "hard to
     measure" changes like management performance.

• . A two-tier approach to performance monitoring should be considered The India Karnataka
    RWSS developed a two-tier approach largely as a response to Bank guidance that they
    establish only five to ten performance monitoring indicators. This is generally sound advice,
                                                 43
    Sanitation. Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water Supplv and Sanitation Projects

    particularly when dealing with novice or weak institutions. It is preferable to have a few,
    simple, consistent objectives that can be achieved rather than a multitude that remain
    unfulfilled. The first tier is the half dozen indicators for the entire project. The second,
    more detailed tier of indicators is used by the borrower staff and managers to monitor a
    wider range of inputs, outputs, and activities.       It would include some or all of the
    performance monitoring indicators presented at the end of Chapter 2 or in Annex 6.

•   For many projects, a community-based monitoring program is the best methodology. It
    should be participatory, and beneficiaries need to understand the reason for monitoring.
    They should decide upon a small set of easily measurable indicators that are relevant for
    them and that can be linked to the project. Once the system is set up, periodic rounds of
    monitoring should be conducted with strong local participation. Building in a workshop is
    advisable, if possible. The data should be analyzed as quickly as possible in the field and the
    results fed back into the project. The whole process should be repeated ten to twelve months
    later. In the process, benchmarks that can be used elsewhere in the region will be
    established.

•   The results of the monitoring and evaluation activities should be documented in project
    reports.

4.17    It is hoped that the findings and recommendations of this report will spur discussion of
the important issue of how to obtain health results from RWSS projects and lead to adoption of
approaches that will increase the effectiveness of all Bank RWSS projects, both stand-alone and
those connected with Social and Rural Development Funds.

ANNEX 4: ECA REGIONAL FUNDED WSS PROJECTS WITH HYGIENE EDUCATION

                         Since this is the first sector operation by the Bank, the key policy of the proposed
                         Kazakhstan (Kzyl-Orda) Aral Sea Community Rehabilitation (KASCR) project
                         does not address sector-wide policies at the national level. Rather, as laid out in
                         the SAR (par. 25) and confirmed by the task manager (in an interview), the project
                         proposes to:
                         Improve the cost-effectiveness of investments through project design;
                         Involve the participation of local stakeholders in selecting the most efficient
                         delivery mechanisms and assessing their willingness and ability to pay for
                         improved social infrastructure; and
                         Improve the management and operation and financial viability of the regional
                         enterprises responsible for delivering these services.
                         It is important to note that, though this policy is documented in the SAR of the
                         Kazakhstan Pilot Water Supply Project, it applies to the full-scale project. The
                         full-scale ro ·ect is still under re aration.
                         The hygiene education, information, education, and communication components
                         are necessary to create awareness about the project activities. The hygiene
                         education and public awareness component was also meant to enhance public
                         participation and awareness in managing water and sanitation services and to
                         educate the population about the significance of effective water and sanitation-
                         related hygiene practices for improving their health conditions.                 The
                         environmental sanitation component, on the other hand, involves providing
                         assistance to urban settlers to build community sanitation facilities and to rural
                         communities to construct improved household onsite latrines.
                         The software components outlined above are necessary complementary elements
                         for an effective integrated water, sanitation, and health program intended to ·
                         im rove the health conditions of eo le mostl affected b the Aral Sea crisis.

                          At its initial stage of preparation, a social assessment was conducted utilizing
                          beneficiary assessment tools of conversational interviewing and focus ·group
                          discussion. Findings from the social assessment provided recommendations to
                          guide project preparation and design.                   .
                          Currently,· as confirmed by the task manager, monitoring and evaluation activities
                          of the project are focused on supervising the physical activities, financial
                          disbursement, and procurements issues to ensure that project implementation is on
                          track. Project performance indicators are also related to the physical and financial
                          activities. The PIU will provide quarterly reports to the Bank covering financial
                          and physical performance of the project (see SAR par. 51-53, 56). Future
                          monitoring and evaluation activities will also include .the socioeconomic surveys.
                         Another aspect of project monitoring and evaluation is the supervision missions
                          undertaken by Bank staffs.• With respect to Bank supervision, the SAR proposed
                          that it be undertaken four times in the first year and three. times per year in
                        · subse uent ears see SAR ar. 55 .
                         Though the project is supply-driven, it promotes stakeholder participation in
                          project planning. For example, during the project preparation, a major social
                          assessment was conducted. The social assessment activities 'involved substantial
                          participation by intended beneficiaries as well as by government agencies, local
                          research ·institutes, and private firms. Further, the task manager confirms that,
                          during the implementation of the Pilot Water Supply Project, stakeholder
                          consultations, (involving NGOs, Bank staff, municipal and local government
                          officials, community, etc) continued.
                         The task manager also remarked that, community members usually assisted the
                         private (international-Chinese) contractors employed to construct the
                           water su 1 s stems and distribution networks.

                         Since this project is focused on poverty alleviation of people mostly affected by
                         the Aral Sea crisis, it is subsidy based and supply-driven. Technology options
                         provided include piped water systems and onsite sanitation to both rural and urban
                         communities. The onsite sanitation facilities are promoted more in the rural
                         communities served b the ro· ect.
                         The project is subsidy based and intended to reduce the burden of poverty on the
                         people most severely affected by the Aral Sea disaster. The subsidy is also
                         intended to reduce migration of the best educated.
                         Though the project is fully subsidized by Bank funds, community members
                         contribute in-kind towards the construction aspect of project activities and are
                         res onsible for o eration and maintenance of the facilities.
                         Other important investments provided by the KASCR project are capacity
                         building, technical assistance, and training. The capacity building component is
                         meant to assist the agencies responsible for water supply at Oblast, city, and
                         settlement levels to effectively implement the project. In addition, community
                         members are trained to build onsite latrines; and local contractors to assist with the
                         construction of the piped water systems. The provision of technical assistance
                         and training is meant to enhance the efficiency, cost effectiveness, and financial
                         viability of implementing and municipal agencies. The training of the PIU, or
                         proj~ct implementation unit, (e.g., in procurement, etc) is also meant to make them
                         the mana eriall and financiall self-sufficient.

                         The key policies enforced by the Turkmenistan Water Supply and Sanitation
                         (TWSS) project supports the Government's effort to accomplish the project
                         development objectives. These policies fo.clude:
                         Restructuring of the institutions charged with the delivery of water and sanitation
                         services by creating a regional specialized water and wastewater authority in
                         Dashkhovuz;
                         Increasing the responsibility and accountability of the management of the water
                         sector; and
                         initiation of cost-recovery mechanisms including a tariff-setting policy, whereby
                         revenues would cover the full cost of operation, va,riations in working capital
                         requirement, and regular preventive measures.
                         In addition, the Bank, through the TWSS project, supports Government efforts to
                         improve water supplies and sanitation facilities in that part of the country most
                         severely affected by the consequences of the Aral Sea crisis and most poorly
                         serviced with regard to water supply and sanitation. The Bank also supports efforts
                         to strengthen the institutional and policy framework for delivery of potable water
                         su 1 and sanitation services.
                         To. achieve full potential health and socioeconomic impacts, the design and
                         implementation of TWSS project is integrated with software programs meant to
                         complement hardware activities. The software component (sanitation and health)
                         has three sub-components including: (a) improvement of sanitation, hygiene and
                         water supply facilities utilizing community based approaches, (b) health promotion
                         and hygiene education in rural areas, and (c) water quality, sanitation, hygiene,
                         and health services in the Dashkhovuz Velayet Thus, the software component is
                         meant to be a public awareness campaign to inform the population in the project
                         area about improvements in service provision and cost-recovery, as well as to
                         educate the general. population about water conservation, safe practices for water
                         collection and storage, linkages between water, sanitation and health, and the role
                         of the household and community in properly operating and maintaining the
                         systems.
                         Pilots were used for the HSH component. Recommendations from the pilot
                           ro ·ects have been inco orated in the full-scale ro ·ect desi .
                         The TWSS project is subsidy based and supply-driven with an intention to
                         alleviate the burden of poverty through improved health conditions and reduction
                         of migration of the people mostly affected by the Aral Sea crisis. Technology
                         options provided include rehabilitation and expansion of piped water supply
                         systems and distribution system network and on-site sanitation to collective farms
                         in rural communities~ Other technology service options include upgrading and
                         installing standpipes. The project will also protect the investments in water
                         systems by providing additional spare parts and other supplies to operate and
                         maintain the water s stems.
                         Though the project is fully subsidized, community members contribute in-kind
                         towards the construction of project facilities and are also responsible for operation
                         and maintenance of the facilities.                 .

    Sanitation. Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects




                             Since this project is one of the first RWSS sector operations by the Bank in
                             Turkmenistan, it should be expected that the government organization responsible
                             for the project will require continuous technical assistance for institutional
                             strengthening and to ensure that organizational changes and project activities meet
                             project requirements. The institutional development component of the project will
                             finance a two-year program of technical assistance, training, and equipment to
                             strengthen the capacity of the government to manage, operate, and maintain the
                             facilities which provide water and sanitation services to the people of Dashkhovuz
                             (see SAR, par. 3.8).                                           .
                             Project investments through the institutional development components include (a)
I                            national sector reform studies, (b) establishment of the Dashkhovuz regional water
                             and sanitation authority, (c) institutional strengthening of the regional authority,
I                            and d a ublic awareness cam ai .
                             The proposed project incorporates an extensive amount of participation by

I                            stakeholders at all levels. For example, during project preparation, nine
                             stakeholder workshops were held to discuss the project concept and design and
                             key project issues, including cost recovery, reorganization of the water and
                             wastewater sector, community participation components, and project
                             implementation arrangements (SAR, par. 3.2,). In addition, needs and social
                             assessments were conducted during the project identification, including 790
                             surveys, inventories of communal water supply and sanitation facilities; and 14
                             focus rou discussions see SAR, ar. 3.2 .
                             As indicated in the SAR (par. 4.14), monitoring and evaluation would be carried
                             out in the TWSS project mainly in the following areas: (a) procurement and
                             physical delivery of goods;· (b) physical implementation of project activities; (c)
                             impact on service delivery; (d) financial management and control of project funds;
                             (e) capacity building under the project; and (f) water quality, sanitation, hygiene,
                             and health services in the Dashkhovuz Velayet sub-component.
                             In addition the investment in water quality, sanitation, hygiene, and health services
                             in the Dashkhovuz Velayet sub-component will be used to (a) improve water
                             quality monitoring and sanitation and hygiene surveillance systems, (b) upgrade
                             SES laboratories in Dashkhovuz V elayet, (c) improve data ~ollection, analysis,
                             and reporting, and (d) conduct epidemiological studfos (see SAR, page 23).
                             Further, since the Bank has limited sector experience in the country, the TWSS
                             projeet would require an intensive supervision by the Bank for the first year after
                             the loan is in effect.

Sanitation, Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects




                         The key policies supporting Uzbekistan Water Supply, Sanitation and Health
                         (UWSSH) include microeconomic . stabilization and structural and sectoral
                         reforms; strengthening of market incentives, particularly in agriculture and energy;
                         and protection of vulnerable groups through establishment of an effective safety
                         net and more efficient service delivery. The policies also provide support to
                         ensure or expand access to basic social services focused largely on poverty
                         alleviation.
                         The Bank's sector policy is also directed at strengthening the government's
                         institutional ca aci and actin as a catal st for aid mobilization.
                         As indicated in the SAR for the UWSSH project, a hygiene/health education, and
                         sanitation promotion (HES) component is included in the overall project design.
                         This integrated approach to project design is specifically meant to help decrease
                         the incidence of waterborne diseases among the population, particularly diarrheal
                         diseases among children.
                         The HES component is focused on improving household sanitation and hygiene;
                         provision of improved commercial and public toilets; and on health/hygiene
                         education. However, since the Bank has limited experience in implementing
                         integrated water, sanitation, and health programs in rural areas in Uzbekistan, a
                         pilot demonstration project was required to guide project preparation and design.
                         To achieve this, low-cost measures were identified under a PHRD-funded
                         community based demonstration project preparatfon activity in two rural
                         communities in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm in 1996. Though the full-scale
                         project is subsidy-based and supply-driven, the pilot promoted demand-responsive
                         and community-based participatory approaches in its activities with an intention to
                         identify the most efficient way for the UWSSH to deliver services. The pilot was
                         successfully implemented by a Swiss NGO, Helvetas. An impact assessment study
                         after the completion of the pilot indicated community members were receptive to
                         the HES programs. Some positive health and socioeconomic benefits on the
                         population served were attributed to the pilot activities. In sum, the assessment
                         supports the hypothesis that it is worthwhile to include hygiene/health education,
                         and sanitation promotion components in the UWSSH project to achieve the full
                         potential positive health and socioeconomic impacts. Most important, the findings
                         and recommendations from the pilot project have been incorporated into the
                         desi and im lementation of the full-scale UWSSH ro"ect.
                         The delivery of services in the UWSSH project is subsidy-based and supply- and
                         demand-driven. Services are being provided (based on willingness t<;> pay for the
                         improved water supply.and sanitation) to both urban and rural communities most
                         severely affected by the Aral Sea crisis.
                         The technology and service provided under the safe water supply component
                         include (i) replacing or, where appropriate, rehabilitating sections of the
                         distribution systems in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Oblast; (ii) rehabilitating two
                         water treatment plants; (iii) expansion of one treatment plant; (iv) rehabilitation of
                         five ground water sources; (v) building additional trunk pipelines in
                         Karakalpakstan; (vi) rehabilitation of the rural distribution centers in
                         Karakalpakstan and Khorezm; (vii) development of local water supply distribution
                         systems; (viii) provision of spare parts for about 300 desalination units in
                         Karakalpakstan as well as training for the operators; and (ix) expansion of
                         demand-based rural water supplies in the two Oblasts.
                         The rural sanitation component promotes demand-responsive and participatory
                         approaches (based on the pilot project) for the construction and rehabilitation of
                         improved latrines and installation of handwashing facilities in selected households,
                           ublic laces, rim      health centers, canteens, schools, and collective farms.

Sanitation, Health and Hygiene in World Bank Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects




                         The project is subsidy-based. The Bank, other donor agencies, and the
                         Government will provide the funds for project activities. Beneficiaries contribute
                         in kind or in cash to the capital cost of the project. Communities are expected
                         cover the full operations and maintenance costs of the water and sanitation
                         schemes. These would be designed and costed with the participation of the
                         selected communities accordin to the level of service the choose.
                         Other investments provided by the UWSSH project include technical assistance
                         for institutional strengthening, a tariff study, a refinancing and feasibility study,
                         and project management training and training of latrine artisans. The project
                         management training investments are meant to improve the organization,
                         management, operation and maintenance, and financial viability of the regional
                         a encies res onsible for water su 1 , sanitation, and health.
                         The UWSSH project promotes participation in project activities. Participation
                         activities were initiated during project preparation. First, the project facilitated
                         extensive stakeholder consultation and carried out household surveys and
                         community focus group meetings to identify stakeholder needs, priorities and
                         constraints. Second, the two pilot projects initiated participatory activities in
                         project implementation. The pilot projects include the water supply engineering
                         project and the community-based demonstration rural sanitation, hygiene and
                         health project. The outcomes and experiences from the pilot and participatory
                         monitorin activities have eatl influenced ro"ect desi n and im lementation.
                         Since this project is the first in the water and sanitation sector in Uzbekistan, a lot
                         of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is required for an effective design and
                         implementation of project activities. The UWSSH has already initiated an
                         impressive track record of M&E activities. For example, five social assessments
                         were carried out during project preparation. Among the monitoring activities that
                         provided baseline data for the full-scale project are: (a) a social needs assessment
                         of rural communities in Karakalpakstan and Khorezin Oblast; (b) an urban area
                         social assessment in urban centers of Nukus and Urgench Oblast; (c) a water
                         vendor and willingness to pay study; (d) a salinity taste tolerance assessment and
                         household survey of private water supply users; and (e) a hand pump user survey
                         and water quality assessment. A periodic collection of similar baseline data would
                         guide the effective implementation of full-scale project activities, as well as make
                         evaluation at project completion easier.
                         Further, the project implementation unit (PIU) is responsible for tracking the
                         activities under the pilot and full-scale projects using a geographic information
                         system (GIS)-based management information system (MIS) and a set of key
                         performance indicators for monitoring implementation progress {SAR, par. 46-47,
                         51).
                         The Bank will supervise the project four times in the first year, and quarterly
                         project reports on the actual and planned physical performance of the project and

                             Though the policy and institutional reforms supported by the Albania community works
                             project is less poverty focused,. all three projects (Pilot Poverty Alleviation, Rural

                             Actively alleviating rural poverty;
                             Restoring food security;
                             Promoting the small private sector;
                             Strengthening local governments; and
                             Rootin rural develo ment olicies in local tradition and culture.
                             There seems to be a rule of thumb in all types of projects -- social fund, rural
                             development, integrated, or stand alone -- that information, education, and
                             communication (IEC) campaigns are necessary to create public awareness of the
                             project's existence and to generate public interest in the services that would be provided
                             by the project. The ADF projects are not an exception to this rule of thumb. IEC is one
                             of the essential elements to promote the ADF projects, especially since all three are
                             demand-driven.
                             Hygiene education, on the other hand, is not a major priority in the projects or
                             subprojects financed by the ADF. The ADF policy supports poverty alleviation that
                             can be achieved through improvement in basic infrastructure services (e.g., clean water,
                             transport, health centers, etc.) and facilitates growth of alternative employment and
                             consumption possibilities. In addition, providing a reliable water supply frees up the
                             time spent (usually by women) collecting water from remote natural wells for other
                            .productive uses and will also greatly reduce the need for medical care due to risks of
                             water-borne diseases, that hav.e been observed from time to time in the coun .
                             All ·three ADF. projects are demand-driven, hence communes demand services and
                             select, design, and implement subprojects based on established eligibility and approval
                             criteria. ADF staff evaluate subprojects and propose level of service. Technology
                             options for the water supply subprojects include gravity-systems, standpipes, and piped
                             systems. A gravity system connected to a stand-post is adopted by most because of its
                             minimum installation cost (US$22,000) and operational cost and its potential for
                             sustainability.. Each stand-post serves on the average 500 people.
                             The ADF provides a range of rehabilitation and construction cross-sectoral services in
                             rural and urban areas through priority small investments identified by the communities
                             (villages) or local governments (municipalities), including: rural roads, schools, health
                             centers, water supplies, markets, and small scale irrigation schemes. The basic
                             employment opportunities through infrastructure works account for 25-30% of
                             subproject costs.
                             The ADF has financed about 60 rural water supply subprojects (under the pilot and

                     Total project cost is estimated at US$12 million. The financing plan for the total
                     project is as follows:
                     The Bank- 50% (-US$6 million)
                     Other Donors - 40% (-US$4.8 million)
                     The Government- 10% (-US$1.2 million)
                     Communes are expected to contribute a part (5-10%) of subproject costs (in kind or in
                     cash de endin on circumstances.
                     The project provides limited seed funding for training and study tours to help equip
                     Albania's local government with the skills necessary for local development.
                     Other investments include: local government, contractors and community capacity
                     building, operational costs, and training for and technical assistance to the ADF staff.

                     The ADF projects promote participation in subproject design and implementation. For
                     example, once a village selects a subproject and contracts are signed after subprojects
                     are approved, the commune and village work together in preparing project cost
                     estimates and work plans, with technical support from the ADF staff (see par. 3.10,
                     SAR).
                     In addition, the .task manager says that, where relevant, users associations and/or
                     maintenance funds are created to ensure adequate maintenance of the rehabilitated
                     infrastructure for the first ears after its com Ietion.
                     Monitoring and evaluation undertaken in the ADF projects consists of qualitative and
                     quantitative assessments. The quantitative monitoring assesses the physical and
                     financial performance of project activities (i.e., procurement, financial disbursements;
                     number of subprojects approved and financed, etc).
                     The qualitative monitoring consists of beneficiary assessment and socioeconomic
                     studies. Beneficiary assessment (BA) studies are conducted and the findings are
                     evaluated and incorporated into project implementation.          An ADF project team
                     member also asserts that the BA studies also help to identify obstacles to development
                     and to root project activities in local culture. The socioeconomic studies are to monitor
                     and assess how much ove has been alleviated due to ADF activities.

                        eneratin em lo ment.
                 •     The ASIF is demand~driven, and a public awareness campaign has been implemented to
                       promote the project. The SIF project has a promotion team that goes to the communities
                     . to disseminate information. on the SIF program. The projcet also conducts an
                       advertisement campaign in newspapers and on.local radio stations.
                 •     Hygiene/health education has not been a major priority of the rural community; hence,
                       the ASIF project does not focus much attention on it. However, since two stand-alone
                       health and education programs are currently beirig implemented in country, .it is
                       assumed that the will cover h iene/health education issues.
                 •     The poverty assessment conducted during project preparation reveals (this is also
                       confirmed by the task manager) that portable ~ater supplies, schools, and youth centers
                       are the highest priority needs of the rural communities in Armenia. Water i.s needed for
                       survival and schools for the future well being of the children, and the youth centers are
                       meant to prevent/mitigate migration. Consequently the main service options provided
                       to the rural beneficiaries are rehabilitation or construction of small-scale rural
                       infrastructure.
                 •     Community members are required make a 15% (5% for the poorest of the poor)
                       contribution to the capital cost of the micro-project selected. Community members are
                       also required to set up a user committee and to be responsible for the operation and
                       maintenance of the facilities.
                 •     There is, however, a iimitation on the services provided by the ASIF in terms of
                       technology options and training of community members to effectively and sustainably
                       operate and maintain their facilities. This limitation has been noted by the project team;
                       follow-up supervision missions will address it accordingly. Finally, the level of service
                       for the micro-projects is dependent on affordability and sustainability criteria set up by
                       ASIF.                     .

                       US$1 million (5%) and the community contribution is US$2.5 million (12%), other
                       donors will contribute ~US$2.5 million (12%), private sector US$2.0 million (10%).

                       allowed size of a micro- ro ·ect will be US$150,000.
                 •     The investments (institutional support) provided by .the ASIF are limited only to
                       training of contractors and the ASIF management staff on procurement issues (i.e., of
                       equipment, project materials and vehicles). Other ASIF's investments include technical
                       assistance on financial management, salaries, operating costs, and monitoring and
                       evaluation.

                     The project is demand-driven, and community members make decisions on the choice
                     of micro-project and design based on their willingness to pay and the selection criteria
                     set up by ASIF. However, the participation process seems to stop there. The task
                     manager asserts that, the participatory process must be improved to empower
                     community members, influence community participation during implementation, and
                     effectively and sustainably manage (and also operate and maintain) the improved
                     facilities.
                     The monitoring and evaluation system for the ASIF seems to be quite functional and
                     systematic. The activities within the monitoring and evaluation system include
                     systematic qualitative and technical assessments. Results of these assessments are fed
                     into the project MIS and have been a source of guidance for the design of the project
                     implementation manual. Among these assessments are:
                     Yearly procurement, audit, and technical reviews.
                     Needs and beneficiary assessments to assess the satisfaction of beneficiaries with the
                     overall service delivery and results and the opinion of beneficiaries on the services and.

                     The PAD (prepared in November 1997 by the infrastructure department) states that the
                     key policy of the GSIF project is in support of the borrower's municipal social
                     development and poverty reduction program. The program is directed at improv,ing
                     mobilization of local resources and transparency in their use, rehabilitating and
                     improving maintenance of public assets, and introducing and expanding cost recovery
                     for basic services.
                     However, according to the the project task manager, this policy is currently under
                     review because it does not reflect what is actually happening right now in the country in
                     the areas of ove alleviation and social develo ment.
                     A review of the PAD reveals that hygiene education· was not included in the menu of
                     sub-projects to be financed by the GSIF project. The task manager indicated that
                     sanitation was not a demand. Since the GSIF promotes the demand-driven approach to
                     financing sub-projects, beneficiaries are responsible for making their choices based on
                     the priority needs in their communities.
                     Public awareness campaigns on the availability of the funds and on the types of sub-
                     proje~ts supported by the GSIF are conducted nationally and locally. Such campaigns
                     are . also meant to increase awareness among community members, potential
                     im lementin a encies, and the rivate sector.
                     The GSIF project promotes demand-driven approaches to financing sub-projects.
                     However, as revealed by the task manager, the level of serVice of micro-projects is
                     balanced between the standards that the Government expects and what the community
                     wants and can afford. Choice of technology options and standard of construction are
                     ne otiated and most! de endent on affordabili for beneficiaries.
                     IDA would finance 15% of the project cost and the Government 5%.
                     A minimum of 2-3% of the micro-project costs (in kind or in cash) is required of the
                     users directly and 16% minimum contribution from the community. However, the task
                     manager indicates that community members are refusing to pay the contribution
                     because they still do not understand why this money is being collected from them. A
                     willingness-to-pay study is being conducted to identify what the real problem is and
                     wh beneficiaries do not want to contribute.
                     The GSIF provides a significant amount of training investments that are directed at
                     effective and sustainable delivery of services provided by the GSIF project. The
                     training investments include:
                     Capacity building of policymakers to monitor and analyze trends in the level and
                     structure of poverty in Georgia.
                     Institutional strengthening of GSIF for mobilization, channeling project resources
                     through small investments, coordinating, planning, monitoring, and managing project
                     activities.
                     Capacity building of communities to prepare and implement small projects.

                     contracts financed b the GSIF.
                     The GSIF promotes participation in its activities including community participation,
                     key stakeholder consultations. In terms of community participation, microproject

                                government into a more supportive and accountable role, working in partnership with
                                community-based organizations.
                                The Moldova SIF also contributes to the growth of the private sector by enhancing
                                com etition in the local construction and technical assistance markets.
                                Through the public awareness and promotion program in communities, MSIF provides
                                information and promotion on choices, technical assistance throughout the micro-
                                project cycle, formal appraisal of the micro-projects, supervision oversight, and
                                monitoring and evaluation.
                                The MSIF also promotes hygiene education activities.               For example, during
                                implementation many of the infrastructure micro-projects will be integrated with
                                programs to improve basic social services, such as early childhood development,
                                  rim     health care ro rams, and ublic health and h iene education.
                                The services provided by the MSIF are demand-driven. The type if infrastructure
                                services provided under the micro-projects include: rehabilitation of local health posts,
                                school facilities, and community centers, including hygiene facilities, sanitation, cold
                                and/or hot water supply, etc. Other services include rehabilitation and construction of
                                community-level potable water networks: supply lines, distribution net.works, source
                                development, etc.        Sanitation services include rehabilitation and expansion of
                                community level sewage networks and pumping stations, disposal and treatment of
                                solid and liquid waste in the communities, etc.
                                A community-based organization referred to as the local implementing agency (IA) is
                                directly responsible for preparing the micro-project proposals and for the up-front
                                collection of a financial and in-kind contribution of 15% of total project costs from
                                beneficiaries. The IA is also responsible for micro-project implementation.
                                The MSIF serves also as an autonomous and demand-driven financial intermediary that
                                provides technical assistance and transfers small grants (average US$65,000) to the
                                IAs.
                                Total project cost US$19.8 million. The Bank is funding 75.8o/cr-$15 million, other
                                donors 7.07o/cr-$l.4 million, the Government 6o/cr-$1.2 million, and local communities
                                11 o/cr-$2.2 million of total project costs.
                                Thus, since the project is demand-driven, community members are required to
                                contribute up to 15% of the total project costs, procure all works and services, and
                                supervise the impiementation and future sustainability of the facility and services.
                                The overall project cost summary is as follows: infrastructure micro-projects 84%,
                                project management unit (PMU) 8%, children social development 2%, capacity
                                buildin 6% of the total ro·ect cost.
                                The pilot project provided a significantly large investment (-US$ I. 7 million in grants
                                and trust funds) in the MSIF team and associates, private contractors, local
                                governments and local community implementing agencies towards upstream technical

                                activities.
                                The full-scale project will also provide a significant amount (US$1.53 million) of
                                investments su ort and technical assistance to the PMU.

                 •   The MSIF also promotes community participation in micro-project activities. For
                     example, the beneficiary community is expected to organize itself through the IA,
                     identify and reach consensus on small-scale investment priorities that maximize public

                     The key policy of the Poland Rural Development Program is in support of
                     decentralization and comprehensive rural development. This policy is in support of the
                     Government's efforts toward European Uniion (EU) accession by helping to narrow the
                     gap between rural and urban areas in economic development. The policy links with the
                     EU accession initiatives for rural development, environment, employment, and
                     agriculture, to enable the Government to use available resources (credits, grants, and
                     human capital) with maximum efficiency.
                     However, the top priority in the PRD's policy is the support to rural infrastructure
                     provision as the basic condition for stimulating economic activity that will improve
                     livin conditions in rural areas.
                     Though the PRD program design includes education in its menu of sub-projects, it does
                     not include hygiene education or environmental sanitation promotion. The program
                     includes public awareness and program promotional activities at all levels and through
                     all appropriate communication media (i.e., TV, radio, newspapers, etc.).
                     Hygiene education is not included in the menu of options.
                     The overall PRD program is designed to allow for the phased introduction of project
                     benefits into progressively larger sections of the target areas experiencing high levels of
                     rural unemployment, so that, by the end of the program, populations in all selected
                     voivodships (regions) will have received investments for infrastructure, training and
                     education, and private enterprise development to increase employment and promote
                     sustainable economic growth.                                        ·
                     The PRD is a demand-driven program; hence, investments will be directed only at
                     priority projects that are identified by local government (rural and mixed gminas and
                     powiats), with committed financing sources. The priority rural infrastructure services
                     to be provided include water supply systems (piped, distribution, networks, etc.) and
                     sewerage (wastewater collection network, either on site or off site, and treatment).
                     A project management structure and a maintenance plan for each infrastructure work,
                     including sustained annual budgeting and appropriate user fees, will be an obligatory
                       artofthedesi ofeachsub- ro'ect.
                     Since the program is demand-driven, only projects proposed by local authorities with
                     identified and committed financing sources, will be eligible for partial co-financing of
                     up to 1/3 of total project costs. Project financing by the Bank (30-40% - 1/3 of total
                     project costs) would be in the form of credits, rather than grants (or subsidies), and
                     would be at commercial terms; the remainder would be available on concessionary
                     terms or as grants. More then 50% of the PRD funds would be co-financed by the EU.
                     In addition, sub-project beneficiaries are required to contribute 5-10% of total sub-
                       ro -ect costs.
                     Investments provided by the PRD include:
                     Human capital development (i.e., training/education) and private sector deveiopment.
                     Technical assistance to communities for writing proposals and training in financial
                     management, contracting and procurement policies, organizing service contracting,
                     implementation, repairs and supervision, reporting procedures to the voivodships or

                     The PRD promotes participation. For example, it involves all stakeholders (the
                     voivodships, rural community representatives, local government, etc.) in project
                       Iannin and mana ement decisions.
                     The PRD's PMU is responsible for the overall monitoring of program activities. The
                     PMU has set up a central statistical office (CSO) with a management information
                     system (MIS) and has developed sets of output monitoring indicators to supervise the
                     implementation activities of the rural development program. The VPIU monitors
                     program activities at the regional level. The monitoring activities of the VPIU include:
                     monitoring the quality of sub-project proposals presented by the communes, financial
                     and physical activities of the PRD in the field, and socioeconomic studies (beneficiaries
                     assessment and willingness to pay). VPIU is required to report findings to be fed into
                     the program's MIS.
                     Further Bank supervision missions serve as a complement and check to the PMU's

                      The key policies supported by the Romanian Social Development Fund (RSDF) include
                      poverty alleviation and decentralization (page 4, PAD). However, they tend to be more
                      supportive of poverty alleviation at the community level than decentralization.
                      The policy also promotes demand-driven and participatory approaches to RDSF project
                      interventions. Thus, by promoting these approaches the RSDF program intends to
                      increase people's ability to trust each other and cooperate in mobilizing resources and
                      solvin · roblems.
                      The RDSF project design also includes promotional activities. These project
                      promotional activities are meant to be a publicity tool to disseminate and create public
                      awareness of the existence and offerings of the RDSF project, rather than as an
                      educational tool. The promotional activities will include national level campaigns
                      (using TV, radio, and newspapers and organizing seminars with NGOs,
                      parliamentarians, and journalists) and county-level promotion (using local media,
                        asters, and leaflets and or anizin worksho s .
                      Since the RSDF project is demand-driven, beneficiaries would be expected to select
                      level of service for sub-projects. The numbers of beneficiaries per project will depend
                      on the nature of the project.
                      The beneficiaries' choice of service options will be based on affordability and
                      sustainability.
                      Further, beneficiaries (i.e., poor rural communities and disadvantaged groups), with the
                      assistance of the .RSDF staff, would be expected to prepare sub-project proposals and
                      designs. The sub-project interventions promoted by the RSDF will include small-scale
                      rural infrastructure (latrines, sewerage systems, community centers, local water
                      supply/piping, artesian wells, etc.) and income-generating activities (focused on the
                      rural areas). Community-based social services (day care centers/educational centers;
                      family planning/counseling/ health promotion; home care for the elderly; shelters for
                      the homeless; juridical assistance services) are to be promoted among NGOs and
                      disadvantaged groups located both in rural and urban areas.
                      When sub-project proposals are approved, the technical staff of RSDF will also offer
                      direct technical assistance to the community groups by providing impartial information
                      about unit costs, appropriate technologies and whatever services would assist and
                      enable the very poor to make informed choices and to take sustainability into
                      consideration.
                      In addition, NGOs will be required to inform their beneficiaries and to offer them
                      service options in order to enable them to participate in the project design and to make
                      informed choices.
                      In support of the demand-driven principles of the RSDF, sub-projects will be financed
                      only based on request. RSDF will also require evidence of community interest and
                    . willingness to pay through cash or in-kind contributions to the project proposal budget.
                      A minimum contribution of 10% of the sub-project cost (net of taxes) is expected from
                      beneficiaries in-kind or cash .
                      The RDSF also offers investments through training courses and technical assistance
                      aimed at community level capacity building for:
                      Participatory identification and prioritization of needs.
                      Design, implementation, and monitoring of sub-projects.

                     The RSDF promotes participation in almost all project activities. For. example, during
                     project identification and preparation, the primary beneficiaries (community groups,
                     local authorities, and NGOs) were consulted.
                     Further, poverty appraisal and prioritization of needs and design and implementation of
                     the project will be highly participatory. RSDF will also require community groups to
                     be organized and registered; project management committees (elected by the
                     community to represent the community's interests) should be in place prior to
                     application.
                     In addition, RSDF will also require that other organizational fonns, such as
                     maintenance committees, should be initiated prior to implementation. Thus, community
                     members will participate in identification and implementation of demand-driven. sub-
                     projects.
                     Finally, NGOs, acting as implementing agencies will have to submit to RSDF evidence
                     of beneficiaries' involvement in problem identification and project design. NGOs are
                     also expected to consult with beneficiaries and communities and collaborate with them
                     in im lementation.
                     Project monitoring and evaluation would be the responsibility of the RSDF. Through
                     the monitoring system, regular surveys would be conducted (both quantitative -- on the
                     physical and financial activities of the project, and qualitative -- baseline beneficiary
                     assessment surveys). The survey findings would provide infonnation on achievement of
                     benchmarks and feedback on criteria and procedures used for selecting and
                     implementing sub-projects, enabling revisions of the operational manual. In addition,
                     RSDF staffs are expected to supervise projects at critical stages of project
                     implementation. RSDF will also submit to the Bank semi-annual progress reports on

                      The key policy supported by the Tajikistan Social Investment fund (TSIF) is to
                      collaborate and scale-up NGO poverty alleviation programs (i.e., develop capacity at
                      the national and local to implement participatory approaches to poverty alleviation and
                      demonstrate poverty alleviation activities that could be replicated or expanded through ·
                      the TSIF).
                      Community-based organizations involved in NGO programs will also be encouraged to
                         ut forward ro osals to the TSIF.
                      The educational efforts promoted by the TSIF project are meant to increase awareness
                       among community members, potential requesting and implementing agencies, and the
                      private sector of the availability of ful).ds and the types of micro-projects supported by
                      the TSIF. The information, education, and · communication (IEC) promotional
                       activities will begin at the end of the first year in targeted regions so as to generate
                      proposals to be financed during the second year.
                      The educational efforts do not seem to include hygiene education or environmental
                      sanitation romotional cam ai ns.
                      The micro-projects promoted bythe TSIF are demand-driven.
                      Ten to fifteen micro-projects (social infrastructure, such as wastewater canal cleaning,
                      small water and sanitation stations, public baths and latrines, schools and health points,
                      etc.) are to be implemented during the first year of the project (par. 3.10, SAR)
                      The TSIF will have limited funds and will aim to assist the poor. Not everyone will be
                      helped. By December 31, 1997, the TSIF was to have developed a targeting strategy
                      ·satisfacto to IDA to ide distribution of ro·ect resources ar. 4.18, SAR.
                      The estimated total project cost including duties and taxes is US$12.7 million. IDA
                      provides 94% (US$12 million) and the Government 6% (US$0.7 million) of the
                      estimated total project cost (pages 28-30).
                      The TSIF project is also subsidy-based. But community members would be required to
                       contribute an equivalent of 10% of total cost of each micro-project either in the form of
                      time or labor, rather then in cash. This contribution would supp!ement the limited
                       ability of the beneficiaries to pay directly for operation and maintenance costs of
                      rehabilitated infrastructure.
                      Sustainability is a concern at both the institutional {TSIF) and micro-project level.
                      Although the TSIF project is being conceived as a short-term program of three years, if
                       it is successful the TSIF could be continued. Hence, the project would build the
                      institutional capacities of the TSIF, as well as local agents (such as local government
                      units and NGOs),' so that they could carry out poverty alleviation programs in the
                      future. For example, technical assistance in the form of an international technical
                      advisor, focusing on construction, preparation of standards, and norms, will be·
                      provided (par. 4.16, SAR).
                      In addition, training will be provided to the TSIF staff on a range of topics, such as
                      participatory community development, contracting and bidding ·procedures, project
                      supervision and evaluation, English, and computer training.
                      Trained TSIF staff will also provide technical assistance and training to local
                      governments, small contractors, NGO staff and other active community members to
                      help them plan, · manage, and implement micro-projects and to participate in
                      com etitive biddin       ar. 3.9, SAR

                     The TSIF project promotes participation of stakeholders at all levels in its poverty
                     alleviation program activities. For example, participants involved with micro-projects
                     will be {a) the community or group that is supposed to benefit directly from the micro-
                     project in terms of increased job opportunities and income and improved access to
                     services, {b) the requesting agency (i.e., the community group, NGO, or local
                     government) that presents a microproject proposal to TSIF for financing, and (c) the
                     implementing agency that will sign the framework agreement with the TSIF.
                     Another activity promoting participation by the TSIF project is the criteria requirement
                     (presentation of a plan for operating and maintaining the micro-project) for micro-
                     project proposal approval.
                     Finally, the emphasis on community participation in micro-project design and
                     im lementation will im rove the ros ect for sustainabili .
                     Monitoring and evaluation have already been a prominent feature of the existing NGO
                     programs, and both the findings and systems used will be built upon in the scale-up
                     programs (pages 25-26, 48-49, SAR).
                     The NGOs are to report progress of micro-project and achieved targets to the TSIF on a

                                 have a fixed policy framework, its policies are focused mainly on poverty
                                 reduction and stimulation of employment-generating opportunities in rural
                                 communities. Also, the conditionality surrounding the key policy is consistent
                                 with the CAS strategy reform from the ground up.
                             • The project, however, addresses several CAS objectives: (a) improving the
                                 environment for increased output and employment in productive private
                               . sectors; (b) development of small and medium enterprises (SME); (c) increased

                                 in rural areas; (d) alleviation of poverty, through both the components· arid the

                                  environmental campaign in the USTF project activities.



                             •    Though the PCD does not provide a lot of insight into the service options
                                  proposed by the USTF project, infrastructure (water and sanitation, health,
                                  education) services under the project ru:e likely to be a balance between
                                  rehabilitation and construction of existing infrastructure. Thus, the USTF is
                                  likely to finance community infrastructure works identified by communities in
                                  collaboration with the USTF staff and local authorities.
                             •    The service option to be promoted by the USTF will reflect the lessons learned
                                  from the IDB review of social funds which emphasizes that the fund should be
                                  designed to ensure that infrastructural interventions are demand-driven and
                                  proactive ·in eliciting community demand, particularly in the poorest areas
                                  where communities ma have less ca aci to articulate their needs.
                             •    The PCD does not offer much information on the financial options provided
                                  under the USTF. However, it states that the financial issues of the USTF sub-
                                  projects in some sectors (e.g., water and sanitation, health, etc.) will be defmed
                                  through collaboration with colleagues already active in the sector.
                             •    Furthermore, the proposed project design will draw on the lessons learned from
                                  the IDB review of social funds emphasizing the need to select infrastructure
                                  interventions with a clear understanding of the recurrent cost implications and

                     The PCD states that the USTF provides a significant amount of training
                     investments in its design. The training investments include:
                     Building the capacity of local communities and their organizations (e.g.,
                     mahalla committees, village credit associations, etc.) to articulate their needs
                     and preferences.
                     Training of small contractors, to familiarize them with USTF bidding
                     procedures and assessment criteria and to clarify their responsibilities during
                     the implementation of subprojects.
                     Strengthening of small and medium enterprise capacity to access the fomial
                     credit system, through a range of businesses support services.
                     Building of capacity in selected financial institutions to operate SME credit
                     windows according to commercial criteria and actual disbursement of small
                     credit lines.
                     Technical assistance to the central and local USTF staff and staff in relevant
                     line ministries. Building their capacity for basic financial and economic
                     analyses of sub-projects that balance sustainability requirements with the need
                     for time! im lementation.
                     The USTF supports participation based on lessons learned from an IDB review
                     of social funds. The lessons learned on participation experiences reflected in
                     the USTF's proposed project design point to a need for mechanisms to ensure
                     communi       artici ation be ond identification of sub- ro ·ects.
                     The ability to target low-income groups in the development process is vital to
                     the impact of the USTF sub-projects. The PCD further states that the
                     monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system for the USTF will include the
                     following activities:
                     Social assessments meant to be used to help develop strategies for minimizing
                     social risks.
                     Developing a good management information system (MIS) for each component
                     and designing sub-project procedures for all components. M&E indicators
                     should be part of the sub-project approval process, rather than as free standing
                     post facto assessments.
                     The USTF will also be linked to other initiatives (financed by GTZ and
                     possibly UNDP) supporting a reformed in budget survey for Uzbekistan, which
                     should significantly increase the ability of the government, and USTF to
                     identify low-income groups and areas where different services are
                     underdevelo ed.

         ANNEX 7: KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR COMMUNITY WATER AND SANITATION SERVICES


1.    Promote a demand responsive approach where communities make informed choices regarding their
      participation, service level, and service delivery mechanisms.

2.    Promote institutional reform based on clear roles for key stakeholders where communities own their
      facilities, the private sector provides goods and services, and government facilitates the process.

3.    Ensure.appropriate legal framework for ownership and management.

4.    Implement CWS projects within context of broader commuriity and local government development.

5.    Establish financial policies that underpin demand responsive approach where communities pay part of the
      capital cost in proportion to the cost of the facilities, and all operations and maintenance costs.

6.    Support formation of representative Water· User Associations for planning, implementation, and
      management of community water supplY: facilities.

7.    Create competitive environment for allowing communities to access range of providers of goods and
      services for all aspects of the project cycle.

8.    Integrate water, sanitation and hygiene education in CWS projects.

9.    Promote user investment in sanitation through public awareness and hygiene education, and strengthen
      private sector's ability to construct facilities.

10.   Ensure representative and informed participation of all stakeholders.

11.   Include clearly defined capacity building components that enable all stakeholders to play their roles and
      build partnerships.                             ·

12.   Set rules to target poor, unserved communities and vulnerable groups in these communities.

13.   Support community-based environmental management to improve living conditions and protect water
      resources.
