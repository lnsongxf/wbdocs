                                                                                                    99228

                                   LUANDA DECLARATION

Having met in Luanda, the Republic of Angola, at our 2015 Caucus, hosted and chaired by
Honorable Armando Manuel, Minister of Finance of the Republic of Angola and Chairman of
the African Caucus of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group
(WBG):

              We, the African Governors of the IMF and the WBG discussed ways and means
               the Bretton Woods Institutions (BWIs) can support our efforts to: (i) address the
               challenges of financing for sustainable development; (ii) combat tax evasion and
               eliminate illicit financial flows; (iii) invest in economic transformation and
               diversification; (iv) finance regional transformative infrastructure projects; and (v)
               enhance African voice and representation in the BWIs.

IN THIS CONTEXT

Mindful that the world’s increasingly volatile financial markets outlook means that finding the
resources to finance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be difficult, and conscious
that without the right financing and policies, we cannot achieve the set ambitions:

              We submitted for support by the BWIs transformative solutions and actions - including
               strengthening public policies, harmonizing regulatory frameworks, developing
               public/private partnerships (PPPs), improving business climate, and restructuring
               sovereign debt - to unlock the potential of people and the private sector and incentivize
               changes in financing, consumption and production patterns in support of sustainable
               development.

Acknowledging that illicit financial flows coupled with aggressive tax avoidance, repatriation of
profits and debt repayments are tragically depriving our countries of hundreds of billions of
dollars every year; and convinced that domestic resources that our countries can raise
themselves will be our largest single resource for funding our countries’ development:

              We proposed some focus areas where BWIs' assistance could help our countries to raise
               new development finance through domestic resource mobilization by increasing, inter
               alia, tax collection, private finance, international public finance; and, in particular,
               reducing illicit financial flows by 2030, with a view to eventually eliminate
               them, including through trade, monetary and financial systems, strengthened global
               economic governance, and improved international tax cooperation.

Underscoring that natural resource wealth presents vast opportunities for development;
conscious that our countries that depend on it for export earnings and fiscal revenues face
peculiar challenges and remain highly vulnerable to various external shocks; and concerned that
more than two decades since the start of diversification programs, the lack of well-designed
diversification strategies and inadequate monitoring mechanisms have not helped facilitate
economic and export diversifications for Africa’s transformation:
              We suggested few actions that the BWIs could undertake in support of our countries to
               achieve economic and export diversification by spurring innovation and technologies in
               higher-value sectors - including agriculture, infrastructure, energy, manufacturing,
               services, data improvement, and capacity building - to unleash the spirit of
               entrepreneurship and drive Africa’s transformation.

Reaffirming that infrastructure development remains a key driver and a critical enabler for
sustainable growth in Africa; expressing concern on the inadequacy of current international
funding and delivery architecture in responding to Africa's infrastructure needs; noting that the
current favorable economic landscape in the continent provides us with a unique opportunity to
collectively address regional transformative infrastructure financing with a sense of urgency:

              We proposed for Bank's support six regional transformative projects in energy and
               agriculture sectors; as well as a few innovative solutions to reduce Africa's growing
               infrastructure financing gap. We also called for BWIs' financial contributions into the
               African Development Bank's (AfDB) Africa50 initiative to unblock the challenges
               associated with infrastructure project preparation, bankability, and financial structuring
               as key prerequisites for attracting private capital investments.

Reemphasizing the critical importance              and     urgency     of    increasing Africa’s voice
and representation within the BWIs:

              We reiterated our position that the size of the IMF Executive Board be aligned
               with the institution’s growing mandate and renewed our longstanding
               commitment to a third chair for Sub-Saharan Africa. We recalled the commitment
               of the Fund membership to complete the comprehensive review of the quota
               formula by January 2013, and our position for enhanced Africa's representation
               through quota shares that reflect our economic dynamism and underlying
               vulnerabilities. We agreed to maintain a concerted dialogue with the leadership at
               the IMF and the Bank to enhance the representation of African nationals and
               effectively promote their career development within the agreed institutional goals
               of diversity and mobility at all levels of staff.
FINALLY

Cognizant that IDA is and should continue to be the most important source of funding in
achieving ambitious SDGs targets:

              We renewed our support to the WBG’s new financing initiatives to facilitate the
               transition from concessional to non-concessional funding, as well as the ongoing
               discussion of options to increase the resources available for development finance
               through IDA. We stand ready to be consulted on options that would be identified.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

We, African Governors, thank His Excellency President José Eduardo dos Santos, the
Government and the People of the Republic of Angola, for the hospitality and support they
accorded us throughout our stay in the country.
