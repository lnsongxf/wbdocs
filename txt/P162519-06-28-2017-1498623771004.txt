The report builds on and complements a previous analysis (World Bank 2015), which provides a comprehensive
review of the groundnut value chain in Senegal and the role of the country in the groundnut oil global markets. The
new report provides updated results using the Policy Analysis Matrix approach to assess competitiveness and
comparative advantage of the country’s groundnut value chain, and analyzes policy options for sustainable agro-
industrial development that keeps the country on track with global markets.

     Policy Brief


     CONTEXT

     Groundnut trade, traditionally important for Senegal,
     has experienced major structural changes
     in the global and domestic markets

     Historically a backbone of the rural economy in Senegal, groundnut production remains critical for the
     country’s poverty reduction efforts. Since the mid-19th century, groundnuts have played a central role in
     Senegalese agricultural development and trade. Today, growing the crop continues to be a primary source of
     income for a vast majority of family farms, accounting for about half of the total cropped area in the country
     and employing two-thirds of the rural population, mostly below the official poverty line. In fact, groundnuts are
     grown by 27 percent of all households in Senegal, and by 52 percent of households in extreme poverty (ANSD,
     2011). Moreover, supporting labor-intensive activities down the value chain, such as transportation, storage, and
     processing, remains an important source of non-farm employment in both formal and informal sectors.

     The global groundnut trade has gradually shifted from oil and meal to whole nuts, and Asia has become
     the major producer. In the 1970s, global trade in oil and meal (by-product of processing used as animal feed)
     exceeded trade in whole nuts. However, since the 1980s shifts in relative transport costs in favor of shipping
     whole nuts as well as shifts in consumer preferences to use groundnuts for food and not oilseeds (with soya and
     palm oil replacing peanut oil) has led to a decline in global trade in groundnut products and significant increases
     in the export of whole nuts (Figure 1). Indeed, while exports of groundnut increased 2.2 percent a year since the
     early 1980s, exports of groundnut oil and meal fell 1 percent and 2.5 percent respectively and meal exports fell,
     despite growing global consumption of both products (Diop, Beghin and Sewadeh 2005). As a result, even highly
     industrialized exporters tend to produce cake and oil only for domestic consumption, while exporting the rest as
     whole nuts that now dominate global trade flows.

Lagging behind global trends, Senegal has only recently liberalized exports of whole nuts, allowing
domestic producers to benefit from increasing international demand. Senegal, similar to the rest of Sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA), did not manage to keep abreast with these global trends, as its share of international whole
nuts trade shrunk from 17.4 percent in 1962-1964 to a mere 1 percent in 1992-2005 (SSA experienced a drop from
88.6 percent to 5.2 percent over the same period). This was largely due to inconsistent quality (stemming from
seed quality and poor management of aflatoxin), unreliable supply, and the lack of adequate incentive framework
to allow farmers to engage profitably in whole nuts trade, as well as large increases in production in Asia. In fact,
for much of the 20th century, the Government of Senegal (GoS) restricted direct exporting of whole nuts, forcing
their lower-price sales to industrial processors for export as oil and cake. With the shift in global demand away
from groundnut oil, those exports became increasingly unprofitable. This incited the Government to lift its ban on
whole nut exports in 2010, leading to a sharp rise in prices paid to producers and new opportunities for some of
Senegal’s poorest farmers and rural entrepreneurs, who have started to expand production, storage and transport
activities. The decline of processing led to eventual bankruptcy of the largest processing firm, SUNEOR, which was
re-nationalized in 2016 under its former name SONACOS (throughout the document systematically referred to as
SONACOS) to avoid liquidation and loss of several hundred jobs.

In this context, the study examines the evolution and future prospects of the sector, aiming to provide the
Government with empirical evidence for its ongoing policy deliberations. In particular, it strives to answer the
following questions:
       i.	   Will the production of groundnuts and their processing into oil remain competitive in the foreseeable
             future?
       ii.	 Will the export of whole nuts be more beneficial for farmers and the whole economy than the export of
             groundnut oil?
       iii.	 What policy, institutional, and technological changes should be considered to make the entire value
             chain more competitive?

     KEY FINDINGS

     Senegal has a clear strong comparative advantage in groundnut
     production, but an unproven and uncertain comparative
     advantage in oil processing

     The data collected for this study show that Senegal has a distinct comparative advantage in growing
     groundnuts under current open market conditions, with profitability being consistently high regardless of the
     production system. All four types of farming systems1 examined generate revenues well in excess of costs (inputs
     and factors), with profitability ranging from 27 percent for the least competitive cooperatives engaged in seed
     production to 72 percent for the most profitable irrigated off-season selling systems (Table 1). These sizeable profit
     margins arise due to the farmers’ strong underlying comparative advantage, as reflected in Domestic Resource
     Cost (DRC) ratios well below 1, which implies an efficient use of domestic factors, wherein each unit of value added
     requires only 0.27 to 0.50 units of land, labor and other resources (depending on the farming system).

     Nevertheless, the full value of whole nuts exports is not yet passed through to farmers. This is largely due
     to a heavy burden of implicit taxation to protect the oilseed industry, which reduces groundnut production and
     erodes incentives for further investment in the sector. Transfers and losses along the current value chain amount to
     24-32 percent of farmers’ current revenues (as measured by the Producer Subsidy Equivalent -PSE). These transfers
     and losses are mostly due to the historical protection of SONACOS (receiving 13-29 percent equivalent subsidy
     over the past three years), and also to a yet limited entry of competing small and medium enterprises capable of
     offering farmers access to low cost transport, storage and marketing options. These results are consistent with
     the findings of a similar study carried out in 2003 for the groundnut value chain2, with the main difference being a
     noticeable increase in the implicit taxation of farmers’ revenues in recent years (PSE and SPR for farm production
     were only around minus 3 percent in the years preceding the privatization of SONACOS).

         	 The four major categories of farms in Senegal’s groundnut sector include the following: (1) standard groundnut producers, defined as smallholders
           with below-average input use and yield; (2) irrigated farms with very high levels of inputs and yields for sale in the off-season when groundnut
           prices are high; and agricultural cooperative members with access to above-average levels of inputs and yield who sell groundnuts either for seed
           (3) or for export (4).

     BOX 1.  The PAM Methodology

     Overview
     The principal methodology used in this study is the Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM) developed by Monke and
     Pearson (1989), which helps policy makers assess the attractiveness of agricultural systems under existing
     technologies and prices by using enterprise budgets at market prices to measure the commercial profitability /
     competitiveness of various activities in the value chain, and by using social opportunity costs (comparable world
     market prices) of the same activities to measure their contribution to the economy as a whole (comparative
     advantage), taking account of resource transfers and losses due to government policies.

                                         Revenues            - Cost of inputs       - Cost of resources          = Profits from the

     Indicators
     The PAM generates three sets of indicators:

     Competitiveness (Profitability) Indicators:
          •	 Private Benefit-Cost Ratio, PBC=a/(b+c)
          •	 Resource Cost Ratio, RCR=c/(a-b)
          •	 Gross Margin, GM=d/a
          •	
     Comparative Advantage Indicators:
          •	 Social Benefit-Cost Ratio, SBC=e/f+g
          •	 Domestic Resource Cost Ratio, DRC=g/(e-f)
          •	 Social Gross Margin, SGM=h/e
          •	
     Policy Effects (Distortions) Indicators:
          •	 Nominal Protection Coefficient, NPC=a/e
          •	 Effective Protection Coefficient, EPC=(a-b)/(e-f)
          •	 Producer Subsidy Equivalent, PSE=l/a,
          •	 Subsidy Ratio to Producers, SRP=l/e.3



     Data Sources
     The PAM analysis is based on the 2010-2015 budgets of groundnut enterprises along the four stages of the value
     chain: 1) production on farms, 2) post-harvest handling and transportation, 3) processing into exportable oil and
     cake, and 4) exporting whole nuts. This analysis if further complemented by longer-term data on world prices and
     market shares since 1972.

     Following recent important reforms, the sector has benefited from expanded competition and increased
     prices. In the last decade, the Government has introduced important reforms, ceasing SONACOS monopoly by
     allowing new formal oilseed producers to enter the domestic market, and, more recently, by authorizing exports
     of raw groundnuts. Consequently, groundnut producers in Senegal now face many more options for marketing
     compared to a decade ago. The prices and market shares shown in the Figure 2 reveal the magnitude of changes
     that have already occurred, as almost all farmers now have better options than selling to SONACOS under a pre-
     determined farm gate price negotiated and set by the Groundnut Inter-professional Committee (Comité National
     Interprofessionnel de l’Arachide, CNIA)4. These trends indicate that since 2010 SONACOS has been increasingly
     unable to outbid other buyers in rural groundnut markets for domestic use and even for export, with its share of
     exports declining steadily from nearly 75 percent in 2010 to less than 5 percent in 2016.

Senegal’s competitive position in processing groundnuts into crude oil is much more uncertain, as the
dominant government-owned operator fails to generate value under current market conditions, while other
private processors seem to experience similar challenges. Transformation of whole groundnuts into oil and
meal for export by SONACOS has highly variable returns that are now particularly low. Despite large transfers from
taxpayers (fiscal subsidies) and border protection, without which the company would not have started operations
in the first place, SONACOS has been increasingly unable to maintain its market share5 and last earned significant
profits back in 2011. Its operations are traditionally characterized by high unit costs and low oil extraction rates.
Negative Gross Margins indicate private losses, while negative DRCs reveal negative value added at social prices,
indicating that the company is actually destroying wealth through its continued operation. In fact, under the new
more competitive market conditions, the company is no longer profitable. It’s continued functioning required a
nearly 30 percent of subsidy equivalent (projected) in 2016 to operate, compared to around 20 percent in 2014
(which is similar to the level needed in 2011, when SUNOCOS operated at 68 percent of its processing capacity -
the highest over the period covered by the study). As for other private processing companies, while no sufficient
data was collected to conduct a separate PAM, the fact that they have been producing below capacity the past
two years (operating at 4 and 12 percent of their capacity in 2015 and 2016, respectively) suggests that they are
also likely facing challenges in procuring sufficient grain at current market prices (further analysis is warranted to
confirm this hypothesis).

SONACOS faces daunting financial, technical and economic challenges. The sensitivity analysis based on
the available data from SONACOS demonstrates that it is not able to break even, generating negative value
added at current market prices.6 The main way for the company (or any other processor in Senegal) to become a
competitive exporter of oil would be to raise its low revenue per unit (kg) of groundnuts purchased. A breakeven
would require a 58-percent increase in oil revenues per kg of nuts purchased. With current oil export prices and
no other budget changes, this implies a costly need for SONACOS to reach an extraction rate of 44 percent, which
appears highly unlikely given the company’s current remarkably low rate of 28 percent.7 The sensitivity analysis also
tests a Government-led pathway to increased profitability - a restriction of whole nuts exports and consequent price
decreases, which effectively penalizes farmers. This scenario would require a 34 percent tax on exports, similar to
an export ban in place before 2010, which would lower domestic whole nut prices by an equal amount (34 percent),
potentially deepening poverty incidence among groundnut producers.

    	 Without commercial viability, it cannot buy enough groundnuts after harvest to prevent local market prices from falling below officially negotiated
      rates at that time, which is followed by seasonal price rises that reflect high real interest rates, storage losses, uncertainty and other contributors
      to the cost of holding groundnut stocks in rural areas.
6
    	 Presently, the company is generating negative value added - buying whole groundnuts whose export value is 292 FCFA/kg, with revenues (the
      sum of all the oil, cake and residue from nuts) providing not more than 224 CFA/kg.
7
    	 This rate is much lower than what the company could actually achieve (35 percent before privatization), or what is typically achieved by
      other groundnut processors – Chinese oil press manufacturer, for example, reports oil extraction rate between 35 and 45 percent (http://www.
      bestoilpresses.com/related-posts/how-to-improve-peanut-oil-yield.html).

       POLICY IMPLICATIONS

       With adequate policies Senegal is well positioned to transform
       the whole groundnut value chain into a powerful engine of
       economic growth, poverty reduction and social stability.

       The Government of Senegal has already undertaken major policy actions and measures as part of the
       implementation of the Agricultural Growth Acceleration Program in Senegal (PRACAS), which resulted in
       redressing the overall agricultural sector performance. In the groundnut sector in particular, the Government’s
       efforts, performance targets under PRACAS were met or exceeded for the year 2016, both nuts in terms of seed
       capital renewal with 55,000 certified seeds produced against a target of 40,000 metric tons (mt), and in terms of total
       output with 1,050,000 metric tons of groundnut produced against a target of 1,000,000 mt for 20178. Furthermore,
       the government has taken significant steps to eliminate monopsony around the supply chain of oil mills, SONACOS
       in particular, and to improve competition for the collection and marketing of groundnuts in the region. Countries,
       with greater openness to export markets for diversified products of groundnut especially high-quality nuts. The
       government has encouraged the entry of new operators in the collection, processing and export of groundnut
       oils and seeds, and took over SONACOS from the main shareholder for its next privatization. In addition, the
       government has also initiated initiatives to encourage the diversification of cropping systems in the groundnut basin,
       with expansion of rain-fed and low-land rice cropping systems, sesame and horticulture in addition to livestock.

       These efforts should be pursued and deepened to allow the country and its groundnut producers to take better
       advantage of opportunities in the global markets. In this context and moving forward, the Government should
       consider the followings:

       To achieve this objective, the Government may consider the following three policy objectives:

              •	    Groundnut sector policy cannot be done on the back of the groundnut producers, who represent a very large
                    number of poor people in the country and enjoy clear comparative advantage in their economic activity.

              •	    Polices that support the groundnut producers’ access to the best market opportunities need to be accompanied
                    by policies that mitigate fluctuation risks and provide social safety nets.

              •	    A competitive and market-driven downstream sector is more likely to identify the real economic opportunities
                    in groundnut value chain (such as confectionary nuts) rather than a small protected and subsidized oil
                    transformation sector.

       The groundnut value chain should be anchored in a stable and credible policy framework for whole nut
       exports. The new system centered on producing high quality groundnuts for exports as whole nuts can provide
       significant profitability if well managed. The diversification of actors and increased employment all along the
       groundnut export value chain has already been beneficial to producers who now face a more competitive market to
       sell their output (domestic prices jumped from 16 to 37 percent of the international price for traded whole groundnut
       between 2011 and 2016).

                                            Groundnut Value Chain Competitiveness and Prospects for Development           ix


Consolidate the competitive incentive framework for groundnut producers and
processors that also supports investments in key public goods and services
Producers should be offered the possibility to grab domestic and global markets opportunities through
full liberalization of the domestic price. CNIA farm gate price setting is tagged to ground oil price, and not to
international of whole nuts, generating substantial forgone revenues for producers. Free contractual arrangements
between informed individual and organized producers and off-takers will certainly move farm gate price closer
to the international price of whole nuts. This does preclude a mutually accepted inter-professional regulation
mechanism to ensure transparency and minimize contract breach by participants (e.g. side selling). The mission,
organizational structure and functions of current inter-professional body (CNIA) should be revisited in light of
increasing diversity of actors and to ensure a much closer adherence to global prices. A strong inter-professional
coordination body could be tasked to accompany the development of the new value chain, as the Government
steps back from production (through SONACOS) and focuses on providing key public goods such as continued
Research & Development, training and advisory services to farmers on groundnut-based production systems to
close the productivity gaps and improve management of production related risks, improving domestic marketing
through better access roads and marketing logistic along the key groundnut corridors and consolidation points,
and setting the regulatory framework for effective implementation of contractual arrangements, better access to
market information, and improved quality control.

The new value chains driven by exports of whole nuts could also generate revenue for the Government
through an export tax kept at a lowest level with the proceeds re-invested into the groundnut sector. Such a
low export tax would prevent regressive effects, in particular on farmers’ revenue and welfare. A small export tax
(ideally around 5 percent) would have limited impacts on farmers and could be re-invested to support public good
investments in the sector. Switching from the pre-2016 situation of policies that cost farmers about 20 percent of
revenue to an export tax in the order of 5 percent would bring a significant increase in farm earnings, and would
convert fiscal subsidies into a source of tax revenues. Estimates suggest that a 5-percent tax would bring the
Government an average of over 10 billion FCFA per year, with high variance and great sensitivity to the size of each
year’s harvest. If the export tax is used for the general budget it will only reduce prices to producers and eventually
dampen production and agricultural growth, however if the revenue is invested back into the sector it could also
raise total factor productivity for groundnut producers and liberate resources to be invested in other agricultural
and non-agricultural activities (Box 2).




    BOX S2


    As a contribution to this report, a simulation by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) of the
    impact of the export tax (4 and 10 percent on shelled and unshelled nuts, respectively) suggests the following
    in case of non-targeted use of revenues in consumption and / or investments: i) negative impact on groundnut
    growers and the groundnut oil industry; ii) market adjustment through prices in the short term and through outputs
    in the medium term; iii) low sectoral and macroeconomic effects, with negative growth in the agriculture sector
    and quasi neutral effect on non-agricultural and overall economic growth. However, if the collected revenue is
    invested back into the value chain, targeting farm productivity as a priority, positive impact on both agricultural
    and non-agricultural sectors is expected through increased total factor productivity (TFP) for groundnut
    production (farming), which frees labor and capital factors, stimulating their reallocation into agricultural and
    other economic sectors, and through lower prices for goods and services, as a result of increased production,
    favorable to consumption.

    Opening the market (along with climate change) will expose the sector to greater
    fluctuations and mechanisms are needed to support the sector in coping with price
    and production variability
    Establishing mechanisms to protect against higher vulnerability to price and output fluctuations can be done
    with several instruments. Higher seasonal and annual price fluctuations previously covered by the variation in
    fiscal transfers to SONACOS, are now felt directly by farmers. The examples of varying price and output patterns as
    well as the mechanism of export prices setting the floor at each harvest are demonstrated in Figure 3.9 Moreover,
    there is much greater spatial variation, with lower prices in more remote surplus areas. These fluctuations call for
    measures saving the profits from good years for the use in downturns and for investing in farmers’ resilience through
    targeted social protection measures. Several policy instruments are potentially available to pursue these goals,
    differing widely in their feasibility, effectiveness, and unintended consequences. As elaborated in the full report, the
    most promising combination of policy options involves:

            a.	 Periodic adjustments to keep the export tax under 10 percent of the global CIF price since it lowers prices
                paid to farmers even as it reduces prices for domestic buyers (including oil processors);

            b.	 Reinvesting part of the tax revenues in public services needed to strengthen the competitiveness of the
                sector, including varietal improvement, seed multiplication and market infrastructure; and

            c.	 Investing the other part of export proceeds in resilience-building and risk-mitigating social protection
                measures, including disbursals to farm households at times and places when low prices coincide with
                small harvests.

         Month-to-month storage costs and expectations about local demand determine the seasonal price rise thereafter, as sellers aim to meet demand
         gradually and draw stocks to reach zero just as the next harvest comes in. The size of each harvest does not determine price, but sets only the
         quantity exported, which is traders’ expectations about the available surplus after local demand is met. Export revenue depends on both quantity
         and price, with relatively high prices or large harvests yielding good years whose income must be saved for use in bad years when low prices
         coincide with small harvests.

Maintaining fair competition by limiting the use of public resources to protect and subsidize the industrial
processing segment, in particular SONACOS. A policy aimed only at preserving industrial processing of oil for
export would be hard to sustain, probably even in the short run. Relative prices in world markets ensure that such a
policy is possible only with drastic measures at a high cost to groundnut farmers and taxpayers, as the Government
would need to pay nearly the entire operating cost of the processing plants. Moreover, there is a considerable
opportunity cost of forgoing investments in expanding profitable exports of increasingly valuable whole nuts. The
future of the oilseed sector should be determined by market forces, and all companies operating in the sector (oil
producing and whole nuts exporting companies alike) should face a level playing field. Complete withdrawal of
the Government from the management of SONACOS and accelerating its privatization (or divestiture of its assets)
would clarify the business environment and increase investor confidence in the processing and export segment.

Focusing Government support on providing public goods that improve the country’s global competitiveness
through closing the productivity and quality gaps. Removing distortions and developing private sector led
inputs markets, taking advantage of the wide range of available climate smart germplasms that cover almost all
country’s agro ecological zones to uplift yields per hectare; facilitating and reducing transaction costs associated
with domestic marketing of groundnuts by supporting to cooperatives for better consolidate and store harvests,
ensuring adequate maintenance of farm access and feeder roads and their connection to main road networks;
improving compliance and quality management, particularly in the area aflatoxin control, through access to
improved and efficient technology, such as the IITA-released Aflsafe; promoting better farming practices through
contractual arrangement with off-takers; and supporting a market-based and sustainable seeds production and
inputs distribution system, with targeted support to accelerate farmers’ access to climate resilient technologies.
Increasingly, the option of contract farming is growing in popularity as a way to minimize risk, access needed input
subsidies, and for the oilseed producers to ensure their purchases of grain.

In summary, Senegal is well positioned to transform its groundnut sector into a powerful engine of economic
growth, poverty reduction and social stability. Senegal’s strong comparative advantage in its large groundnut
sector creates the opportunity to use export revenues for productive investments, improved input supply and
groundnut marketing, and targeted social protection against downturns. Export taxes would be much less
burdensome than previous export bans, but if the resulting revenue is not reinvested wisely the tax will return the
sector to its previously downward trajectory. Similarly, if social insurance funds are not well managed, vulnerability
will lead to less efficient and equitable forms of risk avoidance, such as not growing groundnuts at all. Success
is not guaranteed, but with well-designed policies Senegal’s unique position in world groundnut markets offers
remarkable opportunities ahead.

1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND



The groundnut value chain is of major economic, social and political importance in Senegal. Most rural households
grow the crop, and its transport, storage or processing is a key source of nonfarm employment in both formal and
informal enterprises.

Senegal’s groundnut sector was originally developed by colonial authorities, using a monopoly over exports to
control the domestic market. Prices were negotiated annually before each harvest, and applied uniformly throughout
the year in all parts of the country. This panterritorial, panseasonal pricing system was characteristic of colonial
marketing regimes, and ensured that private traders would not store or transport the crop, so farmers would have
no choice but to sell their entire surplus to a single buyer.

After independence in the 1960s, Senegal and other former colonies gradually reformed their monopoly marketing
organizations, often choosing to retain and modify them under government or private ownership (Badiane, 1997).
For groundnuts in Senegal, the French-owned oil processor was nationalized to form SONACOS in 1975, which
proved increasingly costly to operate and was eventually privatized in 2005 to form SUNEOR in 2007. That too
has suffered increasing losses and in January 2010 the government finally ended the monopoly system, allowing
farmers to sell to competing firms for either direct export or processing. Despite large fiscal subsidies SUNEOR
has been able to buy a declining fraction of each year’s groundnut harvest at the officially negotiated prices, was
unable to pay its debts and was renationalized in 2016 restoring the name SONACOS. SUNEOR/SONACOS itself
increasingly relies on other vegetable oils for its business operations, and prices actually received by farmers
after harvest result from competition among traders. The official price negotiated with government for purchases
by SUNEOR/SONACOS has had relatively little influence on farmers because other buyers are more competitive.

Despite turmoil in the groundnut processing sector, groundnut production itself remains a mainstay of the rural
economy. Growing the crop is the main source of income for family farms, involving about half of total cropped
area and about two-thirds of the rural population, most of whom are below the poverty line (ANSD, 2011). Although
SUNEOR/SONACOS is unable to compete successfully, other firms are able to buy and trade groundnuts profitably
in a variety of forms. A major destination is China, with whom Senegal signed an agreement for tariff-free access in
October 2015 (USDA, 2016).

This report builds on a number of previous studies to inform ongoing changes in the sector. Most notably, we
build on the diagnostic analysis of the groundnut value chain that was conducted in 2014 (World Bank 2015) and
addressed a set of key reform proposals including:

    •	   resolving SUNEOR/SONACOS debt and rebuilding a competitive groundnut sector;

    •	   renovating and strengthening the groundnut inter-professional committee;

    •	   building a transparent, efficient and targeted subsidy policy;

    •	   reviewing the farm gate pricing mechanism for better connection to the groundnut oil international price
         trend;

    •	   reviewing policy related to the export of groundnut seeds and grains.

2     Groundnut Value Chain Competitiveness and Prospects for Development



    The focus of this report is detailed in its Terms of Reference (Annex 4). Our primary aim is to inform the Government
    of Senegal with empirical evidence on the following questions:

        i.	   Will groundnuts production and groundnut-based oil production and processing be competitive in the
              foreseeable future?

        ii.	 Would export of whole groundnuts work better than exports of oil for farmers and the economy?

        iii.	 What policy, institutional, and technology options might be needed to make the value chain more
              competitive?

    To answer these questions, the study:

        •	    Identifies the main stages of the value chain (production, marketing, and processing) within the groundnut
              subsector in Senegal at which measurements are undertaken;

        •	    Estimates the cost structure and financial profitability of the main groundnut value chains to assess whether
              limited resources are utilized efficiently;

        •	    Assesses how competitive Senegal is in relation to other major groundnut exporters in the region/in the
              world, both in financial and economic terms;

        •	    Examines the government’s producer price policy compared to equivalent world market prices; Analyzes
              the capacity of Senegal to respond to key structural changes in groundnut systems (identify potential
              inefficiencies and suggest which areas productivity should be improved);

        •	    Derives policy implications about how to improve the comparative advantage of groundnut for Senegal.

    As detailed in our Terms of Reference, the methodology used here to answer these questions is the Policy Analysis
    Matrix (PAM) approach to measuring competitiveness for 2010 and 2015, complemented by historical data on
    prices and quantities to address longer-term changes and dynamic comparative advantage. The PAM approach,
    developed by Monke and Pearson (1989), uses enterprise budgets at market prices to measure the commercial
    profitability of various activities in the value chain, and those same activities valued at social opportunity costs
    to measure their contribution to the economy as a whole, taking account of resource transfers and losses due to
    government policies that could be altered in the future. The differences between private profits or competitiveness,
    and social values or comparative advantage, are known as divergences or distortions.

    A principal feature of the PAM method is that it takes account of each enterprise’s underlying productivity and
    policy effects at all stages of the value chain, from farm inputs to transport and marketing. Using that approach
    allows us to expand upon previous studies which focus almost exclusively on output prices, such as the Anderson
    and Masters (2009) study of agricultural distortions in Africa which included extensive analysis of the groundnut
    pricing in its chapter on Senegal (Masters 2009). To summarize the PAM budgets we make use of several kinds of
    cost-benefit ratios, whose interpretation is based on Monke and Pearson (1989), Masters (1993) and Masters and
    Winter-Nelson (1995).

2. THE MARKET FOR GROUNDNUTS IN SENEGAL



The ability of SUNEOR/SONACOS to compete with farmers’ other options has been declining steadily since 2010.
The figure below shows actual local market prices for groundnuts in shell, relative to the Government mandated
minimum prices for groundnut purchases by SUNEOR and other major traders. Actual prices are observed by
the Commissariat à la Sécurité Alimentaire (CSA), and represent a national average that is not available for all
months so each is shown by a dot. Vertical shading between the actual price and the SUNEOR procurement price
show periods in which actual prices after harvest fell below the official floor, indicating that SUNEOR and other
traders were unable to buy enough groundnuts to keep prices above the level negotiated by the Comité National
Interprofessionnel de l’Arachide (CNIA). In each marketing year, prices then rose well above the SUNEOR floor at
levels determined by the balance between local supply and demand from consumers and exporters. These trends
indicate that, since 2010, SUNEOR has been increasingly unable to outbid other buyers in rural groundnut markets
for domestic use and even for export. The bottom of Figure 4 shows SUNEOR’s share of Senegalese groundnut
exports, which has declined steadily from nearly 75% in 2010 to less than 5% in 2016.

4     Groundnut Value Chain Competitiveness and Prospects for Development



    As indicated above, a characteristic feature of groundnut markets is the seasonal pattern of local prices within
    Senegal. Prices fall at harvest as local buyers accumulate stocks for storage and processing for export or local
    sale later in the season at higher prices. The rate of seasonal price increase reflects costs of storage, especially
    the implicit cost of capital involved in holding a valuable crop from one month to the next, as well as traders’
    expectations about supply-demand balances in future months. These prices have trended up over time in real
    terms, relative to overall inflation in Senegal, as the groundnut harvest has become an increasingly valuable export
    product.

    The figure below provides CSA shows the seasonal price variation in local markets for groundnuts in shell. Darker
    colors show more recent year. From the data it is apparent that prices are not only trending upward at the start
    of each marketing year in October, but also rising faster from month to month as the market transitions from the
    fixed-price system negotiated through CNIA before 2010, to the market-price system negotiated between individual
    farmers and individual traders since then.

3. COMPETITIVENESS, COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE
AND DISTORTIONS BY ACTIVITY



The PAM approach to policy analysis begins by identifying specific activities at each stage of the value chain, and
then constructing enterprise budgets for those activities at market prices to measure their competitiveness and at
social opportunity costs to measure their comparative advantage relative to other activities, as shown in the figure
below.

The construction and interpretation of PAM budgets was originally detailed in Monke and Pearson (1989), with
subsequent extensions in Masters (1993) and Masters and Winter-Nelson (1995). Using the notation above,
indicators of competitiveness are the Benefit-Cost Ratio, BCR=a/(b+c), the Resource Cost Ratio, RCR=c/(a-b),
and Gross Margin, GM=d/a. Indicators of comparative advantage are the Social Benefit-Cost ratio, SBC=e/f+g, the
Domestic Resource Cost ratio, DRC=g/(e-f), and the Social Gross Margin, SGM=h/e. Indicators of policy effects
are the Nominal Protection Coefficient, NPC=a/e, the Effective Protection Coefficient, EPC=(a-b)/(e-f), the Producer
Subsidy Equivalent, PSE=l/a, and the Subsidy Ratio to Producers, SRP=l/e.

In this study budgets for groundnut enterprises are constructed at each distinct stage of the value chain:
(1) groundnut production on farms, (2) transport and handling after harvest, (3) processing into exportable oil and
cake, and (4) exporting whole nuts. Groundnut production is further divided into six distinct kinds of farm enterprise,
and processing is split into two kinds of oil expressing activities. This allows us to analyze competitiveness,
comparative advantage and policy effects for ten distinct kinds of activity, each of which is presented here as the
national average for that activity. Future work could consider diversity within each of these categories, including
differences by region and other enterprise characteristics.

6     Groundnut Value Chain Competitiveness and Prospects for Development




    3.1 PRODUCTION
    For the first stage of groundnut production we provide six distinct enterprise budgets, based on three major
    categories of farms in Senegal’s groundnut sector:

        1.	 Smallholders in low-input systems with limited access to inputs, which we call the standard farm;

        2.	 Members of agricultural cooperatives who use moderate input levels to attain above-average yields; and

        3.	 Farmers with access to irrigation who can use high input levels and sell at high prices in the off-season.

    Most groundnuts come from the first two categories of farms, but taking account of irrigated production is also
    important (Lynn et. al. 2015). For standard farms we compute budgets in two distinct enterprises: production for sale
    to local markets at prices measured by the CSA during the post-harvest selling season (Oct-Jan), and production
    for sale to SUNEOR at official seasonal prices set through the CNIA. For cooperative members we do budgets for
    sales to both of those markets, plus a third budget for sales as groundnut seeds. For irrigated farms, we use local
    market prices measured by the CSA in high-priced season before rainfed crops are harvested (June-Sept).

    All farm budgets represent the 2015 harvest with corresponding prices and subsidies which are presented in 2015
    FCFA/kg. Across all budgets, costs and revenues are annualized and adjusted per kg of groundnuts in shell, taking
    account of all inputs and outputs of the system. Most notably revenue from groundnut hay is included in revenues
    for all farming systems, as this has become an increasingly important source of farm income and livelihoods (Noba
    et al. 2015).

    Standard Farm Budgets: The standard farm budget was constructed from a variety of sources to create a
    composite image of the average low-input farm in the basin arachidier. Using a World Bank funded investigation of
    cooperative farm systems performed by M. Luzietoso in Feb. 2016 as a base we adjusted the figures to represent
    a lower yielding system. For example, labor costs, which were very high in the Luzietoso budgets were adjusted
    according to available government production budgets (DAPSA, 2013 and 2016) and expert opinion. Seeds, which
    for cooperative budgets were purchased in full each year were adjusted to include 50% seed retention. Yields for
    the standard farm budgets are 740 kg/ha, representing the average of the lower 50% of regional groundnut yields
    (GOS, 2016).

    Irrigated Farm Budget: The irrigated farm budget is an adjusted version of the 2009 irrigated system budget
    produced by SAED, the Société Nationale d’Aménagement et d’Exploitation des Terres du Delta du Fleuve Sénégal
    et des Vallées du Fleuve Sénégal et de la Falémé. Yields on these farms are much higher (3500 kg/ha) than in
    rainfed operations, making the added cost of irrigation fees and unsubsidized seed reasonable. This is the only
    budget which includes large amounts of fertilizer application, again relying on high yields to remain profitable,
    which it does in both private and social budgets.

    Cooperative Budgets: The bulk of the cooperative budgets for both seed producers and non-seed producers
    was taken from the Luzietoso budgets. However, some important adjustments were made. For example, as in the
    standard budget, labor valuation and quantity was reduced using government budget estimates. In addition, it is
    important to note that these producers were assumed to buy ecrémé seed at a government subsidized rate.

    Table 1 presents the itemized farm budgets at private prices, and Table 2 presents them at social opportunity costs.
    Divergences between the two account for observed subsidies on seeds, other farm inputs and financing (MAER,
    2016), as well as market inefficiencies that would be remedied by policies designed to improve competitiveness
    by facilitating entry of new traders exporting whole nuts after harvest. The social opportunity costs shown here are
    based on measured 2015 export revenues, minus the actual costs incurred by exporters and transporters in that
    year including a ten percent profit margin for traders in a competitive market. In the appendix, we also present
    social costs that would follow from a failure to alter current policies, in which revenues in the social budget reflect
    those currently found on the open market as measured by the CSA for the 2015 harvest.

The policy analysis matrix reveals any divergences between private incentives and social costs along the value

From them we can see that all systems are profitable in private terms, but much more so in social terms.

Tables 5 summarizes the policy distortions between private and social budgets. The net tariff-equivalent Subsidy
Rate to Producers is -20 percent, implying that 20 percent of what farmers would have earned in a competitive
market is now being transferred to the rest of Senegalese society. As shown in the budgets for processing, these
funds are now absorbed by SUNEOR, but after reforms this amount could be retained by farmers as their own
revenue, or be used by government to provide public services from export tax revenues.

     Results of the production budgets indicate that groundnut production remains profitable relative to farmers’ other
     opportunities, despite the many challenges they face in the groundnut sector. This very strong competitiveness and
     comparative advantage has sustained the groundnut value chain for decades.


     3.2 TRANSPORT AND HANDLING
     Transport and handling of groundnuts from the farm to end-users plays a crucial role in the value chain. It is a
     relatively labor-intensive activity, offering high value added in the sense of employment opportunities per unit of
     tradable output. Under what is known as the carreau-usine system, transporters were brought into government-
     sponsored price negotiations with SUNEOR/SONACOS and other big oil producers, to set farmgate prices and
     transporter payments at the beginning of each season. Transporters may also provide other services related to
     groundnuts and other crops, including storage. Indeed many informants mentioned that more diversified agrifood
     enterprises, known as operateur privé stockeur (OPS), are now transporting large quantities of groundnuts and also
     competing with end-users to hold stocks so as to arbitrage over both space and time. For the purposes of these
     budgets (Tables 6-10) we were unable to obtain independent information on these OPS agents, so we present only
     the negotiated terms as provided by SUNEOR. They are adjusted to incorporate taxes and disaggregate diesel
     costs based on FAO (MAFAP) provided estimates.

     Results of Tables 6-10 reveal that transport activities are generally competitive, with moderate profit rates at both
     private prices and social costs, and face no special taxes on their groundnut activities.

3.3 PROCESSING INTO OIL AND CAKE
Groundnut processing in Senegal takes place through a few primary channels which we present below. Industrial
processing of groundnuts into oil has historically taken over half of the groundnut harvest, the vast majority of which
is then exported in crude form (USDA). Industrial oil expressers such as SUNEOR/SONACOS move large quantities
of groundnuts around the country to their centralized factories for processing and shipping. On the other end of the
spectrum are dispersed artisanal oil processors who purchase from local markets and sell crude and refined oil for
that same market.




3.3.1 PROCESSING BY SUNEOR/SONACOS
In the tables below we present the private and social budget for SUNEOR. These are budgets of continuing
operation, meaning they do not take into capital recovery costs for fixed assets and land; however, they do take
into account repair costs. Unlike the other budgets presented in this report which are based on harvest years, the
SUNEOR budgets are based on audited financial statements which use calendar years.

Costs and revenues are presented in terms of 2015 FCFA per kg of groundnut in-shell processed as throughput
each year, adjusted by the value of groundnut products in audited sales data. Yearly variation in operating costs per
unit of throughput depends on largely on volume handled, so costs per unit are presented in the form of a four-year
average covering 2011 through 2014. Revenues were estimated using financial statement valuation of end product
and corroborated with SUNEOR provided FOB prices. Financial statements are not yet available for 2015 and 2016,
so revenues for those years are based on FOB prices instead of SUNEOR’s own financial statements.

As can be seen below, the three most important factors in determining SUNEOR competitiveness are the cost
of groundnuts purchased, the value of oil and cake sold, and the cost of operations. Recent years involve large
losses regardless of prices paid to farmers, due to very low revenue per unit of groundnuts purchased. Revenues
as declared in financial statements imply extraction rates below 30%, which is far less than the levels typically
achieved by other groundnut processors. This kind of inefficiency is compounded by high costs of operation, in
part because of low throughput. Even with very large subsidies from government the company lacks the revenue
needed to buy enough groundnuts to operate its machinery at full capacity. Given low extraction rates, however,
raising subsidies to increase throughput would just increase the total losses, and in any case these are symptoms
rather than causes of SUNEOR’s dependence on subsidies, as the underlying lack of commercial viability limits
payoffs to efficient operations.

Tables 11 and 12 below provide enterprise budgets for SUNEOR operations at private and social costs. The social
cost reflects distortions observed on the ground and through government documents. The SUNEOR price paid to
suppliers in has benefited from occasional subsidies paid by the government to SUNEOR in order to maintain price
floor set by CNIA and the government. A portion of the subsidy on price has been attributed to SUNEOR in years
that the market price was above the SUNEOR price, while it has not been in year when the price was indeed below
the SUNEOR price. The budget also reflects the removal of operating subsidies, and the overpayment of labor
apparent in their financial documents (votresalaire.org).

     Summary PAMs in Table 13 show that transfers have taken place on the revenue side through fiscal subsidies while
     there has been an implicit social tax on costs through higher labor costs. The net result is very large social losses
     in all years except 2011 and 2013, and despite large subsidies there were private losses as well in all years except
     2011, 2012 and 2013.

     A distinctive feature of SUNEOR operations is that value added at social prices is so low as to have fallen below
     zero, and stayed negative since 2014. As shown in Table  14 below, this makes the traditional DRC measure of
     comparative advantage useless for comparisons. A more general social benefit-cost (SCB) ratio is therefore

as shown above even these heavy subsidy rates are not sufficient to maintain private profitability.

3.2.2 PROCESSING BY ARTISANAL OPERATORS
Small-scale artisanal oil expressors have been gaining attention from policy makers and development groups as
an opportunity for labor-intensive entrepreneurship in small towns and cities (World Bank, 2015, p.41). Previously
a cause for some concern because of high rates of aflatoxin, interviews with local experts suggest that improved
processing methods have helped reduce risks in artisanally processed oils (Lynn et.al., p.39). Enterprise budgets
for this activity are sufficiently simple as to summarize quickly in Table 16. Costs refer to continuing operation of
existing facilities, rather than new establishments, so as to permit direct comparison with our budgets for SUNEOR/
SONACOS. Costs are based on FAO estimates and Luzietoso (World Bank 2016) budgets, and refer only to the
2015 harvest due to lack of data for previous years. The budget shown here refers to an enterprise with a throughput
of roughly 5400 mt per year, with high levels of labor employment as detailed in the itemized budget (Annex A1.2).

     3.3. EXPORTING WHOLE NUTS
     The growth in whole groundnut export, which has received much recent attention, has grown substantially since
     export restrictions were lifted in 2010. These processors do not benefit from the price setting of the CNIA and
     government, but buy nuts on the local markets, shell them in warehouses near the markets and ship them directly
     to the port (Lynn & Hathi, 2016). Budgets presented below are from a single exporter, SEDAB, which shared cost
     data from their 2015 marketing year with us.

20     Groundnut Value Chain Competitiveness and Prospects for Development




     4. GLOBAL TRENDS AND MARKET DYNAMICS
     The PAM results presented in this report are based on enterprise budgets for cultivation, marketing and processing
     of groundnuts harvested in Senegal between 2010 and 2015. To project forward into future scenarios and policy
     options, a longer perspective on prices and quantities is needed. The data presented here focus on changes
     since 2000, in the context of evolving market conditions since comparable data became available beginning in
     1972. These data allow us to assess longer-term competitiveness and comparative advantage at each stage of the
     groundnut value chain, so as to answer the fundamental questions motivating this report:

          i.	     Will groundnuts production and groundnut-based oil production and processing remain competitive in the
                  foreseeable future?

          ii.	 Will exports of raw groundnut work better for farmers and the economy?

          iii.	 What policy, institutional, and technology options might be needed to make the value chain more
                competitive?



     4.1 WORLD PRICES AND TRADE BY PRODUCT TYPE
     The question of whether Senegal should export groundnuts in whole form or processed into oil and meal depends
     fundamentally on the price premium offered for these processed products, relative to the value of whole nuts and
     the costs of processing.

     The world price premium for oil over whole nuts since 2000 is shown in the figure below, using monthly data for
     standard varieties and locations. Senegal may be able earn more or less than these baseline values for its whole
     nuts or its oil, but the figure shows clearly that, in general since 2003, the world-market premium paid for oil over
     whole nuts has fluctuated with brief spikes above 40% in 2004, 2008 and 2013, followed by long valleys below 20%
     and many months in which the premium varies around zero.

One reason for the low premium on oil relative to whole nuts is that processing nuts into oil also generates cake,
which is sold as animal feed. Senegal exports both oil and cake, but there is now relatively little international trade in
cake and no world price series for it is available. The fact that groundnut oil enters international trade in much larger
volumes than groundnut cake indicates that expressing is done in countries that consume the cake locally to feed
as livestock. This was not always the case. Groundnut cake, also known as meal, was previously traded even more
widely than groundnut oil. The shift in processing from places like Senegal that export the meal to places where
meal is consumed locally is among the most important changes in world groundnut markets.

Long-term trends in world trade volumes for all three major groundnut products since 1972 are shown in the figures
below. These start in the first year for which comparable data are available, and a subsequent chart provides a
close-up view of changes since 2000 for comparison with the chart above showing the premium paid for oil over
whole nuts. These charts reveal that, in the 1970s, world trade in groundnut meal equaled or exceeded trade
in whole nuts, and both were much larger than trade in oil. Oil expressing occurred either in countries where
groundnuts were grown, like Senegal, or in countries where the oil was consumed.

The location of oil expressing shifted gradually during the 1980s and 1990s, as world trade in whole nuts increased
steadily and world trade in groundnut meal declined. During a brief period from 2000 to 2005 trade in meal fluctuated
around the same volume as trade in oil, but since 2005 world trade in meal has continued its decline as trade in
nuts continued to rise. The trend that began in the 1970s has come to its logical conclusion, with world groundnut
trade being conducted primarily in the form of whole nuts. Oil expressing occurs primarily where both oil and meal
are consumed.

     4.2 SENEGAL MARKET SHARES AND COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE
     As shown above, since 1972 the location of groundnut oil processing has shifted away from groundnut-exporting
     countries like Senegal to the places where oil and meal are consumed, leaving international trade in groundnuts to
     be dominated by shipments of whole nuts.

     Figure  7 below reveals how Senegal’s share of the dwindling market for internationally-traded oil and meal has
     fluctuated over time from the 1970s through the 1990s, and then declined steading after 2000. Direct exports
     of whole nuts from Senegal were permitted only occasionally, such as during the boom years around 1975, until
     Senegal joined the world market tendency to trade groundnuts in that form in 2014 and 2015. Before 2014, Senegal
     was transforming almost all of its surplus nuts into oil and meal and exporting both. In the late 1980s and 1990s the
     country’s market share of oil was significantly above its market share of meal, indicating that other countries were
     crushing nuts for their home oil markets and exporting the meal, but after 2000 the two market shares returned to
     fluctuating in tandem as the rest of the world processed its groundnuts close to demand for both oil and meal.

The next set of long-term data presented here reveal key trends underlying Senegal’s market shares. In Figure 8
below, the top line shows Senegal’s groundnut yields per area of harvested land relative to the world average. This
peaked above 100% of the global mean in 1975 and then fluctuated around a downward trend until reaching its
lowest level just above 20% in 2002, and then recovering to vary around 50% since then. The lightest shaded line,
second from top in most years, shows Senegal’s share of global groundnut area harvested which peaked in 1975 at
around 7% of global groundnut area and then declined steadily to just above 2% in 2003, after which it recovered
to above 4% since 2014.

Taken together, area and yield determine Senegal’s share of world groundnut production which is shown in the
figure below by the orange colored line. The country’s share of global groundnuts peaked in 1974-75 at above 7%,
declined to below 1% in 2002, and then recovered to above 2% since 2014. This contrasts clearly with Senegal’s
share of world groundnut processing, which peaked in 1974-75 above 9% and then declined to below 2% in 1995
and has remained below 1% since 2011.

     The picture presented by the figure above clearly reveals how Senegal now plays a very small role in the global
     groundnut processing industry, even as it remains a major player in the production of groundnuts as such. The
     country has successfully ended the 1980s and 1990s declines in relative groundnut area and yield compared to
     other producers, and since 2002 has achieved significant increases in its global share of area planted. The country
     has not yet recovered its position in terms of relative yield per hectare, which calls for renewed efforts to improve
     supply of high-quality seeds and other inputs.



     4.3 THE ROLE OF CHINA
     Many actors in the groundnut sector are interested in Senegal’s trade with China, which has recently become a
     large importer of groundnut oil and a significant importer of whole nuts. The figure below traces China’s evolving
     role in global groundnut markets, in terms of its net trade (exports minus imports) of whole nuts, oil and meal. The
     top line shows how China emerged as a major exporter after its agricultural reforms of 1980, peaking at around 50%
     of global exports in 2001. Over the past 15 years China has steadily shifted its supply-demand balance towards its
     own domestic consumers, becoming a net importer of whole nuts in 2015 and 2016.

     China’s oil expressing industry led its net exports of oil to rise after 1980 to a peak above 20% of global markets in
     1985, after which it cut back on oil exports to around zero in most of the 1990s, and became an increasingly large
     net importer after 2006. The country’s trade in groundnut meal largely tracked its groundnut oil trade until the 2000s
     when it absorbed large volumes of meal to feed its livestock, but that has ended as the country turns to importing
     whole nuts instead.

China’s changing share of world trade is underpinned by changes in the underlying competitiveness of its groundnut
production and processing sector. In Figure  10 below, the top line shows China’s groundnut yields per area of
harvested land relative to the world average. China’s yields were about 120% of world averages in 1975, but after
the country’s 1980 agricultural reforms those yields rose much faster than yields elsewhere, reaching more than
200% of the world average after 1996 and remaining well above that level since 2005. Meanwhile, China’s share
of global area planted to groundnuts stopped growing in 2000 and has stayed below 20% of the world total since
2002, leading the country’s share of global production to peak at about 42% in 2000 and stay around 40% since
then. In 2000, China’s share of global processing began to rise above its share of groundnut production, reflecting
the global tendency of processing to be located closer to consumers of groundnut products than to the farmers who
grow the crop. China’s share of processing reached above 50% in 2015 and is estimated to remain there in 2016.

     Taken together, the long-term trends presented in this section, plus the enterprise budgets and PAM results
     presented earlier, clearly indicate that Senegal has ongoing competitiveness and comparative advantage in growing
     groundnuts for export as whole nuts but not processing for export of oil and cake. The location of processing has
     been gradually shifting over several decades, from where groundnuts are produced to where they are consumed.
     Senegal persisted in not exporting its whole nuts through the 2000s, even as exporting oil and cake became
     increasingly unprofitable and its market share declined. Now that the country has allowed export of whole nuts
     Senegal is regaining market share, and with investments adapted to the new demand for whole nuts rather than
     oil or cake the country’s groundnut sector could grow quickly. In the following section we address the principal
     scenarios and policy options by which Senegal could take advantage of this evolving situation.

5. SCENARIOS AND POLICY OPTIONS FOR SENEGAL


The decline of Senegal’s oil-expressing industry since its peak of global market share in 1975 has had profound
effects on the country. The thousand or so individuals who are employed directly and the many others who are
invested in processing groundnuts into oil and cake find their livelihoods at stake, and a decades-old system of
politically negotiated prices can no longer be enforced. A clear majority of Senegalese people are benefiting from
the change, including hundreds of workers in the labor-intensive business of transporting, handling and shelling
groundnuts, plus more than 400,000 low-income farmers who grow them. These and other Senegalese workers
no longer need to support an unprofitable oil processing industry, but their gains involve unprecedented direct
exposure to groundnut price fluctuations. Some of these price changes will offset changes in yields, when high
prices are earned in low-yield years or vice-versa, but occasionally farmers will experience periods in which both
yields and prices are low, just as there will be occasional boom years when both yields and prices are high.



5.1 STRATEGIC GOALS AND AVAILABLE INSTRUMENTS
Policy options to address the decline of oil expressing in Senegal can be considered in terms of the following
strategic goals:

    (1)	 limit the decline and permit future recovery of the groundnut expressing industry;

    (2) 	accelerate expansion of the value chain for export of whole nuts; and

    (3) 	protect consumers and farmers against fluctuations in prices and real income, especially for farmers when
         low prices coincide with low yields.

The policy instruments available to achieve each of these goals are listed below; those which are feasible to
implement are then retained for further discussion in a set of viable options and future scenarios for groundnut
sector development.

For the first aim, to limit the decline and permit future recovery of the groundnut expressing industry, the available
instruments are:

    (1.1) continued fiscal subsidies, which is clearly unaffordable as the government would need to keep paying
          the industry’s entire cost of operations; or

    (1.2) a return to restricting exports of whole nuts, which would force farmers to sell nuts to processors at lower
          prices than they could receive from exporters.


Of these, only option 1.2 is politically acceptable, but would be very costly in terms of economic growth and poverty
reduction. Restricting whole nut exports always costs farmers and other workers in the value chain more than the
benefits received by processors, thus reducing growth. Furthermore, in the Senegalese context farmers who sell
groundnuts are generally poorer than those who buy groundnuts and therefore benefit from lower prices. Each
year’s potential gains from trade are lost forever, compounding the impoverishing effect of export restrictions.

28     Groundnut Value Chain Competitiveness and Prospects for Development



     For the second aim, to accelerate expansion of this new value chain, the main policy action needed is a clear
     commitment to preserve and improve opportunities to export whole nuts, thereby encouraging entry and investment
     by new enterprises of all kinds. That commitment can then be backed up by specific actions including:

         (2.1) increased investment in developing the input supply sector, to deliver larger volumes of improved seeds
               for both higher yields and improved quality, including increased sales of confectionary-grade nuts;

         (2.2) continued investments to support farmers in expanding acreage, increasing yields, and protecting
               groundnuts from aflatoxin and other post-harvest losses;

         (2.3) a new focus on rural marketing systems tailored to entry and competition among agrifood entrepreneurs
               engaged in the purchase, storage, transport and handling of higher value, aflatoxin-free improved
               varieties of whole nuts.

     All of these policy options involve much lower fiscal costs but significant investments in training and institutional
     change. The largest change would be for option 2.3. By encouraging entry and competition among agrifood
     entrepreneurs, the country would create new rural and urban jobs in a relatively dynamic, labor-intensive sector.
     Free entry of groundnut traders keeps the margin between farmgate and export prices as small as possible, thus
     ensuring maximum pass-through of gains from export opportunities. Traders who face limited competition can earn
     monopoly profits, so this option requires a clear focus on facilitating entry of new firms and gradual improvements
     of the infrastructure that they share such as rural roads and marketing facilities, rural electrification and transport
     hubs.

     For the third aim, to protect farmers and agrifood workers against income fluctuations such as when low prices
     coincide with low yields, the available instruments include:

         (3.1) crop insurance, perhaps involving a combination of weather or yield indexes to protect against low
               harvests and price indexes to protect against low prices;

         (3.2) price stabilization, undertaken through government stockholding or variable export restrictions; or

         (3.3) social insurance, in the form of conditional cash transfers triggered by eligibility for support determined in
               a transparent and equitable manner.

     Of these three, options 3.1 and 3.2 are traditional market-based tools attempted by numerous governments around
     the world. The first instrument (3.1) is the now the principal farm support instrument used by the United States,
     for example, and there are many instances of its introduction in other countries (Iturrioz, 2009, p.6). These are all
     heavily subsidized by taxpayers, however, and they are well known to give farmers much less benefit than their
     fiscal cost due to the distortions in behavior that they introduce, and the difficulty of designing insurance that
     actually pays off in times of need. Insurance for crop yield and prices should therefore be seen as a mechanism for
     spending money to deliver subsidies in response to interest-group lobbying, rather than a way to accelerate growth
     and sustain poverty reduction by profitably expand a value chain. The only forms of crop coverage known to be
     economically efficient are those for commercially insurable risks such as fire and hail.

     The option of price stabilization (3.2) is infeasible to accomplish via stockholding, because any change in
     government stocks would be offset by changes in quantity traded or private stocks held by farmers and groundnut
     traders. Some price stabilization could be achieved by a variable export levy, or by an ad-valorem export levy that
     rises when world prices are high and declines when world prices are low. The main limitation of price stabilization
     is that it fails to protect producers against the most important form of risk, which is when low prices coincide with
     low yields.

The social insurance approach (option 3.3) is increasingly popular around the developing world, primarily because
new technologies for monitoring and transfer of funds permit protection of overall livelihoods, rather than narrowly
defined price or weather risks, with relatively low transaction costs (Grugel and Riggirozzi, 2012). Senegal itself is
among the pioneers in this domain, having recently introduced a Bourse Familiale for which eligibility has already
been drawn up using a national register of 450,000 low-income households. The government does not yet have
funds to provide transfers to all of those eligible, but the Bourse Familiale infrastructure offers a promising and
viable mechanism by which to channel funds to rural areas affected by eventual downturns in the groundnut sector.

A viable combination of policy options would involve an export tax whose revenues would be dedicated to investment
in both groundnut productivity and social protection. This reform package could begin with a variable levy or ad-
valorem tax on whole nut exports that generates revenue, and in so doing lowers and somewhat stabilizes prices
paid by groundnut buyers inside Senegal. Roughly one third of WTO members used export taxes as of June 2014,
primarily developing countries in situations somewhat similar to groundnuts in Senegal (Zambersky and Cajka
2015). Many countries use export taxes that worsen inequality and also efficiency (Laborde et al. 2013), but a well-
managed tax can be an attractive alternative to other instruments (Piermartini 2004) that remains a widely-used part
of the policy toolkit (Solleder 2013). Recent case studies of their use in Africa include Mkumba (2015) on timber
exports from Malawi, and Fitawek and Kalaba (2016) on leather exports from Ethiopia. A detailed simulation study
of oilseed export taxes in Argentina and Indonesia is provided by Bouet et al. (2014).

In Senegalese situation, a tax on exports of whole groundnuts would reduce prices received by groundnut farmers,
but the cost of that could be more than offset by farmers’ gains from increased public investment in input supply
and marketing services. Revenues from the tax could also be disbursed via the Bourse Familiale at the times and
places of greatest need. Switching from the recent export ban to a future export tax would turn the groundnut sector
from a fiscal cost that slows economic growth and worsens income distribution to a source of fiscal revenues that
can accelerate inclusive growth as long as the export tax rate and resulting revenue are managed appropriately to
invest in higher productivity and insurance against times when low yields coincide with low prices.



5.2 MODELING THE IMPACTS OF EXPORT TAXES ON THE
GROUNDNUT SECTOR IN SENEGAL
Constructing scenarios to predict how the Senegalese groundnut market will change over time and respond
various policy options involves construction of an analytical model. The approach illustrated in the figures below
summarizes standard economic theories of how actors in the groundnut value chain would respond to an export tax
or other policy changes, including their effects on poverty and economic development.

Figures 11 and 12 represent total Senegalese production and consumption of whole nuts available in Dakar and
other port cities for local consumption or shipment to the rest of the world in any given year. With free international
trade the price paid for exports (Pfob) would determine quantities produced (Qp’) and consumed (Qc’), but with an
export tax the net price received by producers and paid by consumers is the observed local price (P), with the
associated lower quantity produced (Qp) and consumed (Qc).

As shown in Figure 12, in each year the farmers’ losses from an export tax are larger than the sum of consumer
gains and groundnut fund revenues, due to deadweight loss from foregone trade. This observation is the basis
for standard economic arguments against export taxation. The economic cost of taxation depends heavily on the
tax rate, as deadweight losses rise exponentially and tax revenues obtained increase less than linearly with any
increase. For example, doubling an export tax will less than double tax revenue, but much more than double the
deadweight losses to Senegalese society. For this reason, a lower level of export tax is more likely to be cost-
effective, and its net value to Senegalese society depends entirely on how the revenue is invested. Figure 12
illustrates how farmers would benefit from investments in productivity enhancements such as improved seeds,
which raise yields and lower cost per unit sold, thus allowing farmers to gain the area shaded with dots. The
magnitude of these gains could potentially be much larger than farmers’ losses from lower prices, if the policy led to
new investment in high-value services such as seed systems that are now underfunded because the government’s
available resources are being absorbed by SUNEOR.

To trace the effects of alternative policies to the farm level, it is helpful to move beyond the single year model
shown above to consider price dynamics over time in rural markets. The standard economic model of storage and
price formation is shown in Figure 13 below, for a hypothetical region isolated from the rest of Senegal. For visual
clarity the picture is simplified by imagining that each successive crop is harvested simultaneously, at which point
prices fall and then gradually rise to their next peak the following year. Each year’s average price is determined
by expected demand relative to local supply, so prices start and end lower after a large harvest, and higher after
a small harvest. Within each year, the percentage rate of price increase from month to month depends on the cost
of storage, which is the opportunity cost of capital invested in stocks plus any storage losses. Improvements in
the marketing system that reduce storage costs will flatten the curve, reducing seasonal fluctuations around each
year’s average price.

The simplified picture in Figure 13 above is clearly unrealistic for groundnuts in Senegal, where almost all production
areas have potentially profitable opportunities to sell at least some of each harvest to other places including overseas
markets. Figure 14 below adds the effect of export opportunities, with a horizontal line at the time of harvest showing
the price level offered by buyers for transport and sale elsewhere. That price reflects the supply, demand and
trade diagram shown in Figures 11 and 12, with fluctuations over time such as the changes actually observed in
Figure 1 at the start of this report.

     The figure above helps explain actual price patterns observed in rural areas. In each year that exports take place,
     average prices are above what they would be in the absence of trade. Local prices are set by export opportunities
     after each harvest, and remain at export price levels for as long as transporters are actively buying for shipment to
     other regions. Once each year’s surplus is sold, the local market becomes self-sufficient and prices rise at the cost
     of storage from month to month until the next harvest.

     In the hypothetical scenarios shown here as well as the actual prices shown in Figure 1, each year’s average local
     price is determined by the value of groundnuts sold for export at the end of each harvest. Based on the supply-
     demand analysis shown in Figure 11, urban prices after each harvest would be foreign prices minus any export
     taxes. Sellers in rural markets must also pay for transport and handling to the urban market, so any improvements
     in infrastructure and marketing systems that lower transaction costs will bring a correspondingly higher rural price
     level each year. Our supply-demand diagrams emphasize that local prices for goods that can profitably be traded
     with other regions do not depend on local supply and demand. Local prices are set by foreign prices net of taxes
     and transaction costs. Fluctuations in local supply and demand do not affect prices, but they do determine the
     quantities produced, consumed and traded. This effect is illustrated in Figures 15 and 16 below.

The figure above shows how farm income and export earnings from each marketing year depends on both the level
of export prices and the size of the harvest. In the stylized example shown here, harvests are large in years 1 and 2
and then small in years 2 and 3, while export prices alternate between high and low. This allows us to simulate the
full range of possible interactions between price and quantity. In reality the frequency and sequence of such shocks
will vary, and there may be many more bad years than good ones. The best years are when high prices coincide
with large harvests, and the worst are when both are low.

Figure 16 below translates the example shown in Figure 14 back to a supply-demand framework, so as to show
yearly variation in export tax revenue and its effects on economic stability. A smaller local harvest is illustrated
by shifting the supply curve to the left, and lower global supply-demand balance shifts the horizontal world price
downward. For realism, some exports remain profitable in all years, but export quantities and hence tax revenues
vary widely. As drawn here, when prices are high the smaller harvest cuts export tax revenue in half. When prices
are low there is an even greater reduction in tax revenue, and in the worst year total exports are almost down to zero.

The analysis presented here is particularly helpful to assess options for price stabilization. Most importantly,
accumulating or releasing stocks has little effect on prices in this setting, for the same reason that large and small
harvests do not affect price: those changes cause fluctuations in quantities exported. Adjusting government stocks
can influence market prices only when trade volumes are fixed, perhaps at zero, and even then a change in the
government’s stocks is likely to cause an offsetting change in the private stocks held by farmers and wholesalers.
For this reason stockholding is primarily used as a farm subsidy measure to deliver targeted benefits for political
reasons at a particular time and place, and it generally does so much less efficiently than other instruments.

The price stabilization instrument revealed by this analysis to be very effective is variation in the export tax. The
vertical gap between world and local prices, Pfob – P, is the magnitude of the tax when expressed in FCFA/kg. This
can be fixed at a specific rate, or it can be adjusted as a variable levy: in the case of whole groundnuts, for example,
the rate might be calculated on a sliding scale from 80 FCFA/kg when export prices ex-Dakar are above 1000 FCFA/
kg, down to 10 FCFA/kg when export prices are below 500 FCFA/kg. Fixing the percentage rate at an intermediate
ad valorem level also provides some price stabilization. In the variable levy example just given, percent rates range
from 8% to 2%. With a fixed 5% rate, the specific tax would vary from 50 to 25 FCFA/kg over that range.

     Allowing the specific tax rate to vary with export prices provides some price stabilization from year to year, which is
     particularly helpful for groundnut consumers in urban areas. Among farmers, price risks are usually less important
     than variation in harvest quantities, especially given climate and health risks that can harm all the crops and livestock
     on a given farm. For this reason, actions that raise and stabilize farm production or provide social insurance for
     overall incomes are almost always more powerful than price stability as a source of economic resilience for farmers.
     The main kind of price stabilization that helps farmers comes from investments to lower seasonal storage costs,
     thereby reducing seasonal price rises, and from investments to lower the costs of farm-to-market transport, thereby
     raising the farm-level prices associated with any given export opportunity.

     The analytical models presented above allow comparison of alternative policies under various scenarios, providing
     qualitative results about the direction and relative magnitude of effects. This helps rule out infeasible policy choices,
     and narrow the search for those that are most likely to achieve the government’s goals. Quantitative simulations of
     various scenarios can then be used to guide actual implementation of any particular set of interventions.

     As an illustration of how simulations could be used to guide policymaking, we modeled the expected fiscal revenues
     from switching to a 5% export tax on whole nuts, with corresponding policies aimed at increasing productivity
     and lowering marketing costs along that value chain. For this initial simulation, each year’s quantity exported was
     defined as total production minus local consumption for food, seed and post-harvest losses, from the USDA’s
     PSD database, and each year’s export prices FOB Dakar were estimated from World Bank commodity prices net
     of transport costs. To compute expected future values, we drew all possible combinations of the quantities and
     prices actually observed in the past, then simulated the sector’s response to using export tax revenues for public
     investment in production growth and social insurance.

     The resulting distribution of tax revenues is shown below, as the probability of export revenues falling in the given
     ranges each year. Based on past production, there is a 30% probability that a given year’s tax revenues will be in
     the 5-10 billion FCFA range, a nearly 35% probability that it will fall in the 10-15 billion range, and in a third of cases
     revenues would be above that. But even a moderately higher level of groundnut production leads to much higher
     probabilities of even larger tax revenues, thus highlighting the importance of reinvesting tax revenue in productivity
     enhancement. High variability also emphasizes the need for dedicated fiscal accounts to save earnings in good
     years for use during downturns.

     from 1980-2015. Scenarios use actual data and then moderate (15%) or high (30%) increases in groundnut production, with an increase in domestic
     consumption (5%) corresponding to increased incomes and poverty reduction from higher production.

The figure above shows the probability of reaching each level of export tax revenue to the government. These
revenues would come primarily at the expense of groundnut farmers, due to the reduction in price received. The
distributional impact on farmers can be seen through an analysis conducted by Marzo and Martinez (2016), using
data from the national poverty survey of 2011. For numerical convenience, they compute the effects of a 10%
export tax, and then show its effects on groundnut farmers in each quintile of the income distribution, in terms of
total household expenditure. Based on the 2011 household survey, it turns out that the poorest groundnut farmers
have the most dependence on that crop, followed by the highest income quintile, while those in between tend to
be more reliant on other crops.

As shown in Figure 18 below, the net effect of the 10% export tax is to reduce annual consumption expenditure
by 2.6% for the poorest and 1.8% for the richest groundnut farming households, with lower levels in between and
decline for the national average groundnut farming household of -1.9%.

Looking beyond groundnut farmers, the impacts on the Senegalese population as a whole of a 10% export tax have
been estimated using a general equilibrium model by Fofana et al. (2017), based on the Social Accounting Matrix
of Fofana et al. (2015). This model focuses on how Senegalese activity would adjust to the tax after the revenue
is spent, using quantities observed in 2015. As shown in the previous figure, the tax would reduce incentives and
earnings from groundnut farming, leading to reduced total production and exports. With reallocation of farm labor
and capital to other crops, they estimate that the total quantity of groundnuts grown in Senegal would decline by
0.9%. The most important insight from this model is that a realistic increase in groundnut productivity, rising by just
1% in the short run and 2% in the medium run, would be sufficient to offset that decline in the short run, and raise
national-average disposable income in the medium run. This 1-2% increase in farm productivity of groundnuts
would not happen automatically, but would be feasible if export tax revenues are reinvested in genetic improvement
and multiplication of improved seeds.

In actual practice, the Senegalese government did introduce an export tax on groundnuts in December 2016, at
the specific rate of 15 FCFA per kg for export of in-shell groundnuts, and 40 FCFA per kg for shelled groundnuts
(Republique du Senegal, 2017). The relevant passage of this law reads in full:

         II. 	Le taux du droit de sortie est fixé comme suit:

     The percentage level of this specific tax depends on foreign prices actually paid for exports. To ensure that the rate
     does not rise above levels of cost to farmers and others that can be offset by productivity gains from improved seeds,
     it would be very important to monitor world prices and adjust the specific rate over time so that it does not exceed
     modest levels on the order of 10%. Transparent communications about the use of tax revenues, especially with
     groundnut growers through a reformed CNIA, is also essential to ensure that revenues are reinvested in productive
     public services such as crop improvement, seed multiplication and seed certification for larger quantities of more
     valuable new varieties.

     A graphical summary of the reform sequence is illustrated in the figure below. Before 2010, the ban on exports
     of whole nuts forced all groundnuts to be consumed or processed into oil, keeping prices and quantities low and
     stagnant. Starting in 2011, new and more valuable export opportunities led to higher prices and larger volumes
     for generic nuts, with opportunities to improve and expand through exports of confectionery nuts and groundnut
     products other than oil. And looking forward, further growth after 2017 could be accelerated by reinvesting some of
     the export revenues in public services to sustain productivity growth and improve quality over time.

6. CONCLUSIONS AND WAYS FORWARD



In summary, Senegal’s deep comparative advantage and large size of its groundnut sector create the opportunity
to use export of whole nuts to fund much-needed investments. The country’s major goals could be achieved by
reorienting the sector towards the most competitive activities, using proceeds from an export tax to improve input
supply and groundnut marketing systems, and to provide social protection against downturns. The use of export
taxes dedicated to a sector’s development has a long tradition in similar situations elsewhere, where a large and
concentrated export-oriented sector can help fund productivity enhancement and insurance to cover future risks.

The negative unintended consequences of export taxes rise sharply as tax rates increase, however, and their
positive benefits depend entirely on how tax revenues are spent, so keeping a low tax whose revenues are well
governed is essential to success. If funds are not reinvested in productivity growth, export taxes might simply
replace the old export bans and return the sector to its previously downward trajectory. Similarly, if social insurance
accounts are not maintained and disbursed at the times and places of greatest need, then vulnerability will lead to
less efficient and equitable forms of risk avoidance such as not growing groundnuts at all.

Success is not guaranteed, but Senegal is well positioned to transform its groundnut sector into a powerful engine
of economic growth, poverty reduction and social stability. Further analysis and annual monitoring of the sector,
ideally conducted within Senegal for the CNIA or farmers’ associations and other groups as well as the government,
will be crucial to ensuring that policies adjust over time to changing conditions.

ANNEX 1. DETAILED POLICY ANALYSIS MATRIX RESULTS




A1.1 DEFINITIONS AND NOTATION USED FOR CALCULATION OF POLICY
ANALYSIS MATRIX RESULTS
The definitions of each indicator, using the Policy Analysis Matrix notation below, is: Benefit-Cost Ratio, BCR=a/
(b+c); Resource Cost Ratio, RCR=c/(a-b); Gross Margin, GM=d/a; Social Benefit-Cost ratio, SBC=e/f+g; Domestic
Resource Cost ratio, DRC=g/(e-f); Social Gross Margin, SGM=h/e; Nominal Protection Coefficient, NPC=a/e;
Effective Protection Coefficient, EPC=(a-b)/(e-f); Producer Subsidy Equivalent, PSE=l/a; Subsidy Ratio to Producers,
SRP=l/e, where each lowercase letter (a-l) is a cell in this matrix:

                                   Revenue -       Tradable costs -    Domestic resources      =       Profits
   	        Private budget         a                   b                  c                          d=a-b-c
   	        - Social budget        e                   f                  g                          h=e-f-g
   	          = Distortions        i=a-e               j=b-f              k=c-g                      l=d-h



The most useful summary measures of competitiveness and comparative advantage in this context are the private
and social benefit-cost ratios, since DRC rankings are not helpful in settings like SUNEOR when value added at
social prices is sometimes negative. Among policy measures, the SRP is particularly helpful as it measures the
tariff-equivalent (or in this case the export-tax-equivalent) cost of policies.

Detailed results presented below are images from a workbook which contains all data and calculations, itemized in
7 color-coded spreadsheets:

       •	   A sheet marked <AllRatios> contains all the pertinent economic and cost ratios for each segment of the
            groundnut value chain such as the social benefit cost ratio, the domestic resource cost ratio and the
            nominal protection coefficient

       •	   A sheet labeled <AllPAMs> contains matrices summarizing all 25 enterprise budgets estimated in the
            exercise.

       •	   Five sheets labeled <EnterpriseCalc> for each kind of enterprise, with detailed summaries of each budget
            split into the three distinct stages of marketing: production, transportation, and processing/export. These
            include 6 budgets each for transport, industrial processing, and export spanning 2011 to 2015 as well as 6
            production budgets with 4 different cost structures and yields and one budget for artisanal oil production.

       •	   A sheet of <SelectedData> containing parameters that enter multiple sheets.

ANNEX 3. TERMS OF REFERENCE




Analysis of the Competitiveness of Groundnut Value Chain in Senegal
Terms of Reference of World Bank Technical Assistance

Background and rationale
Groundnut is a crop of major economic importance in Senegal. The majority of rural households depend on
groundnuts for their livelihoods, both for subsistence crop and for income generation. The groundnut subsector
was for many decades the driver of agro-industrial development in Senegal, serving not only as the key input for
processing of edible oil, but also as the main source of animal feed, and soil fertility for rainfed cropping systems..
Groundnut played a vital role in the national economy especially in the 1960s. However, the groundnut value chain
in Senegal has been confronted with increasing difficulties in recent years including: (i) declining yields relative to
other producers (900 kg/ha in 2009-2014 compared to 1,500 kg/ha in Nigeria, 3,000 kg/ha in China, and 6,900 kg/
ha in Israel) due to traditional farming and increased cultivation on marginal lands, inefficiencies in distribution of
seeds and fertilizers coupled with the use of low-yielding seed varieties and uncontrolled outbreaks of pests and
diseases; (ii) unstructured producers’ organizations and value chain coordination bodies like the inter-professional
committee, with weak or absence of linkages with the processing industry and end-markets; (iii) inconsistent and
distorting sectoral policies; and (iv) the growing importance of alternative oilseed and oil products in the global
market (palm oil, soya, cottonseed, rapeseed, sesame), which have caused groundnut market share erosion and
falling of revenues from exports. This protracted crisis has significantly reduced the economic performance of the
groundnut value chain over the last fifteen years.

These structural problems notwithstanding, groundnut remains in terms of volume and value, the most widely
produced crop in Senegal. It is the main source of income of rural households or family farms especially in the
primary production region. Indeed, it involves 63% of the rural population, 60% of whom are below the poverty line;
482,000 family farms (ANSD, 2011); and 45-60% of the total cropped areas.

Since the privatization of SONACOS in 2005 (which became SUNEOR in 2007) performance in the collection and
industrial processing of groundnut oil underwent dramatic decline from year to year. SUNEOR is bankrupt today
with accrued debts over FCFA 51 billion in September 2015. A diagnostic analysis of the groundnut values chain
was conducted in June 2014 along with a set of key reform proposals consisting of:

    •	   resolving SUNEOR debt crisis and rebuilding a competitive groundnut oil industry;

    •	   renovating and strengthening the groundnut inter-professional committee;

    •	   building a transparent, efficient and targeted subsidy policy;

    •	   reviewing the farm gate pricing mechanism for better connection to the groundnut oil international price
         trend;

    •	   reviewing policy related to the export of groundnut seeds and grains.

     The World Bank Technical and Financial Support
     Owing to the insolvency of SUNEOR, the depth of its financial crisis and consistent inability to operate at capacity,
     the Government of Senegal (GoS) has called for a second round of reforms. GoS held a minority stake in the
     company, and has decided to replace the majority stockholder, Groupe Advens, and take de facto ownership of the
     company. The Government has called upon the World Bank Group for financial and technical support to address
     both the short term issue of reactivating the groundnut oil processing industry as well as the long term viability of
     the sector. The World Bank Group has responded favorably to Government request through an additional financing
     (AF) of USD 20 million to the ongoing West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP-2A). The AF would
     help finance the introduction of new activities proposed in response to restructuring the groundnut value chain
     in Senegal and reinforcing achievements made under WAAPP-2A in developing the national seed multiplication
     system. More specifically, the AF would support the GoS in:

         i.	    Strengthening of the national certified seeds production and marketing systems for groundnuts (US$15.60
                million): As part of this process, the AF will finance costs related to: (1) the acquisition and distribution of
                about 40 000 tons of certified groundnut seeds (US$12.50 million) by matching the Government funding to
                keep certified seeds prices at affordable level while expanding the use of an ITC based platform developed
                under WAAPP-2A (US$0.10 million) for targeting farmers and ensuring transparency in the system; and (2)
                the provision of storage facilities (US$2.00 million) and agricultural equipment to cooperatives and seed
                producers’ organizations (US$1.00 million);

         ii.	 Supporting comprehensive technical assistance as a building block for longer-term sustainability of the
              groundnut value-chain and economic diversification in the groundnut producing areas (US$2.10 million).
              As part of this process, the AF will finance costs related to:

               a.	 Support to the SUNEOR cession (US$0.85 million) including: (1) establishing a performance contract
                   between the Government and SUNEOR for the transitional period and conducting a readiness scoping
                   study with IFC support to provide an updated financial, technical and legal due diligence status of
                   SUNEOR (US$0.05 million). A preliminary study will help to determine how soon and under what
                   conditions a competitive bidding process could be launched to attract new strategic partners for
                   SUNEOR. IFC will also assist in the drafting of terms of reference for a transaction adviser; (2) procuring
                   transaction advisory services to elaborate the baseline business plan and assist the GoS in attracting
                   new investors for SUNEOR through a competitive and transparent process (US$0.80 million);

               b.	 Support to the GoS for the elaboration of a new development policy strategy for the groundnut
                   value chain, conduct necessary analysis for the preparation of a longer term strategy along with an
                   investment program for the economic restructuring and diversification of the groundnut producing
                   regions (US$1.25 million);

         iii.	 Supporting the GoS in conducting the agricultural enterprises census (US$2 million) as part of the general
               census of Senegalese enterprises aiming at updating the national directory of enterprises and associations.

     Objectives and Scope of the Technical Assistance Assignment
     The World Bank is engaged in an intensive policy dialogue with the Government at a very high level including with
     the Minister of Agriculture, the Minister of Finance, the Prime Minister and the President of the Republic. To better
     support this dialogue, the World Bank would like to conduct further studies on the competitiveness of the Groundnut
     value chain.

     This competitiveness study will help to inform the Government with evidence-based analysis on the impacts of
     different current and potential policies. Given the high level competition with other countries and the growing
     importance of alternative oil products (e.g. palm oil, soya, cottonseed, rapeseed, sesame) , questions are:

         i.	    Will groundnuts production and groundnut-based oil production and processing remain competitive in the

        ii.	 How does groundnut production in Senegal compare with other high value crops?

        iii.	 Would an export option of raw groundnut work better for farmers and the economy?

        iv.	 What policy, institutional and technology options might be needed to make the value chain competitive?

The proposed study will take into consideration and update the World bank study carried-out in 2014 (diagnostic of
the groundnut value chain) as well as the 2007 analysis by William Masters (Distortions to Agricultural Incentives in
Senegal) and will further deepen the analysis using the Policy Analysis Matrix by Monke and Pearson1 or a variant
of this approach as may be appropriate.

Specifically the study will:

        •	    Identify the main stages of the value chains (production, marketing, and processing) within the groundnut
              subsector in Senegal as well as the various locations at which measurements will be undertaken;

        •	    Estimate the cost structure and financial profitability of the main groundnut value chains (production,
              marketing, and processing ) to assess whether limited resources are utilized efficiently;

        •	    Assess how competitive Senegal is in relation to the global supply-demand balance for edible oil and other
              groundnut products that Senegal could export, both in financial and economic terms;

        •	    Examine the government’s producer price policy compared to world market prices and transaction
              costs associated with transport, storage and processing; Analyze the capacity of Senegal to respond to
              key structural changes in groundnut systems (identify potential inefficiencies and suggest which areas
              productivity should be improved);

        •	    Derive policy implications about how to improve the comparative advantage of groundnut for Senegal in
              the medium (5 years) and long term (10 years).

Methodology
The study will assess the competitiveness of groundnut value chains in Senegal from both a financial and economic
perspective with the aim to provide additional empirical analysis to assess whether further investments in commercial
groundnut value chains in Senegal are warranted, and if so, of which kinds.

The financial analysis will use standard budgeting techniques to compute the cost of production, net value added,
and the private-cost ratio (PCR) using prevailing market prices, including any taxes and subsidies received by
value chains actors. The economic analysis will use a domestic resource cost (DRC) and social cost-benefit (SCB)
ratio approach to assess the comparative advantage of the groundnut production and marketing systems, netting
out the value of any transfers and accounting for the effects of distorted exchange rates. While the financial analysis
examines the profitability of groundnut production and marketing to private actors under existing market conditions,
the economic analysis measures profitability to the economy as a whole. Understanding the distribution of the total
financial revenues and costs among actors within the value chain as well as the economic performance of the
groundnut value chain from the societal point of view will allow to provide proper incentives to various stakeholders
while allocating scarce resources in a more efficient manner. In so doing, the study will identify and quantify the
main distortions causing differences between the actual current use of resources in the sector drawn by competitive
advantage (PCR) and the opportunity cost of those resources dictated by comparative advantage (DRC). Using
a Divergence-Separation-Module (DSM) approach, these distortions will be separated into policy and structural
components, to distinguish between policy-induced transfers among Senegalese actors (such as tariff revenues
paid to government), from structural inefficiencies and deadweight losses (such as the cost of fuel and machinery
used in value-subtracting activities).

Then, the study will also conduct various sensitivity and scenario analyses to assess the implications of the changing
dynamics of the domestic, regional and international markets for the comparative advantage of groundnut value
chains in Senegal under alternative assumptions about the evolution of production costs, yields, exchange rates,
world prices, wage rates and transport costs or other relevant identified parameter. The set of PCR, DRC, SCB

     and DSM ratios derived from the various scenarios will indicate whether there is a good case for further exploring
     efficiency aspects of expanding groundnut production in Senegal.

     The above will be structured in a Policy analysis matrix (PAM) to evaluate the competitiveness of groundnut value
     chain. The approach is employed due to its simple and understandable nature, particularly to policy makers (Monke
     and Pearson, 1989; Gotsch, 1989; Fox et al., 1990; Staal, 1995). It evaluates the competitiveness of commodities
     concerned by comparing data from the private and social budgets. While private profits are estimated based on
     market prices, social profits are estimated on the basis of social prices. The standard PAM structure is given in
     Annex 3.

     Data Collection
     In order to present the most representative and economically important set of PAMs the researchers will be guided
     by previous studies and through on-the-ground experts. Data gathering will take place primarily through the initial
     mission starting around July 10. The researcher will start by interviewing local staff to determine the value chain
     characteristics to be profiled including but not limited to: regions of interest, marketing channels, processing types,
     and end-user markets.

     Following determination of the value chains to profile the researchers will collect cost, quantity and revenue data
     for each stage of the process from farm to final point of sale broken up by tradable and non-tradable factors.
     Administrative data, especially that of SUNEOR will be provided by a recent study performed by the World Bank and
     otherwise obtained through interviews with key personnel. Travel to market locations in Senegal may be necessary,
     along with telephone and email contact with local and overseas trading offices to determine shadow prices and
     transport or processing costs for each product may be necessary. Researchers will also need to obtain reliable
     estimates of the shadow exchange rate, and any overt distortionary government policies.

     During the site visit, the World Bank staff will facilitate travel and setting up meetings for the purpose of obtaining
     any necessary data. After data collection, staff will remain available to support the project through completion.

     Expected Results
     The expected results from this technical assistance is a concise report on the competitiveness analysis of groundnut
     value chain along with a policy brief to be discussed and validated with the Government to guide the reform process.

Annex 1: The Domestic Resource Cost (DRC) and Social Cost-Benefit (SCB) Approach
There are various measures of comparative advantage. Among those measures, the domestic resource cost (DRC)
ratio has been widely used. The domestic resource cost (DRC) approach was developed by Michael Bruno in the
1960s and it compares the opportunity costs of domestic production to the value added that it generates. The
numerator is the sum of the costs of using domestic primary resources - land, labour and capital (non-internationally
traded inputs) - valued in terms of shadow prices. The denominator is the value-added (value of output minus
tradable input costs per unit of output) in border prices. The DRC is for commodity i is calculated as:

∑Nn=1 Pen * Qn
DRC = -------------------------------------,

(Pei * Qi - ∑Tt=1 Pet* Qt) *SER
where Pei and Qi are the economic price and quantity of output i; Pet and Qt are the economic price and quantity
of tradable input t used to produce output i; Pen and Qn are the economic price and quantity of nontradable input t
used to produce output I; and SER is the shadow exchange rate.

The DRC value may be positive or negative. A positive value below unity indicates efficiency and comparative
advantage – the economy saves foreign exchange from local production; a value equal to unity indicates that the
economy neither gains nor saves foreign exchange through domestic production; and a value greater than unity
indicates inefficiency and lack of international comparative advantage – the economy is incurring costs in excess
of what it gains or saves from the production in terms of foreign exchange.

The main limitations of the DRC method include: 1) the tendency for some “domestic” costs to involve imported
components, which are not always easy to disaggregate; 2) the partial equilibrium framework on which it is based
and which focuses only on a single market without addressing the linkages among markets (i.e., the indicator
ignores substitution and cross-price effects); and 3) possible undervaluation or overvaluation of imported resources
due to undervalued or overvalued exchange rates; thus, assumptions about real exchange rate are critical, as
competitiveness may be artificially created by devaluing the domestic currency, which results in the decrease of
the economic valuation of exports and increase in those of imports (Latruffe 2010).

As shown by Masters and Winter-Nelson (1995), when a PAM is constructed using an estimate of the opportunity
cost of foreign exchange (the shadow exchange rate, SER), alternative activities should be ranked using a ratio of
total costs to total benefits at social prices. This social cost-benefit (SCB) ratio uses the same data as the DRC in
slightly different form:

(∑Nn=1 Pen * Qn ) + ([∑Tt=1 Pet* Qt] *SER)
SCB = ---------------------------------------------------------

(Pei * Qi)
Using the SCB instead of DRC ratios to rank activities is preferred because it takes full advantage of the information
provided by the shadow exchange rate, avoiding the tendency of DRC comparisons to understate the economic
value of relatively labor- or land-intensive activities (Masters and Winter-Nelson 1995). In this study both DRC and
SCBs will be estimated using farm budget data and relevant macro- and microeconomic data by: (1) classifying
and decomposing input items into their tradable, non-tradable and transfer payments (tax or subsidy) components;

56         Groundnut Value Chain Competitiveness and Prospects for Development



     (2) estimating social (or shadow prices) of the output and all the inputs; (3) constructing commodity and system
     budget tables; (4) and computing the corresponding DRC and SCB ratios.

     There is a substantial literature on shadow pricing, and two kinds of numeraires have been widely used: the first
     one, the “world price” numeraire, adjusts the prices of nontraded goods to be equivalent to border prices, while the
     second one, the “domestic price” numeraire, adjusts the prices of traded goods to be equivalent to domestic prices
     (Belli et al 1997; Gittinger 1982). This study will compute shadow prices using the “domestic price” numeraire. More
     specifically:

             •	    traded goods, which include production output (i.e., milled rice) and inputs (i.e., seeds, fertilizers,
                   pesticides, herbicides, transport, and farm equipment) are valued at their economic parity prices. The
                   import parity price is the economic price of the imported good at the point of delivery obtained by adding
                   to its FOB2 price all freight and insurance charges between the world market and the point of reference,
                   accounting for the adjustment of the currency. Conversely, the export parity price, which is the economic
                   price of exports at a specific point, is obtained by deducting freight and issuance charges from the CIF3
                   price, accounting for the adjustment of the currency;

             •	    tradable but nontraded goods, which are goods that are not traded because of government regulation
                   (e.g., rice under an export ban), are valued at their domestic market price; and

             •	    non traded goods are goods that by their very nature tend to be cheaper to produce domestically than to
                   import but for which the export price is lower than the domestic cost of production. Such goods include
                   labor, capital and land, farm tools, construction, services, utilities, credit and irrigation water and are
                   valued at their opportunity costs or the benefit forgone by using a scare resource for one purpose instead
                   of its best alternative use (Gittinger 1982).

     Annex 2: Divergence-Separation Module (DSM) Approach

     The total divergences between domestic prices and their border price equivalents result from the effects of policy
     distortions and effects of market failure (or market imperfections). Since the majority of existing direct policy
     interventions and subsidy programs influencing the input and output markets of the analyzed activities is known
     (from Government policy documents), a separation of quantitative effects of these instruments can to be carried
     out to quite an extent. Assuming that the sum of divergences (bt) for each activity is the result of observable policy
     distortions (bp) and structural distortions (bst) , {bt = bp + bst}, and bt is known from the results of the protection
     analysis, the methodology of separation can be characterized as an identification of bp and subsequent computation
     of the residual bst. By this token, bp is defined as the set of all directly observable policy influences, as there are for
     example direct subsidies to factors and products, taxes (import taxes, taxI; excise taxes, taxV), tariffs (tar), import
     surcharges (sur), export subsidies (sub), and quotas of importation. Consequently, bst is defined as the sum of all
     influences that are not directly observable and thus for the most part consist of of market failure influences of spill-
     over effects of policies not intended to influence the analyzed price directly.

     Following the definitions of price theory the private domestic price of a good at a border location B (ppB) equals
     the border price equivalent (social price) of identical goods at the same location (pSB) if markets for tradables are
     assumed to be perfect and undistorted. The existence of a different bt , { pPB - pSB ¹ 0 }, implies the existence of
     distorting influences causing private prices to differ from their border price equivalents. If bt is totally explicable
     by the set of observable policies, all distortion can be characterized as direct policy distortion bp, leading to the
     identity bt  = bp and implying that there is no existing structural distortion bst. Using the pt that can be derived from
     the “standard” protection analysis and in order to identify the levels of bp and bm  for the analyzed activities, the
     following steps are carried out:

         	 Free on Board or FOB is a term of sale to indicate that the price quoted by a seller includes all charges up to placing the goods on board a ship
           at the port of departure specified by the buyer.
     3
         	 Cost, Insurance, Freight or CIF is a term of sale to indicate that the price quoted by a seller includes insurance and all other charges up to the
           named port of destination.

The observed private prices of tradables at the farm-gate location (pPF) are converted into private border prices
(pPB) by adding (in an net export situation) or subtracting (in an net import situation) the costs of interregional
                                       t     t
transportation and processing (F B or B F , with B indicating the border location and F indicating the farm-gate
location). Doing so leads on one hand to comparability at an identical location, and on the other hand domestic
interregional transportation and processing costs are not taken into account for the following calculation of tariff
influences. In the so-called ‘Divergence-Separation-Module’ (DSM), a withdrawal of influences of border instruments
such as import tariffs, import quotas at reduced tariffs, import surcharges, export taxes and subsidies on domestic
prices is carried out on the basis of pPB. The results are displayed as so-called corrected private border prices (pCB).
A subtraction of social border prices of the tradable good pSB from its corrected border price pCB thus will display the
level of distortions left after trade policy withdrawal. These rest distortions (~structural distortions) after trade policy
adjustments are indicated by the abbreviation bst*. If no other influences on domestic tradable prices exist, then  pCB
will equal pSB; all distortions can be explained to be direct trade policy distortions bp and no other distortions bst*
will be observable. If, in addition, direct subsidies are paid on tradables (w/ direct taxes being introduced as direct
negative subsidies), a further adjustment for these payments has to be carried out, resulting in bst. By multiplying
the results by the physical unit of factor use (xi) the total level of policy and rest distortions of the analyzed activity
are computed.

Thus for a tradable, (net) imported commodity the DSM becomes

The Policy Analysis Matrix:
The PAM, developed by Monke and Pearson (1989), is a partial equilibrium framework that allows analysis of
policies in terms of their impact on commodity systems, representing the results in a matrix of private and social
values (table 1 below).

The PAM approach requires the formation of accounting matrices for revenues, costs, and profits (revenues minus
costs). Costs are defined in two columns as tradable inputs and domestic factors (essentially land, labour, and
capital). Tradable inputs are those available at the international market level; those available domestically are
potential exports. Intermediate inputs (e.g. fuel, feed, and electricity) are disaggregated into tradable input and
domestic factor components.

The first row of the PAM contains the calculation of private profitability, which represents the competitiveness of the
agricultural system given technologies, observed market input and output costs, and policy transfers. The second
row defines social profitability, representing comparative advantage or efficiency in the agricultural commodity

     social profits are indicative of socially efficient usage of resources, and negative social profits indicate production
     at social costs that exceed the costs of importing results in inefficiencies).

     The final row of the PAM represents transfers; vertical divergences must be explained by the effects of distorting
     policy or the existence of market failures. The net transfer caused by policy and market failures (L = (D - H)) is the
     sum of the separate effects in the factor and product markets.

     Theoretically, social prices are those that would exist in perfect market situation. Practically, such prices are estimated
     using different methods such as identification of quantifiable market interventions that make the differences in
     the observed and free market price, calculation of border equivalent or parity prices, and estimation of shadow
     prices (Gittinger, 1982; Monke and Pearson, 1989; Staal, 1995; Yao, 1997). Following standard PAM procedure,
     the following indicators of comparative advantage, protection and policy impacts would be calculated: private
     cost ratio (PCR), domestic resource cost (DRC) and social cost-benefit (SCB) ratios, nominal protection coefficient
     on tradable outputs (NPC), nominal protection coefficient on tradable inputs (NPI), effective protection coefficient
     (EPC).

     An NPC > 1 reveals that producers are protected for the product. Similarly using input costs, the nominal protection
     coefficient of tradable inputs (NPI), measures the ratio of the private cost of tradable inputs to their social cost.
     Where NPI < 1, producers experience protection or subsidization for input purchase prices.

     The effective protection coefficient (EPC) is a measure of the net effect of distortions or negative protection on
     outputs and tradable inputs. For an EPC > 1, producers are protected for the value-added produced.

     A DRC or SCB ratio less than one indicates a value-adding activity which has some comparative advantage relative
     to world-market competitors. An SCB or DRC greater than one indicates that the activity is value-subtracting, as the
     opportunity cost of resources used exceeds the value of what is gained. Within each category, activities ranked by
     SCB contribute more value addition (or less value subtraction) per unit of resources used.
