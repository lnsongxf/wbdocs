GLOSSARY
Agglomeration economies. The benefits, savings or (average) cost reductions resulting from the clustering of activities. 

Urbanization economies. These arise from a larger number of different industries in the same place. Sources of urbaniza-
tion economies include access to specialized financial and professional services, inter-industry information transfers, and
availability of general infrastructure such as telecommunications and transportation hubs. Urban diversity that can foster
the exchange of ideas and technology to produce greater innovation and growth can enable firms in different industries
to share indivisible facilities or public goods. They also have access to a wider variety of intermediate input suppliers, a
larger pool of narrowly specialized workers, and risks.

Localization economies. These arise from a larger number of firms in the same industry in the same place. There are three
sources of localization economies. The first is the benefit of labor pooling, which is the accessibility that firms have to
a variety of skilled laborers, which in turn provides employment opportunity for the laborers. The second benefit is the
development of industries due to the increasing returns to scale in intermediate inputs for a product. The third source is
the relative ease of communication and exchange of supplies, laborers and innovative ideas due to the proximity among
firms.

Portfolio of cities. In order to enhance economic efficiency and foster agglomeration economies, policymakers need
to treat cities as a portfolio of assets, each differentiated by characteristics that include size, location, and density of
settlement. Businesses and people can exploit economies of scale and agglomeration if their settlements perform their
intended functions.

Density. This is measured as the mass of the population per unit of land is the defining characteristic of urban settle-
ments. Given that high productivity requires the geographic concentration of labor and capital, it is highly correlated with
economic density. 

Economic density. The geographic compactness of economic activity, which can be measured as value added (GDP) or
jobs created per square kilometer. Economic density is important for agglomeration economies and the economic com-
petitiveness of cities.

Distance. The ease or difficulty for goods and services, labor, capital, information, and ideas to traverse space, captur-
ing both time and monetary aspects of costs. Locations close to markets have a natural advantage as they tend to have
lower transport costs and easier access to knowledge and other resources. Distance-to-density is one of the factors in
low income per capita, labor productivity, and real wages; it is also a factor in high rates of poverty and unemployment.

Division. This affects density and distance. Within-city disparities in welfare and housing and associated social issues,
such as crime, persist well past high levels of urbanization and upper-middle incomes. Some divisions, such as geo-
graphic barriers, are beyond control, while others are self-imposed and include ethnic and cultural divisions, or those
caused by inappropriate institutions and regulations.

OVERVIEW


A
          s Malaysia looks toward the future, there is a strong recognition that urbanization will play an increasingly
          important role as a driver of economic growth. The evidence linking higher levels of urbanization, higher produc-
          tivity and overall economic growth is well established. Yet cities can grow in different ways that will affect their
          competitiveness and livability. They can be successful at creating opportunities, providing services for residents
and citizens, and enhancing public spaces to create vibrant and attractive places to live. But cities can also neglect invest-
ments in critical infrastructure and basic services, and mismanage land, environmental and social policies which result in
traffic congestion, sprawl, slums, pollution, and crime.

This study is part of a work program carried out by the World Bank under the guidance of the Economic Planning Unit
(EPU) of Malaysia and Khazanah Nasional Berhad. The overall objectives of the work program are to support the Gov-
ernment of Malaysia (GoM) in i) formulating a set of strategies to enhance urban development and the role of cities in
Malaysia; and ii) strengthening systems of benchmarking cities in Malaysia for informed policy decisions.

This study focused on understanding three key aspects of city competitiveness: economic growth, urban governance, and
social inclusion. The analysis is based on existing data provided through the Malaysian Department of Statistics, GIS data
from local authorities, international comparative data, and primary data collected through extensive field work carried
out from April to October, 2014. The study covers six main conurbations in Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru, George
Town, Kuantan, Kota Kinabalu and Kuching. Lessons from international experience were used as guidance in the context
of Malaysia’s own experience and provided critical input to the set of recommended policy options.

The main report includes an introductory chapter covering the context, analytical framework, and methodology for the
study; Chapter 2 covers main findings and policy recommendations related to economic growth in cities; Chapter 3 pro-
vides detailed spatial analysis on land use and a review of local development strategies for the cities covered in the
report; Chapter 4 discusses institutional issues related to urban planning, development and service delivery; Chapter 5
includes analysis on urban poverty, inequality and social inclusion, particularly as it relates to urban youth as broader
issues of social inclusion are covered in other recent studies; and the concluding chapter (6) presents cross-cutting
issues related to implementation of the recommended policy options including institutional responsibilities, time horizon
and prioritization, and data sharing. Several annexes provide additional information on international experiences, and
details on methodology used in the analysis.

A separate report was produced from the strengthening city benchmarking work program. The Malaysian Urban-Ru-
ral-National Indicators Network on Sustainable Development (MURNInets) benchmarking platform was assessed, with a
set of core indicators for benchmarking city performance consistent with international experience. Analysis based on data
provided by MURNInets, as well as some international comparators from the Global City Indicators Facility (GCIF) data-
base was carried out, and followed by a joint workshop with GCIF and JPBD on global best practices for benchmarking.
There was also an in-depth analysis of the new international standard for city indicators, International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) 37120; on Sustainable Development of Communities; Indicators for City Services; and Quality of
Life. The report submitted in parallel with this report summarizes key findings and recommendations which point to the
proposed adoption of international benchmarking to allow cities to compare how they are doing relative to other cities
with similar attributes.




xiv  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
ECONOMICALLY COMPETITIVE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE CITIES
From an economic perspective, maximizing the gains from urbanization to strengthen the role of cities as the growth
engines of the national economy is fundamental to helping Malaysia transform from a middle-income country to a high-in-
come one. Continued investments in rural areas will ensure equity and balanced development at the national level. Anal-
ysis based on the framework developed in the World Bank’s World Development Report 2009, which characterizes
geographic transformations for economic development in three dimensions: density, distance and division, points to
three main constraints to the economic competitiveness of Malaysian cities1:

     	     Low economic density. Global experience suggests that economic density, as measured by either jobs per km2 or
           gross domestic product (GDP) per km2, rises with the level of development; and the densest places in the world
           are in the richest countries. The economic density of Malaysian cities, however, is relatively low compared to other
           large cities in East and Southeast Asia. For example, the employment density of Seoul, Singapore and Hong Kong
           is 2.5, 5 and 10 times that of Kuala Lumpur respectively, while the gross value-added per km2 of these cities is 4, 13
           and 22 times that of Kuala Lumpur. This limits the benefits of agglomeration and impedes transformation to a knowl-
           edge-based service economy.

     	 Inefficient urban form that results in high transport costs and negative environmental impacts. Sprawling urban
       form can undermine livability, affordability and environmental sustainability. The relatively low spatial density of
       Malaysia’s cities results in long commutes for work, and ultimately affects transport costs which are high compared
       with other East Asian cities. The share of transport costs in household income is 50 percent higher than in Hong
       Kong and Tokyo. Adding to the high transport costs is traffic congestion, currently a serious problem in the larger
       cities of Malaysia. Urban sprawl also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Temperature records for the past 40
       years already show that temperature anomalies in Malaysia’s cities have increased faster than the global average. In
       the medium to long term, climate change is expected to result in more heat waves and to exacerbate the urban heat
       island effect, in turn increasing energy demand for cooling and increasing water consumption. Heavy, more frequent
       precipitation events are expected and will increase the risk and severity of urban flooding and landslides, requiring
       careful land use planning and attention to spatial form.

     	 Insufficiently integrated institutions and policies. Institutional complexity and coordination issues across various
       levels of government affect the efficiency of urban planning and implementation. For example, land use planning and
       urban transport are generally not well integrated. Institutional coordination and strong capacity in execution and
       enforcement are important for integrating land use with strategic and structural investment planning across sectors
       in Malaysia’s cities.

The framework for analysis also denotes cities as a portfolio of assets, each differentiated by characteristics that include
size, location, and density of settlement. Extensive research highlights the fact that businesses and people can exploit
economies of scale and agglomeration if their settlements perform their intended functions. Settlements of different sizes
complement one another with large cities, secondary cities, market towns and villages all linked through complementary
functions. Large cities typically would concentrate services and innovation, whereas secondary cities and medium sized
cities, which tend to have more land, would concentrate manufacturing and can specialize on specific industries accord-
ing to their comparative advantages and designated strategies. Smaller towns connect rural and urban areas and act as
market centers for agricultural products and other rural outputs. The structure of Malaysia’s cities included in this study is

         Density refers to the size of population and economic activities per km2, distance refers to the ease of reaching markets and determines
         access to opportunity, and division arises from barriers to economic interactions created by social, cultural and other barriers which
         restrict market access. These three spatial dimensions can drive markets and affect competitiveness.


                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities  xv 
roughly as follows: Kuala Lumpur is the large primary city, followed by two large secondary cities (Johor Bahru and George
Town), and several medium-sized cities (Kuantan, Kota Kinabalu, and Kuching). Each city faces some specific challenges
with regard to its economic productivity, land use patterns and spatial development. Key points related to economic, land
use and spatial factors were analyzed at the individual urban level, these points are described below for each of the six
conurbations.

	    Kuala Lumpur. Greater Kuala Lumpur is the economic center of Malaysia and has considerable potential to become a
     world-class business center. To allow this to happen, Kuala Lumpur would benefit from growth in services and inno-
     vation sectors, with more standardized industries moving to smaller cities and towns, as has been the experience
     of other developed countries. The relative degree of specialization in financial, business and consumer services in
     Kuala Lumpur decreased from 2003 to 2012, although industry is still a large part of its economy. Kuala Lumpur’s
     labor productivity is behind most competitor cities in the East Asia region as well as global comparators with sim-
     ilar economic structure. With regard to land use and spatial development, Greater Kuala Lumpur has low density,
     partly due to the underutilization of land in the central areas of the city. Nearly half the land within 1 km of the city
     center is used by institutions, is designated as open/recreational. Although the Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2020
     envisioned large residential development projects, land use analysis shows that the Federal Territory of Kuala
     Lumpur (FTKL) actually lost residential area between 2000 and 2010, especially in areas close to the city center.
     This suggests that these large projects have occurred mostly outside FTKL, which could make commuting times to
     jobs in the city center even longer.

	    Johor Bahru. Johor Bahru benefits from the economic spillovers of its neighbor, Singapore, as is evident from the
     growing share of consumer services in the local economy. However, Johor Bahru still has low productivity, including
     in the service sector, which suggests that economic efficiency needs to be enhanced. There is much potential for
     Johor Bahru to leverage its proximity to Singapore. Different approaches would exploit the city’s comparative advan-
     tages: land availability, cheaper labor, lower-cost housing, all of which could help promote new industries. A strong
     understanding of the economic dynamics of both cities is essential to finding the most productive direction for Johor
     Bahru’s economic development. With regard to land use and spatial development, institutional land dominates the
     center of Johor Bahru, occupying 80 percent of land within the first 1km buffer zone. It may be more efficient to use
     this centrally-located land for commercial or business purposes, i.e. for an economic purpose that reflects its high
     value. Residential areas, mainly located in the 3 km buffer zone are largely co-located with industrial and commercial
     use, which is a good sign for mixed-use developments.

	    George Town. Georgetown is recognized as a leading hub for electronics and high tech manufacturing and has a
     strong focus on instruments (including medical, instruments) and pharmaceuticals. Overall, industrial productivity is
     significantly higher than in Kuala Lumpur. The economy, however, has struggled in recent years, and has been weaker
     than the national average. Land use and spatial analysis show that of the four cities analyzed, George Town had the
     least amount of land allocated to institutional use. Most new industrial land has been the expansion of existing
     industrial clusters, indicating that further spatial concentration of manufacturing firms show signs of agglomeration
     economies. This also corresponds to the conurbation’s spatial development plan, which locates specialized manufac-
     turing centers largely based on existing industrial clusters.

	Kuching. Kuching has performed well in the past decade with strong growth and substantial increases in per capita
 income; both above the national averages. It has relatively high industrial productivity which can be attributed to
 the spatial concentration of its industrial firms, and to the nature of their industrial activities. Kuching’s clusters of
 manufacturing industries are located in the Sama Jaya Free Industrial Zone (FIZ), and in other industrial parks/zones.
 Reports suggest that industries are attracted to Sarawak as it has more competitive electricity rates than other cities

xvi  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
    in the region. The federal government, with the support of the state government, offers incentives and import duty
    exemptions to investors, which creates a favorable business environment.

	   Kota Kinabalu. Kota Kinabalu’s economic output appears to have experienced more volatility than the other Malay-
    sian cities reviewed in this study. This may be related to data issues and/or reflect patterns of investment driven by
    the 2008-09 financial crisis and subsequent recovery. With regard to spatial and land use patterns, Kota Kinabalu
    has a higher proportion of residential land than other Malaysian cities, and its green/open space accounts for nearly
    half the city’s total area. This amount of unbuilt land so close to the city center is unusual, but is a result of the large
    hills/steeply sloping terrain close to the center.

	Kuantan. Kuantan city is less industrialized than Kuching and Kota Kinabalu, and of the six Malaysian cities reviewed
 for this study, it has the highest share of agriculture in its economy. Consumer services are a significant component of
 the local economy, accounting for over 25 percent of the city’s GDP. Kuantan stands as the gateway to the broader East
 Coast Economic Region, which offers a significant source of raw materials for various industries. Kuantan also hosts
 the main port for the east coast of peninsular Malaysia. Given its existing economic structure and geographic location,
 Kuantan could focus on its comparative advantage of internal (plant-level) scale economies. In this regard, improved
 connectivity to large rural areas, as well as to the large cities on the west coast of the peninsula, could facilitate access
 to raw materials as well as to markets. This needs to be accompanied by continued enhancements in infrastructure and
 by the provision of services such as quality education and healthcare.



URBAN GOVERNANCE
Governments have an important role to play in the delivery of effective and efficient urban services and infrastructure.
They need to design and support policies for land and housing markets; raise and equitably redistribute revenues; and
promote a safe and sustainable urban environment through strong institutions, both at the national and local level.

The scope of the analysis related to governance in this study focuses on institutions as they pertain to urban planning,
development and service delivery in Malaysia. It includes aspects such as: the roles and responsibilities of government
agencies; the system of strategies, plans, policies, laws and regulations; implementation arrangements and coordination
mechanisms; and monitoring and evaluation. The analysis involved desk reviews, extensive stakeholder interviews with
various government agencies at all levels and across all six conurbations, as well as a review of selected global case
studies.

In carrying out the analysis, many of the issues in relation to urban planning, development and service delivery may
appear to be of technical or financial nature at first glance, but with further analysis the underlying causes tend to be
institutional. For example, despite differences in legal frameworks and specific institutional arrangements between Pen-
insular Malaysia, and Sabah and Sarawak, many of the institutional issues identified were confirmed during stakeholder
interviews as being similar to those on the peninsula.

Three main institutional issues were identified.

	   Centralization/federalization of urban service delivery. Local development and urban service delivery in Malaysia
    are highly centralized through federal/national-level government agencies. Local authorities in Malaysia are respon-
    sible for delivering relatively few services, and many functions related to the delivery of core urban services such as
    public transport, roads, water supply, sewerage, solid waste management, drainage, public health, police and emer-
    gency services, and education come under federal government control. The challenges identified in the delivery of



                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                 Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities  xvii 
     urban services suggest that the high degree of centralization has not always had the intended benefits of increasing
     efficiency and effectiveness. The creation of new agencies has also made coordination and implementation more
     complex.

	    Challenges in urban and spatial planning. Although Malaysia has a comprehensive planning system that guides
     urban development, weaknesses exist in coordination and linkages within the planning system. The current National
     Physical Plan has not been well implemented in sectoral planning and budget allocations. Large project investments
     that are designed and planned centrally may not reflect local knowledge and priorities, while some local plans and
     zoning may be inconsistent with state-issued land titles and projects initiated at higher levels.

	    Financial and technical constraints facing local authorities. Local authorities in Malaysia have limited financial
     resources. Most local authorities rely on property assessment tax for the majority of their revenue, but in many cases
     assessment rates and assessed property values have not been updated regularly. At the same time, the fiscal transfers
     that local authorities receive as grants from federal and state levels are relatively limited and unevenly distributed.
     Local authorities continue to face growing pressure from the public for service delivery and maintenance, and often
     end up using their own funds for stop-gap repairs of facilities or infrastructure that are not their responsibility. In
     addition, local authorities face constraints in terms of staff and their technical expertise. They have difficulty recruit-
     ing, motivating and retaining the right staff; they face staffing controls exercised by the federal-level Public Service
     Department, and offer relatively lower pay and fewer opportunities for career development compared to federal and
     state level agencies.



SOCIAL INCLUSION
A key aspect of a city’s competitiveness is its ability to be socially inclusive and allow all people, including the disadvan-
taged, to share in and to contribute to rising prosperity. Malaysia has made great strides in reducing poverty in recent
decades: the incidence of poverty is just one percent in urban areas (not including foreign workers). Inequality, however,
remains a challenge. The Gini coefficient for Malaysia is one of the highest in Asia, and is substantially higher in urban
areas than in rural areas.

The movement from rural areas to urban areas is significant and has been taking place in Malaysia for decades. In the last
five years alone, about 2.5 percent of households moved out of rural to urban areas. Young people between the ages of 20
to 30, account for the largest share of internal rural to urban migration. While the move to cities can offer opportunities,
not everyone benefits from these opportunities. This can create divisions in society that can be quite evident in urban
areas and can lead to social problems, especially for young people who may have dropped out of school or who may be
unemployed.

The analysis focused on at-risk youth in urban areas (aged 15-30) as this group is often identified as particularly vulner-
able to exclusion, and given that other recent studies have covered broader aspects of social exclusion. Four aspects of
social exclusion were covered: economic, political, socio-cultural, and spatial. Qualitative field work was carried out in
the six areas included in the study, and included focus group discussions, key-informant interviews and round table dis-
cussions with key stakeholders. Some of the key findings are noted here.

	    Economic aspects. Three main dynamics were identified through the field work as contributing to vulnerability and to
     a sense of social exclusion. They deal with individuals as well as the broader family: i) youth unemployment linked to
     lack of education or skills training; ii) poverty and rising costs of living; and iii) irregular work patterns and dysfunc-
     tional families.


xviii  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
	   Political aspects. At-risk youth found it difficult to make their voices heard; they also believed that they had limited
    influence on decision-making, which contributed to a sense of exclusion. This has negatively impacted their percep-
    tions of their role in neighborhood committees, also in places of worship and religious organizations especially at the
    local community level.

	   Socio-cultural aspects. Difficulties in accessing the education system were identified as key contributing factors to
    both vulnerability and exclusion. Recurring themes in all six cities were issues related to discipline in school resulting
    in absenteeism and expulsion. Issues identified through focus group discussions relate to a lack of interest in classes
    that do not cater to students’ learning needs, to teachers’ disciplinary style that discourages students from attending,
    and family problems. Broader issues concerned problems with the education system that could hinder the devel-
    opment of non-academically inclined students. The issue of criminalization of young people involved in anti-social
    behavior was also raised. Police reports, arrests and lock-ups have created bad experiences for many of the young
    people the research team encountered. Some groups expressed strong distrust of institutions and saw little hope for
    the future.

	   Spatial aspects. The majority of the urban poor and low-income families live in public housing – high-rise flats for
    newer construction, and 5-story walk-up flats for older construction. Regardless of the type of flats, the issues raised
    by flat dwellers were similar and included: issues of affordability, the lack of appropriate community spaces, poor
    maintenance and limited public transportation. Safety concerns, including the prominence of crime and violence
    were also identified.



POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
It is important to acknowledge that Malaysia has done well on many fronts. Its economic and social indicators demon-
strate impressive progress in recent decades. Achievements in poverty reduction have been remarkable: the share of
households living in poverty dropped from over 50 percent in the 1960s to less than two percent in 2012.

As Malaysia sets its sights on high income status, it will be essential to harness the benefits of urbanization through a
system of competitive cities that draws on the advantages of each individual city. When analyzing key opportunities to
attain this goal, several policy recommendations emerge based on the analysis summarized above. Some will require
major policy shifts and strong political will to implement, and these changes may benefit most from phasing in gradually.
Other policy options may be easier to implement and could be initiated within a relatively short time frame. Over time,
however, these recommendations will best achieve results when implemented in their entirety rather than through partial
or selective implementation. The recommendations are summarized below and are discussed in greater detail in the full
report. Chapter 6 provides details on implementing agencies, prioritization, and time horizon required.


 Fostering Economic Growth
u	
a.	 Strengthening institutions for managing land markets and developing land policies. Well-functioning institutions
    are important to help promote economic density and dissipate economic and social divisions. This can be achieved
    by encouraging: flexible land use regulations and better utilization of land; coordination of land use planning with
    development of connective infrastructure; and use of public transport

    Flexible land use regulations. Malaysia needs flexibility in land use to cater to the changing demand for land and to
    accommodate more dense and compact urban development. Relaxing any overly stringent restrictions on land use,
    such as low plot ratios is crucial for achieving this. Realizing the potential of low-use land for more productive uses,

                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities  xix 
       such as affordable residential and commercial developments, would contribute to increasing economic density and
       foster economic growth.

       Coordination of land use planning with transport infrastructure development. Besides relaxing stringent regula-
       tions and ensuring fluidity of the land market, there are other urban planning tools, such as mixed-use planning,
       that can help change the spatial structure of cities and limit urban expansion and sprawl. Efficient land use through
       transit-oriented development (TOD) or smart growth that prioritizes new developments along established public
       transport routes may help Malaysian cities reduce distances from places where jobs are concentrated.

b.	 Target interventions to improve efficiency in the system of cities. These can include incentives to cluster service-
    and knowledge-based sectors in large cities and to relocate land-intensive manufacturing industry to smaller cities
    and towns. Initiatives to repurpose old industrial districts could include infrastructure redevelopment and catalytic
    projects to make the city’s spatial structure more efficient, livable, and sustainable. At the same time, continued
    investments in rural areas are necessary for equity and balanced development across the country. While some of
    these initiatives are already underway in Malaysia, there are opportunities for deepening them to improve efficiency.

       At the city level, analysis indicates optimal utilization of available land close to the Kuala Lumpur city center2 could
       facilitate agglomeration economies and increase economic density through a number of policy actions. The spatial
       development strategy for the center of KL focuses mainly on mixed-use development and on ensuring that the residential
       component remains strong; the success of this strategy depends on the pattern of these residential areas close to the
       city center, i.e. high density residential, as reflected by high plot ratio, can be commensurate with the high value of
       land and can promote mixed-use development and more compact urban form.

       For the Johor Bahru/Iskandar Region, a key recommendation is to adjust the existing strategy to pursue more verti-
       cal linkages with Singapore. This would need to focus on selected sub-sectors in manufacturing and in finance and
       business services. Further analysis of successful and failed initiatives and the most dynamically growing industries
       could indicate possible growth areas.

       In the case of the George Town conurbation/Penang area, significant work has been done in recent years on its eco-
       nomic and urban strategy. This study recommends a deepening of the implementation of existing plans. The recent
       slow-down in the electronics sector, and weakness in other sectors of the economy, point to the need for George Town
       to move the manufacturing sector up the value chain, along with the services sector. This is taking place already and
       is supported by the government, as reflected in its spatial development plan.

       As for Kota Kinabalu, Kuching and Kuantan, further study would be required to match the extent of analysis that has
       been done for Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru and George Town; a specific recommendation would be to perform this
       analysis in any future work.


 Ensuring Environmental Sustainability
v	
       Encouraging the use of public transport. The provision of public transport infrastructure and services could be
       accompanied by fiscal incentives to encourage the use of public transport and reduce reliance on private vehicles.
       This would help reduce congestion and transport costs in Malaysian cities. Fiscal instruments are primarily price-
       based and take advantage of market mechanisms. Examples of these instruments include: congestion charges, emis-
       sion and/or pollution tax or charge (e.g. carbon tax, sulfur tax), fuel tax (e.g. any excise tax on fuel), vehicle tax (e.g.

2	
     Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur and adjacent areas in the state of Selangor


xx  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
    ownership, licensing or registration fee) and subsidies (e.g. subsidies for clean fuels, efficient vehicles, and public
    transport). These instruments are expected to cut travel demands, encourage commuters to use public transport;
    substitute polluting fuels (e.g. petroleum products) with clean fuels (e.g. ethanol, hydrogen, compressed natural gas),
    and encourage the public to use vehicles with higher fuel economy.

    Integrating policies for climate change and disaster risk reduction into urban planning and management. Given
    climate change projections, Malaysia can expect more frequent precipitation events and an increase in the risk and
    severity of urban flooding and landslides. This is likely to disrupt economic activity and infrastructure. In the longer
    term, sea-level rise also threatens many Malaysian cities: all six cities in this study are located at or near the coast.
    Incorporating risk reduction into land use and infrastructure planning could have positive economic impacts and
    ultimately save lives.


 Strengthening Institutions for City Competitiveness
w	
a.	 Localizing the delivery of selected urban services. There are substantial opportunities for transforming institu-
    tional structures to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery. This can be done by shifting more
    management and decision-making roles to the local level and promoting an enhanced system of local performance
    indicators.

    Identify services to be delivered locally. The criteria for identifying the appropriate level for service delivery include:
    economies of scale; externality effects; equity; and local responsiveness and accountability. Based on these criteria,
    some services that are currently managed centrally could be devolved to lower levels of government. Such services
    could include: intra-urban highways and federal intra-urban roads; urban public transportation including buses and
    rail; drainage and flood mitigation; solid waste management and disposal; and emergency services.

    Metropolitan governance. In certain cases, localization would mean that some functions and services, particularly
    planning, would be organized at the conurbation level, involving several local authorities and possibly more than
    one state. This would facilitate improved planning and coordination across local authorities within a conurbation,
    while also allowing for prioritization of local needs. Globally, various institutional arrangements for metropolitan
    management exist, for example, a metropolitan-level agency for one specific sector, controlled jointly by a group of
    local governments.

    City performance indicators. Indicators are essential for tracking improvements in urban service delivery. For each
    localized service, one or more quantitative indicators should be measured, and needs to be supported by a baseline
    and regular monitoring. Malaysia has the building blocks for this, including the Star Rating System and the Malay-
    sian Urban-Rural-National Indicators Network on Sustainable Development (MURNInets). There are opportunities for
    enhancing these systems through the use of internationally standardized indicators to benchmark performance and
    identify good practices from leading cities worldwide.

b.	 Increasing the capacities of local authorities. Ensuring that service delivery at the local level is optimized will
    require some strengthening of the financial and technical capacities of local authorities, including own-source rev-
    enues, fiscal transfers, and staffing.

    Property assessments. Dismantle the barriers, political or otherwise, that have prevented the property assessment
    system from working the way it was intended to work. This could include revising assessment rates and updating




                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                 Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities  xxi 
     assessed values. Safeguard mechanisms could be built into the system to avoid placing sudden or excessive property
     tax burdens on individual property owners, particularly for lower- and middle-income groups.

     Fiscal transfers. The system of fiscal transfers to local authorities could be revised to be more transparent, predict-
     able and formula-based. The specific formula for grant transfers, including constituent variables, needs to be care-
     fully considered, and needs to take into account the diversity of needs across the country. At least part of the grant
     formula could be based on needs, such as level of development, extent of land area, and number of residents served.
     In principle, transfers could also be structured as performance-based grants. Based on performance indicators for a
     particular service, incentive payments in the form of increased grant funding could be given to local authorities for
     excellent performance.

     Staffing. The technical capacities of local authorities could be improved to help them recruit, motivate and retain the
     right staff. Options for this could include: relaxing some centralized staffing controls, and increasing opportunities for
     career development by enabling local authority staff to rotate and serve at other government agencies. To the extent
     that some of these changes would be undertaken with the proposed PBT Transformation Plan, the implementation of
     this plan should be a priority.


 Fostering Social Inclusion
x	
     Strengthening programs for at-risk urban youth. Some policies and programs targeted at enhancing support for
     at-risk youth have been successful in other countries. Such programs help to: prevent school dropouts; encourage
     entry to the labor market; and facilitate inclusion through spatial integration (e.g. housing, transport).

     Support policies aimed at keeping children in school. Global evidence shows that implementing policies that
     encourage children to remain in secondary school is one of the most important preventive investments a country can
     make for at-risk youth, both in terms of improving their educational outcomes and in reducing almost all risky kinds
     of behavior. Completing secondary school can serve as one of the strongest protective factors for young people in
     two key ways: i) through the knowledge and skills that they acquire, which enable them to make informed decisions;
     and ii) through the sense of connectedness that students often feel to adults within the school. Promoting school con-
     nectedness through efforts to improve school quality; providing financial incentives to stay in school; incorporating
     life skills training into the curriculum; and revising disciplinary policies can have a range of benefits. These include
     decreases in: absenteeism, fighting, bullying, and vandalism, and the promotion of educational motivation and class-
     room engagement. It also helps to improve academic performance, school attendance and completion rates.

     Scale up targeted programs for vulnerable youth. While Malaysia has been spending a significant amount of its fis-
     cal resources on social protection, much of that has been devoted to non-targeted programs which do not necessarily
     reach vulnerable youths. International experience points to a range of programs that could be supported including:
     “provide second chance programs” such as literacy and comprehensive educational/job training programs that pro-
     vide school dropouts with an opportunity to complete high school and enter tertiary education or the labor market;
     job training programs that include a mixture of technical skills, life skills and internships; and mentorship programs.
     The My Skills Foundation program in Malaysia provides a good example that could potentially be scaled up.

     Invest in safe neighborhood programs. Safe neighborhood programs are another way to foster a sense of belong-
     ing and support participants’ aspirations, ultimately having a powerful impact in changing the lives of youth at risk,
     as well as changing the dynamic between young people and other community members. Such programs should be




xxii  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
   informed by a clearly articulated design principle, a coherent structure and should focus on measuring impact on the
   ground.

   Improve coordination, design and implementation of programs. Given the multidimensional and cross-sectoral
   nature of youth interventions, the implementation of any such program would need to be well coordinated by several
   government ministries. The establishment of an interagency task force on youth-at-risk could enhance coordination.
   There are also important opportunities to engage the community, local government and civil society organizations in
   the design and implementation of programs at the local level.


 Promoting Innovation through Information
y	
   Deepen open data policies. Providing open access to data from Government and other sources can create new
   business opportunities, and help solve civic problems. As technology advances, cities around the world are experi-
   menting with ways to use data from a number of sources to better understand their urban environment and their cit-
   izens, trying to use technology to respond more effectively to citizens’ needs. As a technologically advanced society,
   Malaysia is in a good position to take advantage of new and innovative means of data-enabled urban management.
   Many Malaysian government agencies collect large amounts of data, some of which are available publicly online, and
   some agencies have developed mobile phone applications to help citizens access these data. However, more could

   government and citizens. Numerous examples are raised throughout the report where having more open access to
   data could help to enhance competitiveness in cities.

1.	 INTRODUCTION
1.	   Malaysia‘s economic performance over the past 30 years has been impressive. Gross domestic product (GDP)
      increased at an average annual rate of 5.8 percent. GDP per capita has now surpassed the United States dollar
      (USD) 10,000 mark at market rates. Its progress in reducing poverty has also been remarkable with the share of
      households living in poverty dropping from over 50 percent in the 1960’s to less than two percent (2012). These
      gains have made Malaysia a global success story.

2.	   Looking ahead, the Government of Malaysia (GoM) has set laudable goals to transform Malaysia from a middle-in-
      come to a high-income economy, while ensuring that growth is also sustainable and inclusive as outlined in its
      2010 New Economic Model (NEM) and Economic Transformation Programme (ETP).

3.	   Urbanization is an important part of this vision for Malaysia. The evidence linking higher levels of urbanization,
      higher productivity and overall economic growth is well established. Cities create proximity and facilitate the flow
      of knowledge that drives innovation. They are centers of productivity, human capital, and greater market access.

4.	   Yet cities can grow in different ways. They can be successful at creating opportunities, providing services for res-
      idents and citizens, and enhancing public spaces to create vibrant, livable cities. But city management can also
      neglect investments in critical infrastructure and basic services, and mismanaged land, environmental and social
      policies can result in traffic congestion, sprawl, slums, pollution and crime.

5.	   The GoM has identified the need to develop a comprehensive and coordinated strategy and action plan for urbanization
      to enhance the competitiveness of its cities, both in terms of economic activity and livability. This would strengthen the
      ability of Malaysia’s cities to become centers of innovation and strong economic clustering, as well as attractive places
      for people, businesses and jobs, and contribute to achieving the long-term development goals outlined in the NEM.


1.1	 Study Objectives

6.	   This study is part of a work program carried out by the World Bank under the guidance of the Economic Planning Unit
      of Malaysia and Khazanah Nasional Berhad. The overall objectives for the work program as set out in the Concept
      Note are to support the GoM in a) formulating a set of strategies to enhance urban development and the role of cities
      in Malaysia; and b) strengthening systems of benchmarking cities in Malaysia for informed policy decisions.

7.	   The study focuses on three aspects of city competitiveness: economic growth, urban governance, and social inclusion.
      It covers six conurbations in Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru, Kuantan, George Town, Kota Kinabalu and Kuch-
      ing. It is based on analysis of existing data from the Department of Statistics; international comparative data; spatial
      data at the city level; and primary data collected during extensive field work carried out from April to October, 2014.

8.	   This introductory chapter (1) of the report lays out a framework for thinking about competitive cities and the meth-
      odology used in this study. Chapter 2 covers main findings and policy recommendations related to economic growth
      in cities, Chapter 3 provides detailed spatial analysis on land use and a review of local development strategies for
      the cities covered in the report, Chapter 4 discusses institutional issues related to urban planning, development
      and service delivery; Chapter 5 includes analysis on urban poverty, inequality and social inclusion, particularly
      as it relates to urban youth, and the concluding Chapter (6) presents cross-cutting issues related to the implemen-
      tation of recommended policy options including institutional responsibilities, time horizon and prioritization, and
      data sharing. The annexes provide extensive supporting materials and case studies.

1.2	 Defining Competitive Cities

9.	     Despite the large international body of research on the competitiveness of cities, a standard definition or common
        understanding of competitive cities has not emerged. Most definitions focus on economic prosperity and growth
        potential. Some definitions also include aspects of quality of life which also contribute to an urban environment con-
        ducive to economic growth and competitiveness (see Box 1-1). Drawing from these approaches, a multi-dimensional
        framework for defining competitive cities was used for analysis with the aim of developing a set of recommendations
        that could help Malaysia move toward a system of competitive cities. This analytical framework was used to reflect
        Malaysia’s vision for development as outlined in recent strategies and plans for the country (see section 1.4). Key
        elements include: economic growth; good urban governance; social inclusion; and environmental sustainability.

10.	    Economic growth. Growth happens in cities that are characterized by high concentrations of human capital,
        excellent connectivity, and a vibrant knowledge-based economy. Cities foster economic growth because density
        increases the ease of moving goods, people and ideas. They remove the physical spaces between people and firms,
        and proximity makes connections easier. Firms value this agglomeration. In the context of a system of cities, each
        city has a role in maximizing efficiency and competitiveness. But they cannot take full advantage of agglomeration
        economies if transport and other infrastructure is limited; if land markets do not allow for economic density; or if
        distortionary policies inhibit opportunity and result in negative environmental consequences.

11.	    Good urban governance. Governments have an important role to play in the delivery of effective and efficient urban
        services and infrastructure. They need to design and support policies for land and housing markets; raise and
        equitably redistribute revenues; and promote a safe and sustainable urban environment through strong institu-
        tions. While urbanization policies are important at the national level, many urban issues are best handled by local
        governments. Good urban governance ensures transparency, accountability, equity, and local participation, all of
        which contribute to city competitiveness.

12.	    Social inclusion. Broadly understood, an inclusive city is one that allows all people, including the disadvantaged, to
        share in and contribute to rising prosperity. Inclusion is concerned with both consumption and production includ-
        ing those elements that are related to human well-being, shared prosperity, and social justice. Such concepts are
        particularly important in urban areas where inequalities are highly visible; it is common to observe low-income
        populations alongside wealthy residents. Such stark differences can exacerbate frustration and feelings of exclu-
        sion resulting in crime and other costs to society.

13.	    Environmental sustainability. Sustainable cities can be defined broadly, to integrate environmental, economic,
        and social objectives. Given the potentially negative consequences of specific urban planning decisions that can
        lead to congestion, pollution and high greenhouse gas emissions, cities today need to consider the trade-offs of
        infrastructure investments as these are likely to be locked in for hundreds of years. This is all the more urgent for
        cities that are rapidly urbanizing. Such decisions can ensure investments that are green and resilient, ultimately
        generating higher economic returns and improving quality of life for residents, as well as improving a city’s chance
        to attract and retain talent. Such investments contribute to competitive cities.

14.	    This study also builds on earlier work on smart cities in the World Bank’s Malaysia Economic Monitor (World Bank
        2011). Smart cities were defined as cities that are innovative, green and resilient. It was recognized that Malaysian
        cities face a number of challenges in becoming “smart”. In relation to skills and knowledge to enable more innova-
        tion, the report noted that Malaysia’s leading universities are performing below potential and not contributing suf-
        ficiently to the cities that host them, and that skills shortages have persisted. On the green and resilience agendas,
        it was also noted that car ownership is spreading; public transport options remain limited; and that GHG emissions
        are high and rising while urban densities are declining (World Bank 2011).

2  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
Box 1-1	 Approaches to defining competitive cities

Despite the fact that a large international body of research exists on the competitiveness of cities, a standard definition or com-
mon understanding of competitive cities has not emerged. However, by identifying common themes in existing definitions or
approaches to measuring the competitiveness of cities, we can arrive at a working definition for the purpose of understanding
and promoting competitive cities in Malaysia.

Most approaches to competitiveness have a particular focus on economic issues; specifically the economic advantage that locat-
ing in the city gives to private enterprises within it. An ongoing World Bank study defines city competitiveness as “the ability of
a city to use its administrative leverage and capacity to make the most of resources at its disposal in order to create an environ-
ment in which the private sector can grow, create jobs, improve incomes of employees, and adapt to external shocks through
innovation, improved productivity and access to external markets.”3 Similarly, according to a definition by Webster and Muller
for another World Bank study (Webster and Muller 2000), also cited recently by the Asian Development Bank (Choe and Roberts
2011), “[u]rban competitiveness refers to the ability of an urban region to produce and market a set of products (goods and ser-
vices) that represent good value (not necessarily lowest price) in relation to comparable products of other urban regions.”

However, Webster and Muller then broaden the definition to include the concept of livability or quality of life, by adding that “[n]
on-tradables, e.g., local services, are part of the competitiveness equation. An urban economy that produces goods and services
for local people of high value relative to price, supports the export economy of the city, making it more competitive, as well as
directly raising the quality of life and standard of living for people living in the urban region.”

A report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 2006) on competitive cities asks whether there
is a choice between having economic dynamism and having a livable city, and concludes that a “good and attractive environment
may not be an alternative to economic success but may contribute to it.” The report also points out that the attractiveness of a
city for investment and human capital depends, in part, on its inclusiveness. It explains that while it may be possible for cities
to create elite enclaves that represent their desired image to the world, metro-wide economic growth depends partly on social
cohesion.

A number of competitive city frameworks invoke the notion of sustainability. A study by the World Economic Forum (2014) begins
with an economic perspective and then expands its definition to emphasize the need for sustainability. It defines city compet-
itiveness as “the set of factors: policies, institutions, strategies and processes that determine the level of a city’s sustainable
productivity. Sustainability encompasses economic, environmental and social issues.”

Other studies focus on measuring what would contribute to a city’s competitiveness without providing an explicit definition. Yet
the indicators that they use suggest a broad understanding of competitiveness and its enabling conditions. For example, a com-
parison of the competitiveness of Australian cities used 20 indicators grouped under the categories of productivity, sustainability
and livability (University of Canberra n.d.)

Some of these multi-dimensional approaches consider governance as one contributor to competitiveness. A recent study by the
Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU 2013), describes competitiveness as a “holistic concept”, and uses 32 indicators to calculate the
level of competitiveness of a city. Indicators are grouped into eight thematic categories and assigned weights: economic strength
(30 percent), physical capital and financial maturity (10 percent each), institutional character and human capital (15 percent
each), global appeal (10 percent), social and cultural character (5 percent), and environment and natural hazards (5 percent).
“Institutional character” can be seen as a term describing governance. The McKinsey Global Institute (2011) uses an Urban Per-
formance Index (using the terms “performance” and “competitiveness” interchangeably) which again takes an “integrated” and
“holistic” approach. The Index is built from 100 quantitative measures across four dimensions: economic performance, social
conditions, sustainable resource use, and finances and governance.

1.3	 Methodology

15.	    The approach for the analysis in the study draws on a broad range of international literature for understanding
        specific aspects of urban development as it links to competitive cities. The analysis is based on existing data
        resources from the Malaysia Department of Statistics, international resources, and qualitative field work carried
        out from April to October, 2014.

16.	    Lessons from international experience were used to assess Malaysia’s experience and provided critical input to the
        set of policy options. Parallel work programs carried out by the World Bank for Malaysia on a National Transport
        Strategy and a National Social Protection Strategy also provided input to this work.

17.	    The six conurbations included in this study are defined in various ways in the data sets used in this study. For clar-
        ity, the report has defined the urban areas and definitions using the terminology summarized in Box 1-2.

18.	    The economic analysis draws heavily on existing data sources obtained through the Department of Statistics,
        Malaysia; as well as the Oxford Economics Global Cities dataset; the World Bank East Asia Urban Expansion data-
        set; CEIC Malaysia data; the Global Risk Data Platform from the United Nations Environment Program (for calcula-
        tion of GDP per km2); and analysis carried out for the World Bank work program on the Malaysia National Transport
        Strategy. A summary of the how these datasets are utilized is provided in Annex 1. The analytical framework of
        this report builds on the “3-D” framework: density, distance and division, as developed in the World Bank’s World


   Box 1-2	 Definitions and terminology in relation to the six urban areas of focus in this study

   As a point of departure, this study uses the existing conurbation names and boundaries, as defined and used by the Federal
   Department of Town and Country Planning, Peninsular Malaysia (JPBD) and in recent documents such as the 2010 National Physical
   Plan 2 (NPP-2) for the four urban areas in the peninsula: Kuala Lumpur conurbation, George Town conurbation, Johor Bahru
   conurbation, and Kuantan conurbation.

   When these names appear in conjunction with “conurbation”, the specific meaning and the area referred to is the entire area
   within the specified conurbation boundary. Note that the conurbation boundaries encompass large areas, although substantial
   portions of these areas are not currently built up (i.e. not considered urban), particularly in the cases of Johor Bahru and Kuantan.

   The conurbation names are also used throughout this report as the preferred name for each urban area: “George Town” instead
   of “Penang”, and “Johor Bahru” instead of “Iskandar Malaysia”.

   In Sabah and Sarawak, conurbation boundaries have not been defined. The urban area of Kota Kinabalu is taken to be the City
   of Kota Kinabalu itself, as administered by Kota Kinablu City Hall (DBKK). The urban area of Kuching refers to the whole area
   administered by the two local authorities of Kuching North and Kuching South.

   Where applicable, other names/terms are used in this report with specific meanings as follows:
   ›› Greater Kuala Lumpur: as defined by the ETP National Key Results Area (NKRA) consists of the federal territories of Kuala Lum-
      pur and Putrajaya, plus eight adjacent local authority areas in Selangor;
   ›› Penang Island refers to the island only, while Penang state refers to the whole of the state: island and mainland;
   ›› Iskandar Malaysia/Iskandar region: as defined and used by the Iskandar Regional Development Authority (IRDA) the area of
      Johor Bahru district and Kulaijaya district;
   ›› Greater Kota Kinabalu: as defined in the Sabah Structure Plan, refers to the City of Kota Kinabalu (administered by DBKK) and
      the adjacent districts of Penampang and Putatan.

   The term “city” is also used throughout this report in a non-specific way to refer to the six selected urban areas.



4  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
         Development Report 2009 (WDR 2009) to study the constraints to economic competitiveness of cities (see Section
         2.2 for an introduction to the framework).

19.	     An analysis of individual cities examines sectoral composition, productivity and cost of living based on the frame-
         work of a portfolio of cities. Under this framework, each city should perform its intended function based on its
         comparative advantage. The policy recommendations follow the WDR 2009’s framework, categorized as follows:
         institutions with common approaches; connective infrastructure; and targeted interventions. It includes a discus-
         sion on sequencing and prioritization according to different levels of urbanization. Relevant international experi-
         ence is integrated with analysis and policy recommendations to draw lessons from other countries.

20.	     City level economic performance was also assessed relative to comparators to assess city competitiveness for the
         six conurbations in the study. This benchmarking exercise uses the Competitive Cities Snapshot methodology,
         recently designed as a part of Competitive Cities Knowledge Base initiative of the World Bank. The methodology
         provides a quick overview of a city’s economic performance with comparisons to others with similar characteris-
         tics on economic outcomes and their key drivers. The approach uses the following data sources for comparisons:
         Oxford Economics Global Cities database, World Bank Doing Business, EIU Competitiveness Index, EIU Livability
         Index, Mercer City Index, UN-Habitat City Prosperity Index, tothinknow database. The criteria for comparator selec-
         tion are defined separately for each city and are explained in Chapter 3.

21.	     The spatial analysis in Chapters 2 and 3 is conducted with GIS data4 on land use and spatial structure, examining
         how urban land is allocated among different uses (residential, agricultural, industrial, commercial, etc.) as a func-
         tion of distance to the city center, and how this land use pattern changes over time (2000 versus 2010, for the
         Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur (FTKL) and George Town only due to data availability). The actual conurbation
         boundaries in the analysis may be different from the administrative boundaries of the metropolitan areas for which
         land use data have been provided by local governments. Analysis is therefore conducted only for areas within the
         conurbation where data are available as is elaborated in Chapter 3.  Based on the key findings from the economic
         and spatial analysis, a review of local development strategies5 was conducted, documenting current and former
         strategies for the city; and comparing the strategies to the situation on the ground.

22.	     The institutional analysis in Chapter 4 focuses on the role of institutions as they pertain to urban planning, devel-
         opment and service delivery in Malaysia. The focus of the analysis has been mostly on the administrative and fiscal
         dimensions of institutions, and less on the political. For these purposes, the term “institutional” is used in the
         broad sense to include aspects such as: the roles and responsibilities of various government agencies; organiza-
         tional structures; the system of strategies, plans, policies, laws and regulations; implementation arrangements and
         coordination mechanisms; and monitoring and evaluation.

23.	     The methodology involved a combination of desk research and interviews with a range of stakeholders. Specifically,
         the analytical steps included identification of a list of “core” urban functions and services that are of particular
         interest for cities; mapping of institutional roles and responsibilities; and a review of relevant plans, policies, and
         laws/regulations related to urban planning, development and service delivery. They also included interviews and
         meetings with a range of stakeholders: government agencies at federal, state and local levels; and private sector
         representatives. A review of selected global case studies was also undertaken to identify some examples of good
         practice and successful institutional change that could be relevant for Malaysia.

                                                                                                                            1. Introduction  5 
24.	    The social analysis in Chapter 5 uses a social exclusion lens defined as a multidimensional process which weakens
        the links between individuals and the rest of society (Rodgers and others 1997). The study explores three key chal-
        lenges related to the livability and competitiveness of cities: social exclusion, youth and crime rates, and places
        a focus on how these challenges relate to livability and competitiveness of cities. It is understood that there are
        several vulnerable groups living in Malaysian cities, such as the elderly, disabled, and single-headed households.
        Given the relationship between competitive cities and at-risk youth, and the existence of other ongoing work, this
        study focused on at-risk youth in urban areas specifically.

25.	    The methodology uses qualitative techniques, specifically focus group discussions, key-informant interviews and
        round table discussions with key stakeholders. This field work was carried out in the six conurbations included in
        this study. Four aspects of exclusion were explored: economic, political, socio-cultural, and spatial. In addition, the
        work also included a literature review and identification of international good practice; and a mapping of govern-
        ment policies and programs. Media coverage on the topic of crime and violence in urban areas was also reviewed.

26.	    A separate report was produced from the strengthening city benchmarking work program. The Malaysian Urban-
        Rural-National Indicators Network on Sustainable Development (MURNInets) benchmarking platform was assessed, with
        a set of core indicators for benchmarking city performance consistent with international experience. Analysis based on
        data provided by MURNInets, as well as some international comparators from the Global Cities Indicator Facility (GCIF)
        database was carried out, and followed by a joint workshop with GCIF and JPBD on global best practices for benchmark-
        ing. Training on global benchmarking and international comparators was conducted at the workshop. There was also an
        in-depth analysis of the new international standard for city indicators, International Organization for Standardization
        (ISO) 37120; on Sustainable Development of Communities; Indicators for City Services; and Quality of Life.

27.	    The findings from this work show that the MURNInets system currently in place for local benchmarking in Malaysia
        is fairly well established and is now being used by many local authorities (PBTs). For Malaysian cities to be glob-
        ally competitive, a system for international benchmarking should be adopted. International benchmarking is vital
        to achieving sustainable and competitive cities, which is why many cities participate in local and international
        benchmarking initiatives. In order to be globally competitive, cities need to be able to see where they stand against
        other cities with similar attributes. The Global City Indicators Facility and the World Council on City Data provide
        international benchmarking platforms that can assist the Government of Malaysia and cities in Malaysia to become
        more competitive through comprehensive benchmarking efforts. Two options were presented for consideration
        with details on the implementation of these options elaborated in the Benchmarking report:

        »» Option 1: Cities in Malaysia adopt ISO 37120 and be certified to be part of the World Council on City Data.

        »» Option 2: Cities in Malaysia that are not ready to adopt ISO 37120 can participate in the Global City Indicators
           Facility and report on indicators within the GCIF framework.

28.	    In reviewing the boundaries of the six conurbations included in the study, guidance was provided based on interna-
        tional best practice for consideration. Recommendations for Malaysia include: redrawing the conurbation boundary
        to take into account jurisdictional, administrative and service boundaries as well as economic, social, transpor-
        tation and environmental issues. Recommendations also include the development of an urban growth boundary
        (UGB) manual. These points are discussed in detail in the Benchmarking report.




6  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
1.4	 Context

29.	    Malaysia is among the more urbanized countries in East Asia, and its urban population continues to increase rap-
        idly. With a high concentration of population in large cities, Malaysia has good opportunities to harness economies
        of scope, scale, and agglomeration. The urban population of Malaysia (in urban areas of more than 100,000 peo-
        ple) increased over the period 2000 to 2010 from 10.2 million (43 percent of the total population) to 15.0 million
        (53 percent), making it one of the more urbanized countries in the region in demographic terms, after Singapore,
        Japan, and the Republic of Korea (and Taiwan, China) (World Bank 2015). The urban population now comprises
        approximately 70 percent of the country’s total population. The rate of urban population growth, at an average of
        four percent a year, has been among the fastest in the region. This rate was surpassed only by Lao PDR, Cambodia,
        and Vietnam; these first two have much smaller urban populations than Malaysia. As of 2010, Malaysia had 19
        urban areas of more than 100,000 people each (World Bank 2015).

30.	    According to 2010 census data, the total population of the six selected conurbations accounts for nearly half of the
        national population, with Greater KL alone accounting for a quarter of the national population. There were a total
        of 19 urban areas of more than 100,000 people.

ary crosses some mukims, these mukims are only partially included in a conurbation. The left column shows the population of each conurbation, excluding
mukims that are partially included in a conurbation; the right chart takes into account the population of mukims that are partially included in a conurbation.

32.	     Malaysia’s urban land grew from around 3,900 km2 to 4,600 km2 between 2000 and 2010: an average annual
         growth rate of 1.5 percent, which was lower than the average of 2.4 percent for the region. The absolute amount of
         urban spatial expansion was among the highest in the region, lower only than China, Indonesia and Vietnam. Urban
         areas covered approximately 1.4 percent of the total area of the country in 2010, among the highest in the region,
         making urban areas in Malaysia among the least dense in East Asia (World Bank 2015).

33.	     Malaysia’s development strategy has recognized the role of cities as the nexus for economic growth and for attract-
         ing mobile talent, jobs, and capital. Policies to operationalize this vision of growth have been included in the New
         Economic Model (NEM), which is driven by ‘innovative processes and cutting-edge technology, supported by a
         healthy level of investment and talent, for high value added goods and services’. Supporting policies and plans
         include:

         »» Initiative-22 (Driving Growth by Urban Agglomeration): this is part of the 10th Malaysia Plan (2011-2015) which
            embraces the key message of the World Bank’s 2009 World Development Report (World Bank 2009). It outlines
            the need to develop clusters of high population and economic density, also to improve livability to attract talent,
            linked to National Key Economic Areas (NKEAs).

         »» The 2010 National Physical Plan 2 (NPP-2) is aligned with the vision outlined in the 10th Malaysia Plan. It is
            based on the concept of “concentrated decentralization” to “concentrate the nation’s scarce resources to a few
            priority urban centers with the greatest growth potential for job creation while protecting the rural areas and
            natural environment” (NPP-2 2010)

     Urban land was defined as the built-up land in urban areas with populations of 100,000 or more, using built-up areas as observed from
     satellites, see World Bank, 2015.


8  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
       »» The National Urbanization Policy has been developed in tandem with the NPP-2 and outlines principles which
          will “guide and coordinate the planning and urban development of the country to be more efficient and system-
          atic particularly to handle the increase in the urban population by 2020 with emphasis on balancing the social,
          economic and physical development within urban areas”. The federal Town and Country Planning Department
          has begun work on a National Urbanization Strategy for Malaysia based on this.

34.	   While it is evident that the Government of Malaysia is committed to developing policies and strategies to tap
       into the vast economic potential of cities, it is unclear how well the implementation of these various initiatives is
       coordinated. There are other gaps which could potentially hinder Malaysia’s ability to fully leverage the economic
       benefits of urbanization. These include: a paucity of socioeconomic data at the local level; the absence of an oper-

2.	 BUILDING ECONOMICALLY COMPETITIVE CITIES

2.1	 Introduction and Analytical Framework

35.	   This chapter analyzes the economic competitiveness of Malaysian cities and provides policy options based on local
       and international experience. It focuses on the critical issues of maximizing economic gains in urban areas, provid-
       ing the right enabling conditions, and balancing the costs and benefits of population density, in order to make cities
       the growth engines of the national economy. It examines how Malaysian cities can move from an industry-based
       economy to a service- and knowledge-based economy, and shows how this can help Malaysia transition from a
       middle-income to a high-income country.

36.	   Section 2.1 lays out the analytical framework for the analysis; Section 2.2 presents key analytical findings and
       accompanying policy recommendations. Selected case studies and examples from other countries/cities are pre-
       sented to help recognize constraints to economic competitiveness and to identify corresponding policy priorities.
       The following chapter, Chapter 3, takes a city-by-city approach, providing additional analysis and policy recom-
       mendations for each of the six conurbations, including economic analysis of industrial structure and productivity,
       spatial analysis of land use, and review of local economic development strategies.

37.	   The analytical framework of this chapter builds on the “3-D” framework on the geography of economic develop-
       ment based on research from the World Bank’s World Development Report, 2009: density, distance and division
       (World Bank 2009). International experience suggests that cities do well when they focus transformation on these
       dimensions. Increased density is reflected in the growth of cities; shorter distances are important for the time and
       cost of commuting; and fewer divisions are needed to consolidate knowledge and the skills base and to bring peo-
       ple and firms closer to the institutions that support economic growth.

38.	   Population density, measured the population per unit of land, is the defining characteristic of urban settlements.
       High productivity requires geographic concentration of labor and capital and is highly correlated with economic
       density. Economic density is the geographic compactness of economic activity, which can be measured by GDP or
       jobs created per square kilometer. Economic density is important for agglomeration economies and for the eco-
       nomic competitiveness of cities. Tokyo, the world’s largest city, is home to 35 million people, one quarter of Japan’s
       population, but occupies only four percent of the country’s land area.

39.	   A city needs to find the right balance between the costs and benefits of density to be truly competitive. The benefits
       of density include productivity gains and the ability to share public amenities, two factors that lead to the urban
       wage premium. (See Box 2-1 for some examples of the benefits of economic agglomeration in cities.) High, but
       poorly managed, density is often associated with the urban cost penalty, marked by such issues as land scarcity,
       high commuting costs, congestion, and high crime rates.

40.	 Distance affects the ease of moving goods and services, labor, capital, and information; distance also needs to
     consider time and financial costs. Locations close to markets tend to have lower transport costs and easier access
     to knowledge and other resources. Eight million Americans relocate to a different state every year to move closer
     to economic opportunity. A high ratio of distance to density has been found to be one of the causes of low per
     capita income, low labor productivity, and low real wages. It is also associated with high rates of poverty and
     unemployment.




                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                           11 
41.	     Density and distance are also affected by division. Disparities in welfare and housing across the same city, and
         attendant social issues such as crime, persist even where there are high levels of urbanization and upper-middle
         incomes. Ethnic and cultural divisions, or divisions caused by failing institutions and inadequate regulations can
         be detrimental to communities; geographic divisions can also hinder economic concentration and reduce fluidity
         of market access, and thus negatively impact cohesion and economic growth.


     Box 2-1	 The benefits of economic agglomeration in cities

     On New York’s Wall Street and in the City of London, financial firms, insurance companies, and banking syndicates benefit from
     being close to one another. Co-location stimulates the growth of other specialist services, such as legal, software, data process-
     ing, advertising, and management consulting firms. These clustered firms, by providing a thicker market for highly educated
     individuals, benefit from drawing on the same large pool of human capital. They also gain from the generation and diffusion of
     knowledge amongst one another. Although much of the evidence of urban agglomeration economies comes primarily from devel-
     oped countries, there is also evidence from developing countries: a survey of 12,400 manufacturing firms in 120 cities in China
     points to the higher productivity of firms in more populous cities.

2.2	 Analysis and Broad Policy Directions

42.	     The analysis uses data from the Oxford Economics dataset of some 750 cities globally, as well as from the Depart-
         ment of Statistics, Malaysia. It identifies the following main constraints to the economic competitiveness of Malay-
         sian cites: i) low economic density, ii) high transport costs, and iii) institutions and policies that are not well
         integrated, especially with regard to urban planning, land use, and housing.

2.2.1	 Low economic density

43.	     Economic density is a major contributing factor to productivity in cities, for the reasons stated below.

         »» Density7 reduces transport costs making it easier and less expensive to move goods and people

         »» Density cuts communication costs allowing for frequent face-to-face interactions that are important for exchang-
            ing ideas and building trust, which in turn promote innovation and productivity

         »» Density promotes knowledge transfer among workers and between firms.

44.	     High density in large cities is the key to innovation. Larger cities tend to produce more high-tech and experimental
         items, which require a diversity of skills and production types to thrive (Jacobs 1970; Duranton and Puga 2000).
         In the high-tech industry, urban diversity and cross-sector fertilization aid innovation and nurture new products.
         Evidence from electronics firms in Japan shows that highly-skilled research and development, and trial production
         are located in larger metropolitan areas, while mass production of standard items takes place in non-metropolitan
         areas. Leading universities also have a key role in fostering innovations, and it has recently been pointed out that
         Malaysia’s universities can help drive innovation and growth by working to improve student skills in communica-
         tion, problem-solving, and information technologies (World Bank 2014a).

     Density here refers to well-managed density, density that allows a city to be truly competitive as described in paragraphs 38-39 above.

45.	   Economic density, defined as GDP in purchasing power parities per square kilometer, rises with the level of devel-
       opment. The densest places in the world are in the richest countries. In 2005, Dublin, London, Paris, Singapore,
       and Vienna ranked at the top, with more than USD 200 million in gross product per square kilometer. Likewise,
       Tokyo-Kanagawa, New York-New Jersey, Oslo-Akershus-Vestfold, and Vienna-Mödling were the densest grid cells of
       1° longitude by 1° latitude, generating more than USD30 million of gross product per square kilometer (see Figure
       2-1).

46.	 Economic density is critical for transitioning to a knowledge-based service economy and tends to happen as coun-
     tries move to a more mature phase of development. Service economies tend to have higher population densities
     than industrial economies because:

       »» service economies require less land per employee. Banks, insurance companies, hospitals, and schools can oper-
          ate comfortably in high-rise buildings that allow for high density;

       »» given external economies, business services have greater potential for agglomeration as firms serve one another.
          Every bank needs advertising; every advertising firm needs a bank account. The potential for codependence and
          agglomeration is thus intrinsic to services.

47.	   Services are prominent among the most agglomerated industries in the United States of America. Larger cities
       have been amassing service jobs from areas less than 20 kilometers away. Between 1972 and 1992, jobs in the
       U.S. became more spatially concentrated and medium-size counties lost jobs to more urban areas. In the United
       Kingdom, financial and insurance services are 35 times more concentrated than manufacturing; and information
       and communications services are seven times more concentrated (Campos 2012).

48.	   Cities in Malaysia with more service- and knowledge-based firms and fewer manufacturing and other industri-
       al-based firms tend to have higher economic density. Figure 2-2 shows how Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru and Kuan-
       tan, cities where manufacturing’s share of the economy is between 30 percent and 40 percent, have significantly
       higher economic density than George Town and Kota Kinabalu, where the share of manufacturing and/or heavy
       industry is more than 50 percent. The only exception is Kuching, which has a high share of manufacturing (58 per-


                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                    2. Building Economically Competitive Cities  13 
         cent) and also high economic density. This can be explained by the concentration and clustering of manufacturing
         industries in Kuching, where factories and industrial parks/zones are supported by good infrastructure, transport
         and preferential policies. The manufacture of silicon wafers and other electronics is a mainstay in Kuching’s high
         levels of productivity. Further discussion of Kuching can be found in Chapter 3.

49.	 The overall economic density of Malaysian cities is relatively low. Economic density for the six conurbations in this
     study is lower than other large cities such as Bangkok and Jakarta, as measured by gross value added per km2 or
     jobs per km2. Low economic density limits the benefits of agglomeration and may impede a city’s structural transi-
     tion to a knowledge-based service economy.

50.	     While Kuala Lumpur has the highest economic density within Malaysia, its employment density is only around
         1,600 jobs per km2. In comparison, the employment densities of Seoul, Singapore and Hong Kong are 2.5, five, and
         ten times that of Kuala Lumpur respectively (see Figure 2-3).

     A number of the cross-city comparative analyses are based on Oxford Economics data. However, it is important to note that some of our six
     conurbations in the datasets have different boundaries from those defined by the Government of Malaysia.

51.	     Figure 2-4 shows economic density as measured by GDP per km2 for major cities of ASEAN countries, represented
         by the height of the bars.9 Figure 2-5 and Figure 2-6 display this same data – in 2D format for greater clarity – for
         peninsular Malaysia, and Sabah and Sarawak, respectively. Kuala Lumpur’s GDP per km2 is comparable to that of
         Jakarta and Ho Chi Minh City, even though overall per capita GDP is higher in Malaysia than in Indonesia or Vietnam
         (per capita GDP in Indonesia and Vietnam is only one-third and one-fifth of that of Malaysia, respectively). As a
         potential competitor to Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok’s economic density is substantially higher, even though Thailand’s
         per capita GDP is only around half of that of Malaysia’s. Compared to other large cities in high-income countries
         of East Asia, the difference is even greater. GDP per km2 in Seoul, Singapore and Hong Kong is 4, 13 and 22 times
         that of Kuala Lumpur, respectively.

     In the distributed global GDP dataset, sub-national GRP and national GDP data are allocated to 30 arc second (approximately 1km) grid
     cells in proportion to the population residing in that cell. The method also distinguishes between rural and urban populations, assuming
     the latter has a higher GDP per capita. Input data are from: 1) a global time-series dataset of GDP, with subnational gross regional product
     (GRP) for 74 countries, compiled by the World Bank Development Economics Research Group (DECRG); 2) population projections for 2009,
     based on a population grid for 2005 provided by LandScanTM Global Population Database (Oak Ridge, TN: Oak Ridge National Laboratory).
     This dataset was extrapolated to 2010 by UNEP/GRID-Geneva. Unit is estimated value of production per cell, in thousands of constant
     2000 USD. Cell level anomalies may occur due to poor alignment of multiple input data sources, and users are strongly recommended to
     attempt to verify information, or consult original sources, to determine suitability for a particular application. This product was compiled
     by DECRG for the Global Assessment Report on Risk Reduction (GAR). It was modeled using global data. For a detailed description of the
     data sources and methodology, see http://preview.grid.unep.ch/index.php?preview=data&events=socec&evcat=1&lang=eng

52.	      While the population density of the selected Malaysian cities has grown rapidly in recent years, increase in employ-
          ment density has lagged. Population density increased by 22 percent from 2003 to 2010 but employment density
          only increased by an average of 13.5 percent. George Town and Johor Bahru have even witnessed a decline in job
          density. The population density of these six cities is now close to half the average level of Shanghai, Tokyo, and
          Singapore, while the employment density is only 27 percent of the average level in the three East Asian cities10.
          Correspondingly, the average overall economic production density of the six Malaysian cities is only eight percent
          of that of Shanghai, Tokyo, and Singapore.11

2.2.2	 High transport costs and urban expansion

53.	      Transport costs in the six Malaysian cities are high compared to other East Asian cities. Figure 2-7 and Figure 2-8
          show that the share of transport costs in household expenditure in Kuala Lumpur is 59 percent higher than that in
          Hong Kong and Tokyo, and the share of transport costs in household income in Kuala Lumpur is 50 percent higher
          than that of Hong Kong and Tokyo.

54.	      Adding to transport costs are the costs of traffic congestion, currently a serious problem in the larger urban areas
          of Malaysia, and particularly in Kuala Lumpur. The recently completed World Bank advisory service on a national
          strategy for Malaysia’s transport sector found that federal roads in nearly 50 percent of Malaysia’s main urban
10	
      Shanghai, Tokyo and Singapore have an average population density of 7.037.7 persons per km2, the six Malaysian cities have an average
      population density of 3,244 persons per km2.

      Employment data and gross value added data are extracted from Oxford Economics. Urban land area and population data are obtained
      from World Bank 2015; Urban land was defined as the built-up land in urban agglomerations with populations of 100,000 or more, using
      built-up areas as observed from satellites.

          areas are at or above capacity. The situation is less critical for state and local roads, but around a third of these
          still see heavy congestion. Not surprisingly, when asked about top challenges to the efficient movement of people
          and freight, states consistently list traffic congestion. They also see inadequate and insufficient infrastructure in
          urban areas as a top challenge, primarily in terms of public transport solutions and road maintenance.

18  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
55.	                       An underlying driver of high transport costs is the spatial expansion and urban sprawl of Malaysian cities. This is
                           reflected in the population density gradients by distance from the city center shown in Figure 2-9, a result of the
                           relatively flat spatial form of Malaysian cities compared to their East Asian peers.12 This expansion is also reflected in
                           the fact that Malaysia had the fourth-largest built-up landmass in the East Asia and Pacific region as of 2010, when
                           urban areas covered approximately 1.4 percent of the total area of the country. Malaysia’s urban space grew from
                           around 3,900 km2 to 4,600 km2 between 2000 and 2010, an average annual growth rate of 1.5 percent. In absolute
                           terms, urban spatial expansion was among the highest in the region, lower than only China, Indonesia, and Vietnam.

56.	                       Urban sprawl and weaknesses in urban transport mean that Greater Kuala Lumpur faces the unusual combination
                           of longer journey times for public compared to private transport, and highly congested roads and highways (World
                           Bank 2015a). As a consequence, public transport use is relatively low and the corresponding high use of private
                           vehicles is exacerbating the problem. The modal share of public transport in Kuala Lumpur is only 19 percent, com-
                           pared to 62 percent in both Shanghai and Singapore (World Bank 2015a).

2.2.3	 Inefficient urban form can undermine livability, affordability and environmental sustainability

57.	                       When the cost of living outweighs the economic gains from increased density, “agglomeration diseconomies” set
                           in. Inefficient urban form, such as sprawl that results in high transport costs, contributes to this. In the case of
                           Kuala Lumpur, this is reflected in the city’s high cost of living. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit’s (EIU)


12	
          The measure of city form that has been most often studied by urban economists is the population density gradient from a negative
          exponential function. More specifically, the population density of a city is hypothesized to follow: D(u) = D0e-γμε where D is population
          density at distance u from the center of a city; D0 is the density at the center; e is the base of natural logarithms; “the gradient,” or the rate
          at which density falls from the center (Bertaud and Malpezzi 2003).




                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                              2. Building Economically Competitive Cities  19 
          Worldwide Cost of Living survey,13 Kuala Lumpur ranked 74th on the 2012 list of the world’s most expensive cities.
          The index value for Kuala Lumpur is 83, meaning that Kuala Lumpur is 83 percent as expensive as New York City,
          although its salaries are nowhere near as high. The cost of living in Kuala Lumpur has been increasing rapidly: the
          index value rose from 67 in 2009 to 83 in 2012, an increase of 23 percent in three years.

58.	      The benefits from increasing density can be offset by the high cost of living, especially for non-tradable goods such
          as housing. According to Demographia, a U.S.-based urban development research group, Malaysia has a “severely
          unaffordable” residential homes market, with housing even more out of reach for its residents than in Singapore,
          Japan and the U.S.14 Malaysia’s median house price is 5.5 times higher than median annual income, this is higher
          than Singapore’s at 5.1. Housing in the U.S. and Japan is classified as “moderately unaffordable” (The Malay Mail
          online 2014).

59.	      Low density and long distances can have a negative impact on the local and global environment, increasing per
          capita energy consumption and per capita greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This in turn represents a challenge
          for city competitiveness, in terms of environmental sustainability and overall livability. Evidence from around the
          world has found that living in low-density areas where people drive long distances to work increases per capita
          energy consumption leading to increased production of greenhouses gases (e.g. Kahn 2006). Senbel et al (2014)
          found that compactness, when coupled with mass transit, can yield considerable reductions in emissions. Figure
          2-10 illustrates the relationship between per capita transport emissions and population density.

60.	 Based on available evidence, Malaysian cities appear to have moderately high per capita GHG emissions. The Econ-
     omist Intelligence Unit (EIU) estimated per capita energy-based CO2 emissions in the Federal Territory of Kuala
     Lumpur at 7.2t in 2007 (EIU 2011); the corresponding figure for the Iskandar Malaysia Region in 2005 was esti-
     mated at 9.3t (Ho et al 2009). A study of Putrajaya modeled per capita GHG emissions at 8.7t CO2e in 2007 (UTM
     et al 2011), while a more recent study suggests that per capita GHG emissions in 2014 for the area encompassing
     Johor Bahru and Pasir Gudang were approximately 11.5tCO2e (21MtCO2e total emissions with a population of 1.82
     million) (Gouldson et al 2014).

61.	      Urban resilience and disaster preparedness are an important aspect of sustainability that merit increasing atten-
          tion. Malaysia’s cities face increasing environmental challenges, with attendant economic and social impacts. Tem-
          perature records for the past 40 years already show that temperature anomalies in Malaysia’s cities have increased
          faster than the global average (see Figure 2-11). In the medium to long term, climate change is expected to result in
          more heat waves and to exacerbate the urban heat island effect, in turn increasing energy demand for cooling and
          increasing water consumption. Heavy, more frequent precipitation events are expected and will increase the risk
          and severity of urban flooding and landslides. This is likely to disrupt economic activity and infrastructure (World
          Bank 2011). In the longer term, sea-level rise also threatens many Malaysian cities: all six cities in this study are
          located at or near the coast; the costs of coastal protection are expected to increase over time. These concerns,
          as well as the possibility of rare disasters such as earthquakes, would be an important consideration for building
          the resilience of Malaysian cities, especially since these are not currently well covered in many existing plans and
          strategies.




13	
      The EIU takes into account more than 160 items, from food, toiletries and clothing to domestic help, transport and utility bills, in 140 cities
      worldwide to formulate a cost of living index, which uses New York City as a benchmark.
14	
      Demographia rates housing as severely unaffordable if it is 5.1 times median annual income. 4.1-5.0x is seriously unaffordable; 3.1-4.0x is
      moderately unaffordable; less than 3.0x is affordable).

62.	    In this context, “green growth” has emerged in recent years as a priority for countries and cities in order to ensure
        that economic growth is environmentally sustainable. Green policies can contribute to growth by helping to increase
        the amount of natural, physical, and human capital available; by promoting efficiency; and by stimulating innova-
        tion (World Bank 2012). Environmental performance is an essential component of city competitiveness, and can
        become an important source of competitive advantage. For example, prioritizing green growth in a city could help
        it become a hub for innovations in renewable energy such as in the design and production of green products like
        solar panels. Better environmental performance will also help to lower the overall cost of doing business, through
        resource efficiency that lowers production costs.

63.	    The environmental sustainability of Malaysian cities has been gaining more attention in recent years, and various
        plans have emphasized environmental considerations. There is a growing recognition of the need to prioritize green
        growth now. Penang has been recognized for improving the quality of its urban environment (see Box 2-2), and
        is also the location of several strategic projects to promote green urbanization (Abdul-Majeed and Ismail 2013).


   Box 2-2	 Green urbanization in Penang

   From 1971 to 1990, Penang industrialized rapidly. This growth provided job opportunities and increased living standards. How-
   ever, there were also negative effects from this growth, including urban sprawl associated with increased population. The waters
   around Penang Island had some of the highest E. coli content in Malaysia and the island’s rivers had become increasingly pol-
   luted. The Sungai Pinang in Penang Island was declared a “dead river” in 1990. Management of both industrial and household
   waste was poor, with little enforcement of regulations.

   The Malaysian government introduced several policies related to the construction industry, water, and waste management from
   the mid-1980s onwards to deal with these problems. It strictly implemented zoning in the industrial area. The Penang water sup-
   ply authority introduced a water conservation surcharge in 2010 to reduce water consumption; and the government established
   a fully integrated waste disposal system that has revitalized the city’s most polluted river. International standards in waste man-
   agement have been applied to Penang’s industrial parks and its hospitals. In 2010, Sungai Pinang was certified by the Drainage
   and Irrigation Department as having improved to Class 3 (moderate level) after the local government built a waste discharge
   system at the River Road abattoir. Penang was ranked the 8th most liveable city in Asia by the ECA International in 2010.

2.2.4	 Potential for more efficient land use

64.	 Economic density and transport costs are usually related to the spatial distribution of economic activities within
     cities. This section analyzes land use in three Malaysian conurbations (Kuala Lumpur, George Town, Johor Bahru
     and Kota Kinabalu). The land use data was used to draw comparison with New York City and Singapore, for which
     comparable data were available. Chapter 3 discusses land use patterns in each Malaysian conurbation in more
     detail.

65.	    Due to the varying extents for which land use data were available, different amounts and categories of non-built-up
        land were present in the data, including agricultural land. The data showed that 85 percent of land use in the Johor
        Bahru conurbation was for non-built-up areas, compared to 50 percent for Kota Kinabalu, and 34 percent for New
        York City (Figure 2-12). Although this may be indicative of how much open space there is in each of these cities,
        it is more likely a function of how the conurbation boundaries were drawn. As defined currently, the Johor Bahru
        conurbation includes vast areas of agricultural land.

     five standard classes: residential, commercial, industrial, institutional, and infrastructure. While these standard
     land use classes may not contain exactly the same land uses within them from one city to another, they allow for

*Singapore’s commercial and industrial land uses are combined in a single category.



67.	    Greater Kuala Lumpur and Johor Bahru use around 30 percent of their built-up land for residential purposes, while
        George Town and Kota Kinabalu use more: 43 percent and 44 percent respectively. New York City has a much
        higher proportion of residential land at 64 percent, although it is important to note that New York City has a mixed
        commercial and residential class that has been included here under the residential category. Singapore, where
        most housing takes the form of dense high-rise apartment blocks, uses only 16 percent of its built-up land for res-
        idential purposes.

68.	 These four Malaysian conurbations and New York City have a similar proportion of land dedicated to commercial
     use: between four percent and six percent. The Malaysian conurbations use between 10 percent and 13 percent of
     land for industrial purposes, around twice that used for commerce, whereas New York City has slightly less land
     area dedicated to industry than commerce (note that New York City does not include the industrial areas in New
     Jersey that are part of the larger New York metropolitan area). Singapore has a combined “industry and commerce”
     category which makes up 16 percent of the total built-up area.

69.	 Institutional land occupies 14-18 percent of the built-up area within the four Malaysian cities. New York City’s
     institutional land takes up only 10 percent of the built-up area, while Singapore’s makes up over 30 percent of its
     built-up area, although this includes a large area set aside for defense: 20 percent of all built-up area.

70.	    Infrastructure, including transportation infrastructure, makes up a much larger proportion of the built-up area in
        the Malaysian cities than in Singapore or New York. In Greater KL and Johor Bahru, infrastructure is the largest land
        use. Around a third of all built-up land in these two conurbations is used for infrastructure. This compares with only
        13 percent in New York City and 20 percent in Singapore.

71.	    Figure 2-14 compares the borough of Manhattan in New York City with the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur
        (FTKL). Both use just over 50 percent of built-up land for residential purposes. Manhattan dedicates more land to

          commercial use than FTKL but FTKL has more industrial land; and 27 percent of land in FTKL (33 km2) is for institu-
          tional use, compared to just 16 percent in Manhattan (5 km2).

72.	      This comparison illustrates how improving land use efficiency can increase economic density in Malaysian cities.
          Kuala Lumpur has a lot of open space close to the city center: almost half the land within 1 km of the city center
          is used for institutions, or for public recreational space. Some of this land should remain unchanged due to the
          public amenity value; some other parts are unlikely to be redeveloped due to civic or historical importance. Yet so
          much undeveloped, or sparsely developed, land in Kuala Lumpur provides scope to focus on a more efficient use
          of land, including carrying out detailed assessments on whether land close to the city center can be put to more
          productive use without undermining the quantity or quality of public amenities. The authorities also need to con-
          sider whether any institutional sites could be consolidated or relocated in favor of residential or commercial use15.

73.	      Considering options to promote development of Malay Reserve Land (MRL) near city centers has potential to
          improve land use efficiency, even where tracts of MRL do not occupy much land in the city. Restrictions on the use
          of such land also result in a lower-than-average market value (Ariffin 2013). Almost half the MRL inside FTKL has
          been kept as open/green space16, this is greater than the share of open/green space for non-MRL land in the city.
          Kuala Lumpur City Plan 2020 proposes to “encourage and facilitate the development of Malay Reservation areas,
          traditional kampungs and new villages.”

                                                                                                      2. Building Economically Competitive Cities  25 
74.	      A standard urban economics model17 was applied to demonstrate how segregating MRL from the rest of the land
          market could potentially impact the affordability of housing and land. Annex 2 includes an explanation of the
          results and model analysis, which is based on the MRL data for the Johor Bahru conurbation. The results show
          that the impacts are not large, but are also not negligible. In Johor Bahru conurbation, where approximately 14.5
          percent of the land is MRL, the model shows that rents and land values where MRL is excluded from urbanization
          would achieve an increase of 1.3 percent and 4.6 percent respectively, based on a value of 0.16 for ß (the share of
          income devoted to housing expenditures).

2.2.5	 More flexible land-use regulations can increase economic density

75.	      Tools and regulations for land use planning such as minimum plot size, limits on plot ratio18, road widths, setbacks
          (to the front, rear and sides of a plot), land for public use, and pedestrian and vehicular access have direct influ-
          ence on economic density and the overall spatial form of cities. Regulations should be flexible enough to respond
          to changing market conditions. Overly stringent regulations that can restrict increases in economic density and
          potentially distort land and housing markets should be relaxed, while incentives can also be offered at certain
          locations where the economic return of land is high, agglomeration benefits are prominent, and infrastructure and
          public services are sufficient to accommodate high density. It is also important to take a long-term perspective of
          the demand and supply for real estate, and to take account of this in the planning process.

76.	      In this context, a re-examination of planning guidelines in Malaysia is needed to maximize land use in cities. Some
          policy initiatives have already been implemented; for example the Penang Island Municipal Council (MPPP) has
          revised plot ratio guidelines for high-rise properties on the island to allow developers to construct a total of 122,000
          ft2 per acre compared with 42,000 ft2 per acre previously. The Kuala Lumpur City Plan 2020 states that “mixed-use
          development incorporating high density residential, high plot ratio commercial as well as community and business
          facilities shall be encouraged.” The transit planning zone in and around KL Sentral is a good example of zoning for
          mixed commercial use with plot ratios of up to 6.5 at KL Sentral itself, and between 4 and 5.5 in parts of Brickfields.

77.	      In Malaysia, the National Land Code (1965) plays a vital role in controlling and managing land use and urban-rural
          development. Rules and restrictions imposed by the Code have been progressively amended to cater to social,
          political and economic changes in the country, but shortcomings persist in the use of the present legislative frame-
          work to foster a competitive economic environment. There have been past cases where development planning
          and land administration procedures and requirements have prolonged the development process (Singh 1995). For
          example, the National Land Code technically only allows for a given plot of land to have a single use; this means
          that recent mixed-use developments are typically categorized as commercial, with residential units within such
          developments paying assessment and utility rates based on commercial rates.

78.	      Even where there is flexibility in changing land use, it may not always promote efficiency and density. Land mar-
          ket and real estate experts in Malaysia have pointed out that property developers often find it more financially
          attractive to build on rural land next to existing urban areas, rather than redevelop brownfield sites within cities. A
          developer typically buys rural land from the previous landowner at relatively low market values, pays a premium to
          the Land Office to convert the land to non-agricultural use, and then sells the newly-built property at a good profit.


17	
      Due to limited data availability, this model has been constructed based a certain number of simplifying hypotheses without detailed
      calibration; the outputs of the model should be considered with caution.
18	
      Plot ratio is defined by the Town and Country Planning Act 1976 (Act 172) as: “the ratio of the total floor space area of a building to the area
      of the building plot as measured between the boundary lines.” Different terms for this same concept are in use around the world: floor area
      ratio, floorspace index, floor lot ratio, plot ratio; despite subtle differences, all are essentially similar.


26  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
       Recalibrating such factors as the premium payable for conversion of use, and the allowable maximum plot ratio in
       and near city centers, would help shift incentives toward redevelopment and increasing density, rather than sprawl.

79.	   The experience of Los Angeles demonstrates how changes in land policies have been used to densify one of the
       most sprawling cities in the world. The city has supported a shift toward a more compact spatial structure through:

       »» zone change ordinance allowing higher Floor Area Ratio (FAR), population density and building heights around
          transit stations and specially designated boulevards and plots;

       »» change of land-use regulations allowing a mix of residential, commercial and special industrial uses i.e. media
          and entertainment, and the right to adapt and reuse commercial buildings as housing, especially in boulevards
          and transit station areas;

       »» significant investment in metro, light rail and bus networks that have made Los Angeles the third-best city in the
          U.S. in terms of transit ridership.

         Box 2-3 describes these changes in greater detail.


  Box 2-3	 Los Angeles (1995): Redesigning spatial structure

  The need for a policy turnaround: The 1970 Los Angeles “Centers Plan” acknowledged that: “Many of the problems which have
  surfaced in recent years could have been avoided by a comprehensive planning process.” This document was more conceptual
  than implementable but its principles are recognizable in the General Plan Framework of 1995 prepared by the City Planning
  Department. The framework established a vision for the long-term development and physical form of Los Angeles that would steer
  economic growth; address congestion through investment in public transport and reduce the need for long and frequent private
  vehicle trips. It would also promote multi-family residential neighborhoods and pedestrian-oriented districts.

  The use of community plans to stimulate compact development: The General Plan Framework is to be implemented through
  amendments to the community plans of the 35 Los Angeles communities. The Hollywood Community Plan, approved in 2012,
  projects an increase in population, employment, and housing in Hollywood by 2030. Plans to invest in mass transit provide an
  opportunity to accommodate employment and population growth in mixed-use centers and along transit corridors. The plan
  increases density within 400 meters of transit stations, and creates incentive areas that allow increases in FAR for preferred
  types of development. Policies in Downtown Los Angeles have encouraged the private sector to build almost 20,000 market
  residential units since 1999, about double the number of then-current units. Financial incentives and FAR bonuses have made
  affordable housing possible, accounting for about 20 percent of all units built.

2.2.6	 Coordination of land-use planning needs with transport infrastructure development

80.	 Land use planning and urban transport are generally not well integrated: see Chapter 4 here, and World Bank
     (2015a). A city’s transport choices can generate positive as well as negative externalities as the city grows; as
     such, transport is best addressed as part of an integrated urban strategy that can cater to various user groups and
     anticipate long-term needs. The World Bank’s advisory service on a national transport strategy (World Bank 2015a),
     recommends a conurbation-level lead urban transport agency as the “integrator” for strategic planning, policy for-
     mulation, and infrastructure and services planning.


                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                          2. Building Economically Competitive Cities  27 
81.	    Central business districts and other economically dynamic areas of cities normally have the highest plot ratio.
        Those that are well connected to public transit can accommodate large daytime populations. Outlying areas that
        are also linked to the transit system, for example those adjacent to transit stations or those at major highway inter-
        sections, should also be assigned high plot ratios by planners. Greater population densities also generate a greater
        need for infrastructure services, and governments need to be careful to not overwhelm infrastructure when plan-
        ning for increased population density. It is equally important not to impose low-density caps where infrastructure
        can support increased density.

82.	    Research (e.g. Barter 2004) points out that Malaysian cities’ heavy dependency on private vehicles may be caused
        by outdated structures which encourage and rely on car use. Efficient land use through transit-oriented develop-
        ment (TOD) or smart growth that gives priorities to new developments along established public transport routes
        may help Malaysian cities reduce distance to employment in dense urban areas. Attention should also be paid to
        the needs of lower income groups; the recent EPU-UNDP study on housing issues in Malaysia highlights that areas
        of lower income housing in Malaysian cities are poorly served by public transportation, which disadvantages resi-
        dents there. Outside of the largest cities, a related challenge that also affects lower income groups disproportion-
        ately is the need to improve public transport service levels and coverage in small and medium-sized cities/towns.

83.	    TOD often includes a mixture of residential, commercial, and/or other amenities integrated into a walkable neighbor-
        hood and located within a short distance of quality public transport. Hong Kong suffered from high congestion costs
        and an increase in the number of vehicles in the 1960s and early 1970s. With the launch of several spatially connective
        policies, such as building the Mass Transit Railway and modifying building height restrictions around the Kai Tak air-
        port, Hong Kong now ranks among the world’s top five in infrastructure efficiency, and the slums are gone. Box 2-4 sum-
        marizes some lessons from global success stories in TOD, while Box 2-5 details the specific experience of Copenhagen.

84.	    The Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2020 recognizes the benefits of TOD and proposes to “provide priority and
        incentives to development in areas around transit terminals.” To reinforce this, the Plan mentions more intensive
        development near transit terminals; mixed-use development incorporating high-density residential use; high plot
        ratio for commercial as well as community and business facilities; bus services integrated with rail terminals and
        interchange facilities provided to facilitate fast, convenient, efficient transport; and pedestrian and traffic linkages.


   Box 2-4	 Lessons from TOD success stories

   TOD is a high-value complement to mass transit development. Compact, mixed-use, high density development around key mass
   transit stations can have the dual benefits of creating a ridership base that enhances the economic and financial viability of the
   mass transit investment and compounding the accessibility benefits a mass transit system can bring to a city’s residents. The
   following are some lessons drawn from examples of successful TOD from around the world.

   First, realizing TOD requires coordinated efforts across multiple sectors and a series of inter-linked development phases,
   where attention to detail is crucial. TOD should ideally be an integral element in a city’s master plan. An urban design scheme for
   TOD would be contextual and consider various dimensions including integration with and access to the transit station, supporting
   a right mix of land uses and density, and the creation of a walkable, human scale environment around it. Getting TOD right is often
   about getting the details right: for example, planners in Singapore often reserve direct pedestrian links to the entrances/exits of
   stations, guiding pedestrian circulation through sheltered walkways.

   Second, successful TODs require not only the city’s support of high density, mixed use development around transit, but also
   prioritizing the development of these areas over others in the metropolitan area. In the best scenario, this priority is reflected in
   an urban growth pattern that mirrors the mass transport network, as in Curitiba, with little or no development outside the system.

Box 2-4	 Continued

Third, the transit accessibility of successful TODs has to be higher than auto accessibility. Achieving this requires a number of
deliberate actions: for example, Singapore’s transport and land use policies promote greater convenience and lower cost for public
transport than driving; London and Boston reduced the amount of parking spaces in downtown buildings to prioritize public transport.

Fourth, implementing successful TOD requires strong legal backing, sound financial planning and appropriate timing. At a tech-
nical level, it is necessary to formulate detailed development control guidelines and enforce such guidelines in a manner that is
transparent and consistent, yet not perceived to be overly burdensome. The legal environment is critical and defines the role that
the government plays beyond providing access to infrastructure and appropriate zoning. Financing considerations are also import-
ant. TOD offers a variety of land-value capture opportunities for recouping the financial costs of mass transit development such
as through joint development at stations; tax-increment financing; and selling air rights in up-zoned areas. However, experience
suggests that it is not easy to avoid conflicts of interest between financial gains for the public sector and safeguarding the interests
of area residents. Timing issues are also critical: the construction schedule of the transit station and the adjacent public infrastruc-
ture needs to be carefully coordinated with market demand and therefore, the release and development of land parcels around it.

Box 2-5	 Copenhagen 1946: A regional framework that anticipated transit-oriented development

A vision depicted by a memorable analogy. The regional plan for Greater Copenhagen was prepared on behalf of the Danish
Town and Planning Institute. Under the plan, commonly known as the Finger Plan, urban growth would be concentrated along five
corridors or “fingers” oriented toward historical villages in the periphery, while central Copenhagen, the palm of the hand, would
remain the principal regional center. The areas in between the “fingers” - “wedges” - were to remain as green areas. The intent
of the Finger Plan was to prevent sprawl, guiding growth along fingers, which would have a radial S-train line (the first opened
in 1934) running through them. Small independent communities of 10,000 inhabitants were planned for each “finger” with
commercial space, schools and other facilities built around stations, connected to the city core by the S-train. The regional scale
was remarkable at a time when planning was not geared toward such cross-municipal reach. Equally remarkable is that although
the Finger Plan was a non-binding and initially private document, the government’s role was critical to ensuring its success. The
government safeguarded the principle of coordinated land use and transport, and ensured its application in municipal plans. It
also created the conditions for land markets to develop along the axes established in the plan.

A precursor of coordinated land and transport planning. The Finger Plan has guided growth in the Copenhagen region for more
than 60 years. The use of rail infrastructure investment to steer growth to desired areas can be considered a precedent for TOD.
During the 1950s and 1960s, the population of Greater Copenhagen doubled and the built-up area expanded dramatically. The
principles of the Finger Plan were followed by other planning instruments, including the Outline Plan of 1960, which first intro-
duced the concept of multiple centers in the metropolitan area

In the 1970s, policies were included to ensure the conservation of the green wedges. The 1972 Structure Plan identified four new
nodal towns and the 1989 Regional Plan refined the concept of a multi-center structure by increasing investment to link the nodes.
The “fingers” have grown longer and tubbier than what was anticipated six decades ago, but the plan has been largely successful in
absorbing the growing population and continues to be relevant in the city’s highly functional structure today. The Danish national
government has been involved in developing a 2007 update of the Finger Plan, already enacted into a national directive. The prin-
ciples have been incorporated into national spatial planning, and local authorities are responsible for compliance.

85.	    In Johor Bahru, efforts have also begun to promote TOD. The Iskandar Regional Development Authority (IRDA) has
        developed plans to enhance regional and local public transport systems by initiating several projects, for example
        the high-speed rail network linking South Johor Economic Region (SJER) to Kuala Lumpur and the Light Rail Transit.
        Likewise, the current Penang state transport master plan also emphasizes TOD and transit corridors as a priority for
        the George Town conurbation. Sustained and integrated efforts by all relevant agencies at federal, state and local
        levels are needed to ensure the success of TOD plans in Johor Bahru and George Town.

86.	 Fiscal incentives are necessary to encourage the use of public transport and reduce reliance on private vehicles.
     International experience shows that urban areas shrink in size as transit subsidies increase, but they increase in
     size with auto subsidies. Instruments that take advantage of market mechanisms include: congestion charges or
     tolls, emission and/or pollution tax, fuel tax, vehicle tax and subsidies. Singapore, London, Amsterdam and Stock-
     holm have congestion tax schemes to reduce peak-time car traffic (World Bank 2009). These policies are imple-
     mented to promote the use of public transport which reduces congestion costs and increases liveability, eventually
     leading to higher productivity in cities. Hong Kong is a good example of a city where the use of public transport is
     encouraged (see Box 2-6).



   Box 2-6	 Mobility and density in Hong Kong

   In the second half of the 1970s, Hong Kong experienced real growth of about 10 percent a year, combined with an influx of immi-
   grants, and roaring demand for private cars. Car registrations more than doubled in a decade. The results were long commuting
   times for private cars and freight transporters; as well as health costs from air pollution. The Transport Department reacted with dra-
   conian measures. In 1979, it defined a transport policy to increase road capacity, and expand and improve the mass transit system.

   The government trebled the annual license fee for cars, doubled the first registration fee (to between 70 percent and 90 percent
   of the import price of a vehicle), and doubled fuel taxes. Private and public vehicle ownership fell quickly. In 1985, the share of
   private registered cars had fallen to 50 percent, 10 percent of these were taxis. The public transport system consists of a 74-kilo-
   meter underground mass-transit railway; a 34-kilometer heavy rail line (linking Kowloon with China); a 32-kilometer light-rail
   system in the northwest of the New Territories, and a 16-kilometer tram on the northern side of Hong Kong Island. Five private
   bus companies operate franchised services with more than 6,000 buses. These are complemented by minibuses with fixed fares
   and exclusive rights to provide service on certain routes. Entry to this submarket is strictly regulated.

   Today, road charges in Hong Kong are seen as a device, not to reduce congestion, but to curtail air pollution and maintain the
   city’s attractiveness. Hong Kong ranks fifth in the infrastructure index of the Global Competitiveness Report, with a score of 6.2
   out of 7; it also ranks first in product market efficiency and financial market sophistication.

2.2.7	 Strengthened institutional capacity for more effective urban planning

87.	    Limited coordination across different levels of government contributes strongly to division in Malaysian cities.
        Chapter 4 discusses this in more detail (see Section 4.2.2.).

88.	    Implementation difficulties can contribute to inefficient land use in urban areas. The implementation of the National
        Land Code differs across states as land is a state matter (Article 74 of the Malaysian Constitution). There have
        been cases where a conflict of interest between federal and state authorities has led to unresolved cases of land
        acquisition for development, potentially restricting the supply of land for development purposes (see, for example,
        Omar 2002; Awang 2008).   Box 2-7 describes some of these implementation issues. Given that there are existing

  Box 2-7	 Land use inefficiencies due to institutional weakness

  State-level planning inefficiencies: The Town and Country Planning Act 1976 (TCPA) was established to integrate matters
  between the federal government and state authorities relating to town and country planning. In addition to the TCPA, the Local
  Government Act (1976) allows local authorities to control and guide land development. Section 18 of this Act stipulates that land
  development may be controlled and initiated through the formulation and identification of a “structure plan” and a “local plan.”
  The structure plans are the general proposals of the local government for the development and use of land in each state. They
  are normally prepared by the state-level offices of the Federal Town and Country Planning Department, and have to be adopted
  by the states. However, changes made by the states often create uncertainties in planning, giving rise to concerns among land
  developers (Usilappan 1994).

  Overlapping jurisdictions between the National Land Code (NLC) and the TCPA: The NLC and the TCPA govern the land devel-
  opment systems of Peninsular Malaysia. This means that there are two separate sets of legislation on land use and development
  control (Awang 2008), which has given rise to overlapping land use policies. One example is the case of Yow Chuan Plaza in Kuala
  Lumpur: a development plan was approved in contravention of the zoning plan. The land in question was zoned as a residential
  area under the TCPA, but the approval given by the Land Office under Section 130 of the NLC was for commercial use. Landowners
  may also experience conflict with planning law in terms of their right, under the NLC, to apply to the appropriate land office for
  conversion to a different land use. Some such applications could be contrary to the local plan because the NLC does not require
  the Land Office to take planning laws into consideration when an application for approval of a conversion is submitted19.

        Refer to “Conflict between land and planning legislation over land use and development control” (page 7) of Awang (2008)


         proposals to revise the National Land Code, the overarching priority in this regard is to ensure that the entire legal
         and regulatory framework is supportive of flexible land use in cities, and does not create unintended distortions
         such as those mentioned in this chapter.

89.	 Taking a metropolitan-wide approach to planning could enhance coordination across jurisdictions in a metropoli-
     tan area; in Malaysia’s case this spans several local authorities and sometimes more than one state. Section 4.3.1
     discusses metropolitan governance in further detail, stressing the importance of planning and coordination.

2.2.8	 Targeted interventions to formulate a more efficient system of cities

90.	 Malaysia needs to maximize productivity gains from agglomeration and economic specialization by managing its
     main metropolitan areas. Policymakers can treat their cities as a portfolio of assets, considering size, location, and
     density. Government interventions can be used to target a more efficient network of cities, and providing the right
     enabling conditions: more clustering of service- and knowledge-based sectors in large cities, and relocation of
     land-intensive manufacturing industry to smaller cities and towns.

91.	     Limits on industrial decentralization can hurt the economy; these limits can also lock cities into patterns of land
         use that are not environmentally sustainable. As industry leaves the urban core, city land should be redeveloped
         to accommodate firms in tradable services. Initiatives to repurpose old industrial districts typically include infra-
         structure redevelopment and projects to make the city’s spatial structure more efficient, livable, and sustainable.
         Experience from Barcelona (see Box 2-8) shows how the public and private sectors can work together to improve
         the industrial and spatial structure of a city.

92.	     In Malaysia, some policy initiatives have been developed to enable cities to realize their comparative advantages.
         Kuala Lumpur has focused the policy initiatives of its Structure Plan 2020 on strengthening its service- and knowl-
         edge–based sectors and promote urbanization economies, including:

                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                 2. Building Economically Competitive Cities  31 
        »» prioritize development in economic clusters, e.g. finance, business services, education, tourism, retail;

        »» develop amenities, enhance connectivity for these clusters;

        »» increase foreign investment by establishing incentive packages to attract multinational corporations and by
           using a specialized entity, InvestKL, to enhance institutional support;

        »» talent acquisition through overseas talent acquisition programs; strengthen the local talent base with an empha-

        »» increase livability by creating a comprehensive pedestrian network; developing an efficient solid waste manage-
           ment ecosystem; and increasing urban green space.

93.	    These policy incentives and interventions are already planned or implemented individually by cities or states. In
        order to form an efficient network of cities, policymakers at the national level need to play a role in coordination
        and integration.



   Box 2-8	 22@Barcelona: A best practice example and its possible demise

   How should cities manage the redevelopment of urban cores when industries move out? This was handled effectively in Barcelona
   by allowing businesses and residents to take the lead. Since the late 1990s the city of Barcelona has transformed itself, using its
   post-Olympics momentum to redevelop 180 hectares of city land that had been languishing under warehouses after industry left
   the area 20 years earlier. Led by the private sector and enabled by public policy, the redeveloped area is now home to more than
   1,500 companies, 10 universities with 25,000 students, 12 technology centers, and 3,000 new housing units for low-income
   residents.

   The project started as a government initiative to offer preferential real estate, an initiative that met with limited success. In 2004,
   the private sector entered, chiefly in four traded services: media, energy, medical technology, and information and communi-
   cations technology. These services already existed in Barcelona but were spread across the city. A market-induced relocation
   of interrelated activities allowed for rapid growth and attracted international companies. This was done without subsidies; the
   initiative employed a requalification mechanism that allowed private developers to convert industrial zoning to zoning with
   higher building ratios in exchange for returning 30 percent of the land to the city for green spaces, social housing, and technology
   centers in equal amounts (World Bank 2011).

   Key to the success of “22@Barcelona” was the project’s ability to include public and private sectors. Initial leadership, from the
   city’s mayor and the public sector, focused on restructuring poorly used space close to the city center. The danger, in the mature
   phase of such projects, is that the government may react to the initial success by attempting to replicate it in projects that it funds
   directly, without including the private sector.

32  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
3.	 CITY-LEVEL ANALYSIS AND POLICY REVIEW

3.1	 Introduction

94.	      Enhancing economic efficiency and fostering agglomeration economies relies on policies that treat cities as a portfolio
          of assets, each differentiated by characteristics that include size, location, and density of settlement. Three decades
          of worldwide research highlight the fact that businesses and people can exploit economies of scale and agglomera-
          tion if their settlements perform their intended functions (World Bank 2009). In practice this means the following.

          »» Towns and small cities should allow firms and farms to reap benefits from internal scale economies by provid-
             ing roads to move inputs and outputs, and by providing schools for workers’ families.

          »» Medium-size cities should allow producers to benefit from proximity to each other, this allows producers to
             choose workers and materials from a larger pool and creates beneficial competition as they can shop around.
             These are called localization economies.

          »» Large metropolises provide the urban diversity that can foster the exchange of ideas and technology to produce
             greater innovation and growth. This enables firms in different industries to share facilities or public goods, a
             wider variety of intermediate input suppliers, a larger pool of specialized workers, and risks. They provide what
             are called urbanization economies.

95.	      To this end, government policies can be oriented toward fostering a more efficient system of cities: more clustering
          of service- and knowledge-based sectors in large cities; and relocation of land-intensive manufacturing to smaller
          towns and cities. Investments in rural areas are also necessary for balanced development. In terms of the six Malay-
          sian cities covered in this study, Kuala Lumpur has the role of a large primary city; Johor Bahru and George Town
          are large but secondary cities; and Kota Kinabalu, Kuching and Kuantan are medium-size cities.20 Each city has its
          own comparative advantage and agglomeration economies, depending on size, location, and sectoral structure.
          The aim for policy-makers is to provide an enabling environment for each city to perform its intended function and
          to maximize benefits from agglomeration economies. Box 3-1 describes the experience of the Republic of Korea.


      Box 3-1	 The shifting role of major cities in Korea

      In the Republic of Korea, as rural-urban migration accelerated between 1983 and 1993, the share of national manufacturing
      employment in large cities like Seoul, Busan, and Daegu fell from 44 percent to 28 percent, while the share in small cities and
      rural areas rose from 26 percent to 42 percent. Rising labor and land costs drove labor- and land-intensive manufacturing indus-
      tries out of central Seoul. As manufacturing’s share in employment in Seoul fell from 32 percent in 1980 to 11 percent in 2010,
      the share attributable to the service sector rose from 58 percent to 81 percent. A tax credit for manufacturing firms that moved
      factories from Seoul to its suburbs and other cities incentivized the regional development plan.

      This categorization largely corresponds to the top two categories in Malaysia’s National Urbanization Policy (NUP): the National Growth
      Conurbation (Kuala Lumpur); and Regional Growth Conurbations (George Town, Johor Bahru and Kuantan). For the purposes of this report,
      the distinctions among the four other categories of smaller urban settlements in the NUP (Sub-regional Growth Conurbations; State Growth
      Conurbations; District Growth Conurbations; and Major and Minor Settlement Centres) are less marked, and such settlements can be
      collectively referred to as smaller towns and cities.


                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                           33 
96.	 Cities surrounded by large rural areas, such as Kuching, Kota Kinabalu and Kuantan, need common institutions
     for more efficient rural-urban transformations. Low-density areas should build economic density through stronger
     links between villages and towns. Policy priorities would be the provision of basic social services and the improve-
     ment of land markets. Regulations need to be versatile enough to facilitate efficient land-use conversion, and
     building standards should be enforceable without being overly restrictive. Flexible supply of land in these areas is
     essential for relocation of land-intensive manufacturing from larger cities to smaller cities.

97.	      For cities with intermediate urbanization, such as Johor Bahru and George Town, policy priorities need to include
          common institutions and connective infrastructure to increase density and reduce congestion. This includes pro-
          viding social services for rural and urban residents; ensuring fluid land markets; and investing in infrastructure
          in and around the growing city centers. Increases in congestion and therefore transport costs could undermine
          attempts to improve integration; connective infrastructure is essential to ensuring this integration.

98.	 Advanced, primary cities like Kuala Lumpur need institutions and infrastructure compatible with higher density
     and shorter distances. An inclusive mix of institutions, infrastructure and incentives is needed to improve livability,
     creativity and social integration. Successful metropolitan areas in both developed and developing countries have
     well-functioning land markets, representative management, state-of-the art transport infrastructure, and social
     policies to integrate low-income residents.

99.	 This chapter consists of individual sections focused on each of the six Malaysian cities. The basic analytical
     approach consists of the following three components.

          »» Economic analysis on growth, productivity, sector composition and specialization. This analysis includes an
             examination of trends over time, as well as benchmarks from comparable cities from around the world.

          »» Spatial analysis using GIS data on land use (e.g. residential, industrial, commercial) to show urban land use allo-
             cation as a function of distance from the city center. Given limitations in available data, the analysis is presented
             for four city areas: Greater Kuala Lumpur (the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur (FTKL), plus eight adjacent local
             authority areas in Selangor); Johor Bahru (all land within the conurbation boundary); George Town (land from the
             state of Penang only); and Kota Kinabalu (the DBKK-administered local authority area).21 A review of how land
             use patterns have changed over time is provided for FTKL and George Town only (owing to limitations in data
             availability) for 2000 and 2010. All data was based on current (“semasa”) land use data for the years in question.

          »» A review of existing city/local economic development strategies is provided for Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru and
             George Town, based on key findings of the economic and spatial analysis. This takes stock of development efforts
             and strategic priorities over the last decade, comparing strategies against measurable economic outcomes. The
             review attempts to evaluate the extent to which the strategies have achieved the intended results. Any discrepan-
             cies between intended plans and actual results are used to formulate suggested revisions to the cities’ strategic
             priorities. The results of this analytical exercise need to be validated through in-depth discussion and further
             analysis as needed.




21	
      The raw data for each of the four city areas had slightly different land use categories. For the analysis, these existing categories were
      grouped into a set of standard categories: Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Institutional, Public and Community Facilities, Infrastructure,
      Agricultural, Green/Open Space, Water Bodies, and Others. The relevant table in Annex 2 explains how the existing land use categories in
      each city were grouped.


34  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
3.2	 Greater Kuala Lumpur
3.2.1	 Economic performance and specialization

100.	 Over the last decade, Greater Kuala Lumpur strengthened its position as the economic center of Malaysia. Between
      2003 and 2012, the city’s economy grew at an average rate of two percentage points higher than the national econ-
      omy as a whole. Over the same period, the city’s economy created more than 750,000 new jobs. Per capita income
      in the city grew by more than 50 percent, and average income is currently more than 147 percent of the national
      average. This suggests that Kuala Lumpur remains the most attractive city for talent in Malaysia.

101.	 As part of the analysis, Kuala Lumpur was compared to other capital cities in small, upper middle-income and
      high-income countries with highly centralized economies (see Box 3-2 for an explanation of the selection of com-
      parator cities). While Kuala Lumpur has the lowest GDP per capita in the comparator group, it grew significantly
      faster than any of the comparators over the last four years, and weathered the global financial crisis much better
      (see Figure 3-1). For its level of development, Kuala Lumpur has shown high rates of growth (it lies above the trend
      line in Figure 3-2), while all other comparators in the region have been underperforming.


  Box 3-2	 Comparator selection for Kuala Lumpur

  Kuala Lumpur is the capital city and main economic hub of a relatively small but dynamic country. The most relevant comparators
  for Kuala Lumpur would be capital cities in small upper middle-income and high-income countries with highly centralized econ-
  omies. Most of the cities selected have completed the transition from industrial center to business services hub, which makes
  their experience directly applicable to Kuala Lumpur. Comparator cities were also selected from large metropolises in the East
  Asia region, given regional competition.

  The following cities were selected:
  a.	 Seoul – capital of the Republic of Korea and dominant city in the national economy. Seoul has led the county’s transition
      from low value-added to high value-added/high-tech manufacturing; R&D and business services.
  b.	 Shanghai – one of the largest cities in China, it has experienced sustained growth in recent decades. Its economy is largely
      driven by manufacturing, and the transition to business services is already taking place.
  c.	 Tokyo – the capital of Japan is widely recognized as one of the world’s global cities and an international financial capital. Tokyo
      accounts for 30 percent of Japan’s economy. According to a study by PriceWaterhouse Coopers, Tokyo is the largest urban
      economy in the world, although the city has experienced a lengthy stagnation in the last two decades, as has Japan as a whole.
  d.	 Hong Kong – one of the world’s leading financial centers, it has successfully transformed its economic structure from a
      manufacturing-intensive to a services-oriented economy. Key industries include consumer services, finance and business
      services, and high-tech manufacturing.
  e.	 Jakarta – the capital and largest city of Indonesia. Jakarta is one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world, and has
      outperformed Beijing and Kuala Lumpur in terms of economic growth. Its economy has been largely driven by the services sector.
  f.	 Bangkok – the capital and most populous city in Thailand. Its economy is mainly driven by trade, tourism, and lower val-
      ue-added manufacturing.
  g.	 Amsterdam – largest city/economic hub of the Netherlands. Considered one of the best European cities to locate an interna-
      tional business. Business services make up the core of the economy along with tourism.
  h.	 Santiago – capital of Chile and its dominant economic center. Santiago has led the country to high-income status. Home of
      the headquarters of large Chilean agricultural companies, copper producers and other mining companies, it is also a vibrant
      business services economy. Since the early 1990s, the city has successfully implemented regeneration initiatives and busi-
      ness development programs; it also invested in infrastructure, which helped it diversify away from traditional manufacturing
      sectors into business and consumer services.
  i.	 Vancouver – the economic center of the west coast of Canada: the city has been widely recognized as one of the most livable
      cities in the world. It has achieved impressive rates of growth through attracting talent and building on skills and a high level
      of entrepreneurship in the local economy.

36  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
102.	 The industrial structure of Kuala Lumpur’s economy has not changed much in the last ten years, although the city
      has been undergoing a process of gradual deindustrialization. Manufacturing and construction still constitute the
      largest share of gross value added (GVA), although this has declined by 3.5 percentage points over the decade (see
      Figure 3-3). Financial and business services have outgrown the rest of the economy, adding 1 percentage point to
      their GVA share. The transport and communications sector, including the ICT industry, have also grown. The contri-
      bution of public services and consumer services to the economy remained relatively stable over the same period.

103.	 The gradual shift towards tradable services is more evident in the employment structure. As industry and consumer
      services have seen their share of employment decrease, employment in financial and business services has grown
      from 13.5 percent to 16 percent and in the transport and communications sector it has grown from seven percent
      to 10.5 percent.

104.	 Greater Kuala Lumpur’s development potential lies in its role to serve as an interlocutor between Malaysia and
      the global economy. As Malaysia’s largest city with a population of more than 6 million, Kuala Lumpur’s economy
      should ideally be service-dominated with high economic density and strong diversity. Relative to other Malaysian
      cities, Kuala Lumpur has a strong services sector, especially in financial and business services, which accounts
      for 24 percent of city GDP (see Figure 3-4). This growth in services such as legal, banking or insurance should be
      encouraged in Kuala Lumpur.

105.	 The degree of specialization in financial and business services in Greater Kuala Lumpur is low in relation to interna-
      tional comparators (see Figure 3-5). The mining and extraction, manufacturing, utilities and construction category
      still represents a large share of the economy, especially when compared to other large cities in the region. Kuala
      Lumpur has a lower share (31.2 percent) of these industries than Jakarta or Bangkok where the share is 41 percent
      and 37 percent respectively. Their share is greater than in Seoul and Hong Kong where this industry accounts for
      less than 10 percent of GDP.23 Kuala Lumpur has the one of the highest shares of industry in the global comparator
      group, and a relatively low share of financial and business services (Figure 3-5).

      Singapore also has a relatively high industrial share in its economy. About 28 percent of Singapore’s GDP comes from industry, and it
      employs a fifth of the workforce. The petrochemical industry is very important for the economy in Singapore as it has the third largest oil
      refinery in the world, behind Rotterdam and Houston. Singapore places great emphasis on high-end manufacturing: semi-conductors and
      consumer electronics, as well as machinery, transport equipment, and ships. The government is fostering future growth in sectors such as
      aerospace, precision engineering, and life sciences. Source: InterNations.org 2015; EconomyWatch.com 2015

106.	 Figure 3-6 shows economic sector specialization in Greater Kuala Lumpur against the rates of economic growth in
      those sectors as measured by share of GDP from 2005 to 2013. In 2013 Kuala Lumpur focused on communication
      services, business and professional services, and hospitality. Personal services like private clinics and counseling
      were among the fastest growing industries in terms of share of GDP from 2005 to 2013. These services are in the
      top right-hand quadrant under: “growing” sectors, and indicate the trend towards tradable services.

107.	 Productivity is crucial to Kuala Lumpur’s economic competitiveness but it continues to lag most comparators.
      Output per worker is 50 percent lower than in Seoul and Taipei, and 20 percent lower than in Santiago. Figure
      3-7 shows that gross value-added per worker in industry is around USD 36,000 (2012 constant prices) in Kuala
      Lumpur, while it is around USD 70,000 in Singapore and USD 96,000 in Tokyo. This figure is only around USD
      47,000 for financial and business services, compared to USD 107,000 in Singapore and USD 237,000 in Tokyo.
      Productivity in other services is also significantly lower than other large East Asian cities. Low productivity in pub-
      lic services is particularly evident.

108.	 The Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2020, from 2000, indicated that Kuala Lumpur would benefit from growth in the
      services and innovation sectors; it recommended that more traditional industries move to smaller cities and towns.
      Recent growth trends and productivity analysis confirm that this remains a feasible track.

109.	 Kuala Lumpur has potential to become a world-class business center. Ranked 18th in the World Bank’s Doing
      Business Report (World Bank 2015b), Kuala Lumpur has performed well in providing an attractive environment for
      business. Despite this, its performance falls below the East Asian average in property registration (see Table 3-1),
      even though online stamping to reduce the time and cost to transfer property was introduced in 2005 (World Bank
      2015b).

3.2.2	 Land use and spatial structure

110.	 Spatial analysis was undertaken using current (“semasa”) land use data for Greater Kuala Lumpur, consisting of
      FTKL and eight local authority areas in Selangor, for 2008-2010.26 This area lies entirely within the Kuala Lumpur
      conurbation boundary. Figure 3-8 shows how land use in the Greater Kuala Lumpur area is allocated; overall, FTKL
      is mostly urbanized but other parts of the Greater Kuala Lumpur area retain a lot of green/open space and agricul-
      tural land, especially in outlying areas. Most land in some local authority areas in Selangor is green/open space or
      agricultural.

111.	 Spatial analysis was conducted with 1km radial buffer zones from the center of Kuala Lumpur, as illustrated in
      Figure 3-9 (Greater Kuala Lumpur) and Figure 3-10 (the central area of Kuala Lumpur).

112.	 Figure 3-11 and Figure 3-12 present the percentages and absolute areas of land use by category for each 1km buffer
      zone in Greater Kuala Lumpur for 2008 - 2010. These charts identify key features of the land use pattern:

          »» Commercial land use is concentrated in the central part of the city, accounting for over 20 percent of land in the
             first 1km buffer zone; it diminishes very quickly as distance from the city center increases, and accounts for only
             four percent of land in the 5km buffer. This is in line with the usual land use pattern seen in other cities around
             the world: land close the city center has the highest rent per km2, and is usually allocated to commercial use as
             this generates the highest return per km2.

          »» A large share of land close to the city center is occupied by institutions: more than 40 percent within the first
             1 km buffer zone, and 23 percent in the 3 km buffer zone. This makes the share of land for institutional use higher
             than that for commercial use in most parts of the city. Since public services account for a small share of GDP with
             relatively low productivity, alternative uses for current institutional land in the high value zones closest to the
             city center could lead to higher economic density and productivity27.

          »» A lot of land close to the center of Kuala Lumpur is used for residential purposes, it accounts for the largest share
             of land use between the 3km and 9km buffer zones. The efficiency of this land use depends on the nature of the
             residential areas: high density residential, as reflected by high plot ratios, can be commensurate with the high
             value of land and is well-suited to mixed-use development and a more compact urban form. The standard urban
             economics model suggests two fundamental mechanisms in this regard. First, when choosing where to live,
             households make a trade-off between proximity to the city center and real estate prices, or size of dwelling; sec-
             ond, project developers, or landowners, maximize their profits and choose the quantity and density of housing

      For FTKL, land use data provided by DBKL were for the years 2000 and 2010; for Selangor, land use data provided by JPBD Selangor were
      for 2002 and 2008. For analytical purposes, the 2000 DBKL and 2002 Selangor land use maps were merged as one time point, as were the
      2010 DBKL and 2008 Selangor land use maps.

      Further analysis of this issue would require a case by case consideration of specific institutional sites, which is beyond the scope of this
      study.

           choose to build.

        »» Green/open space accounts for a significant proportion of land near the city center – around 22 percent of land
           within a 3km radius of the center. These areas may offer potential for more efficient land use, as discussed in
           section 3.2.3.

113.	 Changes in land use between 2000 and 2010 were analyzed for FTKL. Figure 3-13 summarizes the overall changes
      and Figure 3-14 presents these changes in 1km buffers. Figure 3-16, Figure 3-17 and Figure 3-18 display these
      changes in residential, commercial and industrial land.

114.	 Key features of the changes in land use in FTKL for 2000 to 2010 can be summarized as follows:

                 »» Residential use has decreased substantially, and is most evident close to the city center. Some of this decrease
                    in residential use appears to have made way for institutional use. Population density and the intensity of resi-
                    dential land use increased over this period; the population of FTKL grew from 1.31 million to 1.63 million. Over
                    this period also, the population growth rate in Selangor was higher than that of FTKL, meaning that overall urban
                    population growth in Greater Kuala Lumpur was distributed over a wider area and not concentrated near the
                    center.

                 »» The use of land for institutional purposes has increased substantially; it has also increased for commercial pur-
                    poses, but to a lesser extent.

                 »» There has been a large decrease in green/open space, mostly within the 5km to 13km buffer zones. Green/open
                    space has increased in the 3km buffer zone. In some cases the decrease in green/open space only reflects a
                    change in land use classification from 2000 to 2010 where pre-existing water bodies had been classified as
                    green/open space in 2000, and then corrected in 2010.

                 »» Industrial land use showed very little change, with only a minor decrease. Figure 3-17 shows that land classified
                    as industrial remained almost the same from 2000 to 2010.

3.2.3	 Low-use land in central Kuala Lumpur

115.	 For a city of its size, Greater Kuala Lumpur has low density, in population terms and economic terms. The average
      population density for all urban areas with populations greater than 100,000 in East Asia was around 5,800 peo-
      ple per km2 in 2010; this figure was almost 6,700 people per km2 for urban areas in the same population class as
      Kuala Lumpur, i.e. those with between 5 and 10 million people. The equivalent figure for the Kuala Lumpur urban
      area28 was just 3,300 people per km2 (World Bank 2015).

116.	 One cause of this low density may be the underutilization of land in the central areas of the city. Initial analysis
      of land use data from 2010 revealed that there were 13,838 parcels of land labeled ‘undeveloped’ within a 10 km
      radius of the city center, an area of 31,160 ha. These parcels covered 3,271 ha: almost 12 percent of this area. Upon
      closer inspection, some of these land parcels were found to be of no actual concern. A few of these have recently
      been developed, e.g. the site of the new Istana Negara, Desa Park City, etc. Several other tracts of land labeled as
      undeveloped appear to have been subdivided among multiple owners and are being prepared for development.
      Elsewhere, a few large undeveloped areas are too steep to be built on, e.g. Bukit Dinding, and hilly areas in Mela-
      wati and Taman Connaught.

117.	 Unlike many other East Asian cities, Kuala Lumpur has a large amount of open space close to the city center. Nearly
      half the land within 1 km of the city center is used by institutions, or is designated open/recreational space. Many
      of these serve as public amenities, and need not be developed. Others are unlikely to be redeveloped due to their
      civic importance. As so much central land in KL is open or sparsely developed, it is important to develop it to its full
      potential to improve production and economic density.

118.	 Examples of areas near the city center that appear to be under suboptimal use include:
          »» The Chan Sow Lin industrial area adjacent to the Bandar Malaysia site, zoned for light industrial use with a max-
             imum plot ratio of 2. The development plans for Bandar Malaysia suggest that an alternative, higher value use
             for this industrial area should be considered.

          »» Jalan Semarak, between Jalan Tun Razak and the DUKE highway: this area features substantial parcels of low
             density institutional land within 5km of the city center, currently occupied by institutions such as the Ministry
             of Defense and universities. It appears that there are some plans for development in this area, for example for
             the Pulapol site.

          »» Golf courses: RSGC and KLGCC are within 4km and 7km of the city center, respectively.

          »» The University of Malaya campus, within 5km of the city center.

          »» Malay Reserve Land in the Penchala area, which is sub-divided into individually-owned parcels, mostly unde-
             veloped and vacant, it is zoned for residential use (see Figure 3-18). It should also be noted that this terrain is
             mostly steep, limiting its development potential.

          »» Large cemeteries around Bukit Petaling/behind the former Istana Negara, within 3km of the city center and also

      The study from which these population density figures are drawn used a spatial definition of the ‘Kuala Lumpur urban area’ based on built-
      up areas as observed in satellite imagery, this is slightly different from the areas defined as Greater Kuala Lumpur and the Kuala Lumpur
      conurbation.


                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                        3. City-level Analysis and Policy Review  49 
        The potential for the development or redevelopment of sites like these should be considered, although for some
        types of sites such as Malay Reserve Land or cemeteries, this may be very difficult or impossible. Singapore offers
        an example of how old cemetery areas can be freed up for development.

119.	 In light of the above, key policy and planning questions for Greater Kuala Lumpur currently relate to the types and
      quantity of development on land near the city center. Given the existing ample supply and pipeline of commercial
      space (office, retail etc.), as well as the current issues around housing affordability, there is scope for ensuring the
      adequate supply of housing for middle and lower-income households, including within FTKL. A detailed discussion
      of housing issues, however, is beyond the scope of this study.

120.	 Another possible consideration would be pursuing a more polycentric, rather than monocentric, urban form. Box
      3-3 discusses some examples of polycentric urban form, and its advantages and disadvantages.

3.2.4	 Review of the development strategy

121.	 In 2000, Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2020 was developed. This comprehensive strategy document combined
      aspects of economic and social development of the city, identified key growth areas across the city, and outlined
      implementation structures and actions required. Although the Structure Plan recognized that it was premature
      for Kuala Lumpur to aspire to be a global city, it declared a focus on export-oriented industries for the city, and
      an ambition for greater integration into international markets and supply chains. This ambition was based on the
      recognition of Kuala Lumpur’s main competitive advantages: highly skilled labor, a major hub airport, a rapidly
      developing port, and successful trade and finance liberalization reforms.

122.	 The economic ambitions of the strategy were defined separately for the city center and the broader conurbation of
      Kuala Lumpur.
        »» Central Kuala Lumpur was supposed to prioritize HQ activities; financial and business services; high-end retail
           and tourism services; cultural activities; education, and high-tech manufacturing activity. These priorities were
           earmarked for the areas identified as part of the Multimedia Super Corridor.

50  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
  Box 3-3	 Polycentric Urban Form

  A polycentric city traditionally has a central business core as well as some combination of a secondary business core, a tertiary
  business core and inner and outer edge cities (Lin et al 2010). Over time and as their size grows, most monocentric cities begin
  to exhibit a degree of polycentrism (Bertaud 2003). This box presents information on several cities which have been able to
  increase economic efficiency by moving away from a monocentric to a polycentric urban model.

  Examples of Polycentric Cities:
  1.	 The Boston metropolitan area is a good example of polycentrism promoting innovation and hi-tech manufacturing as well
      as research and design for many industries, in several city centers. Greater Boston comprises the central city of Boston, as
      well as several surrounding cities, including Providence, Worcester, Manchester, Lowell and Cambridge. All together they are
      home to more than a half-dozen distinct industries, and the overall economy has benefited greatly from the large and diverse
      labor force and from agglomeration economies.
  2.	 Seoul is one of the clearest examples of a planned polycentric city in Asia and supports many new employment centers in the
      form of outer edge cities. In the 1980s, several new town projects in the Seoul capital region were planned and executed by
      the government, to provide affordable and social housing for the large influx of population following industrialization. After
      the Asian financial and economic crisis of 1998, the development of new town projects has primarily been led by the private
      sector (Lee et al 2012). The new town projects now being developed are both closer to old central Seoul, and have developed
      without the hollowing out of inner central Seoul. The efficiency of Seoul’s public transit system has been a strong factor in
      the economic vibrancy of the vast metropolitan area.
  3.	 Hangzhou, a mid-size city of about 4.19 million people, has evolved as an example of polycentric development over the last
      two decades. Hangzhou has a multi-functional main city center and three sub-centers (Xiasha - a hi-tech zone, Jiangnan -
      industrial and commercial zone, and Linping - industrial city). There are four state economic zones where foreign firms can
      enjoy cheaper facilities, less congestion and lower costs. The move towards a polycentric form has enabled the growth of
      complementary industry agglomerations as well as changed population densities in the various sub-centers (Yue et al 2009).

  Advantages and Disadvantages:
  The chief advantage of the polycentric urban form is that land prices fall on average leading to a more universal spread of rents
  and potentially better access to housing for the city’s vulnerable poor (Bertaud 2003). In addition, it can help to revitalize ailing
  neighborhoods by an investment in services and potential commercial centers.

  The main disadvantage is that labor markets tend to fragment and thus one of the primary benefits of scale from agglomeration
  is lost. However, there are attendant competitive advantages with localized access to specialized and skilled work forces in each
  sub-center or business core. Finally, it is much harder to create and maintain high quality, public transport networks for polycen-
  tric cities (Bertaud 2003) and control emissions.

  Key Takeaways:
  It is important to note that to promote a polycentric urban form significant investment in urban services is required as well as
  strong support for infrastructure and transportation (Bertaud 2003). Polycentric cities require specialized transport structures
  which promote ease of access to each business core while also allowing for linkages across the entire metropolitan area. They
  are also well suited to transportation networks with high private car usage (like many American cities with large suburbs). While
  there is some evidence that polycentric cities lead to shorter travel times (Lin et al 2010), it is also undoubtedly true that actual
  commuting volumes are far higher, reinforcing the need for well-planned transportation networks.



      »» For the rest of the Kuala Lumpur area, the priorities were federal and state government services; logistics activ-
         ities; education; recreation; and a wide range of industrial facilities.

123.	 The key economic targets identified for Kuala Lumpur supported the general idea of building a diversified economy
      that builds on its core advantages and aims to gradually move up the value-added ladder. According to the sector
      level targets, by 2020 Kuala Lumpur was supposed to become:


                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                  3. City-level Analysis and Policy Review  51 
        »» A leading center of the knowledge-based economy;

        »» An international commercial & financial center (by focusing on attracting large international companies);

        »» An attractive tourist destination;

        »» An international shopping center;

        »» A major meeting, incentive, convention and exhibition (MICE) center;

        »» A dynamic cultural and entertainment center;

        »» A regional educational and health center;

        »» A city with a revitalized manufacturing sector.

124.	 The spatial development strategy for the center of Kuala Lumpur focuses largely on mixed use development and on
      ensuring that the residential component remains strong. This priority was driven by the idea that further concen-
      tration of office-based activities in the city center along with suburbanization of residential areas may put too much
      stress on the transport system and make the core city less attractive or livable. Meanwhile, the land use analysis
      has shown that while the Plan envisioned large residential development projects, FTKL actually lost residential
      land between 2000 and 2010, especially in areas close to the city center. While the intensity of residential land use
      in FTKL increased during the same period, it is important to note that many residential projects, especially those
      not targeted at high-income households, have occurred mostly outside FTKL.

125.	 The Greater Kuala Lumpur and Klang Valley area was identified as one of the 12 national key economic areas
      (NKEAs) in the Economic Transformation Program (ETP) (Pemandu 2012) in 2010. As a part of this strategy, a much
      more ambitious strategy for development was presented. By 2020, Greater Kuala Lumpur aims to be among the 20
      fastest-growing and most livable cities in the world; and the priority sectors were more narrowly defined: financial
      services, business services, education, tourism and retail. Four key challenges were identified:
        »» strong regional competition in target industries;

        »» relatively poor livability performance (79th in the EIU livability rankings);

        »» poor public transport; and

        »» under-utilization of natural assets.

126.	 The following two key economic goals were set out for the city.
        »» Attracting 100 of the world’s most dynamic firms, with a focus on large companies in financial and business
           services; and ICT and related activities. Greater Kuala Lumpur’s value proposition was identified as having a
           strong talent base with high English proficiency; a strategic location at the heart Asia; superior infrastructure; a
           lower cost of living compared to competitor cities such as Singapore and Hong Kong; and a livable environment.
           Malaysia will also need to see significant improvements in order to increase its competitive edge, especially in
           the ease of doing business, e.g. as measured by number of days required to start a business; corporate tax rates;
           and investor protection indexes.




52  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
          »» Attracting the right mix of internal and external talent, including an increase in the foreign-born population of
             the city from 9 percent to 20 percent. The set of actions also includes schemes to attract and support relocation
             of skilled Malaysians from around the world back to the country, and to attract qualified expatriates through
             relaxing immigration regulations and associated schemes.

127.	 Other key objectives include.
          »» Building the high speed rail link to Singapore.

          »» Building an integrated urban rapid mass transit system.

          »» Large scale revitalization, greening; and schemes to create iconic places.

          »» Developing an extensive pedestrian network.

          »» Developing an efficient solid waste management system.

128.	 The NKEA strategy for Greater Kuala Lumpur presents an almost perfect example of a well-developed, ambitious,
      yet actionable strategy document for a city’s development. It covers most of the main aspects of good practices
      in local economic development strategies: identification of enabling conditions; clearly defined targets; a robust
      monitoring and assessment framework; clear delegation of authority; assessments of the costs of initiatives and
      how these costs will be covered.

129.	 The 2010 strategy for Greater Kuala Lumpur is a more developed document than the 2000 strategy (the Kuala
      Lumpur Structure Plan 2020). A comparison of the city’s development trajectory in the two documents reveals
      significant shifts in thinking. The 2010 strategy is more ambitious; the vision has evolved to include the goal of
      becoming one of the fastest growing and most livable cities in the world. It is also more focused, with fewer priority
      sectors and more detail. As part of this shift, the focus on development of the manufacturing and logistics sector
      was dropped, as emphasis is placed on financial and business services and regional corporate HQ activities.

130.	 A key challenge related to the focus on financial and business services is that these sectors are largely demand
      driven. Their growth relies on a vibrant, rapidly growing real sector. Each of the world’s financial centers is a hub
      that services a large manufacturing region: New York City for the US, London for Europe, Hong Kong for China, and
      Singapore for Southeast Asia. It would be very difficult for Kuala Lumpur to rival Singapore as the main services
      hub in in the region, as such local financial and business services will be reliant on the Malaysian economy and on
      local demand.


3.3	 Johor Bahru Conurbation

3.3.1	 Economic performance and specialization29

131.	 Johor Bahru experienced moderate economic growth from 2003 to 2012. Based on Oxford Economics data, the
      city’s GDP increased by 50 percent as the city’s population grew by 15 percent. In fact, in 2012 the core city of Johor
      Bahru accounted for a slightly smaller share of the national GDP compared to 2003, at 3.68% (see Figure 3-19).

29	
      The Oxford Economics database used for economic performance in this report appears to use a narrow spatial definition of Johor Bahru,
      smaller than the area of the Johor Bahru conurbation or the Iskandar Malaysia region. Therefore, all statements based on the Oxford
      Economics data should be read with this understanding.

                                       Per capita income in the city remains below the national average, and over the past decade the city has fallen fur-
                                       ther behind. In 2012, the average income in Johor Bahru was 20 percent lower than it was nationwide. This can be
                                       partially explained by lower overall labor productivity in Johor Bahru, which is discussed further below.30

132.	 Figures on economic output for the Iskandar Malaysia region, for the period 2005-2013, were obtained from IRDA,
      based on the Johor State Economic Report 2013/2014 and data from the Malaysian Department of Statistics. The
      overall pattern of economic performance is consistent with that of the Oxford Economics data as illustrated in
      Figure 3-19: the growth of Iskandar Malaysia’s economy closely tracked growth of the national economy during
      that period. During this period, the Iskandar Malaysia region’s share of national GDP also remained quite stable,
      at around 6.3% in both 2005 and 2013; this contribution to GDP is significantly higher than shown in the Oxford
      Economics data.

133.	 Johor Bahru’s sectoral GDP shares have relied heavily on industry and consumer services over the past decade (see
      Figure 3-20). In 2003, industry’s share of city GDP was 49 percent, much higher than any other sector, followed
      by consumer services at 20 percent. By 2012, industry had dropped to about 38 percent, as the share of consumer
      services had grown to around 28 percent. The shares of financial and business services, as well as transport and
      ICT, remained static at around the 10 percent level or below.

134.	 In a similar fashion, employment has been dominated by industry and consumer services at 34 percent and 33
      percent respectively (figures for 2012). The share of employment in industry declined by 20 percent and that of
      employment in consumer services grew by 22 percent from 2003 to 2013. Employment in financial and business
      services, and transport and ICT remained almost unchanged at 10 percent and 7 percent respectively for 2012 (see
      Figure 3-20).

      Based on Oxford Economics data. GDP and employment data, from which productivity is derived, are location-based, and would not
      include the output of Johor Bahru residents who commute daily to jobs in Singapore. Per capita income data are based on households, and
      household incomes of daily commuters to Singapore should include the income that they earn from jobs in Singapore.

135.	 Johor Bahru’s economic productivity is still relatively low. Gross value-added per worker is only around USD 20,000
      in financial and business services. In consumer services this figure stands at less than USD 15,000 and it is around
      USD 10,000 in public services. In all three cases this is lower than the average of the six selected Malaysian cities
      (see Figure 3-21). Johor Bahru’s industrial productivity ranks lowest among the six cities with a gross value-added
      of less than USD 20,000. Agricultural productivity is the highest among all sectors in the city (Figure 3-21), and has
      the city’s highest growth rate (Figure 3-20).

136.	 Figure 3-22 shows the degree to which Johor Bahru specializes in various sectors of economic activity. This is
      compared to the rates of growth of these sectors nationally as measured by share of GDP. In 2012, Johor Bahru spe-
      cialized in communication services, business and professional services, and hospitality. It also focused on social
      services like private community clinics and counseling. These sectors were among the fastest growing industries at
      the national level as measured by share of GDP from 2005 to 2013.

56  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
137.	 Johor Bahru is in a unique position because of its proximity to Singapore. As part of the analysis, Johor Bahru
      was benchmarked against other cities located close to larger urban centers but separated from them by national
      borders. This was also done with city pairs, i.e. Johor Bahru and Singapore against other city pairs, to show the
      relationship between the city and its larger neighbor as well as the actual dynamics of the city. See Box 3-4 for a
      description of the comparators.

138.	 The key benchmarking findings include:

      »» Johor Bahru lags Singapore on GDP per capita by a large margin. Among the comparator city pairs, only Tijuana
         and San Diego are further apart (Figure 3-23). In recent years GDP per capita in Johor Bahru has grown at a slower
         rate than in Singapore, suggesting that Johor Bahru is not taking full advantage of its proximity to Singapore. By
         comparison, growth in Shenzhen and Bratislava comfortably outpaced their larger neighbors over the same period.

      »» Johor Bahru suffers from low labor productivity, with the lowest level of all comparator cities. In terms of relative
         position, only Tijuana is further behind its rich neighbor San Diego.

      »» Johor Bahru has the lowest per capita disposable income of the comparator cities. However, its average annual
         GDP growth rate of 14 percent from 2008 to 2012 means it is catching up with Singapore, which averaged only
         6 percent over this period.

      »» An analysis of Johor Bahru’s comparators and their larger neighbors reveals how economies of co-located cities
         are connected (Figure 3-24):
         •	 Bratislava and Vienna have similar industrial structures, which suggests limited interdependence.
         •	 Shenzhen is predominantly industrial, while Hong Kong has a larger share of financial and business services
            and consumer services. Shenzhen leverages Hong Kong’s services to attract industrial investors by offering
            lower costs.
         •	 Tijuana has both a larger industrial share and a larger share of consumer services compared to San Diego
            which specializes in finance and business. Tijuana’s economy thrives on manufacturing for the North Ameri-
            can market as well as being a recreational destination for San Diego residents.
         •	 Johor Bahru/Singapore is most similar to Tijuana/San Diego; Johor Bahru has a higher share of industry than
            Singapore as well as a higher share of consumer services.
         •	 Over the past decade, Johor Bahru has been deindustrializing and consumer services have been the main
            source of growth, signaling that the city is becoming even less like Shenzhen.

139.	 As the examples of comparator cities have shown, Johor Bahru could avail of several options to leverage its proximity
      to Singapore. Different approaches would exploit the city’s comparative advantages: land availability, cheaper labor,
      lower-cost housing, all of which could help promote new industries. A strong understanding of the economic dynamics
      of both cities is essential to finding the most productive direction for Johor Bahru’s economic development.

140.	 Deepening the economic integration and complementarity between Singapore and Johor Bahru/Iskandar Malaysia
      may generate economies of scale which could boost the business ecosystem and productivity for both regions. Evi-
      dence shows that increasing economies of scale and agglomeration produces dividends that neither city would be
      able to achieve alone. Singapore is constrained by lack of land and a higher cost of labor, while Johor Bahru/Iskan-
      dar Malaysia lacks advanced technology and managerial know-how (Bhaskaran 2009). Productivity is improved
      when skills, knowledge and ideas are mobile and thus transferable. This complementarity then helps to strengthen
      the economies of both cities (World Bank 2009).

      a.	 Shenzhen - one of the leaders of economic transformation in China in the 1980s. Close to Hong Kong, the city was the first Spe-
          cial Economic Zone (SEZ) established in China. Shenzhen benefited from agglomeration economies; access to a large market;
          the port and advanced services that Hong Kong could provide. Today, the city is one of the main industrial centers of China.
      b.	 Bratislava - the capital city of Slovakia is a 30-minute drive from Vienna, Austria. It was one of the fastest growing urban econ-
          omies in central Europe in the 2000s; the economy is driven by the automotive sector; public services; and a large tradable
          services sector including IT and telecoms sectors. The extent to which Bratislava benefited from proximity to Vienna is unclear;
          however access to the Austrian market and Vienna’s airport likely had a positive impact.
      c.	 Tijuana – in northern Mexico, across the border from San Diego, California. Following the introduction of NAFTA32, Tijuana
          attracted a lot of manufacturing, mainly in the form of assembly plants. This was mainly because of its proximity to the Califor-
          nian market and its relatively cheap labor force. Tijuana now also has clusters of high tech and telemarketing firms. Tourism,
          mainly from the United States, is another strong economic component of the city.

3.3.2	 Land use and spatial structure

141.	 Current (“semasa”) land use data for the Johor Bahru conurbation was used to produce spatial analysis for 201033.
      Figure 3-25 shows the various land uses in this area. This figure also shows the wide area, encompassing four
      administrative districts, for which land use data was obtained; spatial analysis was restricted to the area within the
      Johor Bahru conurbation boundary (the red line).

142.	 Figure 3-26 and Figure 3-27 present percentages and absolute areas of land use by category for each 1km buffer
      zone from Johor Bahru’s city center in 2010.34 Key features of the land use pattern include the following:

          »» Approximately 15 percent of the Johor Bahru conurbation is built-up; 52 percent is under agricultural use and 28
             percent is classified as green/open space. The remainder comprises residential, commercial and industrial land.

33	
      JPBD Johor provided land use data for Johor Bahru and Kulaijaya districts for 2004 and 2010; Kota Tinggi district for 2007; and Pontian
      district for 2008 and 2010. Therefore, the analysis was undertaken for the year 2010 only (using 2007 data for Kota Tinggi). Subsequently,
      IRDA also provided land use data for Iskandar Malaysia (i.e. the districts of Johor Bahru and Kulaijaya) for 2013, but the period 2010-2013
      was considered too short over which to compare changes in land use.
34	
      The land use data were also analyzed for the area of Iskandar Malaysia, the key differences from the area of the Johor Bahru conurbation
      being the inclusion of the whole of Kulaijaya district, and the exclusion of areas in Pontian and Kota Tinggi districts. The results do not
      differ much from what is shown in Figure 3-26 and Figure 3-27, since almost all of the built-up areas of Johor Bahru are included regardless
      of which areal definition is used.

                                   zone, which leaves eight percent for commercial use and 5 percent for residential use. It also absorbs at least
                                   25 percent of total land between the 2km and 5km buffer zones. As in Kuala Lumpur, it is likely that land use
                                   patterns are inefficient, especially given the high cost of land near the city center.

                                »» Similar to Kuala Lumpur and other Malaysian cities, there is a concentration of commercial land close to the city
                                   center, accounting for around 25 percent within the 2km buffer zone, this drops to less than seven percent for
                                   every buffer beyond 5km from the center. In terms of absolute area however, Sebana Cove Resort also shows up
                                   as a large area under commercial use in the far southwest of the conurbation.

                                »» Most residential land is within the 2km to 15km buffer zones, the highest share (about 44 percent) is at the 3km
                                   buffer. Residential areas appear to be located near industrial and commercial land, this allows more workers to
                                   live close to their jobs and helps to reduce commuting times.

3.3.3	 Review of the development strategy

143.	 A review of recent strategies for the development of the Johor Bahru area reveal that while the city has aimed to
      leverage its proximity to Singapore, the understanding of how that can be done has evolved over time. In 2006, an
      economic development strategy for the South Johor Economic Region was developed as a part of the Framework for
      Comprehensive Development of the Iskandar region (Iskandar Regional Development Authority 2006). The specific
      geographic definition of South Johor is somewhat different from the definition of the Johor Bahru conurbation, but
      both share the same key economic centers and can be compared effectively in this section.
144.	 The 2006 strategy emphasized the proximity to Singapore as a key comparative advantage of the Johor Bahru/
      Iskandar region. However, there are inconsistencies in how the strategy interprets this advantage and the ways it
      can be exploited. The strategy lists resource endowments (particularly land) and the lower cost of living as compar-
      ative advantages and this is seen as conducive to further development of chemical and food production industries,
      as well as the logistics industry. At the industry level, the strategy identifies the types of linkages between the
      economies of Johor Bahru and Singapore.

                              i.	 Vertical linkages – city-specialization on different activities within the same supply chain. Linkages are iden-
                                  tified in the electronics sector where greater skill- and knowledge-intensive activities take place in Singapore,
                                  while less-skilled work is outsourced to Johor Bahru.
                              ii.	 Vertical consumption linkages – activities that rely on the consumer power of the wealthier neighbor. The retail
                                   and entertainment sectors of Johor Bahru’s economy rely strongly on consumers from Singapore. Similar link-
                                   ages in food and agro-processing industries to supply Singapore’s supermarkets and restaurants could be
                                   developed further.
                              iii.	 Horizontal linkages – parallel development within complementary industries without a clear hierarchy of loca-
                                    tions in terms of value added or place in the supply chain. It is based on mutually enabling conditions, agglom-
                                    eration and scale economies. The main industries in this category are petrochemicals, oleochemicals, and
                                    parts of the food and agro-processing industries. These mostly rely on better access to natural resources,
                                    rather than on agglomeration spillovers from Singapore.


62  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
145.	 Johor Bahru’s main advantages are lower labor costs, a lower cost of living, and land availability; despite this and
      the fact that most dynamic industries rely on vertical linkages to Singapore, the 2006 strategy highlights horizon-
      tal linkages to support development of high tech industries. It suggests that development priorities for the local
      economy should go beyond the image of being a lower cost suburb of Singapore and identifies the following priority
      sectors for Johor Bahru: electronics, petrochemicals, food and agro-processing, logistics, tourism, health services,
      education services, financial services, and ICT.

146.	 The analysis of Johor Bahru’s economic performance in section 3.3.1 suggests that the actual development of the
      economy since 2006 has not followed the trajectory identified in the strategy. While the strategy expected Johor
      Bahru’s economy to grow by one-third between 2005 and 2010, it only expanded by 8 percent during that period
      (Oxford Economics 2012). High tech industries and high value added services have not yet become the expected
      driving forces of growth. Consumer services grew the most, suggesting that vertical and vertical consumption
      linkages to Singapore currently present greater potential for Johor Bahru than horizontal linkages. This time period
      also includes the global financial crisis of 2008-9, and it is difficult to identify those factors that contributed most
      to Johor Bahru’s relatively weak economic performance.

147.	 In 2010, the Tenth Malaysia Plan identified the Iskandar Malaysia region as one of the key growth engines of the
      country. This plan did not change the strategic economic priorities for the area from the 2006 strategy. The indus-
      tries identified as the core growth sectors were education, healthcare, finance, creative industries and tourism,
      which indicated a continued aspiration for exploiting parallel and horizontal, rather than vertical, linkages with
      Singapore. Manufacturing, property development and utilities were among the sectors that attracted the most
      investor interest, although these were not included as key priority sectors.

148.	 The Johor Bahru Vision 2020 plan, developed in 2014, maintains the sectoral preferences identified in the Tenth
      Malaysia Plan. The only noticeable change is a stronger focus on logistics, based on the ability to offer port and
      airport capacity to complement Singapore’s hub status and create a broader business ecosystem building on this
      complementarity. The declared specialization of flagship areas identified in the spatial development plan include
      the following.

      i.	 The City Center for financial and business services.
      ii.	 Nusajaya for consumer services, education and healthcare.
      iii.	 West Gate and East Gate for logistics and related industries
      iv.	 Airport City (Cyber City) focused on high tech industries and logistics.

      A review of recent key development projects underway in the five flagship areas confirms their overall specializa-
      tions according to the plan. There are also significant high end residential and mixed use developments in Johor
      Bahru that predominantly target wealthier Singaporeans.

149.	 Overall, Johor Bahru has pursued a relatively diversified economic development strategy in the past ten years. The
      city’s economic results suggest that sectors with lower business costs have experienced relatively fast growth.
      Consumer services, entertainment and logistics are among the most dynamic sectors. Significant growth was also
      registered in business services and communications sectors that rely less on demand from Singapore or land
      endowments.

150.	 One possible explanation for Johor Bahru’s relatively slow development over the last decade is the premature desire
      to shift to high-end and value-added services and innovative industries, without fully exploiting the opportunities

                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                          3. City-level Analysis and Policy Review  63 
        provided by lower cost land and labor compared to Singapore. In other words, this strategy focused on horizontal,
        rather than vertical linkages to Singapore. By comparison, the experiences of Shenzhen and Tijuana show how
        these cities progressed by leveraging the lower costs of doing business as their main comparative advantage.
        Cheaper labor and land were key drivers, and then these cities gradually upgraded to higher value-added activities,
        which are still far from dominant in either city.

151.	 Based on the experience of comparator cities, and the initiatives implemented so far in Johor Bahru, there appear
      to be at least three different avenues that Johor Bahru can pursue to better leverage its comparative advantages for
      economic outcomes, some of which are already being implemented.

        a.	 Consumer services and entertainment. Targeting the wealthier Singapore population. Shopping malls and
            entertainment parks like Legoland and the Angry Birds theme park are good examples; this category also
            includes hotels, restaurants and other tourist amenities.

        b.	 Finance and business services. Back-office and/or second office activities for Singapore-based firms. This
            should focus on relatively high value-added activities, that need to be in close proximity to the main offices in
            Singapore, but do not need to be in daily communication. This may include software and other product devel-
            opment, as well as back office functions that are relatively difficult to outsource to offshore locations. Good
            examples from the UK include Reading and Milton Keynes – two smaller cities in proximity to London, that have
            benefited from the relocation of services companies and corporate offices attracted by lower rents and more
            space. They also provide good access to central London.

        c.	 Manufacturing. Based on vertical linkages to Singapore and logistics. This is mostly based on the potential
            associated with the Tanjung Pelepas port and anticipates further expansion of the port. Singapore’s economy
            has a strong industrial component: 28 percent of GDP; it also has a concentration of petrochemical and high-
            end manufacturing, including: semi-conductors and consumer electronics; machinery; transport equipment;
            and shipyards. Given this proximity, Johor Bahru can take advantage of vertical linkages with Singapore, to
            eventually develop its own high value-added industries, based on its comparative advantages in land and
            labor. See the example of Shenzhen, China (Box 3-5).

152.	 The modest economic performance of Johor Bahru in recent years suggests that there is a need to review the eco-
      nomic development strategy and priorities for the city. It may be that the city needs to focus on supporting growth
      in sectors that rely more on vertical linkages with Singapore. Further analysis to identify the preferred development
      path could revisit Johor Bahru’s comparative advantages relative to Singapore. Any analysis should try to identify
      successful and failed initiatives as well as the most dynamically growing industries of the last five years; it should
      consider which sectors and activities could achieve the most sustainable returns in terms of competitiveness and
      economic growth.




64  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
      Box 3-5	 Shenzhen: Building Mutual Benefits on Both Sides of the River

      Shenzhen, the small hamlet that was transformed into a world-class producing city by adopting market-oriented reforms, took
      advantage of its proximity to Hong Kong. Research shows that Shenzhen’s economic takeoff was due in part to its low-cost, high-
      skilled labor, domestic market, and government policies, but that the key factor lies in its successful utilization of its geographic
      and cultural proximity to Hong Kong (Wu 1997). Shenzhen attracted capital investment by becoming the secondary factories hub
      for Hong Kong through channels including foreign direct investment (FDI). It also benefited from Hong Kong’s technology and
      managerial know-how (Wu 1997).
      Economic complementarity: Hong Kong has had a comparative advantage in capital; this is also the case for its production, man-
      agement, and marketing skills. Prior to the development of Shenzhen, it specialized in several manufacturing industries, includ-
      ing textiles, electronics, and machinery, with large trading partners across the globe. Shenzhen could offer Hong Kong abundant
      land and low-cost labor for expansion and this complementary development and division of labor led to dynamic economies of
      scale that were mutually beneficial (Wu 1997).
      Economic transformations in inter-territory development: As Shenzhen provided Hong Kong’s firms with cheap labor, thereby
      lowering production costs, Hong Kong was able to maintain its competitiveness in exports by relocating manufacturing activity
      to Shenzhen. In this way, both Hong Kong and Shenzhen experienced structural transformations of their economies (Wu, 1997).
      Liberal economic policy: Shenzhen’s leaders started to give businesses strong incentives to innovate, fostering private property
      rights and “matching price with quality” (Nee, Kang, and Opper 2007). Shenzhen quickly obtained world-class managerial and
      technical skills from its neighbor, adapted to international standards, and developed its own competitive advantages in the pro-
      duction of electronics and other appliances.
      Today, businesses in computers, communications equipment, electronics, and machinery are five times more concentrated in
      Shenzhen than in China as a whole. Shenzhen is home to some of China’s most successful firms, such as BYD and Huawei. Rapid
      economic change through urbanization has more than tripled incomes, from USD 4,000 in 2000 to USD 14,000 in 2010 (2005
      prices), surpassing Thailand and Indonesia, and making Shenzhen comparable to the Republic of Korea of the mid-1990s.

3.4.1	 Economic performance and specialization35

153.	 Despite being recognized as one of the leading hubs for electronics and high tech manufacturing, George Town’s
      economy has struggled in recent years, and has been weaker than the national average36. As shown in Figure 3-28,
      the city was kept pace with the national economy until the global financial crisis of 2008-9, when it suffered more
      than a 10 percent decline, with a weak recovery afterwards. The electronics industry has faced challenges in recent
      years, and other sectors of the local economy were unable to take its place as key drivers of growth.

154.	 Industrial activity has been the mainstay of the George Town local economy, although its share of output has
      declined from 55 percent in 2003 to 50 percent in 2012 (see Figure 3-29). The share of consumer services has
      remained quite stable, 20 percent in 2003 and almost 22 percent in 2012. Similar static patterns can be found
      in financial and business services, transport and ICT, and public services, each of which has maintained a share
      of around 10 percent. Industry also accounts for the largest share of employment in the economy at 35 percent
      in 2012, with consumer services slowly catching up, achieving 30 percent in 2012. The other sectors, including

      The Oxford Economics database used for economic performance in this report uses a narrow spatial definition of George Town. According
      to this definition, the population in 2012 was 533,000 which is roughly one-third of the population of the full George Town conurbation,
      which includes Penang Island, the mainland part of the state of Penang, and parts of the neighboring states of Kedah and Perak. Therefore,
      all statements based on the Oxford Economics data, and the conclusions based on these, can only be applied to the core city (roughly, the
      urbanized parts of Penang Island).

                            financial and business services, transport and ICT, and public services have retained similar proportions of the
                            employment share over the past decade. Industry and agriculture were the only sectors that managed to improve
                            their labor productivity during the period. Labor productivity in other sectors was stagnant, and in financial and
                            business services it dropped substantially after the financial crisis.

155.	 George Town’s industrial productivity is somewhat higher than Kuala Lumpur’s (see Figure 3-21). This can be
      attributed to its specialization in higher value added manufacturing, predominantly in electronics. It can also be
      attributed to the spatial concentration of industry, which leads to localization economies: a larger number of firms
      in the same industry and in the same place. Spatial proximity allows firms to stay abreast of market information,
      which is useful for negotiating with customers and suppliers. Clustered firms can also share a larger and more
      dependable pool of specialized labor. High-tech electronics assembly plants (such as Dell, Intel, Motorola, Agilent,
      Renesas, Osram, Plexus, Bosch and Seagate) located in the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone make up the core of
      the economy. Bayan Lepas has been recognized as one of the most successful export processing zones in the world,
      and its electrical and electronics (E&E) cluster was the most vibrant of the 10 clusters examined by UNIDO’s 2009
      Industrial Development Report (UNIDO 2012).

156.	 The benefits of localization economies are evident in three manufacturing sectors in George Town. As discussed in
      a 2010 World Bank report (Kharas et al 2010), E&E manufacturing; instruments manufacturing (including medical
      instruments) and pharmaceuticals (biotech) have estimated scale economies of 1.2, 1.12 and 1.31 respectively. The
      report notes that if these industries could be expanded, additional resources would be available for profits and
      wages, and to invest in innovation. These sectors could support sustained growth, even in middle-income areas
      where wages are relatively higher. At the same time, the product-space analysis for Penang, documented in the
      same World Bank report (Kharas et al 2010), shows ample opportunity to raise technological sophistication, espe-
      cially in electronics, engineering, and other high-technology industries.37

37	
      The concept of product space mapping is rooted in the hypothesis that a country’s capability to produce one good is somehow tied with the
      installed capability in the production of other similar goods. The concept of proximity is used to capture this intuitive idea that the ability
      of a country to produce one product depends on its ability to produce others (Hausmann and Klinger 2007).

157.	 Benchmarking George Town against global comparators can be a useful tool for identifying weaknesses in the
      economy. From an economic standpoint, George Town is defined by its dynamic and highly productive electronics
      manufacturing sector. It has therefore been benchmarked against selected comparators in middle-income coun-
      tries (with the exception of India) that have been successful in developing the electronics industry as the key driver
      of their local economy. See Box 3-6 for a description of the comparator cities.

158.	 The main benchmark findings include:

                                          »» In terms of GDP per capita, George Town is close to levels of most of its comparators, with the exception of Ban-
                                             galore which is currently at a lesser stage of development. However it is clear that George Town’s economy has
                                             been significantly weaker than its comparators over the last four years. Figure 3-30 shows that George Town was
                                             hit harder than its comparators by the 2008-9 global recession, and despite good performance in 2010, growth
                                             in 2011 and 2012 was lower than in all comparators except Tainan.

  Box 3-6	 Comparator selection for George Town

  a.	 Bangalore, India – a city widely recognized as the “Silicon Valley of India”. Bangalore has managed to create conditions
      (education system, infrastructure and regulatory environment) that fostered its transition towards the knowledge economy;
      development of the biggest ICT center in India; and helped it become one of the fastest growing cities in South Asia.
  b.	 Incheon, South Korea – historically a manufacturing city 40km from Seoul. Incheon turned itself around by developing a new
      area to step up in the manufacturing supply chain and support growth in the knowledge economy. It upgraded itself to the
      status of global city by investing and attracting knowledge institutions.
  c.	 Tainan, Taiwan, China – one of Taiwan’s secondary cities, Tainan became famous after an industrial zone, that was set up to
      promote high tech, high value added electronics manufacturing, became the first site in the world to produce liquid crystal
      displays that revolutionized the television and computer industries.
  d.	 Monterrey, Mexico – the third largest Mexican city, recognized as one of the best places to do business in Latin America.
      Traditionally Monterrey was an important manufacturing hub, producing steel, cement, glass and auto parts. Since the mid-
      1990s the city has been able to convert the post-NAFTA boom in traditional industries into high value added IT activities,
      largely through support activities that utilized local skill endowments and education institutions.
  e.	 Wroclaw, Poland – historically an industrial and cultural center not far from the German border. Wroclaw has been transi-
      tioning to a high-tech economy since the early 2000s. Today, the city is home to large offices of Google, IBM and Oracle.
      The shift was largely driven by availability of skilled labor and an attractive urban environment, and was supported by the
      establishment of a high tech business park.




        »» Industry provides a much larger contribution to the total output of the economy of George Town than in any of the
           comparator cities. In George Town, the broad industry sector accounts for 50 percent of gross value added, while in
           the closest comparators, Incheon and Tainan, it makes up 43 percent and 39 percent respectively. (See Figure 3-31.)

        »» At the same time, industry’s contribution to employment is much lower than in some of the comparator cities.
           The difference in industry’s contributions to employment and to GVA is striking, particularly if Bangalore and
           Tainan are considered. (See Figure 3-32.)

            •	 Bangalore’s share of employment in industry is only 1.5 percentage points lower than in George Town, but its share
               of GVA in industry is 25 percentage points lower and this contributes only one-quarter of total output in Bangalore.

            •	 Tainan’s share of employment in industry is 7 percentage points higher than in George Town, but its contribu-
               tion to GVA is 10 percentage points lower than in George Town.

159.	 This points to two possible conclusions.

          »» George Town’s manufacturing industry is highly productive. This may be explained by the presence of the large
             electronics cluster, which includes production facilities of world leading electronics corporations.

          »» Overall labor productivity in George Town is slightly lower than in most of the comparator cities, suggesting that
             non-manufacturing sectors in George Town are weak. It is also telling that after manufacturing suffered a decline
             in the aftermath of the 2008-9 financial crisis, it was the public sector, and not other parts of the private sector
             that saw its share expand as George Town recovered.

160.	 The overall performance of George Town’s economy in recent years was largely defined by the consequences of
      the 2008-9 global financial crisis. The crisis hit the city’s manufacturing base at which point its growth trend fell
      behind that of the national economy. The structure and recent performance of the local economy suggests that
      manufacturing continues to be the most productive part of the economy, while other sectors are relatively weak in
      terms of their recent growth and less productive than in comparator cities.

3.4.2	 Land use and spatial structure38

161.	 Current (“semasa”) land use data was used to carry out spatial analysis for the state of Penang for the years 2000
      and 2010. The area analyzed constitutes the bulk of the George Town conurbation. The approach of using 1km
      radial buffer zones from the city center of George Town had to be slightly modified to account for the physical

          the island and the mainland.39

162.	 Figure 3-33 shows how the land in the state of Penang was allocated across various uses in 2010. It shows the
      proportion of George Town’s built-up area that is allocated to residential use, this is larger than in Greater Kuala
      Lumpur or the Johor Bahru conurbation (43 percent compared to 31 percent and 30 percent respectively). Of the

      Since areas on the mainland have long been connected to the island via the first Penang Bridge, the 1km buffer zones for all areas on
      the mainland were restarted at the point where the bridge meets the mainland, around 16km away from the center of George Town.
      Accordingly, the distances of all points on the mainland from the center of George Town were calculated from this point on the mainland,
      with the addition of 16km.

                             cated to institutional use (around 14 percent).

163.	 Figure 3-34 and Figure 3-35 present the percentages and absolute areas of land use by category for each 1km buffer
      zone from George Town’s city center in 2010. These charts identify key features of the land use pattern.

                             »» Only around 30 percent of the overall area of the state of Penang is built-up; 64 percent is under agricultural use
                                or is used as green/open space.

                             »» Like Greater Kuala Lumpur and other cities, there is a concentration of commercial land use at the center,
                                accounting for 37 percent within the first 1km buffer zone. This figure falls to less than 7 percent of every buffer
                                beyond 4 km of the city center. In terms of absolute area however, there is a large amount of commercial land
                                20km from the center of George Town, at the center of Butterworth.

                                are to areas south of both George Town and Butterworth; both areas are around 16-20 km from central George

164.	 Figure 3-36 presents overall changes in land use between 2000 and 2010. Figure 3-37 charts these changes by
      distance from the city center. Some of these changes appear to be the result of reclassification of the same land use
      between 2000 and 2010 rather than an actual change on the ground.

                            »» The most significant change has been the large loss of agricultural land: around 60 km2. However, reports of such
                               a large loss may be due to inconsistent land use classification and reclassification between 2000 and 2010, as
                               there appears to have been an increase in green/open space of more than 26 km2 over the same period. Figure 3-37
                               shows that the areas that lost agricultural land also gained green/open land.

                            »» Nearly 18 km2 of new residential areas were added across the state.

                            »» A small amount of new commercial and industrial land was added during this period (1.7 km2 each) and com-
                               prised areas mostly scattered across the state. One large area north of Air Itam was newly classified as commer-
                               cial, as was the Penang Sentral site in Butterworth. The new Batu Kawan industrial area is not reflected in these
                               numbers which are from the year 2010.

                            »» Less land was classified as infrastructure between 6 and 12 km from the center, but a large amount of land was
                               classified as new infrastructure beyond that. This resulted in an overall increase of nearly 14 km2. The spike in
                               institutional land at around 17 km from the center appears to be the result of a reclassification of the airport from
                               infrastructure to institutional, rather than an actual change of land use.

165.	 Figure 3-38, Figure 3-39, and Figure 3-40 map out the changes in industrial, commercial and residential land use
      from 2000 to 2010, respectively. They display where the losses and additions to land use took place over the
      decade. Most new industrial land was achieved through expansion of existing industrial clusters as seen in the
      areas of Bayan Lepas, Seberang Perai and Bukit Mertajam. This indicates further spatial concentration of manu-
      facturing, but does not reflect the new industrial land in Batu Kawan that was established after 2010. The figures
      show a lot of new commercial areas in both George Town and Butterworth, most notably with the Penang Sentral
      site in Butterworth.

3.4.3	 Review of the development strategy

166.	 The Penang region has had a long-standing tradition of strategic planning. The first strategic plan was developed
      in 1964, and with the 1970 Nathan report it laid the foundation for the manufacturing-centric growth model that
      defined the subsequent development of the city (Kharas et al 2010). The strategic plan that was developed in 1991
      saw a shift in objectives toward development of the service economy, as the limitations of the industry-led growth
      model based on availability of cheap labor were becoming obvious. Accordingly, this plan focused on economic
      diversification by developing high value-added service industries. More recently, the 2001-2010 strategic plan
      emphasized the high potential of an ICT-based service economy.

167.	 In 2009, the development of a new strategy was underpinned by a joint study by Khazanah and the World Bank
      (Kharas et al 2010). The study recognized that the George Town conurbation was losing its competitive edge in
      high-tech manufacturing, and that there was a clear need to refocus the strategy (Majeed 2011). In terms of exter-
      nal pressures, the 2008-9 global financial crisis and the rise of new manufacturing centers in the East Asia region
      meant that it was getting harder for George Town to attract investors. A number of local constraints were identified
      at this time, including the rising cost of production in Malaysia; infrastructure bottlenecks; and the need to nurture
      and sustain talent. It was also recognized that although the local economy was well-integrated into global supply
      chains, domestic value-added was limited and the supply chain did not extend enough to local firms or into the
      hinterland.

168.	 Despite these challenges, the study also recognized that George Town enjoys significant advantages. Given its
      geographic location, accessibility, and skills base, it is well positioned to be a major hub for the Malaysia-Indonesia-
      Thailand Growth Triangle. Moreover, despite the apparent slowdown of the electronics cluster, parts of it were
      successfully moving up the value chain, largely in response to policies that offered technology grants and made it

      easier to import and retain skilled staff. For instance, Intel upgraded its Penang facility from an assembly function
      to one with a primary focus on design and R&D.

169.	 The study proposed a more focused economic strategy, based on the city’s evolving from being a producer of goods
      to being a producer of ideas. In contrast to previous strategies, this approach relies on nurturing and supporting
      local talent; helping SMEs grow; meeting local and regional demand rather than attracting FDI and developing the
      service sector in general, as opposed to specifically defined industries. The main proposals that focus on putting in
      place the right enabling conditions included:

      »» Removing institutional and regulatory barriers and improving governance practices and coordination.

      »» Developing, attracting and retaining talent through improvements in the education system; incentives; and mak-
         ing the area a more attractive place to live.

      »» Improving infrastructure and connectivity.

170.	 A 2011 OECD study confirmed the new strategy’s conclusions, and highlighted a pivotal role that universities can
      play in addressing the main challenges for Penang: talent creation and retention; industrial upgrading and moving
      to innovative types of activity; and improving quality of governance (OECD 2011).

171.	 Recent strategy documents for the George Town conurbation include the identification of six specialization clus-
      ters. The documents discuss George Town’s comparative advantage and the potential for sectors to exploit scale
      economies (JPBD n.d). In addition to higher value-added technology-based manufacturing, these clusters include:
      agriculture and agribusiness, tourism, logistics, business process outsourcing, and biotechnology/life sciences.
      Some of these clusters clearly build on the George Town area’s existing strengths. For example, medical tourism
      attracts client patients from Sumatra in Indonesia, as well as from further afield. George Town also has high poten-
      tial as a logistics hub, thanks to its favorable location. The potential for growth is strong. In addition to the above,
      George Town’s historical core also enjoys recognition as a UNESCO World Heritage Site (Kharas et al 2010).

172.	 Planning and spatial development of the conurbation are seen as key factors in shaping the new development
      model for George Town. The thinking is to pursue an urban form based around a network of specialized centers of
      activity (see Figure 3-41).

      »» George Town-Butterworth are expected to blend into a new city core, with George Town specializing in business
         and finance services, and Butterworth establishing its position as the logistical center.

      »» As noted in the previous section, the specialized centers for manufacturing are largely based on existing indus-
         trial clusters, which will support advancement to agglomeration economies and productivity growth.

      »» The new framework implies greater engagement of the private sector in the regeneration process including:
         initiatives such as grant schemes and business improvement districts; a greater emphasis on bottom-up gover-
         nance; and cooperation among local authorities.

173.	 More recent documents reflect a continued evolution in thinking on the strategy for the George Town conurba-
      tion (Majeed 2012). It appears that while the key challenges facing the economy remain the same, the strategic
      priorities now place a stronger emphasis on issues of livability. Livability is an important driver of the economic
      development of cities, but it is not the only one. Michael Storper, in his recent book (Storper 2012), asserts that in
      the discussion of people versus jobs as core drivers of urban development, international evidence points to jobs

        (or economic opportunities) as being the primary driver. Over time, these job opportunities attract skilled people
        which in turn promotes knowledge exchange and innovation in a dense urban environment, and creates a virtuous
        cycle of urban development.

174.	 In this context, an example of a current priority for George Town’s urban development is in the area of urban trans-
      port. Penang state’s current transport master plan emphasizes the need for transit-oriented development (TOD)
      and a focus on urban transit corridors. Successful implementation of these approaches in the George Town conur-
      bation would support the intended network of specialized centers of activity, while also contributing to increasing
      livability.

175.	 Given the challenges that George Town is facing, it is important for strategic interventions to be balanced against
      direct sector interventions; fundamental enabling conditions like skills and infrastructure; and issues of livability.
      Programs directly targeting skills and retention of skilled workers should be an important part of the mix, alongside
      interventions to address the competitiveness constraints of individual industries. Livability is unlikely to be the
      main focus of the city’s competitive position.

176.	 Kuching’s economy has been driven predominantly by its industrial sector in the past decade. The share of GDP
      contributed by industry has remained high, at 63 percent in 2003 and 58 percent in 2012 (Figure 3-42), while the
      share contributed by consumer services grew from 13 percent in 2003 to 16 percent in 2012. The share of employ-
      ment attributed to industry in Kuching is 27 percent and implies high labor productivity that outperforms all other
      sectors. Kuching’s per capita income is above the national average, and saw strong growth between 2003 and
      2012, when disposable income per capita rose from USD 4,200 to USD 6,800 per annum.

177.	 Kuching’s high industrial productivity can be attributed to the spatial concentration of its industrial firms, and to
      the nature of their industrial activities. Kuching’s clusters of manufacturing industries are located in the Sama Jaya
      Free Industrial Zone (FIZ), with other industrial parks/zones including: Bintawa Industrial Estate, Pending Indus-
      trial Estate, Demak Laut Industrial Park, and Demak Industrial Park Phase 3.

                                            2010). The Sama Jaya FIZ has built infrastructure that connects the area to the city center (8 km), airport (2 km),
                                            and seaport (4 km) (Landingin and Wadley 2005), all of which lowers transport costs. Reports also suggest that

      reviewed in this study. Industry’s contribution to GDP declined until 2007, after which it abruptly increased with
      fluctuations (Figure 3-43). It is unclear what the underlying reasons are for this pattern, which may be related to

      the quality of the data in the Oxford Economics global dataset. It may also reflect patterns of investment driven by
      the 2008-9 financial crisis and subsequent recovery. The shares of other sectors in the economy remained largely
      unchanged during the same period.

179.	 Despite the increase in industry’s contribution after 2007, its share of employment decreased marginally from 24
      percent in 2003 to 23 percent in 2012. The employment share of consumer services grew from 34 percent in 2003
      to 38 percent in 2012. It also appears that labor productivity in Kota Kinabalu stagnated or even decreased in most
      sectors, except for industry where it rose from USD 26,200 per worker to almost USD 43,000 per worker over the
      same period. Productivity of consumer services remained stagnant at around USD 10,000 per worker, while in
      financial and business services, productivity declined from USD 17,000 to USD 13,000 per worker.

180.	 Greater Kota Kinabalu is a key area of focus for the Sabah Development Corridor. The existing strategy places a
      strong focus on developing services in the city’s economy, including further development of the important tour-
      ism sector. Specific initiatives underway for Greater Kota Kinabalu include developing the city as a lifestyle hub;
      improving early childhood education; upgrading healthcare services; improving mobility; and enhancing tourist
      attractions. A future phase of work could examine these, and other elements of Greater Kota Kinabalu’s economic
      development strategy, in detail.

3.6.2	 Land use and spatial structure

181.	 The Sabah State Structure Plan defines the Greater Kota Kinabalu area as comprising the City of Kota Kinabalu (the
      area administered by DBKK), and the adjacent districts of Putatan and Penampang. However, the wider functional
      area also includes parts of Tuaran and Papar districts.

182.	 The spatial analysis presented here utilizes land use data obtained from DBKK for the year 2010. Figure 3-44 shows
      current land use in the city of Kota Kinabalu in 2010, with rings indicating the 1km buffer zones from the city center.
      Figure 3-45 presents the percentages of land use by category for each 1km buffer zone from Kota Kinabalu’s city
      center in 2010. The following observations can be made.

      »» Kota Kinabalu has a higher proportion of residential land than other Malaysian cities.

      »» Green/open space accounts for nearly half the city’s total area, and was distributed throughout the city, includ-
         ing around half the area within a 1km radius of the city center. This amount of unbuilt land so close to the city
         center is unusual, but is a result of the large hills/steeply sloping terrain close to the center.

      »» Most commercial areas are concentrated near the city center (not including a large golf resort to the north which
         is classified in the data as commercial land). Commercial land makes up 11 percent of the area within the first
         1km buffer zone.

      »» The two large swathes of industrial land are at 3-8 km and 14-18 km from the center.

      »» Institutional land accounts for a relatively large proportion (18 percent) of the built-up area of Kota Kinabalu.
         This is mainly due to the two large university campuses located 5-12 km north of the center.

183.	 A key challenge in Greater Kota Kinabalu, particularly in areas outside the City of Kota Kinabalu, is the need to
      continue to develop basic urban infrastructure such as utility lines, drains and sewers. Given the relatively small
      population spread over a large area, the cost of building this infrastructure is high. Promoting more compact devel-
      opment and avoiding further urban sprawl would help to manage the cost of this infrastructure provision.

3.7	 Kuantan

3.7.1	 Economic performance and specialization

184.	 Kuantan city is less industrialized than Kuching and Kota Kinabalu; industry accounts for only 33 percent of the
      city’s GDP (Figure 3-46). At seven percent, the share of agriculture in Kuantan’s economy is low, but is the highest
      among the six Malaysian cities reviewed. Consumer services are a significant component of the local economy,
      accounting for over 25 percent of the city’s GDP; this is the second highest share among the six cities (lower only
      than Johor Bahru). Finance and business services’ share of GDP increased from nine percent to 12 percent between
      2003 and 2012. Other sectors’ economic contributions have been mostly stable. Employment is mostly provided by
      consumer services (31 percent in 2012) followed by public services (25 percent in 2012) and industry (21 percent
      in 2012). The employment shares of these sectors have remained largely stable, except for financial and business
      services which have increased from six percent to 10 percent.

185.	 Kuantan stands as the gateway to the broader East Coast Economic Region (ECER), which offers a significant source
      of raw materials for various industries. Kuantan also hosts the main port for the east coast of peninsular Malaysia.
      Given its existing economic structure and geographical location, Kuantan could focus on its comparative advantage
      of internal (plant-level) scale economies. Evidence shows that internal scale economies are higher in heavy indus-
      tries than in light industries (World Bank 2009), and such activities would be suitable for the Kuantan conurbation.
      Oil and gas, petrochemicals, and other industrial activities are already part of Kuantan’s economic strategy. In this
      regard, improved connectivity to the large hinterland, as well as to the large cities on the west coast of the peninsula,
      would facilitate access to raw materials as well as to markets. This needs to be accompanied by continued enhance-
      ments in infrastructure and the provision of services such as quality education and healthcare. Due consideration
      also needs to be given to the environmental impacts of heavy industrial activities, including all externality effects.
      Insufficient attention to environmental sustainability may have serious consequences in the medium to long-term.

3.8	 City-specific Recommendations

186.	 Based on the city-level analyses presented in this chapter, a number of city-specific recommendations can be made.
      These should be seen in the context of the broader set of recommendations from this study. Chapter 2 outlines gen-
      eral recommendations on more efficient land use and flexible land use regulations to increase economic density, as
      well as on strengthening urban planning, transport infrastructure, and the use of public transport. Chapters 4 and 5
      provide recommendations related to institutional arrangements and social inclusion, respectively.

187.	 The main recommendations for Greater Kuala Lumpur relate to ensuring optimal utilization of available land close
      to the city center (in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur as well as adjacent areas in the state of Selangor), to
      facilitate agglomeration economies and increase economic density. Specifically, these include the following.

                                             i.	 Identify areas of low-use land near the city center that could be feasibly developed (or redeveloped) for more
                                                 productive use. Given the current state of demand and supply for various types of space in Greater Kuala

          Lumpur’s real estate market, it is likely that the focus of many such new developments would be affordable
          housing (particularly for middle-income groups as recommended by the recent UNDP-EPU housing study) and
          the community amenities that go with housing, instead of commercial space.

      ii.	 Consider a suite of policy measures, including a programmatic (rather than ad-hoc) approach, to encourage
           and facilitate the relocation of industrial activity from Greater Kuala Lumpur to other cities in Malaysia. This
           could be based on the portfolio or system of cities framework discussed earlier in this chapter, where reloca-
           tion to small and medium-sized cities is focused on specific industry clusters.

188.	 For the Johor Bahru/Iskandar Region, the main recommendation is to adjust the existing strategy to pursue more
      vertical linkages with Singapore, focusing on selected sub-sectors in manufacturing and in finance and business
      services. This adjustment could imply a somewhat less diversified strategy than is currently the case, as well as
      pursuing fewer horizontal linkages.

189.	 In the case of the George Town conurbation/Penang area, the discussion earlier in this chapter recognizes the
      significant work in recent years on the strategy for its economy and urban fabric, and validates the priorities and
      directions laid out in existing strategy documents. Therefore, although this chapter does not yield any additional
      recommendations, it clearly affirms that the implementation of the existing strategy and priorities should be deep-
      ened.

190.	 As for Kota Kinabalu, Kuching and Kuantan, further study would be required to match the extent of analysis that has
      been done for Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru and George Town; a specific recommendation would be to perform this
      detailed analysis in a future phase of work.

4.1	 Introduction

191.	 Institutional issues often lie at the core of development challenges. The World Development Report 1999/2000
      found that countries with stable governments, predictable methods of changing laws, secure property rights, and
      strong judiciaries have experienced higher investment and growth than countries lacking these institutions (World
      Bank 1999). Subsequent World Development Reports, in 2002 and 2009, drew the link between institutions and
      urban development, recognizing that cities need efficient institutions to benefit from agglomeration economies and
      mitigate negative externalities such as congestion (World Bank 2002).

192.	 The literature on institutional theory and urban governance broadly defines institutions as: “rules, enforcement
      mechanisms and organizations” (World Bank 2002), or as “overarching systems of values, traditions, norms and
      practices that shape or constrain…behavior” (Pierre 1999). Institutions include the rules by which individuals or
      entities interact, and how they implement these rules. Institutions can and do evolve over time, but this process
      alone does not necessarily produce optimal institutions (World Bank 2002). A recent comprehensive analytical
      framework on the role of institutions in urban development was advanced by Boex and Yilmaz (2010), that takes
      into account the political, administrative and fiscal dimensions of central government, local government, civil soci-
      ety, and the private sector. This framework can be summarized as follows.

      »» Political. Local political structure, local electoral systems, political party system, and local participation and
         accountability.

      »» Administrative. Regulatory powers including planning and regulation of local physical space, local public finan-
         cial management and procurement, local human resource administration; and local public services.

      »» Fiscal. Expenditure assignments, revenue assignments including local revenue; intergovernmental fiscal trans-
         fers; and local government borrowing.

193.	 The analysis in this chapter begins with the assumption that the role and importance of institutions for development
      in Malaysia is no different from other countries. The scope of the analysis is limited to institutions as they pertain to
      urban planning, development and service delivery in Malaysia. The analysis focuses mainly on the administrative
      and fiscal dimensions of institutions, and less on the political. For these purposes, the term “institutional” is used
      in the broad sense, to include such aspects as:

      »» the roles and responsibilities of various government agencies;

      »» organizational structures;

      »» the system of strategies, plans, policies, laws and regulations;

      »» implementation arrangements and coordination mechanisms; and,

      »» monitoring and evaluation.



                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                           3. City-level Analysis and Policy Review  87 
194.	 Complementing this broad approach to institutional issues, the analysis in this chapter has been informed by
      ongoing work at the World Bank on a global Competitive Cities Knowledge Base (CCKB). Specifically, CCKB uses a
      standardized approach for assessing the role of city governments worldwide by examining the “mayor’s wedge”,
      defined as the “range of interventions that city leaders can influence, compared to those that are predetermined by
      higher levels of government”. This framework includes “city scope” components of:

        »» institutional and economic development;

        »» functional assignments;

        »» budget and staffing discretion and expenditures; revenue discretion; and

        »» politics.

195.	 A city’s capacity is also disaggregated in terms of:

        »» human resource management;

        »» public financial management;

        »» controlling corruption; and

        »» building ‘growth coalitions’.

196.	 Applying the ‘mayor’s wedge’ can help to identify the role of public sector institutions in creating an enabling envi-
      ronment for economic development, and determine which of those institutions are at the city or local level relative
      to other levels of government. An example of the mayor’s wedge analysis as it applies to two local authorities in the
      Greater Kuala Lumpur Area: DBKL and MPAJ, is included in Annex 3-5.

4.1.1	 Methodology

197.	 The work of the institutional analysis presented in this chapter involved a combination of desk research and inter-
      views with a range of stakeholders. Specifically, the analytical steps are listed below.

        »» Identification of a list of “core” urban functions and services. These are of particular interest for cities,
           including:

            •	 urban planning,
            •	 urban transport including roads,
            •	 water supply,
            •	 sanitation,
            •	 solid waste,
            •	 public health,
            •	 police and emergency services,
            •	 information and communication technologies (ICT), and
            •	 parks and recreation.




88  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
      This list is by no means exhaustive; there are other important basic services, such as health, education, and energy
      supply that are critical for the well-being of urban residents. This core list of urban services was informed by an
      examination of the range of services that is most commonly delivered by city governments worldwide.

      »» Mapping of institutional roles and responsibilities. Focusing on urban planning, development and service deliv-
         ery, the results of this mapping exercise consist of a series of tables. Each table summarizes the list of core urban
         services for a given area within Malaysia, and the various agencies responsible at each stage of the value chain
         from upstream policy, planning and design, through to implementation, operations and maintenance. The insti-
         tutional maps have been compiled separately and are available in Annex 3.

      »» Review of relevant plans, policies and laws/regulations. Focusing on those related to urban planning, devel-
         opment and service delivery, the legal and administrative differences between Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and
         Sarawak were noted (see also Table 4-1 below). A summary “catalog” of these plans, policies and laws was
         compiled, primarily for internal reference purposes.

      »» Interviews and meetings with a range of stakeholders. These included various government agencies at federal,
         state and local levels, as well as private sector representatives. The primary intent of the interviews was to
         identify and describe institutional issues, constraints and challenges within the scope defined above. Visits were
         made to all six conurbations included in the study, between April and August 2014. Effort was made to meet a
         range of local authorities (PBTs) within each conurbation (e.g. in Kedah for the George Town conurbation, and in
         Terengganu for the Kuantan conurbation). The list of meetings held is included in Annex 3-2.

      »» Review of selected global case studies. This was undertaken to identify examples of good practice and success-
         ful institutional change that could be relevant for Malaysia. These include examples of localizing service delivery
         through decentralization (Annex 3-3), and various models of metropolitan management (Annex 3-4).

4.1.2	 The history and context of urban governance in Malaysia

198.	 Malaysia inherited a system of local government from the days of British colonial rule, primarily in the form of local
      councils. By the 1960s, the overall structure of local government in the country was complex, varied and at the
      same time incomplete (Norris 1980). For example, the Royal Commission of Inquiry on local government (the ‘Athi
      Nahappan Commission’), which began its work in 1965, found some 373 local authorities in the peninsula alone,
      comprising municipalities, town councils, town boards, local councils and district councils (Report of the Royal
      Commission 1970: 330). Reforms enacted through the Local Government Act of 1976 (Act 171) together with the
      Town and Country Planning Act of 1976 (Act 172) form the basis of the system of local government in Peninsular
      Malaysia today. Through Act 171, the number of local authorities was significantly reduced, and local elections were
      abolished.

199.	 Malaysia has a three-tiered system of administration. Articles 74-79 of the federal constitution outline the basic
      framework for the distribution of powers across federal, state and local levels (see also section 4.2.1 below). Local
      governments in Malaysia are basically under the power and control of the respective state governments (Ahmad
      Atory and Malike 2006). The federal constitution provides for a consultative body called the National Council for
      Local Government (NCLG), to ensure uniformity of local government laws and policies in Peninsular Malaysia.

200.	 Sabah and Sarawak retain significant powers related to land and local government matters within their respective
      states. Table 4-1 summarizes some of the key differences in local government administration between Peninsular
      Malaysia, and Sabah and Sarawak.

4.2	 Analysis of Institutional Issues

201.	 The institutional analysis suggests that many of the issues that concern urban planning, development and ser-
      vice delivery in Malaysia are related to institutions. Even when a problem initially appears to be of a technical or
      financial nature, further analysis often identifies an underlying or root cause as institutional. This section explores
      institutional issues in three main areas:

       »» the tendency to centralize / federalize the delivery of urban services;

       »» challenges related to urban and spatial planning; and

       »» constraints faced by local authorities particularly in their technical and financial capacities.

       Despite differences in legal frameworks and specific institutional arrangements between Peninsular Malaysia on
       the one hand and Sabah and Sarawak on the other, many of the institutional issues identified were confirmed
       during stakeholder interviews in Sabah and Sarawak as being similar to those on the peninsula.

202.	 A concurrent World Bank RAS on crafting a national transport strategy for the Government of Malaysia has also
      identified a number of key institutional challenges. These include:

       »» weaknesses in the process for planning, appraising and prioritizing development expenditure;

       »» the unavailability or inaccessibility of relevant data; and

       »» lack of inter-agency coordination. (World Bank 2015)

       In general, these findings are consistent with the institutional analysis discussed in this section. From the perspec-
       tive of local authorities, decision-making and allocation of development expenditure rests with the federal gov-
       ernment; in interviews, many local authorities pointed out that they rely on federal agencies for access to relevant
       data. Furthermore, coordination across levels of government appears to be a key challenge for urban planning and
       implementation. These issues are discussed in detail below.




                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                          4. Strengthening Institutions for City Competitiveness  91 
4.2.1	 The centralization/federalization of urban service delivery

203.	 Local development and urban service delivery in Malaysia are highly centralized through federal-level government
      agencies. Many core urban services such as public transport, roads, water supply, sewerage, solid waste man-
      agement, drainage, public health, police and emergency services, and education are delivered through federal
      government agencies. Local governments in Malaysia are responsible for delivering relatively few services, such as
      the maintenance of local facilities like markets and parks. In addition to the overall framework of local government
      administration summarized in Table 4-1 above, Table 4-2 summarizes various urban services and the levels of
      government in Malaysia that are primarily responsible for their delivery.

204.	 Malaysia’s relatively high centralization of service delivery is not unique globally, but it does stand in contrast to
      prevailing global trends. The World Development Report 1999/2000 (World Bank 1999) observed that “...countries
      everywhere, large and small, rich and poor – are devolving political, fiscal, and administrative powers to subna-
      tional tiers of government.” Table 4-3 compares Malaysia and several developing countries in terms of the levels
      of government responsible for the delivery of various services. These comparator countries were selected based on
      available data, and are all peer countries in the middle-income group. Malaysia stands out as the most centralized
      country in this table.

205.	 The tendency toward centralization and a strong federal government in Malaysia has also been noted in the liter-
      ature. It has been observed that “in practice the states have little real autonomy. Although some federal functions
      have been decentralized, most decision-making remains at national level” (Morrison 1994, cited in Phang 2008).
      This is also reflected in aggregate figures for public expenditure in Malaysia relative to other developing countries:
      local government spending as a percentage of total government spending in Malaysia is rather low at less than five
      percent (UCLG 2011: 87). By comparison, aggregate local government spending in South Africa stands at over 17
      percent and at 28 percent in Indonesia (UCLG 2011).

206.	 The institutional maps (see Annex 3-1), developed as part of the analysis for this chapter, further illustrate this high
      degree of centralization. These maps show the many functions in the ‘value chain’ of urban service delivery: from
      policy and planning to construction, operations, regulation and data collection. Funding also rests with federal
      agencies, particularly in Peninsular Malaysia. Federal government agencies, often at state-level, directly control
      management and decision-making for these services. Some services have been centralized through the privatiza-
      tion of former public assets; for instance, sewerage services in Peninsular Malaysia are under Indah Water Konsor-
      tium, a federally-controlled company.

207.	 The information gathered from various interviews and desk research is consistent with the view of Phang (2008)
      that there has been an emergent trend of neo-centralism in Malaysia; i.e. a growing tendency for matters to be
      handled by the federal government, based on the reasoning that this will render better services to the public. One
      recent example of this is the Land Public Transport Act of 2010. This Act mandates the Land Public Transport Com-
      mission (SPAD) to perform all design, planning, implementation, service delivery and regulatory roles in relation
      to land public transport; it consolidates the roles previously performed by 15 other state and federal agencies. In a
      similar vein, the Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Act of 2007 (Act 672) also federalized solid waste
      collection in most states through the formation of the National Solid Waste Management Department (JPSPN) and
      the Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Corporation (PPSPPA), taking on the functions that had hitherto
      been performed by local authorities.

208.	 The range of challenges identified in the delivery of urban services by various levels of government suggests that
      the high degree of centralization has not always had the intended benefits of increasing efficiency and effective-
      ness. Some federal agencies face constraints in delivering fully on their mandates. For example, SPAD is still in
      the process of gearing up to assume all the functions related to land public transport that the law specifies. As
      for solid waste collection, overall costs are likely higher, given the additional costs of running newly established
      federal agencies while local authorities face the same level of expenditure on solid waste through the transfer of
      funds to these new agencies (World Bank 2011). Some local authorities in states where solid waste collection is still
      managed locally appear to be faring as well as before in terms of outcomes, and may even exhibit exemplary solid
      waste performance (see e.g. KPKT 2013: 24). Box 4-1 presents the results of a limited analysis of cost efficiency in
      this sector, comparing those states with federalized solid waste services to those without.

209.	 Regional development corridors. Recent institutional changes in Malaysia have not only been about centraliza-
      tion. In all six conurbations that are the focus of this study, regional corridor authorities now have a role in urban
      development. The Ninth Malaysia Plan (2006-2010) outlined the establishment of a corridor development pro-
      gram with the objective of “reducing regional imbalance” and “(bringing) about equitable growth, investment,
      and employment opportunities to all regions of Malaysia”. The five regional development corridors, including their
      respective corridor authorities and focus sectors, are summarized in Table 4-5.




94  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
Box 4-1	 Comparing solid waste cost efficiency across selected states in Peninsular Malaysia

Solid waste management in Malaysia offers an interesting example and a “real world” experiment on the effects of centralizing
the delivery of a basic urban service. In 2011, Act 672 took effect in a number of states in Peninsular Malaysia, through which
the National Solid Waste Management Department (JPSPN) and the Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Corporation
(PPSPPA) took over functions in solid waste collection and disposal that had previously been the responsibility of local authori-
ties. This shift however, was not implemented uniformly, and some states such as Penang, Selangor and Terengganu declined to
participate in the new federalized system, thus also providing a natural ‘control’ group.

In December 2014, the World Bank team requested and received data on the quantities of solid waste collected and disposed, as
well on costs including labor, operations, and transport, for the two full calendar years of 2012 and 2013.

JPSPN provided the data for nine selected local authority areas within its purview: the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur and
Putrajaya; Johor Bahru, Johor Bahru Tengah, Kulai and Pontian in Johor; Sungai Petani in Kedah; and Kuantan and Pekan in Pahang.

Nine individual local authorities that continue to manage their own solid waste also provided their own data: Ampang Jaya, Klang,
Petaling Jaya, Selayang, Sepang, Shah Alam, Subang Jaya in Selangor; and Pulau Pinang and Seberang Perai in Penang.

Due to some issues with data consistency and completeness, the data for five local authorities were excluded from the final results.

The data obtained enabled calculation of the annual cost per ton of solid waste for 14 local authorities. There was a good balance
between those with “centralized” solid waste management through JPSPN and those that continued to manage solid waste them-
selves. Table 4-4 below summarizes the results.

Overall, the results do not show any obvious systematic difference in cost per ton between the “centralized” and “non-central-
ized” local authority areas. In other words, centralization or localization of solid waste services does not appear to have had a
noticeable impact on cost efficiency. However, this is a relatively small sample and two calendar years is a short period of time
over which to make comparisons. Additionally, the cost data do not take full account of staff and other office/administrative costs
of JPSPN and PPSPPA. Lastly, it does not provide a measure of the quality of service delivery, although KPKT has recognized that
some of the local authorities that have retained solid waste management are performing well in delivering solid waste services.

210.	 In each corridor, the corridor authority oversees implementation of a growth strategy based on the identified focus
      sectors/industries, accompanied by a combination of public and private infrastructure investments. While all the
      corridors feature at least five ‘focus’ industries, there are some overlaps between corridors. For instance, both
      Iskandar Malaysia and the East Coast Economic Region (ECER) have included “logistics” as a focus sector, while all
      corridors in Peninsular Malaysia list “tourism” as a focus sector (see Table 4-5).

211.	 Four out of the five clusters leverage the regions’ industrial comparative advantages. For example, the strategy for
      the ECER focuses primarily on the oil, gas and petrochemicals sector, consistent with the fact that the region pro-
      duces the largest share of mining output in the country due to the existence of offshore petroleum and gas reserves.
      By comparison, the focus of the economic strategy for the Iskandar Malaysia region is on “new growth” services
      sectors located in purpose-built clusters.

212.	 The corridor authorities are tasked with investment promotion, and with acting as “one-stop centers” for invest-
      ment approvals within their respective corridors. They are also meant to act as a conduit between the federal and
      state governments, and in the case of the NCER and ECER, as a kind of metropolitan/regional government agency,
      given that these two corridors cross state boundaries. In some cases, the corridor authorities have been perceived
      to add another layer of administrative bureaucracy to the existing overlaps between the local, state and federal
      governance levels (Ibrahim 2010). For example, although the corridor authorities approve applications for invest-
      ment incentives specific to their corridors, planning approval remains with the respective local and state govern-
      ments (see Section 4.3).

4.2.2	 Challenges in urban and spatial planning

213.	 In principle, Malaysia has a comprehensive planning system that guides urbanization at various levels. In Penin-
      sular Malaysia, the National Physical Plan (NPP) provides the overarching plan, within which state-level Structure
      Plans and local plans/special area plans are developed and coordinated by state and local authorities. Where rel-
      evant, regional plans may span two or more states. These various levels of planning are summarized in Figure 4-1.
      The ‘national physical planning structure’, as proposed and outlined in NPP-2, is well-defined and comprehensive,
      identifying the roles of various agencies and how they relate to one another (see Figure 4-2).

214.	 Linkages across planning levels. Some weaknesses across linkages in the planning system have been raised.
      For example, JPBD has identified a number of issues related to implementation of NPP-2. JPBD has no authority
      or financial resources to actually implement the NPP; implementation sits with various federal agencies, state
      governments, and local authorities. In addition, NPP-2 has not been well incorporated into sectoral planning and
      development, resulting in discrepancies with actual budgetary allocations. Other challenges include limitations
      in monitoring capacity, and lack of suitable policy indicators and databases on strategic zones and conurbations
      (JPBD 2013: 10-11).

215.	 Land titles and zoning. Urban land development is sometimes constrained by inconsistencies in land titling and
      zoning at the state and local levels. In Selangor several representatives of state agencies and local authorities
      mentioned cases where land titles granted by the state (the Land Office) were inconsistent with the latest zoning
      and land uses as indicated in the local plans (e.g. between residential and commercial uses). These issues become
      most acute in areas of rapid urban development and transformation. Some cases may be relatively straightforward,
      such as when an existing land owner pays a premium to convert land use from residential to commercial in a part
      of a residential area currently zoned to allow for commercial use. Examples were also cited of more difficult cases
      where the government opted to acquire the land from the owner because the owner’s intended use, as allowed for
      on the title document, would have been incompatible with current zoning and regulations.

216.	 Large investments and local priorities. One consequence of weaknesses in planning processes and links to imple-
      mentation is manifested in cases where large investments do not fully reflect local knowledge and priorities. Inter-
      views with stakeholders across local, state and federal levels showed how knowledge at the local government
      level41 has not been effectively translated to centralized design and planning of public transport and urban roads,
      including highways. One example is in the planning of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) by SPAD, where a station has
      been planned in the central business district of Klang, but does not take full account of current and future pop-
      ulation growth areas like Bukit Raja. Similarly, MBPJ has begun to initiate intra-urban public transport services
      independently of SPAD to fill the gap in service requirements at the local level. In Johor, local authorities cited their
      perspectives on priority investment needs in terms of roads or bridges that have long been included in local plans,
      but which remain unfunded by the federal government.

217.	 Gaps in planning and coordination. As a result of some of the issues identified above, gaps in planning and coor-
      dination can give rise to suboptimal urban development outcomes. One example of a significant gap in the effec-
      tiveness of planning is the fact that in many places across Malaysia, local plans are not gazetted. The typical reason
      given for not gazetting the local plans is to retain flexibility in decision-making, in effect allowing for a greater
      degree of administrative discretion. The real impact, however, has been to severely weaken the urban planning
      system in Malaysia, where local plans are not the effective tools that they are meant to be.

218.	 Another example is the case of road networks, where there is limited integration between the Highway Network
      Development Plan (HNDP) at the federal level and local plans, state structure plans, and the NPP (World Bank
      2015). In effect, private urban expressways are proposed and planned on an ad-hoc basis. Toll expressways that
      cut across various local authority areas are proposed, designed and planned by private concessionaires, approved
      by the Public Private Partnership Unit (UKAS) under the Prime Minister’s Department, and regulated by the Malay-
      sian Highway Authority (LLM). LLM is an agency under the Ministry of Works but is independent from federal road
      planning under the Public Works Department (JKR). Approval for these expressways at the local government level
      is only required if the local plan has been gazetted; in effect, they are often proposed and built independent of local
      government plans.

4.2.3	 Constraints faced by local authorities

219.	 Many local authorities in Malaysia have mentioned that they face constraints in two specific areas: financial
      resources and technical capacity in terms of hiring well-trained staff.

220.	 Local authority finances. In terms of local government financing, most local authorities in Malaysia depend to
      a large extent on own-source revenues and receive minimal fiscal transfers from federal and state levels. Local

                                                                                        4. Strengthening Institutions for City Competitiveness  99 
        government revenue, as a percentage of total government revenue, is very low in Malaysia, at less than one percent
        (UCLG 2011: 87). Interviews with local authorities across the country consistently found that with few exceptions
        such as DBKL, at least 90 percent of local authority revenue is derived from own-source revenue. This consists
        mostly of property assessments, with a lesser proportion from other local sources such as development charges,
        licenses and summonses. Conversely, less than 10 percent of the typical local authority’s revenue consists of
        transfers/grants from federal or state levels. Table 4-6 gives a breakdown of revenues for selected local authorities.

221.	 Local property taxes. Local authorities’ high level of reliance on own-source revenues is constrained by a local
      property tax system in Malaysia that is not working the way it was designed. The Local Government Act of 1976
      stipulates that the main source of local government revenue is the property assessment/tax (cukai pintu/taksiran).
      This tax is typically based on a property’s annual rental value, determined by the Ministry of Finance’s Valuation
      and Property Services Department, JPPH, and the applicable assessment rate; this can range from two percent for
      agricultural land to 12 percent for commercial properties. Any revision of assessment rates is subject to approval
      by the respective state government.

222.	 Stakeholder interviews revealed that annual rental values and assessment rates have not been revised for a long
      time in almost all of Malaysia; the explanation being that this is for “political reasons”. Specific examples include
      Petaling Jaya, where the annual rental value has not been revised since 1992, while Sungai Petani’s last revision
      was in 1988. Other local authority representatives mentioned even longer periods of 30 years.

223.	 A recent exception is in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, where annual rental values were revised upwards
      by as much as 200 to 300 percent with effect from January 2014, the first such change in 21 years. This increase
      in annual rental values was accompanied by a reduction in assessment rates for commercial and residential prop-
      erties; rebates for the disabled, retirees and owner occupied properties; as well as exempting low and middle cost
      properties from the application of the revised annual rental values (Chan and Sim 2013).

224.	 Intergovernmental fiscal transfers. Local authorities receive their transfers as “grants”, as provided for in the
      Tenth Schedule of the federal constitution, the Local Government Act of 1976, and the State Grants (Maintenance
      of Local Authorities) Act of 1981. Most funds originate from the federal government, but are usually transferred
      through state governments. Table 4-7 summarizes the transfers received by selected local authorities, the popula-
      tion within each local authority area, and the size of the transfers on a per capita basis.

225.	 In per capita terms, transfers to local authorities appear to be imbalanced, with ‘important’ local authorities such
      as DBKL and Putrajaya Corporation receiving much larger per capita amounts compared to other local authorities.
      The per capita transfer amounts do not appear to be related to the size of the local authority area, or its level of
      development.

226.	 Some grants received by local authorities are allocated by different line ministries at the federal level, with some
      funds allocated for very specific purposes (see Table 4-8 for examples on roads and industrial areas). The overall
      effect appears to be that the fiscal transfers received by local authorities are unpredictable from the local authority
      perspective; are allocated based on a range of unrelated criteria; and can vary from year to year depending on
      allocations in different parts of the federal government’s annual budget.

227.	 Development expenditure and operating expenditure. Development expenditures are coordinated and approved
      by the Economic Planning Unit (EPU) under the Prime Minister’s Department, while operating expenditures are
      managed and allocated by the Ministry of Finance (MoF). Development expenditures on projects are often approved
      independently of allocation of budgetary resources for ongoing and long-term maintenance. Federal agencies are

      required to revise budgetary requests to maintain assets every two years. Interviews with local authorities have
      indicated that many federally-funded facilities are built within municipal boundaries, and later do not receive a
      corresponding maintenance budget.

228.	 This places growing pressure on local authorities to provide their own funds for maintenance. In interviews with
      stakeholders, local authorities often mentioned examples of how they would perform stop-gap repairs of a road or
      remedial work on a river bank in response to public complaints, rather than wait for the Public Works Department
      or Drainage and Irrigation Department. They carried out these repairs even though this was not within their remit
      and it involved maintenance for which they had not received federal funding.

229.	 Human capital at the local level. Another challenge that was commonly cited in discussions with local authorities
      across all six conurbations was human capital limitations. This was mentioned as a key factor impinging on the
      quality of service delivery and is due to several factors, including:

      »» Difficulties in recruiting and retaining talent, particularly the perception of limited career opportunities and
         potential disparities in compensation between the different levels of government.

      »» Bottlenecks in the hiring process due to the centralization of staffing allocations at the federal level.

      »» Mismatches between staffing requirements and allocations.

230.	 Local authority staff are not part of the federal or state civil service, but are instead directly hired by the local
      authorities themselves, and paid for by the core local authority budgets. Such staff typically remain with the same
      local authority throughout their entire careers, and do not have the ability to transfer to other local authorities,
      much less to other levels of government. This in turn limits their exposure to the latest ideas and innovations. In
      some cases local authority staffing appears to be constrained by staffing controls exercised by the federal-level Pub-
      lic Service Department (JPA). For instance, JPA may reject a local authority’s request for additional staff positions
      if it does not conform to JPA’s guidelines or its staffing criteria.

231.	 One way in which local authorities may respond to staffing constraints is by hiring more contract staff. For example,
      one local authority in Selangor (within the Greater Kuala Lumpur area) showed that as of August 2014, it had 369
      permanent staff out of a total warranted 449 positions, and had hired an additional 157 contract staff. Within these
      total figures, the situation with respect to professional and technical staffing (job grades 27 and above, requiring a
      minimum of diploma-level education) was 96 permanent staff out of 118 warranted positions, with an additional
      16 contract staff. Although much of the gap in staffing and use of contract staff does not appear to affect the profes-
      sional and technical ranks, a high proportion of contract staff may not be conducive for building staff capacity and
      encouraging longer term career development.

232.	 Local authorities are also able to supplement their staffing levels by obtaining secondees through JPA. Federal
      agencies such as the Town and Country Planning Department (JPBD) embed staff at the local authorities, for func-
      tions such as urban planning. These seconded staff are able to move between different government agencies as
      part of their careers, thereby accessing more career opportunities compared to the local authorities’ “own” staff.

233.	 The lack of career opportunities, as well as lower pay compared to equivalent positions in state and federal agen-
      cies, also contributes to difficulties in filling positions. For instance, local authorities have mentioned that the
      environmental health officer (U29) and public health assistant (U17) positions are very difficult to fill, as graduates
      and others with qualifications in these areas often prefer to work in the private sector.



                                                                                                                                         
                                                                             4. Strengthening Institutions for City Competitiveness  103 
234.	 During various interviews, local authority representatives also voiced the opinion that their staff are insufficiently chal-
      lenged, despite the public’s demands for a higher quality of local service delivery. It is believed that this is because staff
      spend an inordinate amount of time focusing on routine documentation and process-related reporting and audits. For
      example, the Selangor local authority mentioned above provided a list of 22 different “award” or “certification” activ-
      ities that it had been involved in (and required to report/ provide documentation for) for the period 2009-14. These
      include the Star Rating System of KPKT, the Government Portals and Website Assessment, the state Public Sector Inno-
      vation Awards, the 5S Quality Environment of the Malaysian Productivity Corporation, and the MURNInets indicators.

235.	 In recognition of these staffing issues, the Ministry of Urban Well-being, Housing and Local Government (KPKT)
      recently announced the PBT Transformation Plan. One specific proposal under this initiative is to create a PBT Ser-
      vice Commission, under the authority of the state government. The roles and functions of this commission would be
      akin to the federal-level Public Service Commission (JPA), but for local authorities. Appointments and promotions
      of local authority staff come under this new commission. This arrangement would allow for rotation of local author-
      ity staff across different local authorities within a given state.


4.3	 Institutional Recommendations for City Competitiveness

236.	 The diagnostic in Section 4.2 above has identified some institutional issues that constrain the effectiveness and
      efficiency of urban service delivery in Malaysia. If not adequately addressed, these issues are likely to continue
      to affect the delivery of urban services. With growing demand for services from the expanding urban populace,
      addressing institutional issues is an essential component for strengthening the competitiveness of Malaysia’s cit-
      ies. Based on the analysis of institutional issues, the recommendations in this chapter focus on two main areas: (i)
      localization of service delivery, and (ii) increasing the capacities of local authorities.

4.3.1	 Localization of Service Delivery

237.	 This section on localization of service delivery recommends transforming institutional structures in Malaysia
      to increase city competitiveness. The intention is to shift more management and decision-making roles to local
      authorities. This shift should be in tandem with an enhanced system of local performance indicators.

238.	 Appropriate levels of service delivery. A fundamental question when considering shifting greater responsibility for
      service delivery to local authorities in Malaysia lies in determining what the appropriate or ‘ideal’ level of government
      should be for delivering a given service, and therefore what the corresponding institutional structure should be.

239.	 There are a number of criteria that can help decide whether a public service should be delivered and managed at
      the local, metropolitan, state/provincial, or national level. Slack (2007) suggests the framework outlined below,
      which Andersson (2012) uses to categorize various services.

        »» Economies of scale. For many services, the per-unit cost of delivery decreases as the quantity of the service
           provided increases, e.g. water supply and power generation. For some services, such as primary education, econ-
           omies of scale are hard to achieve, and so may be best handled by local governments (although equity consider-
           ations may suggest otherwise; see below). Scale economies can be dependent on the geographic and demographic
           profile of each city/metropolitan area. For example, because Kuala Lumpur differs significantly from Kuantan, the
           level of government recommended for the management of sewerage services could differ for both cities.

        »» Externalities. The provision of services can cause positive or negative effects beyond jurisdictional boundaries.
           In the example of a river basin, upstream infrastructure and maintenance affect water quality for the entire


104  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
         basin. Maintenance and enforcement of river by-laws can be effectively performed at the local level, while plan-
         ning and investment can be done at the state or metropolitan level to take account of any externality effects.

      »» Equity. An important consideration is equity, particularly for services that are funded by local government reve-
         nues. Wealthy jurisdictions are likely to have more local resources for service provision, while poorer ones may
         struggle to provide the same services resulting in unequal access to services. Providing such services at the
         metropolitan or state level can help equalize such imbalances.

      »» Local responsiveness and accountability. Local responsiveness is key for effective delivery of services that best
         suits local needs. The closer decision-making is to the people affected by decisions, the more able citizens are to
         hold decision-makers accountable. Moreover, some services are heavily dependent on maintenance and enforce-
         ment. Examples of maintenance dependent services include public road maintenance, landscaping, drainage
         maintenance, general cleanliness and street lighting. Other services that are enforcement-reliant such as traffic
         control, advertisements, river pollution and business operations also require strong local responsiveness.

240.	 Providing services centrally creates economies of scale and captures externalities, but this comes at the cost of
      imposing a common policy on populations with varied preferences and priorities. Governments should carefully
      consider trade-offs when allocating functions across local, state and national lines; services that central govern-
      ments provide should benefit the entire economy or exhibit substantial economies of scale, for example defense or
      foreign relations. Correspondingly, subnational units should provide local public goods (World Bank 1999).

241.	 In light of these criteria and the underlying literature, a decision flowchart that could be applied to Malaysia’s cir-
      cumstances is illustrated in Figure 4-3. Based on this flowchart, the “ideal” distribution of service delivery respon-
      sibilities across levels of government for Malaysian cities is shown in Table 4-9 and takes into account feedback
      from the Technical Committee for this study. Both the flowchart and the table are not intended to be definitive;
      rather, they are meant to illustrate the logical process by which Malaysia could decide which services could be
      devolved to sub-national levels.

242.	 Devolution. Localizing service delivery in this way would in effect be a process of devolution of governmental
      functions for Malaysia. In addition to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of urban service delivery, this
      devolution could also address institutional issues that have been identified by:

      »» increasing the clarity of accountability;

      »» improving coordination and planning efforts across different disciplines and services; and

      »» reducing duplication of roles and responsibilities.

243.	 Box 4-2 discusses devolution in the context of other forms of administrative decentralization, comparing Malaysia
      with South Africa and Indonesia, which have devolved to varying degrees. Box 4-3 describes the process and out-
      comes of decentralization in Mexico over the past three decades.

244.	 Metropolitan Governance. It is also important to emphasize that the recommended institutional structure is not
      intended to be a blanket move to localize all functions across all layers of urban services in Malaysian cities. In fact,
      some functions, such as road network planning, could be consolidated to better manage the externalities involved.
      Table 4-9 recommends the consolidation of various planning functions at the level of a metropolitan area or state,
      depending on the city.

   Box 4-2	 Approaches to fiscal decentralization

   Fiscal decentralization is the intergovernmental distribution of responsibilities for expenditure and financing among various
   types or levels of government, in a way that is harmonized with the political framework (Muwonge and Ebel 2014). This usually
   takes the form of three distinct arrangements:

   1.	 Deconcentration. A process whereby regional offices of central ministries are established to provide services locally. These
       regional offices do not always have independent decision-making authority. For many urban services, Malaysia’s system
       today most often resembles deconcentration, with varying degrees of authority.
   2.	 Delegation. An intermediate arrangement between deconcentration and devolution. The central government assigns respon-
       sibilities for certain local functions to local governments or other entities, which are ultimately accountable to the central
       government. The trend toward privatization of some services in Malaysia is a form of delegation.
   3.	 Devolution. The transfer of authority for decision-making, finance, and management to quasi-autonomous units of local
       government. These include municipalities that elect their own mayors and councils, raise their own revenues, and have
       independent authority to make investment decisions.

   The table below compares aspects of the ‘mayor’s wedge’ (see Annex 3-5 for further details) for South Africa, Indonesia and
   Malaysia in terms of decentralization, policy levers and revenue-raising power. South Africa can be counted among Malaysia’s
   peers in terms of size, income level and institutional history; this country has followed a model of devolution, with city govern-
   ments wielding more influence over policy and being answerable to their constituents. Indonesia is a nearby example of political
   and institutional transformation, and has moved from deconcentration to provinces, to devolution to cities (Smoke 2013). Annex
   3-3 contains case studies of decentralization in Indonesia, Mexico and Spain, including the benefits that have arisen in specific
   sectors such as health and education.

   Some challenges that countries face in pursuing devolution may include:

   a.	 uneven quality of implementation and lack of conformity to national standards/guidelines across different cities and geog-
       raphies;
   b.	 the need to redistribute financial resources across levels of government, given varying sources of revenue and fiscal capac-
       ities;
   c.	 weak technical capacities in some locations, depending on access to skills and talent.

   Malaysia’s geographic, demographic and political profile, taken together with its existing institutional structure, suggests that it
   would have the ability and resources to overcome these challenges.

108  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
  Box 4-3	 Decentralization in a federal country: the case of Mexico

  Background: Mexico is a federal country with a federal constitution but prior to the mid-1980s, states and municipalities had
  very little autonomy. The president had extensive control over all levels of government, including proposing candidates to head
  local governments. Decentralization reform in Mexico began in 1983, for two main reasons. First, the debt crisis made it difficult
  for the federal government to provide adequate public services; and second, population growth in the Federal District of Mexico
  City placed considerable strains on urban infrastructure and the environment. President de la Madrid’s administration hoped
  that sharing administrative functions and responsibilities with states and municipalities would allow the federal government to
  increase administrative efficiency while decreasing its own accountability by shedding bureaucratic responsibilities (Elias 1997).

  Goals of Decentralization: The decentralization reform in 1983 had three goals:

  i.	 decentralize all federal agencies, administratively and geographically;
  ii.	 strengthen federalism by increasing the powers of states and local government; and
  iii.	 promote regional economic development. (Elias 1997)

  All ministries were subsequently decentralized; coordinated by the Ministry of Budget and Planning. The Mexican constitution
  was also reformed to strengthen federalism. Industrial investment was promoted in places outside of Mexico City; municipalities
  were granted the legal and financial capabilities to operate without interference from the federal government.

  Implementation: Municipalities were given responsibility over potable water, drainage, sewerage, public lighting, refuse collec-
  tion, cemeteries, streets, public parks, public safety, and slaughter houses. The central government also shared revenues through
  an ‘unconditional fund’ for each state. In 1997, the central government provided additional funds to the states and municipalities
  as a ‘conditional fund’ to be used for particular sectors, such as social infrastructure and public safety. These transfers signifi-
  cantly increased local government budgets. By around 1990, the breakdown of the typical municipality’s revenue was, on aver-
  age, 63 percent from unconditional funds from the central government, 11 percent from local taxes, 10 percent from local fees and
  charges, and 16 percent from conditional funds and sale or lease of state owned property (World Bank 1991: 38).

  Outcomes: The overall impact of the 1983 reforms has been mixed. Local autonomy was greater in areas that did not require
  large amounts of federal funding (Elias 1997). For instance, the decentralization of the Ministry of Education greatly improved
  the ability of the states to establish schools and provide teacher training by transferring material and financial resources from
  the federal to the state governments (Rodriguez 1987: 78). Other research has found that fiscal decentralization has been asso-
  ciated with changes in patterns of accountability and entrepreneurship, which tend to promote good governance in rural local
  governments (Moreno 2013). Conditional funds were found to be important in promoting both accountability and entrepreneur-
  ship, while unconditional funds have a negative effect on accountability and no effect on entrepreneurship. Being closer to local
  populations has allowed for more efficient allocation of resources in rural municipalities (Moreno 2013).

245.	 There have been previous efforts to create administrative mechanisms that reach beyond local authority or state
      boundaries in Malaysia. One of the earliest examples is the Klang Valley, where the recommendation for a planning
      and coordination body was made as early as 1972. Over time, this has taken the forms of the Klang Valley Regional
      Planning Council and then the Klang Valley Regional Development Committee supported by a Klang Valley Plan-
      ning Secretariat (Mohamed Ishak 1989 cited in Zuliana Zakaria 2003). However, the Council reportedly went for a
      decade without actually meeting (King 2008: 118), and it has been noted that a key weakness of this arrangement
      is the fact that the Committee is advisory in nature, has not been established by statute, and has no legal powers
      (Sharifah Zubaidah 2007).

246.	 As for the five regional economic corridors discussed in Section 4.2.2, the corridor authorities’ efforts so far have
      been primarily geared toward economic development, serving mainly a coordination function and promoting

                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                   4. Strengthening Institutions for City Competitiveness  109 
        investment. At the same time, service delivery remains with local authorities and/or federal government agencies.
        The most influential of all the regional authorities is IRDA in Iskandar Malaysia, due to the strong financial and
        investment commitments from Khazanah Nasional Berhad. Iskandar Malaysia’s success, in terms of the number of
        key projects that have been implemented, suggests that initiatives toward metropolitan-level governance are only
        effective if coupled with public funding and clear delegation of responsibilities. That Iskandar Malaysia lies within
        the jurisdiction of only one state, Johor, may also simplify potential land and administrative matters.

247.	 Based on the current size and characteristics of Malaysian cities, the metropolitan-level function is envisioned
      to involve mainly planning, instead of implementation and maintenance. Based on recent experience with the
      regional corridor authorities, as well as with planning for the Klang Valley, a basic principle would be for the
      metropolitan agency to have a legal mandate and powers, to include making and approving plans. Nonetheless,
      each metropolitan area should, if required, collectively determine the metropolitan governance model that best
      suits its needs based on its current conditions and growth aspirations. Substantial theoretical and empirical work
      has been done in recent years on various aspects of metropolitan governance (for example, Bahl et al 2013). Box
      4-4 gives the metropolitan management example of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority in the UK, which
      holds some relevance for Malaysia. Refer to Annex 3-4 for more details and examples of metropolitan governance
      arrangements.


   Box 4-4	 The Greater Manchester Combined Authority

   The United Kingdom has recently instituted two programs of regional coordination to unite local governments around certain
   service delivery functions. One of the measures, Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs), cover all English local authorities of which
   there are currently 39. LEPs are meant to provide strategic leadership in local economic priorities. Combined Authorities are
   legal bodies that can be set up by two or more contiguous local authorities and are a more formal alternative.

   The Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) was established in 2011 to cover ten local authorities. The GMCA works
   with its constituent local authorities in economic development and transport. This includes developing a Greater Manchester
   Strategy; an economic strategy; and establishing Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) as GMCA’s executive body for trans-
   port functions (Smith 2012). The GMCA, TfGM and other Greater Manchester institutions have clearly defined roles based on
   agreements between local authorities. Notable achievements of GMCA include: major refurbishment of the Bolton and Rochdale
   railway stations as part of a metropolitan region transport investment program worth £30 million, and permission for the building
   of up to 7,000 new homes by 2017. It is also a testament to the GMCA’s success that London-style powers are now being recom-
   mended for Manchester, as the first U.K. city to follow London’s regional government model (Wilcox et al 2014: 11).


248.	 The creation of metropolitan agencies should not add to institutional complexity, but rather should afford the oppor-
      tunity for rationalization and improved coordination. Metropolitan agencies could be formed to enable coordination
      across several local authorities in a conurbation, which could coordinate specific functions such as urban trans-
      port, solid waste collection and disposal, or emergency services/first responders. These agencies could facilitate
      improved planning and coordination for an entire metropolitan area, while also providing for more effective prioriti-
      zation of local needs. Local authorities could assess availability of services before development approvals are given,
      and approvals for development projects could take into account zoning and land use plans at the local level. This
      would help local authorities manage urban growth more effectively, rather than in an ad-hoc or reactive manner.

249.	 Moving toward metropolitan governance is also consistent with the recommendations of the recently completed
      World Bank RAS on Crafting Malaysia’s National Transport Strategy. It recommends that a lead urban transport
      agency act as a “sub-national integrator” at the conurbation level for planning and decision-making, to include:



110  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
      land public transport, conurbation highways, major federal and state roads within the conurbation, and other trans-
      port planning (World Bank 2015: 237-238). Such an approach is also reflected in Table 4-9.

250.	 A Phased Approach for Institutional Restructuring. A pilot service has been identified to consider the practical steps
      for implementing these changes, Box 4-5 discusses the case of planning and maintenance of roads. As an example
      of a service with low barriers to restructuring, this case highlights issues faced in road infrastructure planning and
      maintenance, and the proposed restructuring and implementation strategies needed to improve this service.

251.	 In seeking to implement localization of service delivery, the recommended phased approach consists of a pilot
      phase, a middle phase, and a final phase. One selected service would be restructured initially to assess the poten-
      tial and the effectiveness of localizing more services given Malaysia’s particular circumstances.

252.	 Pilot Phase. In the pilot phase, the road maintenance function could be devolved to local authorities in one city
      to assess effectiveness before proceeding to other services. The pilot phase could consist of the following steps:

      »» Establish a comprehensive baseline with appropriate data on road maintenance quality. (This would build on the
         existing MARRIS database, and be informed by the findings of the National Transport Strategy which is advised
         by the World Bank.)

      »» Transfer all road maintenance grants (including MARRIS funds) for all federal, state and municipal roads in the
         pilot area to the local authority. The local authority thus becomes solely accountable for all road maintenance
         within its boundaries.

      »» Realign the roles of federal agencies and units to focus on monitoring and evaluation. In this case JKR or the lead
         urban transport agency would monitor the performance of road maintenance.

      »» JKR/the lead urban transport agency would conduct regular surveys of road conditions. This would allow for
         comparison of the effectiveness of road maintenance and road conditions across different local authorities in the
         same metropolitan area (e.g. comparing MBPJ, DBKL, MPSJ).

      »» JKR/the lead urban transport agency would also undertake data collection and mapping of all roads to allow for
         future planning of road construction.

      »» If the results of this pilot phase prove successful, similar initiatives would be rolled out for other services to
         move toward the “ideal” institutional structure in Box 4-5 .

253.	 Subsequent Phases. The timeline and scope for subsequent phases is summarized in Table 4-10.

254.	 City Performance Indicators. To ensure that the institutional restructuring is effectively improving urban service
      delivery, each service needs to be matched with:

      »» one or more quantitative indicators that measure the level of service delivery;

      »» a baseline survey on service delivery based on the current institutional structure; and

      »» regular surveys/data gathering to allow for adequate measurement and follow-up actions.




                                                                                                                                         
                                                                             4. Strengthening Institutions for City Competitiveness  111 
   Box 4-5	 Road infrastructure planning and maintenance

   Historically, road planning and maintenance have been managed according to the three tiers of government: federal, state and
   local. This structure remains despite the increasing complexity of road networks, especially in the Greater Kuala Lumpur area.
   The private sector has also been actively involved, creating many private tolled highways that are often not part of a coherent
   metropolitan level plan. Interviews with federal and local government agencies have revealed that these private highways have
   burdened existing federal and local road networks. Yet, there is currently no intra-urban road network plan coordinated across all
   levels of government for Greater Kuala Lumpur.

   Responsibilities for road maintenance are often unclear to the general public. Local governments are pressured by the public to
   maintain all federal, state and municipal roads in their respective areas, despite not receiving adequate funds to do so.

   Planning: According to Figure 4-3, intra-urban road infrastructure planning does not involve national-level interest and does not
   offer large economies of scale, but does involve externalities beyond municipal boundaries. It is therefore advisable for planning
   to be conducted at the metropolitan or state level. For a metropolitan area like Greater Kuala Lumpur that cuts across ten local
   authority areas and two states, a metropolitan governance entity (or lead urban transport agency as “integrator”) could be formed
   and empowered with a budget for effective road network planning and implementation control.

   Maintenance: To improve accountability and service delivery for road maintenance in cities, responsibility for maintenance of
   all public roads within a local authority’s boundaries could be given to the local authority. It would also need sufficient funding
   to maintain this infrastructure. The local authority would then function as a “supplier” agency for the service in question. The
   federal agencies previously responsible for maintaining federal roads could be tasked with monitoring road maintenance perfor-
   mance across local authorities.

255.	 Malaysia already has systems in place for measuring urban service delivery by local authorities. The Ministry of
      Urban Well-being, Housing and Local Government’s Star Rating System for Local Authorities (SPB-PBT) consists of
      more than 350 indicators, across four areas: management, core services, customer management, and community
      involvement. Based on composite scores across all indicators, individual local authorities receive ratings of up to
      five stars once every two years. Based on KPKT’s experience, SPB-PBT has been effective in motivating improved
      performance among local authorities (“what gets rated gets done”), and is complemented by a training and capac-
      ity building program for those issues where local authorities need support. Another building block is the MURN-
      Inets indicator system (see separate report on city indicators delivered through this study). ISO 37120 is the new
      international standard for city indicators. It offers Malaysia the opportunity to benchmark performance in specific
      areas, and to identify good practices from leading cities worldwide.

4.3.2	 Strengthening capacities of local authorities

256.	 The recommendations in this section relate directly to financial and technical constraints facing local authorities
      as identified in Section 4.2.2. Increasing the capacity of local authorities would involve improvements to urban ser-
      vice delivery by addressing their local plans, own-source revenues, fiscal transfers and staffing. Capacity building
      should also be undertaken to ensure that standards across local authorities are at similarly robust levels.

257.	 KPKT is currently developing the PBT Transformation Plan, within which key focus areas include: developing human
      capital at the PBT level; increasing efficiency of service delivery; strengthening PBT finances; enhancing well-being
      of the people; improving engagement at all levels; and more effective communications. The World Bank team dis-
      cussed the recommendations in this section with KPKT. These recommendations are based on a broadly common
      understanding of the challenges facing local authorities in Malaysia.

258.	 Local Plans. The core of the urban planning system at the local level is the local plan. A key priority would be to
      remove any barriers that prevent the local planning system from working effectively, the way it was designed to.
      Therefore, a specific recommendation of this study is that all local plans should be gazetted. Existing legal provi-
      sions for enabling variations to gazette plans, and for periodic revisions to those plans, should be followed.

259.	 Property Assessments. The core of local authority finances in Malaysia, and the principal form of own-source rev-
      enue, is property assessment (tax). Malaysia should seek to remove political or other barriers that have prevented
      the property assessment system from working effectively. Safeguard mechanisms could be built into the system
      to avoid placing sudden or excessive property tax burdens on individual property owners, particularly lower and
      middle income groups. Where applicable, steps could include:

      »» Revise the assessment rates – on a gradual, step-wise basis, to reach a specified target percentage of assessed
         value over an extended period, e.g. 10 years. Plan for periodic revisions of rates to allow the system to work as
         intended.

      »» Update assessed values where needed to reflect actual market values/annual rental values in a more timely and
         realistic manner.

      »» Build in a protection mechanism designed to shield existing property owners from sudden or excessive increases
         in the amount of property tax that is actually payable. This could be an automatic rebate system that caps the
         annual increase in actual assessment paid, notwithstanding increases in assessed values and assessment rates.
         New owners could be required to pay the full rates, information on which would be transparent as part of the
         property purchase transaction.

260.	 Fiscal Transfers. The system of fiscal transfers to local authorities could be revised to be more transparent, pre-
      dictable and formula-based.

      »» In line with current Malaysian fiscal practice, the Federal Grant to local authorities could be divided into two
         components: the Development Grant (DG - for investment/development expenditure) and the Operational Grant
         (OG - for operational expenditure).

      »» For those services devolved according to the process described in Section 4.3.1, ensure that comprehensive
         technical guidelines from relevant line ministries are in place, particularly for managing how the OG may be
         spent. Sufficient technical capacity building should be offered to local authority staff to familiarize them with all
         technical guidelines so they can perform their functions well.


                                                                                                                                          
                                                                              4. Strengthening Institutions for City Competitiveness  113 
        »» Local authorities may prioritize and decide on spending for specific projects or activities at the local level, pro-
           vided that this is in compliance with federal guidelines.

        »» The specific formula for this Federal Grant, including constituent variables, would need to be carefully considered
           to take into account the diversity of needs across the country. At least part of the grant formula can be based on
           “needs”, including variables such as level of development, extent of land area, and number of residents served.

        »» In principle, part of the Federal Grant could also be structured as a performance-based grant, see Box 4-6 for an
           overview of the literature on the use and effectiveness of performance-based grants. Based on selected relevant
           indicators for the devolved service in question, incentive payments in the form of increased grant funding could
           be given to local authorities for excellent performance (see section 4.3.1 on city performance indicators, includ-
           ing the role of existing Malaysian indicator systems such as SPB-PBT and MURNInets). KPKT could be the lead
           agency for monitoring the performance of local authorities through the indicator systems, with technical inputs
           on specific sectors from relevant line ministries.

261.	 Local authority staffing. To improve the technical capacity of local authorities, options could be pursued to improve
      their ability to recruit, motivate and retain the right staff. These could include: relaxing some centralized staffing
      controls, and providing more opportunities for career development by enabling local authority staff to rotate and
      serve at other government agencies. As mentioned above, the PBT Transformation Plan that is under development
      by KPKT includes a focus on developing human capital at the PBT level, and represents a key opportunity in this
      regard.



   Box 4-6	 Performance-based Grants (PGs)

   Performance-based grants (PGs) are the most widely-discussed fiscal incentive instrument in the literature (Steffensen 2005,
   UNDP 2005, Steffensen 2006). PGs try to promote a positive change in some aspect of local government performance by making
   access to a grant conditional on the achievement of certain goals. Local governments must show that they have met the goals
   established in the grant legislation or rules.

   The literature shows that PGs have been generally successful. Some factors have been important for promoting good results:
   capacity building policies; good performance indicators; flexibility in the usage of funds; commitment and credibility of all actors
   involved (citizens, NGOs, local governments, central governments and other contributing agencies/donors); involvement of all
   key stakeholders in grant implementation schemes; and strong communication of the objectives behind the system.

   International experience has shown that PG initiatives are more likely to be successful when their design includes capacity-build-
   ing components. This capacity building component should be relatively easy for local governments to access, unlike the grant
   component, which should be harder to obtain.

   Good performance indicators are fundamental to the functioning of the PG system. Strong indicators simplify the assessment of
   progress and strengthen the overall credibility of the PG system.

   Flexibility in the usage of funds has proven to be important because it fosters efficiency in resource allocation based on local pri-
   orities and preferences. There is a trade-off between central government targets and flexibility. Those systems which have more
   autonomy in resource utilization tend to achieve stronger performance measures.

114  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
5.	 INCLUSIVE CITIES: AT-RISK YOUTH IN URBAN AREAS

5.1	 Introduction

5.1.1	 Background

262.	 Malaysia, like many countries in Asia and beyond, has a young and increasingly urban population. Movement from
      rural to urban areas is significant and has been taking place in Malaysia for decades. In the last five years alone,
      about 2.5 percent of households moved from rural to urban areas. It is estimated that by 2020 some 75 percent of
      Malaysia’s population will live in urban centers (World Bank 2011). Young people between the ages of 20 and 30
      account for the largest share of internal rural to urban migration.

263.	 Experience with urbanization across the globe shows that for people living in urban areas, urbanization can offer
      both opportunities and challenges (World Bank 2013a). People move from rural areas to cities seeking jobs, busi-
      ness opportunities, and education. Cities offer a different social milieu, where old norms and values may give way
      to new and more diverse ones. New social networks and social capital are built in the cities, and professional and
      neighborhood groups can become new sources of social support.

264.	 But urbanization can also come with significant challenges, and cities can grow in different ways. Inequality can
      be especially stark in urban areas and can contribute to social exclusion and poverty (World Bank 2013a). Mental
      health issues, substance abuse, and poor security all affect people in urban areas more than in rural areas.

265.	 Urbanization also brings challenges for city and municipal authorities. Urban growth is typically unplanned, cre-
      ating serious problems for service delivery and housing. Access to basic services and assets becomes the focus
      around which social exclusion pivots, often intensifying preexisting disadvantages. Households that are not poor
      may also end up living in substandard, crowded housing, with poor access to basic services, surrounded by crime.

266.	 Polarization within cities is one of the root causes of the crime that has beset many cities in Latin America and the
      Caribbean and Africa. Over time, violence can become institutionalized, making it difficult to dismantle. Gover-
      nance challenges in urban areas contribute to some groups feeling left out and having few opportunities for voice
      and redress. Land mafia, drug lords, and other extortionists often step into the role of what should have been core
      state functions. The slums in Brazil, knows as favelas, are a case in point. Recognizing that favelas are a visual
      testimony to the country’s inequality, Brazil adopted a mantra of moving from “divided cities” to integrated cities
      (World Bank 2013a).

267.	 Malaysia’s vision is to enhance the competitiveness of its cities, both in terms of economic activity and livability. A
      key aspect of a city’s competitiveness is its ability to be socially inclusive and allowing all its people, including the
      disadvantaged, to share in and to contribute to rising prosperity.

268.	 The Economic Planning Unit (EPU) in Malaysia has identified the following eight key challenges associated with
      urbanization in Malaysia (Rahamat 2013).

      »» Social exclusion – urban poverty and vulnerable groups

      »» Inadequate social amenities – education and health



                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                   5. Inclusive Cities: At-Risk Youth in Urban Areas  115 
        »» Inadequate housing – low and middle income groups

        »» Unemployment – youth

        »» High cost of living – food and fuel prices

        »» Crime rate – street crime

        »» Environment – congestion and pollution

        »» Illegal foreign workers

269.	 Using a social exclusion lens, this section of the report, explores three of the challenges identified by the EPU: i)
      social exclusion, ii) youth; and iii) crime rates. It focuses on how these challenges relate to livability and compet-
      itiveness of cities.

270.	 It is understood that there are several vulnerable and socially-excluded groups living in Malaysian cities, for exam-
      ple the elderly, disabled, and single-headed households. Because of the relationship between competitive cities
      and at-risk youth however, this study focused specifically on at-risk youth in urban areas.

271.	 In this report, youth-at-risk are defined as individuals between the ages of 15 and 29 who face “environmental,
      social, and family conditions” that hinder their personal development and their successful integration into society
      as productive citizens (World Bank 2008). This group has a greater propensity than their peers to engage in or be
      subject to risky behavior, including school absenteeism, delinquency, violence, and substance use and abuse.


   Box 5-1	 Definition: social exclusion

   The concept of social exclusion is defined in the literature as a multidimensional process, which weakens the links between indi-
   viduals and the rest of society (Rodgers and others 1997). These links can take on an economic, political, socio-cultural, and a
   spatial perspective.

   The economic dimension refers to processes that hinder individuals from gaining financial resources through labor markets,
   credit and insurance markets, basic services, and land, thus causing them to be poor.

   The political dimension of exclusion refers to individuals’ lacking the ability to enable them to exercise their legal freedoms and
   participate in decision-making. Political exclusion particularly affects the poor as they do not have the same access to education
   and information which would empower them to take full advantage of their rights under the law.

   The socio-cultural dimension of exclusion is linked to the isolation of specific groups through education, language, and ethnic
   practices.

   Finally, the spatial or geographic perspective refers to the negative effect of location externalities on individual attributes. The
   more dimensions by which a person is excluded, the more vulnerable this person becomes.

   Socially-excluded groups exist in all countries, rich and poor, democratic and not. They are often hidden from public censuses,
   made invisible by their fear of attacks.

116  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
272.	 Global evidence shows that the consequences of these risky kinds of behavior are extremely costly to young people
      in terms of their ability to make a successful transition to adulthood. The evidence includes such negative out-
      comes as school dropout, unemployment, addiction, incarceration, and social exclusion (World Bank 2006). But
      taking care of such young people is also costly to society, including in terms of increased crime rates and loss of
      productive members of society. Risky behaviors also have spill-over effects and can create a sense of insecurity
      among the population at large and negative perceptions about cities’ livability.

273.	 While there are studies focusing on youth in urban areas in Malaysia, detailed information about the characteristics
      of the at-risk youth, factors contributing to their social exclusion, and details of the policy implications are more
      limited. The links between a growing group of at-risk youth in urban areas and cities’ competitiveness, crime rates
      and overall livability are also not well researched and the policy implications as they pertain to Malaysia are not
      well understood. This study attempts to fill these knowledge gaps. Specifically, this component aims to:

          »» identify at-risk youth living in urban areas, and analyze the key issues they face, in particular as they relate to
             cities’ competitiveness and overall livability;

          »» review programs and policies aimed at addressing inclusive cities; and

          »» draw on international experience, propose policies and priority areas of intervention.

5.1.2	 Methodology

274.	 The methodology used relied on qualitative methods, including focus group discussions, key-informant interviews
      and round table discussions with key stakeholders. Three hundred and sixty-eight youth participated in the focus
      group discussions.42 Four aspects of exclusion were explored: i) economic; ii) political; iii) socio-cultural; and, iv)
      spatial.

275.	 The work included a literature review, as well as a mapping of government policies and programs. A review of
      media coverage on the topic of crime and violence in urban areas was also undertaken as part of this component.
      In response to the EPU’s request, six urban areas were covered by the study: Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Johor Bahru,
      Kuantan, Kota Kinabalu and Kuching.

      Box 5-2	 Qualitative research methods

      Qualitative methods refer to a range of data collection and analysis techniques that use purposive sampling and semi-structured,
      open-ended interviews. These techniques, which produce and analyze textual data, allow for more in-depth analysis of social,
      political, and economic processes (Krishna and Shrader 2000; Hentschel 1999). Qualitative methods and open-ended responses
      tilt the balance of power and expertise away from the researcher toward respondents and community members.

      The team for this component included Datuk Dr. Denison Jayasooria, Principal Research Fellow, Institute of Ethnic Studies (KITA), National
      University of Malaysia, who was tasked with leading the qualitative work and facilitating the focus group discussions. This team also
      included a local firm (C-CODES) led by Ms. Jasmine Adaickalam, tasked with organizing the focus group discussions and prepare the
      research reports. Two local researchers Mr. Kai Shen Lim and Ms. Justina Chen, were engaged to review government programs and to review
      media coverage. Overall the component was led by Helene Carlsson Rex, Senior Social Development Specialist at the World Bank.


                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                5. Inclusive Cities: At-Risk Youth in Urban Areas  117 
276.	 The target for the focus group discussions was youth-at-risk in urban areas between 15 and 29 years old. This age
      bracket corresponds to a subset of the standard Malaysian categorization of youth.43 It was selected because of
      the large number of youth within this age bracket who are living in urban areas and because they are particularly
      vulnerable to unemployment and dropping out of school. Given that they are in their formative years, this age group
      is also considered to be more receptive to engaging in anti-social behavior and crime.

277.	 The research aimed to capture the views of youth-at-risk and therefore targeted young people living in low-income
      neighborhoods, and youth who had been in trouble with the police and dropped out of school.

278.	 Table 5-1 summarizes the key characteristics of the youth targeted for this study.


Table 5-1	 Characteristics of at-risk youth targeted for the qualitative work
                                                              Key Characteristics
                        Youth who have been detained at juvenile or correction centers or prisons
                        Youth who are drug addicts and those in drug rehabilitation centers
                        Living in high-rise flat or low-cost public housing or squatters
                        Youth in informal groups or gangs in the low-income neighborhoods
                        Dropped out of school or educational underachievers within the school system
                        Youth out of prison, juvenile centers or detention or rehabilitation centers
                        Groups at high risk to drugs, alcohol, abuse and gangs
                        Youth in motorcycle racing gangs
                        Homeless youth and living on the streets


279.	 Initially the study focused on male youths only, however that was expanded to include female youths. This wider
      focus allowed the study to highlight the different issues facing young women and men living in the six urban areas
      covered by the report.

280.	 The focus group discussions covered the main ethnic groups including Malay, Indian, Chinese, as well as smaller
      indigenous groups from Sabah and the Orang Aslis. Most participants in the focus groups were Malay and Indian.

281.	 Within the six conurbations covered in the study, the specific locations for the qualitative work were selected to
      allow a diverse set of issues to be highlighted. For example, a focus was placed on the Perai area of Penang, where
      the major public and low-cost flats are located, as opposed to focusing on the whole state of Penang. By focusing
      on Kota Kinabalu in Sabah, which has a large immigrant population, the views of immigrants were also captured.
      Table 5-2 provides an overview of the six urban areas included in the qualitative work.

282.	 The local research team worked with youth-based organizations and local community organizations in identifying
      the target groups for the focus group discussions (FGDs) in the different locations. To ensure that the perspectives
      of different groups of youth were captured, several focus group discussions were undertaken in each city. The
      research team visited the youth groups in their own locations and always conducted FGDs in local settings, for
      example at the local community centers.

283.	 In total 21 focus group discussions were undertaken in six cities between September and November 2014, captur-
      ing the views of 368 young men and women. In addition to focus group discussions, six roundtable discussions
      were organized with key stakeholders in all six cities and two meetings with stakeholders were arranged in Kuala
      Lumpur.


5.2	 Context: Vulnerable Youth in Malaysian Cities

5.2.1	 Poverty rates are lower in urban areas but income inequality is higher

284.	 Malaysia has made great strides in reducing poverty in recent decades. The poverty headcount ratio decreased
      from 37.7 percent in the 1970s to 1.7 percent in 2012. Poverty is more pronounced in rural areas, and pockets of
      poverty are more common among the non-Malay Bumiputera ethnic groups. Urban poverty has remained largely
      unchanged, with the incidence of poverty in urban areas at around two percent over the last decade, and decreas-
      ing to one percent in 2012.

285.	 Despite progress, significant challenges remain and Malaysia’s income distribution record is less impressive than
      its history of poverty reduction. The Gini coefficient in Malaysia is one of the highest in Asia, close to levels observed
      in Latin America (World Bank 2010). Inequality is comparatively high, especially in cities: the Gini-coefficient is
      0.417 in urban areas compared to 0.382 in rural areas. UN HABITAT’s City Prosperity Index finds Kuala Lumpur to
      be one of “the most unequal cities in the developing world” in terms of income (UNHSP 2013).

286.	 Poverty estimates in Malaysia exclude foreign laborers. This group is estimated to make up around 15 percent
      of the Malaysian workforce. Recent figures show that there are about 1.8 million registered, or regular, foreign
      workers and the rest (about one million to two million) are unregistered (undocumented or irregular) workers. In
      2011 about 82 percent of foreigners were in the Peninsula, and the rest were in Sabah/Labuan and Sarawak. If this
      segment of the population is not included in the statistics, calculations will likely underestimate the number of
      people who actually live in poverty in Malaysia. Many of them earn low wages and many of them live in urban areas
      (World Bank 2013b).

5.2.2	 A young and growing urban population

287.	 Malaysia has experienced rapid rates of urbanization and population growth over the past 50 years. The total
      population of Malaysia increased four times from 7.4 million in 1957 to 29.9 million in 2013. The urban population
      now comprises more than 73 percent of the country’s total population (compared to 43 percent of total population
      in 2000).

288.	 Like many other countries, Malaysia is experiencing a youth bulge, with a large concentration of young people
      between the ages of 20 and 29. In 2013, this group constituted about 20 percent of Malaysia’s population (GoM
      2013).

289.	 In Malaysia, young people aged 20-29 also account for the largest share of internal rural to urban migration. In
      2000 over 20 percent of 25 to 29 year-olds emigrated away from their place of origin, and that age cohort makes
      up 19.5 percent of all internal migrants (GoM 2005)

290.	 Despite the prospect of earning higher wages, young low-skilled people who have moved into urban areas often
      face many difficulties, including finding a suitable job and adequate housing. Low-skilled laborers have more of
      these problems than skilled laborers because there are more of these workers and they are also competing with
      foreign workers. There is more competition for a limited number of decently remunerated low-skill jobs (World
      Bank 2013b). Analysis of urban poverty in Malaysia has shown that the formerly rural households who have moved
      to urban areas tend to have low levels of education and tend to become employed in low-earning sectors where
      skill requirements are lower. Accordingly to World Bank calculations, about 60 percent of migrants work as manual
      laborers (in manufacturing, construction, and services), and only about 20 percent work in civil service jobs (GoM
      2005).

5.2.3	 Unemployment in Malaysia is highest among young job seekers

291.	 Unemployment in Malaysia is highest among young job seekers. In 2011, the unemployment rate for Malaysians
      aged 25 and above was remarkably low (around 1.8 – 0.9 percent). However, the same was not true for younger
      Malaysians. In 2011, of the total labor force aged 15 to 24, 23.4 percent were willing to work but did not have a job,
      and the largest number of unemployed were aged 20-24.

292.	 The rate of under-employment (i.e. people working less than 30 hours a week but willing to work more) for those
      aged between 15 and 24 was 15.1 percent in 2012 compared to 4.6 percent overall, suggesting that the young are
      also disproportionally represented in this group (World Bank 2013c).

5.2.4	 Challenges with young people dropping out of school

293.	 Malaysia’s education system has achieved extensive coverage. Enrolment at the primary level has been nearly-uni-
      versal for decades while secondary enrolment has also expanded rapidly. The share of the labor force with a sec-
      ondary education increased from 37 percent in 1982 to 58 percent in 2012. Challenges remain with coverage at
      secondary level, and boys from poorer households in particular are increasingly at risk of dropping out of school
      (World Bank 2013c). Malaysia’s 80 percent secondary enrolment is still below the average for middle-income coun-
      tries (83 percent) and high-income OECD economies (100 percent).

294.	 Non-attendance in school is closely related to socio-economic status. Children of families in the richest 20 percent
      of the wealth distribution are nearly twice as likely to be enrolled in post-secondary education compared to those
      in the bottom 20 percent.

295.	 Gender differences are pronounced, with higher completion rates among women. Data shows that boys are more
      likely than girls to drop out of school. For example, 94 percent of girls complete secondary school, compared to 86
      percent of boys (MoE c.2010).44

296.	 Data provided by the Ministry of Education (MoE) for this study indicate that there was an increase in the number of
      students not in school due to poverty (from 298,800 in 2011 to 303,550 in 2013), despite aid and relief programs
      provided by the Malaysian Government.



44	
      Note: Data refers to MoE schools only. More than 86% of the secondary school age population attended MoE schools and
      about 6.7% attended non-MoE schools.

297.	 According to MoE, there was also a significant increase in national examination failures (Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia
      SPM) from 2012 to 2013, largely due to the new policy requiring a compulsory pass in History, in addition to Malay.
      In 2011, about 35,700 students failed the SPM, compared with 59,000 in 2013.45 Representatives from State
      Education Departments informed the research team that this trend will likely continue as the Ministry has recently
      announced that English will also be made a compulsory pass subject for the national examination.

298.	 Inequalities in educational attainment based on place of dwelling, gender or ethnicity are dwarfed by socio-eco-
      nomic disparities. Rural areas lag behind urban areas in educational attainment, especially at post-secondary
      levels. By tertiary level, the urban-rural gap for this cohort has grown to around 20 percentage points. The educa-
      tional attainment of Malays and Chinese is comparable, while attainment of non-Malay Bumiputeras lag somewhat
      starting with secondary education. However, socio-economic differences are by far the most pronounced.

5.2.5	 Crime and Violence: disconnect between perceptions and data

299.	 Data from the Royal Malaysian Police shows that the overall number of violent crimes has decreased since 2008. A
      closer look at the data however, reveals that there was a slight increase in the violent crime rate between 2011 and
      2012, and that the number of murders also increased between 2011 and 2012 (from 446 to 602). Statistics from
      the Royal Malaysian Police indicate a continued and decreasing trend in property crimes from 173,828 in 2008 to
      123,719 in 2012.

300.	 Disaggregated crime data for the different urban areas is not available, which makes it difficult to assess trends
      over time. There are also concerns about the quality and reliability of this data, which may mask a more accurate
      picture of what is happening on the ground as it only refers to crimes that were reported to the police. This is com-
      mon in other countries with the number of actual crimes typically under-reported.

301.	 Interestingly, there seems to be a disconnect between the perceptions of crime and security and the official crime
      statistics. The official crime statistics seem to point to a decreasing trend. However, a review of media coverage of
      crime and security shows that general perceptions indicate an increase in crime rates and that cities in Malaysia
      are perceived as becoming increasingly unsafe.

303.	 Numbeo reports that the level of perceived crime in Kuala Lumpur is 82.6, and that crime has increased over the
      past three years (85.93). Using this data, the perceived crime rate in Kuala Lumpur is considerably higher than in
      for example Hanoi (42.86) and Bangkok (34.46).

      Numbeo is crowd sourced global database of reported consumer prices, perceived crime rates, quality of health care, pollution and traffic
      quality. The data points is based on self-reporting and perceptions of visitors of Numbeo’s website in the past three years. It claims to
      be the biggest website of its kind with more than 1.3 million data points collected as of August 2014. Numbeo has been used as a source

      Crime Index is an estimation of overall level of crime in a given city or a country. Crime Levels up to 50 are reasonable, and crime index
      levels more than 100 are too high. Safety index is the opposite of crime index. If the city has a high safety index, it is considered very safe.

304.	 A recent study on housing for the bottom 50 percent income group in Malaysia, by EPU and UNDP, also confirms
      that security is a key concern among low income groups in cities (EPU and UNDP 2015). Focus group discussions
      undertaken as part of this study raised public safety as an issue in a number of communities. In fact, when asked
      to rank their suggestions for how to improve their living environment, improvements to public safety was the top
      priority among participants in the survey.



  Box 5-3	 Media reports on crime and violence

  A review of media reports on crime and violence in urban centers in Malaysia revealed that crime hotspots in Malaysian cities are
  usually in wealthier suburbs and central business districts.

  Greater Kuala Lumpur. In many suburban areas in the Greater KL conurbation, wealthy neighborhoods have begun to gate their
  communities. The demand for personal guards has soared, with the number of certified security companies nationwide more than
  tripling over the past decade from 200 to 712 according to the Security Services Association of Malaysia (Fuller 2013). In Kuala
  Lumpur, wealthier areas such as Bangsar, Bukit Damansara, Jalan Bukit Bintang and Jalan Sultan Ismail have witnessed frequent
  criminal activity in recent years48.

  Penang. Penang’s crime index fell 23 percent for the first six weeks of 2014 compared to 2013, but recent media articles show
  that organized crime is common in Penang.

  Kuantan. From January to March 2014, the media reported an increase of five percent in crime rates in Kuantan. Petty crimes such
  as vehicle and petty thefts make up the bulk of criminal activity in Pahang. Snatch theft cases are typically conducted in suburban
  areas such as Taman Impian, while vehicle theft cases are more frequent in central business districts.

  Johor Bahru. Toward the end of 2013, Johor police admitted that the state’s capital city remained a crime hotspot, despite improv-
  ing crime statistics in the peninsula’s southern-most state. Seventy percent of crime in the state happens in Johor Bahru. Crime
  in Johor is a topic of keen interest among Singaporeans, who regularly visit the state by car. Singaporeans tend to be the target of
  kidnappers and robbers, with numerous cases reported over the years.

   Kuching. Crime hotspots include central urban areas in Kuching such as the Kuching Central Business District, Stampin (sub-
   urban area), and Batu Kawah. A Member of Parliament claimed that people in Kuching have been reduced to living in fear of
   being robbed and mugged even in broad daylight. Snatch thieves can get away scot-free, he added, and he attributes this to the
   ineffectiveness of the police force. “These culprits have become more daring and were roaming around looking for victims even
   in broad daylight” (Fernandez, 2014).

   Kota Kinabalu. The crime index in Kota Kinabalu city increased by 9.59 percent, to 377 cases in the first three months of this year
   from 344 in the corresponding period last year. The Kota Kinabalu district police chief said the cases reported this year included
   motorcycle theft (43 cases), theft of heavy vehicles like vans and lorries (16 cases), house break-ins (seven), and robbery and
   snatch theft (five).

   Box 5-4	 Registered gangs in Malaysia

   Gangs in Malaysia have been linked to a wide array of crimes such as armed robberies, drug and prostitution rings, loan-shark-
   ing, gambling and extortion rackets, even contract killings. There are a total of 285 registered gangs in Malaysia, 162 of which
   are subsidiaries from the Ang Beng Hoay and Wah Kee secret society, while 92 are thug gangs. Thug gangs have a total of 3,497
   registered members, the majority of whom are Indian youths. In 2013, police identified 49 illegal gangs nationwide, with nearly
   40,000 known members. It should be noted that the numbers cited only reflect gang members who are registered, and thus, the
   actual number of members could be significantly higher. Sin Chew Daily reported that there are more than a hundred secret soci-
   eties and gangs in the country, many of which have departed from their erstwhile closely-knit organisational structures with many
   gang members splintering to form independent units, resulting in a single gang splitting into many smaller factions49. Malaysia
   has a number-coded underworld with names such as “04”, “08”, and “Double 7”.

   Statistically, Indians in Malaysia represent approximately 7 percent of the total population. However, Indian youths have earned
   a reputation of being involved in criminal activities and other forms of social predicaments such as alcoholism and drug abuse.
   This view is further amplified by the frequency with which Indian youths are arrested for crimes and are detained under pre-
   ventive laws. For instance, according to crime statistics provided by the Royal Malaysia Police College Kuala Lumpur (RMPCKL),
   in 2005, 702 individuals were detained under preventive laws for violent crime at Simpang Renggam Rehabillitation Centre in
   Johor, 316 of which were Indian50. Furthermore, of the 2471 total inmates that were detained under the Emergency Ordinance
   1969, 35 percent were Indian51.

   East, a weekly television program, broadcast by Al Jazeera, spoke exclusively with a senior gang member, who reveals how these
   criminal organizations provide protection and work opportunities for many Malaysians who live in poverty. The gangs prey on
   vulnerable youngsters with the lure of fast money and bonds of brotherhood. These secret societies have been using online media
   to recruit new members in recent years and Facebook has now become an important tool for roping in youngsters52. These secret
   societies source their recruits mainly from schools, especially secondary schools. Most of the gang members are in their 20s and
   30s, and they run in a pyramidal mode by collecting protection money from students to sustain the gangs’ operations.

306.	 In addition to focus group discussions, six roundtable discussions were organized with key stakeholders in all six
      cities. Stakeholders were selected based on their engagement with at-risk youth in urban areas and included state
      level representatives from agencies such as the Police, Department of Social Welfare, Ministry of Education, Pris-
      ons Department, Department of Youth & Sports, Anti-Drug Agency and National Unity Department, as well as key
      civil society organizations. The agencies made verbal reports and shared basic information on youth-related issues.
      They also shared their own reflections on the causes and the type of interventions government agencies could use
      to mitigate the negative aspects.

5.3.1	 Voices of the youth: findings from focus group discussions with young people

307.	 The following four areas of inquiry related to social exclusion in urban areas were explored through the focus group
      discussions.

        »» Economic aspects. Limited access to labor markets and financial resources; and costs of living.

        »» Political aspects. Limited opportunities to participate in decision-making, and making their voices heard.

        »» Socio-cultural aspects. The isolation of specific groups through education, language and ethnic practices.

        »» Spatial aspect. How housing impacts social exclusion in terms of location, mobility, neighborhood set up/acces-
           sibility, and social dynamics (such as gangs, crime, peer pressure).

        The following sections provide a summary of the main issues related to each of the aspects.

5.3.1.1	 Economic aspects

308.	 The focus group discussions highlighted key economic aspects that contribute to vulnerability and to a sense of
      social exclusion. These aspects pertain both to the individual as well as to the broader family.

310.	 Participants commonly noted that it was difficult to find low-skilled              Homeless male youth, Kuala Lumpur
      jobs as they are competing with foreigners. In many cases, their par-
      ents are also competing with foreign workers, making it challenging to find secure income for the family.

311.	 Poverty and rising costs of living. Low wages among the youth and their families coupled with the rising cost of
      living made life difficult for many. In many cases, the parents have to work overtime and have multiple jobs in order
      to make ends meet, leaving some of the youth without much adult supervision and guidance and putting strain on
      the family.

312.	 Work patterns and dysfunctional families. The young people in the focus groups commonly cited dysfunctional
      families as a major root cause of their problems. In some cases, families had major conflicts which were unresolved.
      In many cases one parent (or both) was absent and the youth were left unsupervised. These dysfunctional families
      were not able to provide a safe and nurturing environment for the youth. Urbanization also directly impacts the
      family through work patterns. Both parents could be working double shifts leaving little time for the children. The
      researchers were told children and young people were out very late in the night as parents were not home or the
      home was not suitable for the number of people living there.

5.3.1.2	 Political aspects

313.	 Political aspects, especially related to the young boys’ and girls’ abil-
      ity to make their voices heard and to have some level of influence on “We feel that our views are not being heard in
      decision making, were identified as key challenges and contributed the local community decision-making process.”
      to their sense of exclusion.                                              Young male, Sungai Pinang Focus Group Discussion


314.	 Limited voice in decision-making. In a number of discussions the
      young people highlighted that they had very few opportunities to play a role in neighborhood committees as older
      people were in control. They also noted that in places of worship and in religious organizations, especially at the
      local community level, their views were not listened to or taken into consideration.

315.	 Lack of involvement in local issues. Another related aspect is the lack of opportunities for youth to be involved in
      local issues. With Malaysia’s top-down decision-making process, opportunities for local community engagement
      are limited; and for youth the opportunities are even fewer. FGD participants noted that this top-down approach
      makes them feel that they do not have a direct say in local matters and that their opinions do not matter.

5.3.1.3	 Socio-cultural aspects

316.	 Socio-cultural aspects, in particular difficulties in accessing the education system, were identified as key contrib-
      uting factors to vulnerability and exclusion. Major recurring themes in all six cities were related to discipline in
      school resulting in absenteeism and expulsion.

128  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
  Box 5-5	 Examples of limited voice among youth

  At the Alor Akar flats in Kuantan, the young people complained that the badminton hall in their neighborhood is not properly
  managed by the local authority. Bookings for the facility are made in the city, and the majority of people who use the facility are
  non-local residents. Local young people complained that the rental fee was too high and that the facility was not available for
  their use.

  In another neighborhood also in Kuantan, at the low-cost housing area at Semambu, the research team was told land was ear-
  marked for a football field in 2002, but to-date the local authority has not released it for the local community’s use. In addition,
  local business places were being rented to outsiders although local micro and small business people would have liked to avail
  of the rental locations. They expressed frustration on local issues, and noted that the local leadership also feels helpless as city
  council officials are not sufficiently responsive.


317.	 School absenteeism. The research team was repeatedly told that a major area of concern is school absenteeism.
      The youths’ perspective is that school is boring or class is not interesting as the teacher is just reading the lesson
      and not catering to their learning needs. In other cases, students expressed that they did not like the teachers as
      they were always scolding or nagging them. Peer pressure to go to a cyber café, hang out with friends doing noth-
      ing, were also cited as reasons for school absenteeism.

318.	 Family-related problems, for example parental conflicts, divorce or weak supervision were also highlighted as con-
      tributing factors to school absenteeism. School policy is to send a letter to the parents informing them about dis-
      ciplinary issues. However, for students from dysfunctional families, chances are low that the parents will actually
      act on the letter and come to school to solve the issues. In many cases, parents may work double shifts and do not
      have the opportunity to take time off work to engage. In other cases, the parents may be absent or have personal
      issues such as alcoholism, which make it difficult for them to engage.

319.	 School expulsion. Youth being expelled from school is another area of concern as it risks leaving a growing number
      of students with limited skills and few opportunities. Students are expelled for serious offences such as fighting or
      being absent from school for more than 60 days without notifying the school officially. Three registered letters are
      sent to the home address. If parents respond there will be a review. However if no parent turns up, the policy is to
      expel the student. One estimate given was that only about 30 percent of parents turn up in response to such letters.

                                                   320.	 The research team did not receive actual numbers of expelled
“We know of about 50 students that have been             students but everywhere the team went they met young people
sacked from school for one reason or the other.          from all ethnic groups (mostly Malays and Indians but also Chi-

                                                         grades of the school down.

321.	 While many of the youths interviewed seemed to dislike the Malaysian system of classroom education, they also
      seemed to have tremendous talent and interest in other non-academic areas such as sports, performing arts and
      (for girls) design. Furthermore, the group work and in particular the names they gave themselves in these groups
      (such as Born to Win, King Leader, Always Success, We are Malaysians) revealed that many of them aspired to be
      leaders and successful citizens and do not want to be seen as failures. Despite this, information from focus group



                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                         5. Inclusive Cities: At-Risk Youth in Urban Areas  129 
          discussions suggested that the formal Malaysian education system provides few opportunities to cater to special
          talents, and may not be optimally set up to create a supportive learning environment for these students.

322.	 Underperforming in school. According to the questionnaire provided to the youth, more than half (54 percent) of
      them had an education level of only PMR (form 3) or below, which is significantly below the national average of 80
      percent. This lack of secondary level education will almost certainly affect their opportunities in the job market and
      can lead to inter-generational poverty unless measures are taken.

323.	 The Ministry of Education provided the research team with figures
      for students who did not receive the SPM Certificate. According to “Parents are either authoritarian or they are
      this data, a total of 131,432 students did not secure a certificate in leaving their children to total freedom without

      a failure can have a long-term, damaging impact on students. There
      is a risk that Malaysia’s long-term goal of being a high-income and developed society will be hampered by not
      providing enough opportunities through training or schooling to enable these youths to realize their full potential.

324.	 Authorities seem to be quick to criminalize young people who are involved in anti-social behavior. Police reports,
      arrests and lock-up incidents have created bad experiences for many of the young people that the research team
      encountered. In some cases, however, the youths interviewed felt that being arrested elevated their position among
      other young people as being bad and therefore earned them respect among their peers.

325.	 The study team noted that there seems to be very little cooperation between authorities such as police, social work-
      ers and teachers, at the district level or even city level on the matter of school expulsion. Agencies, such as schools
      and social services, seem to be operating independently of each other. For example, the police seems to be called
      in when the school is unable to manage the situation. Likewise parents too seem quick in going to the police and
      lodging a police report instead of seeking to resolve it within the school or community system.

326.	 Ethnic dimensions. Experiences and stories of discrimination came primarily from Indian and Orang Asli youths.
      Some of them expressed strong distrust of institutions and did not see much hope for the future.

327.	 Stateless children. The team also encountered the particular issues facing stateless young people (for example in
      Kota Kinabalu FGD). These are young people born in Malaysia to parents who originally came from neighboring
      countries. While they have birth certificates, they are not regarded as citizens of Malaysia, and therefore cannot be
      enrolled in the local schools. ABIM, a youth organization, informed the team about refugees in Kuantan among the
      Rohingya, and noted that these children and young people do not have access to education in national schools and
      they cannot afford private or international schools.

328.	 Gender issues. Many of the issues facing boys and girls were similar however, safety concerns were brought up
      more often by the girls.

329.	 In Penang, teenage pregnancy was identified as a key issue. While no numbers were provided, the research team
      was also told that the age of pregnant girls seems to be falling. Some of the girls also noted that they had fewer

5.3.1.4	 Spatial aspects

330.	 The majority of the urban poor and low income families are living
      in public housing. This public housing tends to be in high-rise flats: “I like to do photography as my profession. But
      about 17 to 21 stories for newer construction, and 5-story walk-up my parents do not encourage me to do that.

      low-rise constructions called Rumah Murah. While each location is
      different, many of the issues facing residents of public housing are similar. Issues related to affordable housing and
      its ability to meet the needs of its residents include: lack of appropriate community spaces, poor maintenance, and
      limited public transportation. Safety concerns, including the prominence of crime and violence were also identified
      in the focus group discussions.

331.	 Limited public facilities. The focus group discussions noted that the architecture of a built-up area is not always
      neighborhood friendly, i.e. it does not foster closer ties with other families through adequate meeting spaces and
      facilities. In a majority of cases the built-up space is congested. Basic facilities such as community meeting spaces
      for gatherings, workshops, recreation and outdoor activities are in short supply, and as a result the residents’
      needs for public spaces are not met. Some residents also complained about the lack of space for local shops and
      commercial activities.

332.	 Lack of maintenance. The focus group discussions also revealed issues related to the lack of proper maintenance
      of public spaces. Residents complained about the lack of garbage clearance, elevator maintenance and broken
      lights in the corridors. The research team noted that the Telok Indah Flats in Perai, Penang were visibly dirty and
      only one elevator was operating. One major concern was the responsibility for neighborhood maintenance and the
      physical structure of buildings and public spaces. In some cases, it seems that the local authority takes a direct
      role if the housing is provided by them. However, in cases when housing is privately constructed, it seemed less
      clear; the owners, the residents’ association and the Joint Management Board have to negotiate the maintenance
      arrangements.

333.	 Safety concerns. Safety and security concerns were also raised, in
      particular by the girls. Young girls in Rumah Pangsa Larkin Johor          How can we go back to the village when we
      spoke of the walk-way from the bus stop to the flats, as well as tak-      don’t have money to take back home? Our

                                                                                 to go back.
334.	 Limited public transport. In several cases, the discussions also               Focus Group Discussions, KL Urban Fellowship
      highlighted the limitations of public transport and how it was diffi-
      cult to meet the residents’ transportation needs. For example, lack of school buses made it difficult for students to
      get to school. It was also difficult for residents to travel to and from work, because the bus service stopped at 6pm
      in some areas. In Kota Kinabalu, the youth reasoned that the prevalence of motorcycle theft was a result of poor
      public transportation system. Specifically, people would steal motorcycles in order to get to places as no public
      transportation system was available.

335.	 Lack of sense of belonging and preparedness for urban life. In some of the flats visited, the residents spoke about
      the lack of a sense of belonging to the urban flats as another area of concern. While geographical closeness is a
      feature of the flats, the neighborhood experience is very different to that of the village. Many of the flats are known
      by block numbers rather than names. Furthermore, the flats are small and may lack privacy. Some people prefer to
      spend time hanging-out on the streets, because there is not enough space in the flats.

336.	 Several of the people interviewed noted that they were not well prepared for life in the city, and did not know where
      to seek help. The sense of loss about life in the city was particularly expressed in Kota Kinabalu among the young
      rural people from Sabah who had just come to the city. The longing to experience a new way of living in the city,
      but without adult supervision and support, had driven many of them to alcohol, drugs and engagement in criminal
      activities. This resulted in teen pregnancy, unemployment, and a sense of social exclusion. Several young people
      had friends who had committed suicide. When asked why they did not go back home to the village, they said that
      they did not want to be seen as a failure by their families back home.

337.	 Crime and violence. Issues related to crime and violence were fre-
      quently brought up during the focus group discussions. Gangs are “When they are high on drugs, they break
      common in low-cost housing. Many noted that they had seen gang public facilities, they commit snatch theft and
      fights and experienced trauma as a consequence.                    robbery.”
                                                                                         Participant in Kota Kinabalu Focus Group

        ple, all those interviewed said that participants were aware of gang
        activities, drug use and fights. Similarly in Kota Kinabalu, participants mentioned that in their neighborhood, high-
        risk youth are involved in illegal motorcycle racing, shop and house break-ins, motorcycle theft, fights, drugs,
        gambling and vandalism. They further elaborated that boys as young as 12 years old were smoking and on drugs.

339.	 While few of the focus group discussants would admit in the survey
      that they had been involved in any criminal activities themselves,       “If I had not been able to enroll in My Skills

      as key concerns. Furthermore, the Housing study also recognizes the way in which the members of a community
      related to each other and to the larger community around them as a critically important ingredient toward creating
      a functioning and livable community (EPU and UNDP 2015).

5.3.2	 Agencies’ voices: findings from roundtable discussions with agencies

341.	 The research team conducted round1

342.	 table discussions with agencies in the six different locations, and arranged two roundtable discussions in Kuala
      Lumpur. A review of Malaysian policies targeting at-risk youth in urban areas was also undertaken as part of the
      research. The main findings are summarized below.

5.3.2.1	 Disconnect between needs and current programs

343.	 Findings from the qualitative research highlight that there is a strong need for programs that specifically target
      the needs of at-risk youth in urban areas. However, there seems to be a disconnect between the programs offered,
      the uptake and the targeting, leaving many young people without proper access to services. In general, the review
      shows that a small number of initiatives specifically target at-risk youth.

344.	 The 10th Malaysia Plan. A focus on youth is included in the 10th Malaysia Plan, however, the focus on youth-at-risk
      is less pronounced. Specifically, the plan called for the establishment of the Cabinet Committee on Youth Develop-
      ment chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister to coordinate and update the delivery system for youth development
      programs as well as to streamline the roles and responsibilities of the ministries involved. The plan asks for the
      expansion of the National Youth Skills Institute (IKBN) to provide greater study options and to offer soft skills train-
      ing; the aim is to help expand entrepreneurship training and awareness programs and to expand the RELA Youth
      Squad to promote volunteerism. The plan stresses the need to improve and broaden preventive and rehabilitation
      programs to avoid social ills.


                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                        5. Inclusive Cities: At-Risk Youth in Urban Areas  133 
345.	 Federal Programs. A mapping of federal programs shows that few youth programs target youth-at-risk. Examples of
      such targeted programs include the SAY1M program for student dropouts, which offers courses to secure employ-
      ment; the 1Asrama hostels where children enjoy a more conducive learning environment and receive learning sup-
      port; and the Youth Skills Training Program provided by various institutions with fully subsidized fees and costs. In
      2014, the Ministry of Youth and Sport initiated the Padu project, in an effort to support troubled youth.

346.	 Civil Society Programs. Federal programs are complemented by civil society organizations’ programs. These pro-
      vide more targeted support but still on a limited scale. The study team encountered only two organizations that
      directly target high-risk youths: the My Skills Foundation and the Johor-based Alpha Skills Academy. Both these have
      a two-fold approach of addressing character/values development as well as skills training. Both organizations pro-
      vide strong handholding and mentoring for the young person.

347.	 Gaps in targeting. The qualitative research confirmed previous research in Malaysia (Jayasooria 2008), which has
      identified that high-risk youths tend to fall into five major categories.

        »» Level 1: at-risk youths in high-risk neighborhoods,

        »» Level 2: at-risk to social ills, anti-social behavior, crime & gangs - early signs show inclination through manifes-
           tations of anti-social behavior,

        »» Level 3: youths in the community who are active in crime but have not been arrested or charged. Could have been
           picked up or are under investigation/documented,

        »» Level 4: youth in custody (remand pending investigation, charged & waiting trial, in prison after sentence or
           juvenile correction centers),

        »» Level 5: youths in post-custody stage (out of detention/prison). After-care issues are important to ensure reof-
           fending is minimized.

348.	 In general, agencies seem to be focusing on youths at level 1. However, even at this level, there seems to be a lack
      of a targeted approach as the participants mostly self-select into the activities offered. At level 4, participation is
      involuntary and young people are under the custody of the state. Major gaps appear at levels 2, 3 and 5 as there is
      no specific targeting of at-risk youth or any focused approaches in reaching out to them.

349.	 The scope of this study did not allow for a detailed assessment of the support provided by federal agencies and civil
      society organizations (CSOs) to at-risk youth. Based on the mapping exercise and combined with the focus group
      and roundtable discussions, one can conclude that there is a need to enhance the support to youth-at-risk in urban
      areas and to sharpen the targeting.

5.3.2.2	 Opportunities for strengthening agency coordination

350.	 Recognizing the different agencies’ mandates, the qualitative work revealed that there are opportunities to
      strengthen coordination between the different agencies that work with at-risk youth, and to make the approach
      toward at-risk youth more holistic and results-oriented.

351.	 In general, the Ministry of Education (MoE) addresses poor discipline and absenteeism in schools. The Department
      of Social Work (DoSW) intervenes when the courts take action and place the young person in DoSW’s care. The
      police acts when there is a crime. The Department of Youth Services (DoYS) undertakes preventive programs for


134  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
      all youths, but does not facilitate police action. The Anti-Drug agency intervenes on drug matters. However, overall
      coordination between the different agencies seems to be ineffective. Improved coordination between the different
      agencies and the CSOs would allow for more timely interventions, as well as for a more rapid response to early
      warning signals (such as school absenteeism). By avoiding duplication and focusing on more targeted and results-
      based interventions, it is also possible that the programs could become more cost-effective.

5.3.2.3	 Limited community-based interventions

352.	 The study team also discovered that there are opportunities to further strengthen community- or neighbor-
      hood-based interventions. There seems to be an institutional approach through schools, youth centers and youth
      organizations but these are not necessarily directed at the local neighborhood in the community.

353.	 For example, many agencies seem to focus their youth-related activities at the district or national levels. This
      approach does not optimize resources in those neighborhoods where youths are living. There also seems to be
      a tendency to use national or district youth organizations rather than to work closely with neighborhood groups,
      resulting in local groups’ remaining unorganized and isolated, with limited capacity.

354.	 From the discussions with agency representatives, there seems to be a lack of social workers or community workers
      trained to work with at-risk youth. While many social workers may have some social science or counselling expo-
      sure, they may not be fully equipped to handle youth-related issues and concerns.




  Box 5-6	 Youth programming case studies

  MySkills Foundation

  MySkills is a non-profit foundation sanctioned by the Ministry of Domestic Trade, Cooperatives and Consumerism that runs a
  transformation program for at-risk youth. The MySkills program adopts a two-pronged approach that incorporates vocational
  skills training and holistic transformation. The vocational skills training sessions are provided by PRIMUS (a skills training insti-
  tution accredited by the Ministry of Human Resources) and culminate in the award of a Malaysia Skills Certificate (SKM). This
  certificate is accredited by the Department of Skills Development and is recognized by industries in Malaysia. Students are also
  awarded a Transformation Certificate that recognizes their growth in terms of emotional intelligence, life management and social
  skills. The first group of students graduated in 2011. Currently, there are 189 students enrolled with MySkills.

  Upon enrolment, students are provided food and accommodation in addition to their formal education. Students are grouped into
  either pre-vocational (aged 13-14) or vocational (aged 15-25) classes. Vocational training lasts for two years, after which students
  are assisted in job placements with industry partners. MySkills continues to monitor the performance of students once they have
  entered the job market.

  The program has been successful in reaching out and transforming marginalized Indian youth who might otherwise be involved
  in a variety of social ills and are lacking in formal education. An interview with one employer who currently has seven MySkills
  graduates in his company reveals that he is largely satisfied with their performance.

  MySkills is unique in its approach to mentoring and engaging with individual students. Most students come from difficult back-
  grounds of poverty or family neglect. It is extremely difficult for these students to make a true change to their lives without
  additional support. Each staff member in MySkills is assigned a few students to mentor. They actively engage with the students,
  conducting home visits and celebrating festivals with them. They also provide follow-up support to students who have entered
  the job market through routine phone-calls and engagement with their employers.



                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                          5. Inclusive Cities: At-Risk Youth in Urban Areas  135 
   Box 5-6	 Continued

   There are no formalized enrolment drives for prospective students but student numbers continue to grow through word-of-mouth
   referrals. Most schools around Klang have also taken to referring high-risk students to MySkills. MySkills students are not required
   to pay any fees when they join, although families may make a small contribution if they are able to. It is largely funded through
   public donations. Some funds are also received from the EPU. MySkills has also begun to undertake advocacy work with the Min-
   istry of Youth, using their vast experience to advise on policy initiatives for high-risk youth.

   The Initiative by society for the Kuching urban poor

   The 1AZAM Training Centre, which is run by the Society for the Kuching Urban Poor (SKUP) and operating in Kuching, is another
   good practice example. SKUP is working in Kampung Kudei, which is one of the few remnant squatter areas situated in Jalan
   Nenas Barat, Kuching. Conditions in this kampung are poor: the kampung does not have water, electricity or even proper roads.
   The houses are mere shacks with zinc sheet roofing sitting on stilts. Most of these squatter dwellers are Iban/Dayak Muslims, with
   a few Chinese and Indians.

   SKUP has started a community skills center to train poor people from the area in sewing and baking skills. The e-Kasih poor are
   trained in one of these two skills and then they are launched into their business with 1AZAM funding or are encouraged to work
   in a related field. Training funds come from the 1AZAM allocation provided under the National Key Result Area – Low Income
   Households (NKRA LIH) through its lead agency, the Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development.

   While they undertake intense training for two months, certain enablers are put into place to help support the trainee and their
   family. Currently 55 families are supported and they are given food packets for five days per week while they are undergoing
   training. They are given a monthly allowance of RM500.00 to meet their family needs, as they do not have the ability to earn
   an income during the training period. SKUP also provides each trainee with RM4.00 per day to meet transportation costs. While
   training, their young children are accommodated in the nursery adjacent to the training center and they are also given food. These
   families are linked to private sector companies that want to fulfil their corporate social responsibilities (CSR). After training, the
   idea is that the participants will be able to earn a decent income, at which point the enabling assistance such as food and allow-
   ance is withdrawn and is provided for another set of trainees.

   PADU

   In an effort to help troubled youth, the Ministry of Youth and Sport’s PADU project was introduced in 2014 as part of the Govern-
   ment’s inclusivity agenda. The project objectives are to develop troubled youths’ potential to achieve some quality in their life;
   to provide opportunities for beneficial activities and to guide the youths in avoiding criminal activities. The target group consists
   of youth between the ages of 15 and 17, who are at risk of committing crime, recently involved in crime or with a history of com-
   mitting crime. The implementation period is three months, and includes emotional support, talent and career development. It
   operates in 8 states, with 45 participants per state, and involves 15 youth workers per state.




5.4	 Recommendations: Making Cities More Inclusive by Supporting at-risk Youth

355.	 The qualitative field work focused on identifying the key challenges facing young women and men in urban areas
      along four aspects: economic, political, socio-cultural, and spatial. This section of the report identifies a set of
      recommendations that cut across the four aspects, drawing upon international experiences.

5.4.1	 Recommendation 1: support policies aimed at keeping children in school

356.	 Support policies to encourage secondary school enrollment. This research has identified major challenges
      associated with young people not staying in school. Such challenges include: missed economic opportunities; a

136  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
      tendency to anti-social behavior; and a sense of social exclusion and failure among drop-outs. The implementation
      of policies to encourage secondary school enrollment and completion are therefore critical as secondary school
      completion is one of the most important preventive investments a country can make for at-risk youth, both in terms
      of improving their educational outcomes and of reducing most kinds of risky behavior (Cunningham 2007).

357.	 International experience shows that completing secondary school can serve as one of the strongest protective
      factors for young people in two key ways: through the knowledge and skills that they acquire, which enable them
      to make informed decisions; and through the sense of connectedness that students often feel with adults in the
      school. In essence, schools are one of the primary protective factors for young people because of their dual function
      as provider of hard skills and knowledge via traditional educational curricula and of soft skills such as life skills,
      and the sense of the connectedness that they offer young people (World Bank 2008).

358.	 Promote connection to school. A key aspect of keeping young people in school is to promote their connection to
      school, and initiatives that promote connection to school should be supported. School connectedness is based on
      the idea that most young people want the support and approval of a caring adult and, if this is received as a result
      of positive behavior, then the young person will likely behave in a positive manner. Furthermore, young people
      behave more positively in an environment where they feel safe and accepted. Schools can promote connectedness
      and can model positive behavior; when this is combined with caring parents or other adults outside of the school,
      risky behavior is likely to be reduced.

359.	 Studies in the United States, Brazil, the Caribbean, Mexico, Honduras, and Chile have shown that increasing stu-
      dents’ sense of connection to their schools decreases absenteeism, fighting, bullying, and vandalism. A sense of
      connection also promotes educational motivation and classroom engagement; it improves academic performance,
      and increases school attendance and completion rates. Students who feel more connected to their schools are
      less likely than others to exhibit disruptive and violent behavior; carry or use a weapon; experiment with illegal
      substances; smoke cigarettes; drink to the point of becoming intoxicated; appear emotionally distressed; consider
      or attempt suicide; or engage in sexual intercourse at an early age. Commitment to school is one of the few factors
      that has been found to reduce exposure to specific risks for violence (Farringdon 1999). Conversely, school failure
      and dropout are risk factors for youth violence and delinquency (World Bank 2006).

360.	 The following are examples of policies that have been shown to be successful in improving secondary school enroll-
      ment and completion, particularly when implemented together.

      »» Take steps to improve school quality: strengthen the connection between school and work; improve teacher
         training and reduce teacher absenteeism; involve the local community as monitors of both teacher and student
         performance; initiate peer tutoring programs; introduce innovative programming, such as non-formal education;
         eliminate grade repetition; improve the quality of infrastructure; and make schools safe and accessible to students.

      »» Provide financial incentives: conditional cash transfers (CCTs), school vouchers, loans, grants, individual learn-
         ing accounts, school supplies, and free public transportation to school have been found to increase demand for
         secondary school and offset competing demands such as work and child care. Financial incentives provided
         through Mexico’s conditional cash transfer program, Oportunidades, for example, increased secondary enroll-
         ment rates by 8 percent. The transition to secondary school was increased by nearly 20 percent, and grade
         attainment by 10 percent; there were significantly larger effects for girls than for boys (Guarcello 2006).

      »» Incorporate life skills training into all interventions targeted to at-risk youth to prevent them from drop-
         ping out of school. This should also prepare them for further education and/or job training, and increase their

                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                  5. Inclusive Cities: At-Risk Youth in Urban Areas  137 
           overall employability. Evaluations of life skills programs from around the world have found that knowledge of
           life skills can be a protective factor during adolescence by delaying the onset of drug use, preventing risky sex-
           ual behavior, promoting anger management, improving academic performance, and enhancing social judgment
           (Mangrulkar 2001).

        »» Use students as a captive audience in schools to give them key risk-prevention messages; use national and local
           media to expose young people to social marketing messages and reduce their exposure to negative behavior.

361.	 A key concern for Malaysia is the tendency to expel youth from school. The current disciplinary policies should be
      revised, with the objective of keeping youth in school or placing them in alternative schools.


   Box 5-7	 Strategies to keep students in school: Experiences from the USA

   The United States First Things First program is predicated on the importance of training teachers to create supportive and engaged
   schools and classrooms. The program’s goal is to produce respectful and productive student-teacher relationships through inten-
   sive, high-quality teaching that combines high expectations of students with continued support from teachers. The program
   creates high, clear, and fair academic and behavioral standards by establishing small learning communities. The program also
   includes a family advocacy component and ongoing student performance assessments. Evaluations of the program have shown
   that it has led to reduced suspensions; and increased attendance, parent participation, and reading achievement.

   The Sponsor-A-Scholar Program run by Philadelphia Futures in Pennsylvania provides students from public high schools with
   long-term mentoring (during high school and for one year after graduation); academic support; help with the college application
   process; and financial support for college. Evaluations of the program have found significant positive effects on high school test
   scores and college attendance.

   Evaluations of the U.S. program Project GRAD, a comprehensive dropout prevention program that combines college preparation
   and scholarships, academic support, case management, family strengthening, and school/classroom environment, showed gains
   in college attendance, as well as in math and reading test scores, it also showed decreases in discipline referrals for participating
   students, compared to those in control schools.

   The Quantum Opportunities Program in the United States provides financial incentives to young people to participate in school; it
   also provides mentoring, academic support, afterschool activities, and life skills development. Evaluations of the program have
   shown that participants were: more likely to graduate; had higher educational expectations; were more likely to attend post-sec-
   ondary schools; and became teen parents less often than those in the control group.

   The Career Academy Program combines academic and technical curricula based on specific career paths and establishes partner-
   ships with local employers to provide work-based learning opportunities. An experimental study of outcomes of this program
   have shown that participants were less likely to drop out of school; had better attendance; and earned more credits than those
   in the control group.

5.4.2	 Recommendation 2: support programs that specifically target at-risk youth in urban areas

362.	 The qualitative work highlighted a need to provide targeted interventions aimed at vulnerable youth in urban
      areas. While Malaysia has been spending a significant amount of its fiscal resources on social protection, much of
      that has been spent on non-targeted programs, and therefore seems to have had insufficient focus on vulnerable
      youths (World Bank 2015b). Some programs that are designed to be targeted do not always succeed in reaching the
      vulnerable and the poor; and the current system seems to lack a clearly articulated design principle and a coherent

138  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
      structure (World Bank 2015b). As a result, there is a proliferation of programs that address specific issues in a
      piecemeal way, leading to fragmented policy and administration, with limited impact on the ground.

363.	 Future strategies will need to establish targeted programs. These should be specifically aimed at vulnerable
      youth, including those in urban areas. Such programs should have clear objectives, based on a coherent structure
      and should focus on measuring impact on the ground. Currently successful cases include the Malaysia My Skills
      Foundation, PADU, and the 1AZAM Training Centre in Kuching; these can be used as a case studies, and potentially
      replicated and scaled-up.

364.	 International experience illustrates the types of programs that could be supported:

      »» Second chance programs. These would include literacy and comprehensive educational/job training programs
         that provide young people, who are not in school, with the opportunity to complete high school and enter tertiary
         education or the labor market. Second chance programs (also referred to as education equivalency programs)
         can help address the demand and supply-side constraints that have led many young people worldwide to dis-
         continue their education before acquiring the basic skills needed to succeed in work and life. The primary goal
         of these programs is to expand access to secondary education and training opportunities, but they also offer
         training in a mixture of basic and technical skills.

      »» Job training programs that include a mixture of technical skills, life skills and internships. Many young people
         have insufficient and inadequate skills to compete in the formal labor market. This is often because of difficulties
         in accessing secondary education and job training opportunities; secondary school curricula also need to make
         sure they are more relevant to the labor market.

      »» Youth service programs or public sector internships; and self-employment programs. The principle of youth
         service is to view young people as assets or resources. Youth service can be defined as “an organized period of
         substantial engagement, where young people are contributing to their local, national, or world community, in
         exchange for minimal or no monetary contribution to the participant.” (Sherraden 2001).

      »» Mentoring programs in which caring adults mentor at-risk youth. Mentoring programs consist of assigning a
         caring adult to provide support and guidance to a young person in his or her personal and academic life. Mentor-
         ing programs can either be free-standing interventions or can be included in youth development programs. Inter-
         national experience indicates that mentoring programs have become an increasingly popular intervention for
         preventing or reducing risky behavior among young people on account of their simplicity, relatively low costs,
         and promising results in many risk areas. Risks are defined as being involved in crime and violence, substance
         abuse, and dropping out of school.

      »» Promotion of effective parenting as the cornerstone of policies for at-risk youth. Parental behavior, the family
         environment, and the extent to which young people feel connected to their parents (or to caregivers who fill
         a parent’s role) can be either one of the strongest protective factors in the lives of young people or one of the
         strongest risk factors. Evidence shows that investing in family-based parenting training that promotes positive,
         healthy, protective parent-child interactions can reduce: domestic violence; the extent to which young people
         associate with delinquent peers; alcohol and substance abuse; school dropouts; and arrests. Parent training is
         one of the most cost-effective ways to prevent risky behavior among young people (World Bank 2008a).

      »» Programs that focus on rehabilitation and on providing second chance opportunities. Evidence from interna-
         tional experience shows that the most effective way to reduce youth crime and violence is to concentrate on

                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                 5. Inclusive Cities: At-Risk Youth in Urban Areas  139 
   Box 5-8	 Examples of targeted programs and initiatives

   An evaluation of the European Union’s Second Chance Schools pilot project showed that it had a 94 percent success rate in getting
   some 4,000 young people who lack basic skills and qualifications back into school. Denmark’s Youth Unemployment Program aims
   to increase the employment possibilities available to unemployed, low-educated young people and to motivate them to return to
   school. An evaluation of the program showed that it has had small but positive short-term effects on employment.

   Comprehensive training programs for young people have shown promising results in terms of increased youth employment,
   particularly in developing countries. Much of the evidence for this finding has come from evaluations of Jóvenes programs, which
   were first introduced in Chile and have been replicated in several Latin American and Caribbean countries. This type of program
   targets disadvantaged young people and offers a package of classroom training, work experience, life skills, job search assistance,
   and counseling. Evaluations of these Jóvenes programs have found evidence that participants have a greater chance of finding
   employment and receiving higher earnings than those in control groups. In Argentina, for instance, the probability of adult female
   participants finding employment increased by 10 percent, while in Chile the program increased this probability by 21 percent,
   with even more significant results for young people under the age of 21. Similarly, participants’ earnings increased by about 10
   percent more than non-participants in Argentina and the Dominican Republic.

   An impact evaluation of the mentoring program Big Brothers/Big Sisters in the United States found that after spending 18 months
   with their mentors, the Little Brothers and Little Sisters were, in comparison to those in the control group, 46 percent less likely to
   begin using illegal drugs; 27 percent less likely to begin using alcohol; 52 percent less likely to skip school; 37 percent less likely
   to skip a class; they were more confident of their performance in schoolwork; one-third less likely to hit someone; and got along
   better with their families. The Little Brothers and Sisters met with their Big Brothers or Sisters about three times a month for an
   average of almost 12 months, with each meeting lasting about four hours.

   Jamaica’s National Youth Service program combines residence-based training in job and life skills with an internship for unem-
   ployed secondary school graduates. It was successful in helping 60 percent of its participants to find permanent employment or
   to continue their studies, compared with only 34 percent of similar young people in a control group.

   The Nurse-Family Partnership is one of the most successful nurse home visitation programs in the United States. It trains parents
   in how to provide responsible and competent care and increases their self-sufficiency by advising them in areas such as family
   planning, education, and employment. Studies have shown that this program has resulted in a 79 percent reduction in child abuse
   and neglect; a 56 percent decline in children running away from home; and reductions of 56 percent in arrests of children and
   alcohol consumption by children.

           rehabilitation and to provide second chance opportunities for young delinquents. Another key element of this
           approach is the introduction of graduated, or accountability-based, sanctions for first-time and minor repeat
           offenders (World Bank 2008a).

5.4.3	 Recommendation 3: invest in safe neighborhood programs

365.	 The qualitative work also revealed that local neighborhoods are sometimes not perceived to be safe, and moreover,
      some youths did not feel that neighborhoods catered to their specific needs and aspirations. The sense of belonging
      and connectedness to the local neighborhoods was weak, and many felt that they did not have a strong say in mat-
      ters related to their community. Residents, who are not at risk themselves, also expressed concerns about safety as
      cities were not perceived to be safe.

366.	 Specific recommendations include the following.

      »» Offer activities youth-friendly spaces within existing public buildings. Many schools and community-based
         organizations around the world have created programs with youth-friendly spaces, also referred to as out-of-
         school time (OST) or after-school programs. These programs offer safe places for young people to enjoy super-
         vised and productive activities; enhance their academic achievement; and develop positive relationships with
         adults and their peers (American Youth Policy Program 2006). There is a variety of OST programs but they all
         share the primary goal of preventing and/or greatly reducing the likelihood of young people engaging in risky or
         unproductive behavior.

      »» Invest in safe neighborhood programs by ensuring a strong police presence and fostering good police-commu-
         nity relations. Safe neighborhood programs work in many ways to reduce youth crime and violence. International
         experience shows that successful safe neighborhood programs include three key factors: i) problem-solving
         policing: citizens are involved in identifying community problems to assist the police with prevention, not just
         reaction to crime and violence; ii) community-based policing initiatives with supervised youth activities, includ-
         ing recreational activities, and iii) improved public services and local infrastructure, including appropriate light-
         ing, maintenance of common and public spaces, and provision of public transportation.

      »» Review the design of low-cost housing. The focus group discussion highlighted many issues with the design
         of low-cost housing in Malaysia. Issues include: high density; lack of community spaces; and poor public trans-
         portation. International experience shows that mobility and connectivity should be key goals of an affordable
         and socially inclusive housing policy. Housing mobility allows households to move to the location that best
         maximizes their welfare, which includes having access to basic services like schools, health care, child care
         and employment. A residential location that only allows access to a small segment of the job market within one
         hour’s commuting time is not helpful for households, even if it is theoretically affordable. See Annex 4-3 for a
         case study on affordable housing in England.

      »» To provide better access to Government services, consider establishing one-stop centers at the neighborhood
         level in high-risk communities, and allowing local people improved opportunities to liaise with all the relevant
         agencies. Consider appointing skilled community workers from the neighborhood, who can build trust, bring
         people together and serve to motivate and mobilize people. They should be able to target vulnerable youth and
         other vulnerable groups in the community, such as older or disabled people, or single-headed households.

5.4.4	 Recommendation 4: improve the coordination, design and implementation of interventions for youth-at-risk

367.	 This set of recommendations relates to concerns raised about shortcomings in terms of coordination of youth activ-
      ities in Malaysia. There is also concern regarding insufficient targeting of some of the programs in place, and lack
      of engagement particularly at the local level.

      »» Promote agency coordination. Given the multidimensional and cross-sectoral nature of youth interventions, it
         follows that the implementation of any such program will need to be well coordinated by government ministries
         across several different sectors. Each actor’s contribution to the youth portfolio can be maximized by assigning
         institutional responsibilities according to the expertise of each player. This will ensure that programs are imple-
         mented efficiently and that they have the greatest possible impact. Designing and implementing youth-at-risk
         projects involves many actors, including the federal government, local governments, civil society organizations,
         private sector organizations, families and communities, and even young people themselves. Each has a specific
         role to play based on the skills and the resources that they possess in the context of youth policy.

                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                  5. Inclusive Cities: At-Risk Youth in Urban Areas  141 
   Box 5-9	 Youth-Friendly Spaces

   Brazil’s Open Schools/Abrindo Espaços program provides a combination of academic, athletic, cultural, and work-related activities
   for young people after school and on weekends. It was able to achieve a 60 percent reduction in community violence, as well as
   reduced rates of sexual aggression, suicide, substance abuse, theft, and armed robbery in the participating state of Pernambuco.

   In Macedonia, spending time in community-based, youth-friendly spaces (Babylon Youth Centers) that provide non-formal educa-
   tion activities contributed to the reduction of violent behavior among young people, making them more employable than those
   who participated less or not at all in those programs. It also helped them become more active citizens.

   The Boys and Girls Clubs program in the United States is one of the longest-running after-school programs in the country. It offers
   academic assistance, cultural enrichment, drug and alcohol prevention, life skills training, mentoring, parent and community
   involvement, and sports and recreation. Evaluations found that this program has reduced delinquent behavior; increased aca-
   demic achievement and career aspirations; and improved attitudes toward school among participating young people.

   BEST is an after-school program in Los Angeles, USA that provides young people with a safe environment; educational enrichment
   programs; and recreational activities. Participants are primarily minority students and young people from low-income families.
   An evaluation of this program showed how a cohort of LA’s BEST students began third grade scoring below their peers in the
   comparison group but completed eighth grade scoring higher than their peers.

   The Birmingham Safer Neighbourhood Programme in England operates in eight high-crime and deprived areas of the city. The
   program relies on a community problem-solving approach called “Audit to Action.” After a steering committee conducts a com-
   prehensive audit of crime and safety problems in the area, action groups are formed to develop and implement solutions. As a
   result, community members collaborate with police officers in training sessions and mapping crime patterns; engage in commu-
   nity policing efforts; and provide a range of family, recreational, and educational activities aimed at at-risk youth. After two years,
   the program reduced youth crime by an average of 29 percent and crime in general by 14 percent.

        »» Establish an interagency task force on youth-at-risk. To promote interagency collaboration, an interagency task
           force on youth-at-risk could be set up at federal level as well as at city level. This could involve the Police, Min-
           istry of Education, Department of Social Welfare, Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Anti-Drug Agency, National
           Unity Department, representatives from civil society and the local authorities. Such a task force could focus on
           collecting data and monitoring outputs, as well as on coordination between agencies.

        »» Redistribute resources from ineffective programs to programs that work. Issues related to ineffective targeting
           and lack of rigorous evaluation were highlighted during the focus group and roundtable discussions. Programs
           targeting at-risk youth should be undertaken, and resources should be reallocated to programs that work. Pro-
           grams could also be redesigned to promote efficiency and encourage results on the ground. Programs should be
           selected based on cost-effectiveness and appropriate cost-benefit analyses.

        »» Promote opportunities to engage the community, local government and civil society organizations in the
           implementation of programs. Concerns were raised about the lack of opportunities for the local community to
           engage, and in particular for the youth themselves to have a strong voice in the design and implementation of
           programs that pertain to them. A strong focus on community ownership, participatory design and overall imple-
           mentation in response to the specific needs of the community will contribute to inclusive neighborhoods and
           cities. It will be essential to ensure that the participatory process is done in a way that allows all voices, includ-
           ing different ethnic groups, to be heard. It is also important to engage with local government and city councils,
           to ensure that they fulfill their mandates and respond to local needs.

5.4.5	 Recommendation 5: commission a follow-up and expanded study focusing on at-risk youth

368.	 The final recommendation addresses the knowledge gaps identified in this study. These knowledge gaps concern
      the targeting, cost-effectiveness and impact of the current strategy and current programs supporting at-risk youth.
      Questions were raised about how international experience can be applied to the Malaysia-specific context. This
      study was limited in scope and time. It covered six urban areas and the focus group discussions reached about 350
      young people. While the research team believes that the views expressed by the young people provide an accurate
      picture of the issues at stake, the sample was small and is not statistically significant.

369.	 To further inform Government policy and programs, and to provide more specific policy recommendations, the
      Government should consider expanding the scope of this study. A follow-up study is recommended. Any such study
      could include the following:

      »» a representative survey of youth: the survey would complement the qualitative work and provide statistically
         significant data.

      »» expansion of focus group discussions to other urban and peri-urban areas.

      »» a detailed review of government and civil society policy and programs relevant to youth-at-risk. This review
         could aim to identify good practice examples and opportunities to reallocate resources.

      »» extensive consideration of international experience; sharing of specific lessons and good practices as they relate
         to Malaysia, including monitoring and evaluation.

      »» a second phase could potentially include the design and implementation of pilot programs, as well as study visits
         and exchanges with other countries.

6.	 ACHIEVING A SYSTEM OF COMPETITIVE CITIES FOR
    MALAYSIA
370.	 Cities will play an ever increasing role in Malaysia’s national growth. Ensuring that these cities achieve their full
      potential as centers of economic prosperity that can compete internationally in attracting talent and investments,
      and provide social cohesion and elements of livability for residents, will require a sustained effort from the Gov-
      ernment of Malaysia to put in place the necessary enabling conditions. This report has highlighted many strong
      initiatives that the government can develop but there are also a number of challenges that will require attention
      going forward. Some of these challenges may be reliant on new initiatives or on new ways of implementing existing
      policies in order to have transformational impact.

371.	 Key areas identified in this report as priorities for addressing existing challenges are grouped into the following
      four broad categories.

      »» Fostering Agglomeration Economies and Urban Sustainability:
         Key challenges to address: Low economic density; sprawling urban form; high transport costs; and weakly integrated
         planning processes that limit the benefits of agglomeration and may impede a city’s structural transition to a
         knowledge-based service economy.

         •	 Increase the flexibility of land use in cities to facilitate increased economic density. More flexible and
            fine-grained planning guidelines and regulations can be applied for managing plot ratios and conversion of
            land uses. Policies can also be oriented toward encouraging redevelopment of land in existing built-up areas
            close to city centers, and discouraging urban sprawl. In some cities, such as Greater Kuala Lumpur, ensuring
            optimal land use near the city center can focus on existing areas of low-use land. Industrial activities can be
            relocated to medium and smaller-sized cities.

         •	 Improve urban connectivity through public transport. Although several large-scale initiatives are already
            underway to improve urban public transport, particularly in the Greater Kuala Lumpur area, this report con-
            firms that this should continue to be a high priority for all of Malaysia’s cities. Improving public transport
            and reducing private vehicle use would reduce congestion; improve air quality; and reduce transport energy
            consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. More can be done to encourage modal shift through policy and
            fiscal incentives, and to ensure that lower income, urban communities are adequately served. Outside of the
            largest cities, there is also a need to improve coverage and service levels in small and medium-sized cities/
            towns across the country.

      »» Strengthening Institutions for City Competitiveness
         Key challenges to address: Centralization of urban service delivery; lack of coordination in urban and spatial plan-
         ning; and financial and technical constraints at the level of local authorities which impact the effectiveness and effi-
         ciency of service delivery at the local level.

         •	 Enhance the capacities of local authorities. Strengthening the financial and technical capacities of local
            authorities (PBTs) could ensure optimized service delivery at the local level. Such capacities could include:
            own-source revenues from the property assessments, intergovernmental fiscal transfers such as the Federal
            Grants, and staffing.




                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                    5. Inclusive Cities: At-Risk Youth in Urban Areas  145 
            •	 Strengthen institutional arrangements for more effective urban planning. Urban planning can be more
               effectively integrated across all levels from national to state and local. It can also be integrated across sectors
               and the respective government agencies responsible for each area. Better integration of urban land use and
               urban transport planning, and gazetting the local plans, are prime examples.

            •	 Localize service delivery of selected urban services. The effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery
               could be achieved by shifting more management and decision-making roles to the local level, in tandem with
               an enhanced system of local performance indicators.

        »» Fostering Social Inclusion
           Key challenges to address: Inequality, particularly for youth at risk that can lead to social exclusion.

            •	 Strengthening programs targeting at-risk urban youth. There are a number of policies and targeted pro-
               grams aimed at enhancing support for at-risk urban youth that have had much success internationally. Some
               have helped to prevent school dropouts; encourage entry to the labor market; and facilitate inclusion through
               spatial integration (e.g. housing, transport). Improved coordination across government agencies involved
               in interventions for at-risk urban youth would also help to increase the effectiveness of these interventions.

        »» Promoting Innovation through Information
           Key challenges to address: Decision-making is not always based on relevant and up-to-date data which may affect the
           quality and transparency of decision-making.

            •	 Deepening open data policies. There are many opportunities for enhancing the use of open data from Gov-
               ernment and other sources to create new business opportunities, and to help solve civic problems in cities.

               As technology advances, cities around the world are experimenting with ways to use data from a number of
               sources to better understand their urban environment and their citizens, and to make the response to citizen
               needs more effective. As a technologically advanced society, Malaysia is in a good position to take advantage
               of new and innovative means of data-enabled urban management practices. Malaysian government agencies
               have already taken steps toward making their operations “smarter” using data. For example, the use of crime
               data in strategically locating police resources has led to a reduction in urban crime in Kuala Lumpur. Many
               Malaysia government agencies collect a large amount of data, some of which is available publicly online, and
               some agencies have even developed mobile phone applications to help citizens access these data.

               More could be done to use the data to facilitate collaborative decision-making between government agencies
               and between the government and citizens. The case studies included at the end of this Chapter provide
               examples of the ways in which governments around the world are attempting to use urban data in decision-
               making, and the ways in which a shift toward a more open and collaborative approach to data has helped
               these cities achieve their goals. They show that new technology and larger quantities of data by themselves
               cannot solve cities’ problems. Instead, they reflect a shift toward collaborative decision-making and openness
               of information, in which the new technologies and data are used to facilitate a dialogue between various
               agencies and citizens. See Boxes 6.1-6.5


6.1	 Implementation of Key Reforms

372.	 In order to prioritize key reforms, the government must consider feasibility to affect change; the impacts and
      benefits of expected results (or the cost of inaction); and urgency in terms of how critical it is to address the issues

       today. These criteria were used to qualitatively assess the policy recommendations included in this report, result-
       ing in a categorization of actions by high, medium, and low priority as described in Table 6-1.

373.	 Evidence from other countries suggests that implementation of these recommended actions will require strong
      political will and buy-in from line ministries and local governments. Policy changes in land markets are not easy
      anywhere as there is much at stake for citizens. For such major policy changes, a phased approach will be required.
      Other recommendations such as introducing, or scaling up, successful programs targeting youth-at-risk could be
      implemented with relative ease and could potentially have enormous benefits for addressing social problems and
      improving the overall competitiveness and livability of Malaysian cities.

374.	 The possible assignment of lead and partnering agencies for each recommended policy action is suggested below
      in Table 6-2. A possible time horizon required for implementing recommendations is presented; with short term
      envisioned as within 2 years, medium term, 2-5 years, and longer term being more than 5 years.

150  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
Box 6-1	 Improving Efficiency of City Management in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

In 2010, the mayor of Rio de Janeiro, together with IBM and Oracle, built a Centre of Operations, intended to be a “state of the
art situation room”. The center is used by decision-makers in the city to operate general city services, but mostly to coordinate
emergency response. Over time, the administration has begun to develop routine operational uses for the Centre of Operations.
For example the garbage trucks are coordinated through GPS, so in an emergency the trucks can be re-purposed for other tasks.
This helps the city manage resources and improve efficiency of response.

The Centre of Operations houses representatives from over 30 different departments at any one time. This has involved huge orga-
nizational adjustments from the previously segregated and siloed city departments to a more strategic, coordinated approach.
More than just an advance in technology, the Centre of Operations is a manifestation of a cultural change for the city as an orga-
nization.

One of the core principles of the center of operations was transparency. Rio has made a significant amount of its data freely
available to the public, including crime rates, mortality rates, traffic congestion, etc.

Box 6-2	 Facilitating parking in San Francisco, United States

The “SFpark”  program uses new technologies to make parking easier and faster. Sensors have been installed beneath parking
spots throughout the city. Department of Transportation computers track open spots and set prices according to availability and
turnover. A mobile phone app is also used to direct drivers to open spots and allows them to refill meters remotely. Demand-re-
sponsive pricing information online, via text, and through smartphone apps helps drivers find a space. Longer time limits and new
meters that accept credit/debit cards, SFMTA parking cards and coins make parking more convenient and result in fewer parking
tickets. By expanding payment options, the number of parking citations has decreased markedly. Environmental benefits are also
evident. The program reduces circling and double parking, cutting down on the noise, pollution and frustration that accompany

   Box 6-3	 Using new tools to manage infrastructure in Washington DC, United States

   The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (DC WASA) is a leading regional utility that provides drinking water, waste-
   water collection and treatment to more than 500,000 residential, commercial and governmental customers in the US capital and
   surrounding counties. It operates the world’s largest advanced wastewater treatment plant with a capacity of 370 million gallons
   per day, with a peak capacity of over 1 billion gallons per day.

   The DC WASA system, which dates back to the nineteenth century, was challenged by an inability to monitor infrastructure effi-
   ciently or reliably due to an outdated paper records system. The Agency needed robust technologies to help manage its assets,
   which include hundreds of thousands of water distribution pipes, valves, public fire hydrants, collection pipes, manholes, working
   crews, vehicles and water meters. In 2000, DC WASA began collecting digital data which needed to be consolidated and ana-
   lyzed. With almost no budget to replace infrastructure, DC WASA needed to be able to predict infrastructure failures and prioritize
   replacements in those areas.

   DC WASA and IBM began work on a project called PSTAR, Platform for Spatio Temporal Analytics, which helps DC WASA under-
   stand critical patterns for managing its aging infrastructure. The project integrates advanced analytics with asset management
   software, Geographic Information Systems, and Automated Meter Reading technology.

   The availability of real time, map-based information and geoanalytics is helping DC WASA employees identify potential problems
   before they occur. This is done by analyzing an enormous amount of disparate data that has been put into one single repository
   and uncovering patterns related to weather conditions, water use, demographics, working crews and hundreds of other variables.
   DC WASA is also using instrumentation, like the approximately 200,000 Automated Meter Readers (AMR) located throughout the
   city in commercial businesses and residences; sensors that collect data to improve customer service quality, better understand
   water usage patterns and predict future DC water consumption levels. The Fire Department now has handheld devices that can
   communicate with the water utility when repairs need to happen, allowing collaboration between two agencies which have not
   typically shared data. Through advanced analytics, DC WASA will be able to automatically analyze usage patterns to provide solu-
   tions for demand management and differential pricing. When the project is completely finished, it will provide automatic work
   scheduling by matching workers’ skill sets, tools and equipment to assigned tasks. DC WASA has already tagged over 40 of its
   trucks with GPS devices to provide DC WASA the flexibility to assign emergency work based on crews’, vehicles’ and equipment
   proximity to the affected area, streamlining the Agency’s workload and improving the customer experience.

   Box 6-4	 Creating an open city data portal: Hong Kong, China

   The Government of Hong Kong holds a significant amount of data that could be of significant value to the public. These data-
   sets include demographic, economic, geographical and meteorological data, historical documents and archives. However this
   information has not historically been in a format to facilitate value-added re-use by third parties. In order to combat this, the
   government launched a data portal entitled Data One (Data.One.gov.hk). This 18 month pilot scheme made geo-referenced public
   facilities data and real time traffic data available for free. They held a competition for the best applications of this data, for which
   they received 41 entries. The winner was an app that located the nearest doctor and tracked appointments. Following the success
   of this trial, and support from citizens and industry, the government plans to continue with the portal, and gradually add more
   datasets.

160  Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities
Malaysia’s cities are dynamic centers of innovation and have much potential to play an

increasingly important role as drivers of economic growth for the country. Yet, cities can grow

in different ways that will affect their competitiveness and livability, requiring policies that

create opportunities, foster productivity, minimize environmental degradation and ensure

social equity. This study focuses on understanding three key aspects of city competitiveness:

economic growth, urban governance, and social inclusion, through extensive analysis and

field work in six urban centers of Malaysia. Based on the analysis, the study lays out a set of

policy recommendations that aim to address existing challenges and create opportunities for

achieving a system of competitive cities.
