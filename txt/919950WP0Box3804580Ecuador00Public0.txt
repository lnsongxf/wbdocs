THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number

      registered appointments, and the certification of publication).              4 days       no charge

      The company must present a petition for an employer identification
      number (cédula patronal). This identification number is obligatory for
      employers for purposes of social security, payments covering health,
      pension, accident and work-related illness.

10    An employer can register with the Social Security online through the         2 days       no charge
      webpage of Ecuador’s Social Security Institute. After completing the
      registration online, the employer needs to obtain a password which will
      allow the employer to operate the system online.

      The day after registering online, the employer can present the
      documents/information to the Social Security and obtain the password
      to operate the online system. The online system will allow the employer
      to register all employees’ movements (entries of new employees and
      termination of the employment contract, contributions, etc.).

      The Law of Municipal Regime, which regulates the operation of

      service provided by the municipality.

      or “tasa” for the “habilitación y control de establecimientos comerciales
      e industriales” or the “approval of the ability to operate and control
      commercial and industrial establishments”. Although the tasa de
      habilitación was phased out on December 31, 2004 for all companies,
      the payment of the "tasa" is still required in practice for some
      companies. The fee varies depending on the type of company and the

        going to operate to make sure that such place complies with the City’s
        operation requirements for such business. Once the inspection has
        been made, and the operation of the business has been approved, the
        Municipality declares such business as able to operate, and grants the
        “tasa de habilitacion” as evidence of such ability to operate. The
        average time to obtain the permit is a month.

        The entrepreneur is also required to pay the Commercial Patent - a tax
        that every person or company engaged in commercial or industrial
        activities has to pay to the Municipality of the City where such activities
        are being executed. The Commercial Patent has to be paid each year.
        Companies should pay the Commercial Patent Tax within 30 days
        following the last day of the month when the company started
        operating.

        Obtain urban regulation report (Informe de Regulación Urbana -
        IRM)

        The Urban Regulation Report (Informe de Regulacion Urbana, IRM) is
        required for most procedures before the District Municipality, such as
        purchasing, selling, dividing, and building a property, as well as
        determining if the site is affected by road construction design.

        Valid for 2 years, this report provides the parameters to subdivide or
        urbanize the following:
        • Area available to construct the ground floor
        • Maximum building area
        • Maximum building height permitted
        • Maximum number of dwelling units
        • Building separation distances
        • Permitted and unauthorized land use
        • Basic service availability

        To obtain the report, BuildCo must do the following:
        • Purchase the IRM form, whose value is equivalent to 5% of the
        effective unified basic wage (salario básico unificado vigente) at the
        respective Subdivision Administration (Administración Zonal)
        • Register the property's data and enclose a copy of the property tax
        payment receipt
        • Submit copies of the citizenship identification and of the updated
        voting voucher or owner's exemption certificate
        • Enclose a cartographic sheet of the Geographical Military Institute
        (scale, 1:5,000 or 1:25,000), showing the exact property location and the
        respective public deeds registered at the Property Registry
        • Enclose a copy of the public writ of the estate (a request signed by
        the owner to guarantee the payment of water, electricity, or telephone
        service)

      Obtain construction guarantee and deposit it with the Municipality

      Proof of the guarantee deposit is a required document for the building
      permit application. Once the land plans have been registered for
      zoning and before their approval, the Municipality notifies the applicant
      the amount to be guaranteed (fondo de garantia). The applicant can
      deposit the guarantee in cash or certified check or in the form of an
      insurance policy. The insurance policy is purchased in 2 days from a
      local insurance company. The fee to purchase the guarantee depends
      on the value to be guaranteed.

      After construction is finalized, the Municipality will return the guarantee
      upon inspecting the construction. The guarantee will be returned in full
      only if the actual construction conforms to the plans approved by the
      Municipality. It is assumed that the full guarantee is returned to BuildCo
6     upon successful completion of construction. Therefore, the cost is not         2 days        USD 6
      recorded.

      However, the transaction fee for the guarantee, which amounts to
      0.05% of the guarantee itself, is taken into account because it is non-
      refundable. The guarantee amount is determined by the Municipality
      and depends on the type of construction, the size, the sector, and the
      relevant zone. For construction under 600 sq. m., the guarantee will
      range between 1.5% and 3% of the warehouse value. For construction
      over 600 sq. m., the guarantee will be about 4% of the warehouse
      value.

      This procedure does not entail any charges. However, the scanner
      services fee is 20% of the current minimum wage for each sheet, and a
      form must be purchased with the required stamps. The form fee is USD
      0.40, which is the same as the cost of the stamps. These fees are on a
      per-filing basis, and more than one filing is normally necessary.

the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
