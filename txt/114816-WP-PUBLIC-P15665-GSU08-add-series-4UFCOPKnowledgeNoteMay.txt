policies with general directives to municipal plans with comprehensive layouts. Cities have traditionally
sought to manage floods with regulatory instruments, such as zoning (to designate floodplains or
open spaces) and building codes (to ensure flood-resilient structures), but enforcing compliance
has been difficult. More recently, cities have experimented with economic instruments, such as
land-based financing and performance incentives. Influencing community behavior through risk communication
and participatory methods is vital for supporting flood risk reduction. To create realistic plans that are
acceptable to the community, the planning process must be supported with a participatory framework
for risk diagnostics and communication, along with plan preparation, implementation, and monitoring.
Ultimately, different land use tools must be used in combination for effective implementation.

Integrating flood risk in the land use planning process can be challenging, requiring
coordination among multiple stakeholders and institutions, both formal and informal, as
well responsible decision making. Decision makers may be motivated to push for highly visible
structural measures, which can show constituents that flood risk is being addressed. At the same
time, resettlement is unpopular in both developed and developing countries. In developing countries,
implementing land use plans is further confounded by the complexities surrounding informal settlement
and unclear tenure, as well as by lack of capacity and resources. Ultimately, successful land use
planning for flood risk management requires investment in two areas: (i) educating decision makers and
communities about the flood risk and role of land use planning in managing it; and (ii) building sufficient
technical and governance capacity to formulate, implement, and manage a flood risk–based land use
planning process.
This note offers policy makers and practitioners an overview of the key aspects of land
use planning used to manage flood risks in cities across the world. It includes examples from
developed and developing countries to provide insight into what has worked in different contexts.
It does not provide prescriptive solutions or step-by-step methodologies, since approaches will vary
by context. Solutions and methodologies will depend on local land use challenges and institutional
capacities, on the scale at which land use planning is undertaken, and finally on the local land use
planning culture and land tenure regime, apart from technical and financial capacities.


INTRODUCTION
The frequency and severity of floods has increased in the last two decades and has begun
to affect areas where flooding was once rare. Flood events are also becoming less predictable
due to climate change. Flood risk is comparatively high in urban centers, and the rapid growth of
cities, especially those located along rivers and coasts, increases the exposure of people and assets to
flooding (Jha, Bloch, and Lamond 2012) . Flood risk increases when urban growth compromises natural
drainage and storage areas, increases impervious cover, and reduces the infiltration capacity of soils;
the resulting acceleration of runoff challenges the capacity of cities to manage drainage infrastructure.
Over-extraction of groundwater has led to subsidence. In many low- and middle-income countries,
historical legacies of land use regulations and building codes have created an artificial scarcity of serviced
land and housing that has spurred the growth of informal construction in flood-prone hazardous zones.
Urban communities most affected by floods are (i) those in small and medium-size towns where
infrastructure and institutions are inadequate; (ii) the urban poor, especially those living in slums in
flood-prone locations without access to resources that could mitigate flood impacts (adequate housing,
infrastructure, service provision, and social networks); and (iii) the socially disadvantaged as well as
women and children, who—like the poor—lack access to resources and social networks that could help
them cope with disasters (World Bank 2010) .
A comprehensive approach to flood risk management combines structural measures that
protect against flood risk with nonstructural measures that manage flood risk. Historically,
cities have chosen structural measures, which are designed for two different purposes: they either
safeguard development from an estimated flood risk (through flood defenses such as levees and flood
walls) or direct flood waters away from developed areas (by increasing drainage capacity with pipes,
canals, and storage basins). However, structural measures alone have proven to be inadequate, for
several reasons: (i) they are based on finite predictions of risk that may not account for uncertainty due
to climate change or unplanned urban growth and expansion; (ii) risk may be transferred downstream if
the structures do not allow adequate space for the flood volume; (iii) high up-front cost of sophisticated
engineering design and building materials may not be affordable; and (iv) such measures induce
complacency since communities tend to over-rely on them. Most structural measures minimize
damage, but may not prevent damage. There will always be residual risk that needs to be managed
with nonstructural measures.

assets, and economic development (Burby 2000) as well as local flood defense requirements and
regulatory standards for flood risk (WMO 2016). Spatial plans can delineate flood protection and
development zones, establish emergency routes and facilities, and help ensure that infrastructure
investment for urban growth is based on flood risk.


     Decisions are based on the following risk designations:
         •	 HIGH-RISK AREAS. Existing development in these areas must be prioritized for protection,
            retrofitting, or managed retreat and preventive resettlement. The economic value of central
            business districts justifies structural protection. Areas for retreat (floodplains, wetlands, forests,
            mangroves) may be designated for low-occupancy uses, including recreation, ecosystem-
            based livelihoods such as urban agriculture, or waterfront activities for ecotourism.

         •	MODERATE-RISK AREAS. Flood risk can be managed in these areas through a “living with
            water” approach. Development controls and flood-resilient building codes work with green
            infrastructure to reduce impervious surfaces and improve the connectivity of green spaces.

         •	LOW-RISK AREAS. Preventive resettlement and critical infrastructure such as hospitals are
            appropriate for these areas. Multi-nucleated urban growth and expansion can occur through a
            review of density controls and infrastructure upgrades.

         •	 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE CORRIDOR NETWORK. Strategically located and built to appropriate
            heights, this network consists of (i) roads and emergency routes (rights of way) to and within
            flood zones, (ii) community shelters and health facilities at multiple locations in close proximity
            to neighborhoods (rather than in a central location that could be destroyed by a disaster),
            and (iii) strategic open spaces for response and relief operations that can also function as
            temporary shelter sites and medical field stations.

                    For hundreds of years, the flood-prone Netherlands protected itself with a system of
                DS  dikes that it continually strengthened. After the 1990s, when threatened flooding led
                A N
                    to the evacuation of 240,000 people, the country shifted its approach from controlling
           E RL
         H          rivers to a spatial strategy that restores floodplains and thereby increases discharge
      ET            capacity (by about 10 percent) without raising dike levels. In 2006, the government
    N
                    adopted a flexible spatial framework (“Room for the River”) for the entire Rhine-
                    Meuse delta. Key measures include (i) river bypass where urban development has
 constricted river flow, (ii) restoration of reclaimed land to the river and integration with protected
 parks, (iii) water retention through increased storage capacity of lakes; and (iv) dike relocation to
 relieve bottlenecks at urban centers and development of the floodplain for compatible land uses.a
 The approach includes about 30 strategic projects throughout the major watersheds as part of a
 long-range plan for managing flood risks till the end of the century (Rijkswaterstaat 2006) .
 In 2006, Singapore’s national water agency launched the Active, Beautiful, Clean
 (ABC) Waters program to address periodic flooding and chronic water shortages
 while poised for further growth. “Active” refers to new recreational spaces,             SINGAPORE
 “Beautiful” to the integration of waters with urban landscapes, and “Clean”
 to improved water quality. The ABC program, which will be implemented in
 phases with over 100 projects over the next 15 to 20 years, interweaves flood resilience with urban
 planning by managing the catchment-level water cycle: optimized rainwater collection and storage
 at source through a green network and green corridors; ensured water supply and quality through
 natural cleansing mechanisms; and value created with active recreational land uses for functional
 water bodies. The green network involves parks, wetlands, storm water storage and harvesting,
 and porous pavements, as well as green roofs, tree pits, street-side swales, etc. To reduce flood
 incidence, a diversified water supply system collects storm water and used water at large scale
 from three main watersheds and feeds them back into the supply system after treatment. The ABC
 Waters program has helped reduce flood-prone areas from about 3,200 hectares in the 1970s to 30.5
 hectares in 2016, despite increased urbanization. b

LAND USE MEASURES
Land Use Implementation Tools
Flood risk–based land use plans give communities an overview of which areas need to be protected,
evacuated, developed, or redeveloped. These plans need to be accompanied by implementation tools
that are acceptable to the community and that can be enforced with local capacity and resources.
Such tools can be regulator , economic, financial, or behavioral. They are summarized in table 1 and
described in more detail below.

Regulatory instruments—such as zoning plans,
development controls, and building codes—
prevent chronic disaster risk in the siting and
construction of new settlements and reduce
disaster risk in vulnerable existing settlements.
Over the last decade, countries with mature
building code systems experienced 47 percent of
disasters globally, yet accounted for only 7 percent
of disaster fatalities (GFDRR 2015) . Risk-based
regulations not only are crucial in reducing disaster
risks; they also have proven to be cost-effective.                                          Source: Hawkesbury City Council 2012.

enforcement of regulatory instruments remains
weak in developing countries, where finance and
capacity are often lacking and land ownership and
tenure are contentious.
Zoning plans demarcate areas by degree of flood
risk and link them to appropriate, safe, and
permissible land uses. Land use regulations and
development controls determine appropriate land
uses and guide neighborhood design for different
flood risk zones. Development controls designed to
manage flood risk (see figure 1) must establish                                             Source: FESP, FOWG, and SAEFL 2005.

Flood zoning may prohibit development, limit
development density, restrict development of
highly vulnerable uses in high-flood-risk areas,
and protect land reserves to provide flood
storage or safeguard environmentally sensitive
areas. Flood zoning can be undertaken based
on average annual exceedance probabilities,

Open space zoning designates land reserves in environmentally sensitive areas such as forests and
wetlands. This tool not only accommodates flood storage and reduces flood risk; it also enhances
livelihoods from ecosystem services and provides urban recreational spaces (outdoor sports facilities,
parks, nature reserves). Coastal ecosystems (mangroves, salt marshes, coral reefs, barrier islands,
and sand dunes) protect coastlines from cyclones, storm surges, tsunamis, etc.; riverine ecosystems
such as marshes, lakes, floodplains, and peatlands mitigate floods; and forests reduce the risk of
soil erosion and landslides and mitigate floods. Open spaces used as a green infrastructure network
typically form part of newer flood resilience plans. Ecosystem services from open space can reduce risks
at lower costs than traditional gray infrastructure approaches and can enhance livelihoods; however,
expertise on which approaches to use where and when is limited; few data are available on cost-benefit
ratios; and permitting can be more difficult than for built projects (Monty, Murti, and Furuta 2016) .

                 In Colombia , the land use zoning of the Arroyo Carolina micro-watershed creates
                 exclusive areas where natural ecosystems are protected and restored (Monty, Murti,

                 Analysis of Hurricane Katrina’s effects on New Orleans shows that levees alone

                 offered less protection than levees acting in combination with trees within the
 area’s coastal national parks (Murti and Buyck 2014). In light of such evidence, the U.S. Congress
 approved US$500 million for the restoration of coastal national parks and salt marshes in the area
 (Renaud and Murti 2013 ).

 Planting mangroves in disaster-prone areas of Vietnam has had several significant

                    Japan has a centuries-old history of combining green and gray infrastructure to

                    multiple areas of defense (Furuta and Satoquo 2016) . After the Great East Japan
                    Earthquake in 2011, the Ministry of the Environment decided to expand a coastal
 national park that had been affected by the tsunami; it would act as buffer against future natural
 hazards, serve as a symbol for reconstruction efforts, and promote ecotourism to contribute to
 the local economy (Government of Japan 2016 ). The National Resilience Act, passed in 2013,
 recognizes and promotes land use ecosystem functions of disaster risk reduction (Cabinet
 Secretariat, Government of Japan 2016 ) . The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport’s
 new National Spatial Development Plan and the fourth National Infrastructure Development Plan
 (2015) also recognize the role of ecosystems in reducing disaster risk. At the local level, the Tokyo
 Metropolitan Government and the city of Yokohama developed a master plan for a detention basin
 that would accommodate increased river levels and peak discharge (a function of extensive paved
 areas in Tokyo) and also serve as a sports venue and natural recreational area (WMO 2016) . Finally,
 Japan combines open spaces with flood defense mechanisms such as “super levees” in urban
 areas; super levees may include residential or office space, and—given their elevation—can serve
 as evacuation points during disasters (WMO 2016) .

Storm water ordinances stipulate the volume of runoff permissible from project sites and control flood
risk at its source. Building codes specify minimum design standards for materials, access points, and
floor levels for development within a designated zone. Building codes to accommodate flood incidence
and reduce flood losses may specify (i) elevated siting and roads, (ii) compulsory retrofitting of flood
protection measures, (iii) flood proofing for critical buildings such as hospitals and emergency shelters,
and (iv) planning and design for redundancy. Building codes can also specify building orientation to
minimize disruption of flood flows and require emergency exits in an elevated area such as the roof
(WMO 2016) . Box 4 describes a range of experiences with storm water ordinances and building codes from
different parts of the world.

 Box 4. Storm Storm Water Ordinances and Building Codes


 In New Orleans, the City Planning Commission’s updated Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance requires
 most new development projects to manage the first 1.25 inches of storm water on their site; hence
 private owners are expected to share flood risk with the city. Developers are also required to submit
 storm water management design plans with their development permits.

 The Seoul Metropolitan Government mandates rainwater harvesting in new buildings larger than
 5,000 m2 and existing official buildings larger than 3,000 m2. The water level in the storage tanks is
 monitored remotely by a disaster prevention center, and the building owner is instructed to empty
 the tanks depending on the weather forecast. The system increases risk awareness, enlists private
 owners’ cooperation, and extends sewer pipes’ useful life.

 In Minnesota, development regulations
                                                      Flood proofing through recommended best practices
 for floodways (i) allow open space uses,              in building code regulations
 such as gardens, farms, parks, trails,
 or golf courses, as long as they do not
 obstruct or increase flood levels; (ii)
 prohibit new construction or substantial
 improvements        to   existing    buildings;
 (iii) require construction outside the
 floodplain to be elevated such that the
 lowest floor is above the regulatory
 flood protection elevation (RFPE); (iv)
 require access (driveway and access
 road) elevation that is no lower than
 2 feet below RFPE; and (v) require
 setbacks from lot lines and for shoreland
 management or wild and scenic river
 ordinances (GFDRR 2015).

Financial Instruments
Through its investment choices—whether transport, housing, or infrastructure—a municipality can
orient land use. Public investments can discourage occupation of high-risk areas not by prohibiting their
development, but by making other areas more attractive. The challenge is that financing instruments
and resources, along with the ability to attract funds, are largely centralized, so that local authorities
cannot effectively respond to local needs.

Financial instruments include public funds such as national transfers, donor assistance, municipal
bonds, and flood loss aid linked to property taxation, recovery funds, and reinsurance; they also include
public-private partnerships and flood insurance at individual, local, and national levels.

Economic Instruments
Economic instruments are financial rewards, incentives, and penalties that encourage behavior
changes in businesses, households, and individuals. Cities are increasingly exploring the use of such
instruments, particularly economic incentives, to implement land use plans. Using these incentives not
only supplements public funds, it also encourages private developers and communities to accept and
comply with flood risk–based land use plans. Economic instruments rely on market information that
might not be easily accessible, and on the capacity of agents for acting rationally in economic terms.

A range of economic instruments is available to cities, including preferential taxation, tax credits,
conditional insurance, and conditional permitting. Land-based financing (density transfer or density
bonus) is another important instrument that has been used to manage urban growth in several
                                                                                    countries with different resources,

Behavioral Instruments

Behavioral instruments are important for land use policies as a way to encourage co-investment
between public, private, and nonprofit sectors, and to incentivize useful behaviors and discourage
risky ones. Land use policy that distributes and shares risk among multiple city stakeholders helps
institutionalize resilience by integrating it into the planning and policy of various sectors across the city.
Risk communication is essential for management of risk. Awareness is the first step for developing safe
practices on land use, and any plan should include a communication strategy.

Behavioral instruments include (i) awareness campaigns that use indicators to monitor and inform
the public and foster stakeholder consensus; (ii) mandatory disclosure in real estate transactions; (iii)
warning systems, including institutional coordination for emergency warning and management; and (iv)
capacity building (e.g., training of communities and schools; simulation exercises), which should be
based on the policy at issue, the specific stakeholders, and hazard, risk, and vulnerability assessments,
as well as on lessons learned from previous disaster events. Box 6 describes a range of behavioral instruments
used to promote flood resilience in different parts of the world.

	 PLANNING PROCESS
Integrating flood risk in the land use planning process can be complex because it requires coordination
among multiple stakeholders and institutions, both formal and informal. To develop plans that are
realistic and acceptable to the community, the planning process must be supported with a participatory
framework for diagnostics and risk communication as well as plan preparation, implementation, and
monitoring.
Flood risk information sets priorities in all stages of the land use planning process, from determining
the community vision, to integrating flood risk assessments, to formulating and implementing plans.
Integrating flood risk in the land use planning process requires certain enabling conditions, policy
frameworks, and stakeholder coordination to ensure that the community’s land development goals for
flood risk are accepted and implemented successfully.

process for flood risk management is supported by a number of conditions and processes: capacity
building of stakeholders, community engagement to improve dialogue, partnerships for risk assessments,
development of strategic plans, benchmarking of city resilience, and plan implementation and monitoring
against indicators and scorecards. Box 7 and Box 8 describe how governments at different levels and in
different parts of the world have integrated flood risk into land use planning.

 Box 7. Integrating Flood Risk in the Land Use Planning Process


 Seeking to increase its resilience to floods, t h e m u n i c i p a l i t y o f P a l o i n t h e P h i l i p p i n e s reviewed
 local planning and development tools and then undertook participatory hazard, vulnerability, and
 capacity assessments. Palo identified appropriate flood risk management measures and integrated
 them into its development planning and Annual Investment Program. The municipality focused on
 using local programs and projects that served both to improve infrastructure and to reduce the risk
 of flood (Jha, Bloch, and Lamond 2012) .

 In S w i t z e r l a n d , where the majority of territories have integrated hazard maps into land use(FOEN
 2015), governments at various levels concern themselves with flood risk: the federal government
 provides financial, technical, and scientific support for flood management; the cantons (administrative
 divisions) are tasked with identifying risk areas and implementing flood control measures; and
 municipalities sometimes assume responsibility for flood control (WMO 2016) .

 The N e w O r l e a n s C i t y Masterplan was launched in 2010, but its development started in 2008, and a
 detailed schedule was established to include proper follow-up for the actions implemented. For each
 strategy defined, the plan named a responsible office or agency, estimated the time for completion,
 and evaluated the necessary resources. Having clear roles and responsibilities assigned to specific
 institutions can help increase the viability of the plan (Jha, Bloch, and Lamond 2012) .

 N e w J e r s e y has developed an ambitious water infrastructure plan that aims to reduce flooding
 as part of a comprehensive statewide plan to improve water supply and quality. A consortium of
 stakeholders—including private sector water utilities, engineering firms and contractors, regulators
 at the state Department of Environmental Protection and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
 municipalities, public water and sewer utilities, environmentalists, and community organizations—
 has devised a measurement system to monitor the infrastructure plan. The monitoring will require
 utilities and local and state governments to report publicly on street and property flooding. One
 of the state’s key goals is to promote theuse of green infrastructure—e.g., pervious pavement,
 bioswales, and rain gardens, which collect storm water before it hits the sewers and help prevent
 flooding while beautifying neighborhoods and raising property values.

 Based on risk exposure, eight countries have implemented simple and fast-tracked procedures for
 permits for commercial buildings of less than 1,000 m2 (GFDRR 2015). In 2011, Macedonia developed a
 risk-based system that allows designers and contractors with top qualification to handle more complex
 and higher-risk classes of buildings, thereby reducing state control and increasing transparency.

 Box 8. Norfolk’s Flood Risk–Based Development Strategy


 CONTEXT:

 N o r f o l k , Vi r g i n i a , a historical port city, is home to the world’s largest naval station and thriving coastal
 communities. In recent years, flooding has become more severe and more frequent in Norfolk, partly due
 to sea-level rise and local land subsidence. Norfolk’s comprehensive plan, plaNorfolk2030, does not address
 projected sea-level rise, aging infrastructure, population growth, or an uncertain regional and global economy.
 The city decided to work with the Rockefeller Foundation’s 100RC network to address these omissions
 and more broadly to seek to transform Norfolk into a dynamic waterfront community for the future.


 ACTIONS:

 The city adopted a long-term strategy, NorfolkVision 2100, which was guided by several principles:

     •	 Address flood resilience by planning for the city as a whole; protect flood-prone areas
        concurrent with development of high-density, transit-rich, livable, and affordable
        neighborhoods in low-risk areas.

     •	 Use differentiated land use strategies for neighborhoods classified as four distinct
        community “vision areas” based on prioritization of city assets and flood risk.

     •	 Balance flood protection with access in asset-rich areas.

     •	 Share the flood risk reduction burden in all neighborhoods by adopting green infrastructure.

 The plan was developed collaboratively by multiple city departments and agencies, residents, and
 stakeholder groups. Community engagement was ensured in three phases: (i) awareness raising
 using traditional and social media; (ii) city asset mapping workshops and online exercise; and (iii)
 vision development to prioritize city assets. The community asset mapping was combined with flood
 risk assessment to delineate four “vision areas” with distinct land use approaches (see table).

 TAKEAWAYS:


  •	 By planning for flood resilience in a way that considers flood protection concurrently with
      access to key economic assets and new development, Norfolk will be able to grow in a
      safe and sustainable manner.

  •	 Stakeholder collaboration ensured development of relevant, realistic, and acceptable plans.

22   LAND USE PLANNING FOR URBAN FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT




4. CHALLENGES
While the importance of land use planning to reduce flood risks is generally acknowledged
by policy makers, adoption is contentious locally. Implementing land use decisions can challenge
existing control of a high-value urban resource and can thus be a messy process. For example, decision
makers may be motivated to push for highly visible structural measures, which can show constituents
that flood risk is being addressed. Likewise, communities may resist planning decisions such as
preventive resettlement. In developing countries, land use implementation is further confounded by
the complexities of informal settlement of land, as well as by a lack of capacity and resources.
Another challenge to spatial planning is that its costs versus benefits are not well understood,
especially when a green infrastructure approach is compared to structural measures. Better education
and outreach are needed to help communities appreciate how the required investment compares to the
cost of doing nothing, meaning in this case allowing unplanned urban growth and increasing exposure
and vulnerability to floods.
Lack of capacity to prepare land use plans, especially in fast-growing cities in low- and middle-income
countries, poses yet another challenge. Although significant progress has been made in recent decades
in hazard mapping, translation of technical information into land use regulations and building codes
has been poor. Disaster modeling data are highly technical, and their implications for land use may
be not clear to planning professionals and decision makers; especially challenging is how to translate
probabilistic hazard modeling into local action plans with development regulations and hazard zones,
which need to be referenced to corresponding building design and construction requirements. Scientific
prediction of risk may not be perceived as real risk by the community.

                                                            Finally, even where land use plans
                                                            exist, implementation is challenged by

                                                            any effective community consultation. This
can happen because planning departments tend to operate in isolation from other agencies involved in
transportation, housing, drainage, and water supply, and most cities lack skilled staff to manage review
and monitoring of land use and building regulations. Box 9 offers some examples of challenges that arise
in trying to carry out flood risk–based land use planning.

 Box 9. Challenges

 In September 2016, Hurricane Mathew caused flooding in areas of the U n i t e d S t a t e s that had
 not previously expected significant floods. In Louisiana, one-third of the flooded land area was
 outside the 100-year floodplain designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
 FEMA updates insurance maps only every 10–15 years; it faces political resistance when it tries to
 expand flood zones because homeowners don’t want flood insurance to become mandatory. Hence
 local floodplain managers face the difficult task of encouraging homeowners to take the risk of
 flooding seriously when there is no legal requirement for them to own flood insurance. L u m b e r t o n ,
 N o r t h C a r o l i n a , one of the cities hit hardest by Hurricane Mathew, is also outside FEMA’s 100-year
 floodplain. Local floodplain managers invited homeowners to a meeting where they could find their
 homes on the floodplain map and ask questions about their risk; after weeks of advertising the
 meeting on the radio and in the local newspaper, nobody showed up.a

 In M u m b a i , I n d i a , administrative processes can be equivalent to 46 percent of construction costs,
 as compared to 1.7 percent of construction costs in countries that belong to the Organisation
 for Economic Co-operation and Development. Such expensive processes foster corruption and
 noncompliance (GFDRR 2015) .

The need to integrate flood risk in land use planning is immense, given the frequency,
severity, and impacts of floods in recent decades. Land use planning that incorporates flood risk
information and integrates ecosystem- based measures can be cost-effective. In turn, land use planning
can be integrated in all stages of a flood risk management plan—from prevention and response to
reconstruction—along with other measures, both structural and nonstructural.
An understanding of flood risk should inform community priorities and decisions in all
stages of the land use planning process. A set of land use instruments must be selected that
addresses the type of local flood risk, that is acceptable to the community, and that can be implemented
with local resources and technical capacity. Land use plans that address flood risk must be integrated
within multiple sectors and at multiple scales: local area plans, city strategic plans, metropolitan visions,
and watershed and national policies. This type of integration involves multiple public sector actors (city
governments, public sector companies including utilities, and meteorological and planning institutions)
as well as actors from civil society, educational institutions, research centers, and the private sector—
and all must be coordinated to ensure they work effectively.
Planning, implementation, and enforcement of risk-based land use plans face challenges
in both developed and developing countries. Where cities have succeeded, it has primarily been
due to political will and citizen engagement, very often in the wake of a recent flood disaster. Once the
leadership and the community take a proactive stance, they can work together to resolve challenges such
as finance, technical capacity, land ownership, coordination, and enforcement. Ultimately, successful
land use planning for flood risk management requires investment in two areas: (i) educating decision
24    LAND USE PLANNING FOR URBAN FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT




makers and communities about the role of land use planning in managing flood risks, and (ii) building
sufficient technical and governance capacity to formulate, implement, and manage a flood risk–based
land use planning process.
When decision makers appreciate the benefits of land use planning as a flood management tool, they
will be better able to act on the following recommendations:

     •	 Help communities understand their flood risk so that they demand safe and sustainable urban
       development from decision makers and professionals.

     •	 Create a common goal and foster proactive collaborations between all stakeholders (government
       officials, civil society, communities, the private sector) and initiate institutional coordination
       among different sectoral agencies and levels of government.

     •	 Establish land use planning as a cost-effective measure to manage flood risks by adopting a
       green infrastructure approach.

     •	 Foster partnerships and networks to (i) advance multidisciplinary research (combining
       science, policy, and practice); (ii) share innovative practices in legislation, policy, stakeholder
       coordination, and land use regulations and incentives; and (iii) develop standards and identify
       research and capacity gaps.

     •	 Promote community engagement and participation so that risk assessment and land use
       planning respond to local needs and reflect local cultures. Engaging the community in preparing
       a risk-sensitive land use plan is crucial to its acceptance, implementation, and updating.

When stakeholders have sufficient technical and governance capacity, they will be better
able to act on the following recommendations:

     •	 Draw on technical innovations—in information technology and geographic information systems—
       to ensure that flood risk data and real-time land use information are most effectively managed
       and used.

     •	 Train city officials so they appreciate flood risk management as an integral component of a
       multihazard approach that will help the community reach its sustainable development goals,
       and so they can lead policy and administrative reforms for land use planning. Peer networks and
       e-learning platforms are useful training tools and can foster dialogue between large numbers of
       decision makers and professionals.
                                                                  LAND USE PLANNING FOR URBAN FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT                        25


  •	 Develop locally appropriate standards for land use regulations, engineering design, construction
      of various infrastructures, and guidelines and methodologies for retrofitting of structures. Flood
      risk standards must also be aligned with existing professional urban planning standards. To
      encourage compliance, building codes need to be stratified and accommodate the range of
      construction types, from sophisticated engineered buildings to non-engineered buildings built
      by petty contractors. Compliance is more likely where permitting processes are efficient, risk
      information is available and shared, building practitioners are certified, private third parties are
      accredited to provide review and inspection, and insurance mechanisms are used to augment
      building control.

  •	 Create a pool of professionals who understand how to use risk information and work
     with the community to achieve socioeconomic and resilience goals through the land use
     planning process. Professional associations and planning schools should update professional
     responsibilities and curricula to integrate risk guidance.

Since land use challenges and institutional capacities vary by location, generic and prescriptive land use
processes are not advisable. While the experience of other cities can be informative, each locale must
assess its specific conditions and develop customized solutions. Apart from taking local technical and
financial capacities into account, land use solutions must also be cognizant of local planning approaches
and land tenure regimes.
