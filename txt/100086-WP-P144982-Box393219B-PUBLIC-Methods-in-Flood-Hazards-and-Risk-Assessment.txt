    OVERVIEW

This technical note provides an overview for authorities who wish to conduct flood hazard and
risk assessments and who must develop a step-by-step plan for carrying out the assessment
that is appropriate and feasible in the local context. It is important to keep in mind, however,
that many aspects of flood hazard and risk assessment requires specific expertise and
experience. It is not advisable to conduct these assessments if your team lacks this experience,
and this technical note does not provide specific guidelines, which can vary dramatically
depending on local and regional conditions.

The other major component of flood risk, aside      3.2     Exposure
from flood hazard, is flood vulnerability. The
goal of vulnerability assessment is to              The flooded area shown in a flood hazard map

The focus on physical vulnerability stems from
the fact that it is the most obvious and easily
quantified vulnerability class, and because in
many situations it constitutes a large share of
total flood vulnerability. For simplicity, flood
risk studies and management efforts often only
consider one or several of these classes.
Regardless of the vulnerability class under
consideration, mapping is a central element of
any assessment. Expertise in mapping tools
such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) is
therefore critical.

Despite     its    importance,     vulnerability
assessment for floods and other natural disasters
has received less attention than has hazard
assessment (Changnon, 2003). There have been
few efforts to standardize vulnerability
measurement and estimation techniques,
particularly in developing countries and for
non-economic measures. Depending on the
context, however, non-economic considerations       Figure 8 Example land use map for flood exposure in

                                                        design discharges, which will in turn lead to
                                                        errors in the water levels estimated using a
                                                        hydraulic model, which will combine with
                                                        imperfections in the hydraulic model to affect the
                                                        predicted spatial extent of flooding. Likewise,
                                                        there are considerable uncertainties in
                                                        vulnerability assessment.          For example,
                                                        variations in the characteristics of individual

                                                        damage function, but it is impractical to create
                                                        accurate damage functions for each individual
                                                        home or business that might be affected. The

Even the most careful analyses performed by
leading experts cannot avoid such uncertainties.
Though these uncertainties cannot be
eliminated, their importance and impact on the
decision-making process can and should be
examined. In fact, flood hazard and risk experts
put considerable efforts into understanding the
various uncertainties and how they can affect
risk estimates. An example is shown in Figure
13. These maps are taken from a demonstration
by the Flood Risk Management Research
Consortium       (http://web.sbe.hw.ac.uk/frmrc)
and show how the 0.01 exceedance probability
(100-year) flood extent can vary for different
levels of uncertainty. As can be seen in the
figure, uncertainties in inputs to the floodplain
mapping process can result in large variations in
estimated flood extent. These variations can
translate into significant differences in
estimated economic and other types of flood
damage and loss. These differences imply
significant uncertainty in the decision-making
required to reduce these damages. Uncertainties
should be carefully considered when
considering risk management investments.
(Rogelis, 2012) provides a more detailed
explanation of the various sources of
uncertainty and how they can be incorporated        Figure 13 Example of how consideration of hazard
