BOX 1. VALUE OF QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENTS IN ENERGY SUBSIDY AND TARIFF REFORM PSIA

Qualitative assessments permit in-depth description and analysis of social processes, which complement
quantitative data. For example, they:

•	   Reveal underlying assumptions and beliefs of energy customers, which underlie their behaviors. In
     Tajikistan, focus group discussions showed widespread reluctance to invest in certain energy efficiency
     improvements—plastic windows, more efficient light bulbs—out of concern for their adverse health
     impacts.

•	   Draw attention to attitudes to and information about reforms and social assistance mechanisms, which
     impacts overall acceptance of reforms. For example, respondents across all countries included in the
     research demonstrate limited understanding of the need for energy tariff increase. Tariff increase is
     often perceived as being driven by corruption or mismanagement in the sector. The majority of energy
     consumers are not aware of cofinancing mechanisms for energy efficiency in their countries. In some
     contexts, vulnerable customers do not understand the eligibility criteria for social assistance benefits
     to support energy payments.

•	   Highlight factors of vulnerability that cannot be captured through quantitative research, but can inform
     the design and potential effectiveness of mitigation measures. In Armenia qualitative research revealed
     the widespread use of fuels that do not have monetary value, such as collected wood, manure, cotton
     stalks, and other biofuels. In Tajikistan, qualitative research revealed a higher than expected energy
     expense burden on rural households, including contributions to heating of social buildings, suggesting
     the need for additional support to bolster energy security of rural communities. Research in Bulgaria
     pointed to an enhanced vulnerability of many rural and small town residents to electricity tariff increase
     due to its role in subsistence food production (electrically powered water pumps for irrigation of home
     plots, freezers for refrigeration). In all countries, qualitative research has confirmed the uneven patterns
     of energy expenses through the year, especially expenses for purchasing solid fuels, and consequently
     indicated consumers’ preferences for aligning social assistance allowances to this pattern of expenses.

Qualitative assessment findings can also help improve the design of quantitative surveys. For example, they
can highlight the need to collect energy expenditure data separately for heating and non-heating seasons
to capture seasonal variations, as well as to better account for non-cash energy spending burdens, such as
the time and labor involved in collecting fuels.

    BOX 2. VALUE OF STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS IN ENERGY SECTOR REFORMS

    Stakeholder analysis seeks to provide development actors with in-depth knowledge of stakeholders,
    their role and incentives in the reform process, and highlight obstacles to reform implementation. This
    information is valuable for identifying ways to facilitate the progress of reforms. Stakeholder analysis is
    but one component of a PEA that has a much broader scope, and may include such elements as historical
    background of the sector and reforms, institutional and governance arrangements of the sector, existing
    status quo and acceptability of the reforms, and so on. If time and resources allow, a task team may consider
    conducting a PEA. PEAs in Belarus and Romania, for example, proved critical to providing insight into the
    energy sector and challenges of the reforms.

    In Belarus, the PEA has described an entrenched social contract, based on a paternalistic role of the state.
    In this context, consumers widely view the supply of affordable energy as a social entitlement, and the
    government and all state institutions uphold this belief. Highly centralized decision making prevents energy
    sector institutions such as multiservice utilities from influencing the reform process, while at the same time
    these institutions would be under strong pressure to adapt should reforms progress further. The analysis
    proposes a menu of recommendations, including more open communications of reform and capacity
    building for key sector institutions.

    In Romania, a comprehensive PEA of electricity and gas market liberalization has identified a number of
    areas that have obstructed progress of reforms. These include conflict of interest in certain appointments
    and decision-making functions, weak capacity of key stakeholders (such as regulatory and anti-corruption
    institutions), and financial constraints, among others. The analysis highlights the lack of strong internal
    champions, with reforms being driven primarily by external actors. It has identified a set of actions that
    could help increase internal support for reforms.

    BOX 3. TAILORING SOCIAL ASSESSMENTS TO PENDING POLICY QUESTIONS

    Qualitative assessments are often used with regard to a broader set of energy liberalization policies.
    However, they can also be tailored to specific policy questions related to energy reforms.

    In Ukraine, qualitative research methods were used to consult with consumers on the topic of transitioning
    to consumption-based billing for district heating. Twenty-six focus group discussions were carried out in
    two cities in Western and Eastern Ukraine to discuss aspects of district heating billing and the potential
    installation of heating meters.

    In Poland and Bulgaria, qualitative assessments explored incentives and obstacles for building-level energy
    efficiency investments. Conducting the studies on a concrete topic across countries also allows lessons to
    be shared within the region.

    Given the flexible nature of qualitative research, studies conceived around a specific policy question (such
    as metering or energy efficiency) often generate discussion on broader issues of concern to consumers in
    energy services that can be examined further in the research process.

            assistance, and so on.                                   progress of reforms.

BOX 4: TAJIKISTAN—USING QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE METHODS TO PRESENT A COMPREHENSIVE
PICTURE OF ENERGY DEPRIVATION AND AFFORDABILITY

Tajikistan faces a complex energy challenge. Due to its natural hydro-resource endowments and geopolitical
circumstances, it relies heavily on electricity for urban heating. This is problematic in the winter, when
severe electricity load-shedding occurs, leaving rural residents with only 3 to 7 hours of electricity per
day. A World Bank report (Fields, Kochnakyan, Stuggins, and Besant-Jones, 2012) investigated possible
solutions to tackling the challenge of electricity deprivation. The technical solutions offered to improve the
situation require long-term investments and would necessitate an increase in residential tariffs—currently
the lowest in the region.

A qualitative/quantitative analysis was conducted to take a broader look at the impacts of and possible
shorter-term solutions to winter energy deprivation. It examined in detail energy use and spending patterns
of household groups across the country and impacts on their budget and well-being in the current situation
as well as in scenarios involving tariff and subsidy reforms. The analysis has helped open policy discussions
on bolstering energy security for rural poor who are currently most affected by electricity rationing and the
overall burden of energy costs, as well as to consider socially acceptable solutions to reallocating subsidy
distribution without impacting the well-being of urban poor.

    BOX 5: BEYOND THE AVERAGES

    One of the greatest values of qualitative assessment is the ability to look more deeply into households’,
    individuals’ and groups’ specific circumstances to better understand impacts on their lives and factors that
    drive their attitudes and decisions affected by energy policy decisions.

    In the context of energy reforms, such circumstances may include household decisions about budget
    management and making energy payments; the seasonality of energy expenditure; differences in the
    cost of energy sources across locations; the significance of remittances or security of incomes on energy
    affordability; additional vulnerability of certain social groups (for example, ethnic minorities, female-headed
    households, distant rural residents, and so on). These factors underlie the complex reality of coping with
    energy payments and help identify multiple factors of vulnerability.

    By taking a broader look into impacts from tariff reforms qualitative assessments have led country teams
    to consider better tailored mitigation measures; for example, providing community support to meet high
    winter energy expense burdens in rural areas in Tajikistan, or tailoring social assistance in Armenia to
    better reflect seasonal variations in energy expenses.

BOX 6. GENDER IN ENERGY REFORMS

Gender-differentiated impacts of energy tariff reforms may be hard to conceive for researchers (as well as
respondents), given that energy services are essential to all. Nevertheless, underlying gender dynamics at
the country and household level often translate into types and intensity of impacts that men and women
experience differently as a result of energy tariff reforms.

At the country level, differences in labor market participation and earnings provide for various levels of
vulnerability of male and female heads of households. In cases such as Tajikistan, where households rely
heavily on remittances, energy affordability is significantly less secure for households without a migrant, or
those that have stopped receiving remittances (the latter are often female-headed). In other cases, these
differences are more subtle but still affect energy affordability based on men and women’s level of income
and their role in decision making about family budget allocation. Social assistance benefits targeted at
single parents may formally or informally discriminate against male-headed households; for example,
benefits aimed at single mothers. Most qualitative assessments show that women are more likely to seek
social assistance benefits than men, since seeking assistance is less socially acceptable for men.

At the household level, energy use and energy-related decisions may be affected by the household’s
gender composition. Focus group research shows that men are often more informed about and more likely
to proactively employ energy efficiency measures such as insulation, whereas women tend to be more
informed about and proactive in seeking social assistance measures. Women staying at home are often
affected more directly by energy saving efforts of the household; they may reduce the level of heating
when alone, or reduce use of appliances for various household tasks. Additionally, female-only households
may incur higher costs for energy sources such as wood or coal, because they have to outsource heavier
physical tasks such as transportation, storing, or cutting. Evidence from Armenia and the Kyrgyz Republic
shows that due to these heavier tasks, poor female-headed households are more likely to purchase these
fuels in smaller quantities, which tends to be several times more expensive than buying in bulk.

     Similarly, Tajikistan qualitative findings were validated and integrated with quantitative survey data and
     information from social assistance program evaluations to form a multisectoral report, “Assessment of
     Household Energy Deprivation, Coping Mechanisms and Policy Options for Socially Responsible Reform in
     the Electricity Sector” for country consultations.

     Bulgaria, Romania, and Croatia qualitative assessments have served as inputs to an ESW on “Energy
     Affordability in EU-11,” which also incorporates evidence from quantitative analysis of fiscal and quasi-
     fiscal impacts of energy subsidies, household survey data, and data from evaluations of social protection
     programs.

     BOX 9. ISSUES IN STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS FOR ENERGY TARIFF REFORM

     Energy subsidy and tariff reforms present some distinct challenges that should be considered when
     conducting stakeholder analysis. Energy is essential for all aspects of life. It affects citizens, businesses,
     and public institutions. Changes in access to or cost of energy affect closely most sectors of the
     economy. Unlike other policy reform actions, energy tariff reforms have overarching impacts felt by the
     entire population. It is likely that increasing user costs of energy will bring no short-term benefits to any
     stakeholder group, even if they are necessary for the long-term financial viability of the sector, and for
     improving quality and reliability of services.

     Energy reforms are also often strongly influenced by external stakeholders and the geopolitical context.
     Access to energy imports at below-market price can be used as a political tool, and contribute to stalling
     reforms. The disruption of a regional agreement that had ensured reliable and cheaper energy supply can
     become a catalyst for reforms, and help win public support for them, in order to reduce dependence on the
     regional network. Changes in international market price for imported fuels can provide a strong push and
     rationale for reforms in a particular time period.
