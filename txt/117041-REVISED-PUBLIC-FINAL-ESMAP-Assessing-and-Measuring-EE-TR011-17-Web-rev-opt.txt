                                        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

    Energy efficiency is a cost-effective solution to meet energy, climate change, and sustainable
    development goals and critical for supporting access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable
    energy services in developing countries. The energy efficiency potential is vast and largely
    untapped across the world. This is widely recognized by most governments, the development
    community, and international organizations, and forms the foundation of global initiatives such as
    Sustainable Energy for All. The benefits of improving energy efficiency are multiple, but so are the
    barriers. There is no silver bullet, but recognizing the multiple benefits of energy efficiency (MBEE)—
    including energy savings, as well as others (Table ES.1)—and making them more visible and credible
    is an integral part of the solution. If demonstrated suitably, these multiple benefits can motivate
    stakeholders to invest and participate in energy efficiency programs.

    An intrinsic challenge facing energy efficiency projects is that the benefits are not physically
    visible. The difficulty in reliably predicting and measuring the energy that will be saved and quantifying
    the associated nonenergy benefits (e.g., environmental benefits or increased comfort levels in the
    case of energy efficiency in buildings) can make it more difficult or less interesting for policy makers,
    investors, and energy users in general to focus efforts and resources to scale up energy efficiency.

    This report seeks to make a contribution to scaling up energy efficiency through improved planning
    and design of energy efficiency interventions in developing countries by starting with the basic
    management principle of “What gets measured gets done.” It includes a review of global experience
    with the measurement and verification (M&V) of energy efficiency and the emerging field of assessing
    the multiple benefits of energy efficiency. Through the references, examples, data, and practices
    highlighted, this reports seeks to help practitioners demonstrate the performance of energy efficiency
    interventions.

    The report makes the case that M&V should be a critical aspect of any energy efficiency project
    or program in order to ensure value for money, justify continued or increased funding, as well
    as provide the basis of performance-based payment mechanisms. M&V is essential to assess
    resource savings and to ensure that savings persist over time. Energy efficiency practitioners use
    M&V for several reasons, such as, to:

    t   Improve engineering design and project costing

    t   Enhance energy savings through adjustments in facility operations and maintenance

    t   Document financial transactions (e.g., for energy efficiency projects where financial payments are
         performance based)

    t   Enhance financing for energy efficiency projects

    t   Support development of broader energy efficiency programs

      The report provides an overview of M&V practices for energy efficiency, noting that different terms are
      used to describe the process to measure and verify the
      performance of energy efficiency activities: Measurement
                                                                           Measurement and Verification. M&V is crucial to
      and Verification (M&V), Evaluation, Measurement, and
                                                                           establish the credibility of the benefits of energy efficiency
      Verification (EM&V), or Measurement, Reporting, and                  and build confidence in the performance of energy efficiency
      Verification (MRV). They share the common objective to               activities. Accounting for energy efficiency’s multiple benefits
      “assess the outcome” of an energy efficiency intervention            can help drive more energy efficiency actions. With greater
      and provide a framework for measuring and verifying                  confidence that theoretical energy savings and nonenergy
      project outcomes in a transparent, reliable, and consistent          benefits are realized in practice and a better understanding
                                                                           by governments and stakeholders of the value of energy
      manner. Energy professionals and stakeholders use
                                                                           efficiency, a stronger case can be made for investments, as
      established protocols and methodologies to develop                   well as for the replication and scaling up of energy efficiency
      project-specific measurement and verification plans.                 interventions.
      These documents are not standards, hence, there is no
      compliance mechanism associated with the protocols.
      Practitioners have to decide to what degree their energy efficiency activities would conform their
      energy efficiency activities to the protocols, with decisions typically depending on the projects’ scope,
      cost of M&V, and the use/value/benefits of a more rigorous M&V system.

      The effort and rigor associated with M&V of energy efficiency projects or programs should typically be
      commensurate with the project capital investment and savings risk. The appropriate level of M&V rigor
      can often be determined by considering three factors: (i) the predictability of equipment operation;
      (ii) the magnitude of M&V costs in relation to the value of the energy savings and nonenergy benefits
      produced by the project; and (iii) technical capacity of the operators.

      A review of publicly available documentation for select energy efficiency projects undertaken by
      the World Bank and other organizations indicates that while preparation documentation for energy
      efficiency projects typically include methods for estimating energy savings ex ante, very few projects
      include, from the start, the provisions or methods to systematically measure and assess, ex-post, the
      actual performance of energy efficiency projects and programs. This can lead to: (i) potential under-
      or overestimation of energy savings; (ii) possibly undermining the credibility of energy efficiency
      interventions and their potential replication or scale up; (iii) missed opportunities for learning from the
      actual performance of the energy efficiency interventions and; (iv) making it difficult to develop and
      enable energy performance contracts. Evidence indicates that projects involving ex-post payment
      for energy efficiency performance often have a greater incentive to undertake rigorous M&V.

      This report highlights that energy efficiency projects should include, from the beginning, the
      elaboration of an M&V plan that outlines how the performance of the project will be monitored and
      assessed. It is important to strike a delicate balance between cost, rigor, and complexity. Factors
      that can influence the M&V costs include: project complexity, levels of uncertainty, existing energy

management systems, and the risk allocation for achieved savings. Providing adequate accuracy
while ensuring a reasonable cost of M&V can be challenging.

In the case of projects where parameters are fairly constant and actual measurements may not be
possible for the baseline development and energy savings calculation, a “deemed savings” approach
may be considered. While such an approach typically has less precision (as it consists of multiplying
the number of installed energy efficiency measures by a “deemed” value of savings per measure)
and may increase the level of uncertainty of the achieved energy savings, it has greater simplicity and
lower associated costs. In order to address the higher uncertainty levels, it is typically recommended
to use a conservative approach to reduce overestimation of impact. Combining deemed or “default”
input assumptions with some site-specific inputs and/or sample measurements can contribute to
enhancing the robustness of the estimated energy savings.

There is no empirical formula or easy way to define a point where rigor and M&V costs intersect. One
must rely on judgment and experience to determine a cost-effective approach. A few strategies for
keeping M&V costs low while maintaining the rigor include the following:

t   Use extensive metering in the baseline period and stipulate values for the parameters that cannot
     be metered.

t   Verify key performance items using periodic rather than continuous data collection (not to be
     confused with continuous M&V) to reduce data collection and management issues.

t   Rely upon existing instrumentation, energy management systems, and energy management
     behavioral practices wherever possible.

For the assessment and evaluation of the performance of energy efficiency projects in developing
countries, this report highlights the importance of also considering whether there is unsatisfied
(suppressed) and growing energy demand. Such situations should be taken into account with
baseline assumptions reflecting increasing energy consumption in the future. An increase in energy
consumption following the implementation of energy efficiency measures—compared to the baseline
energy use—is typically referenced as a rebound effect (or “take-back effect”). In the case of
developing countries, and in particular emerging economies, improving energy efficiency often
comes along with increasing energy consumption (to meet unmet and growing demand for
energy services). Thus, the performance of energy efficiency is not so much about “doing more
with less [energy]” (which was applicable to industrialized countries), but rather “doing even
more [energy services] with more [energy]” and contributing to raising standards of living and
promoting prosperity. This shift in how energy efficiency should be considered is reflected in the
increased focus on the multiple benefits generated by energy efficiency investments and policies.

Inclusion of the multiple benefits of energy efficiency (MBEE) can play a crucial role in
enhancing the value of M&V for stakeholders. In many instances, the nonenergy benefits from an
energy efficiency project could be higher and/or have a greater influence on decision making than the
energy saved. For example, an energy efficiency streetlight project can improve visibility, contributing
to fewer road accidents while increasing the perception of security among pedestrians and leading to
lower energy consumption per light point. The topic of MBEE encompasses a wide range of impacts,

     among others. Identifying and assessing all of the direct and indirect benefits of energy efficiency
     is an evolving field; nonetheless, the existing body of evidence and analysis already highlights its
     relevance and is leading a growing number of practitioners wanting to take MBEE into account in their
     assessments of energy efficiency activities.

     From a direct benefit perspective, multiple beneficiaries can be identified. Recipient benefits refer
     to the benefits that accrue to the participants of a program (end-users). The importance of these
     benefits also varies according to recipients’ income levels. Low-income households tend to receive
     greater health and comfort benefits from energy efficiency programs because their baseline conditions
     before improvements are generally lower than those of average-income households. Benefits to
     electricity supplier (the power sector) are numerous. They include deferring the need to build new
     infrastructure to meet growing demand and increasing grid reliability. Important benefits of energy
     efficiency programs accrue in the public budget. This is most pronounced when government agencies
     are the recipients, such as with public buildings or street lighting energy efficiency retrofits. However,
     additional nonenergy benefits to public budget exist. In economies that subsidize end-use energy
     tariffs, energy efficiency programs reduce fiscal expenditures on energy subsidies, which enable them
     to lower deficits or increase spending in other priority areas, such as health and education. Energy
     efficiency improvements can deliver benefits across the whole economy, with direct and indirect
     impacts on economic activity, employment, trade balance, and energy prices.

     MBEE are often omitted from assessments of the benefit of energy efficiency programs for three main
     reasons: lack of data, lack of consensus for quantifying their impact and monetary values, and lack of
     resources to conduct the analysis. However, MBEE significantly contribute to economic growth, social
     welfare, and environmental health, justifying policy makers and program administrators in overcoming
     these barriers and including MBEE in evaluations of energy efficiency programs so that the socio-
     economic benefit of these programs can be optimized.

     The following steps are recommended for incorporation of MBEE in analysis of energy efficiency projects:

     1 | Identify the benefits most relevant to the overarching
         programs goals and to the stakeholders
                                                                          Ability to improve understanding and demonstration of
     2 | Determine the goal of quantifying the benefits                   the social and economic benefits would strengthen the
         (advertising, stakeholder engagement, program                    incentives for government agencies to undertake effective
         decision, impact evaluation)                                     measurement and verification (M&V) of the
                                                                          energy efficiency benefits. This is part of a learning process.

                                               OVERVIEW

This report seeks to make a contribution to scaling up energy efficiency through improved planning
and design of energy efficiency interventions in the developing countries by starting with the basic
management principle of “What gets measured gets done.” The report reviews global experience with
the measurement and verification (M&V) of energy efficiency and the emerging field of recognizing the
multiple benefits of energy efficiency (MBEE). Through the references, examples, data and practices
highlighted in this report, this reports seeks to help practitioners demonstrate the performance of
energy efficiency interventions. The overarching objective is to enable project developers, policy
makers and investors to better consider energy efficiency as a cost-effective solution to meet energy,
climate and key development objectives.

This report builds on the existing body of work on energy efficiency M&V within and outside the World
Bank Group.

Chapter 1 provides a brief introduction. Chapters 2 and 3 are intended to serve as guidance to
improve the assessment of energy efficiency interventions in a transparent and consistent manner.
The report presents a review of major M&V protocols used by the energy efficiency community across
the world. The review compiles a lexicon of the commonly used terminologies and compares the M&V
protocols, in terms of scope, application, and key features. In the context of the MBEE, the opportunity
for expanding the current M&V approaches is presented for further research. An analysis of select
energy efficiency projects identifies key issues with M&V of energy savings and opportunities to
improve demonstration of actual performance of energy efficiency interventions, focusing on energy
efficiency in lighting and buildings.

Chapter 4 presents a review of the latest practices in capturing MBEE. This report seeks to lay the
foundation to a systematic approach of integrating MBEE in project documents by identifying main
MBEE (focusing energy efficiency in buildings and public lighting) and giving examples of metrics
developed to account for MBEE. It gives a brief overview of the experience of institutions that are
increasingly seeking to support incorporating MBEE in investment decisions and communication
strategies. A few methods of quantifying the MBEE investments are outlined, with recommendations
for stakeholders interested in pursuing quantification and incorporation of MBEE in decision making
and for future research. Chapter 5 provides an illustration of the key steps in ensuring effective M&V of
energy efficiency projects.

M&V of the MBEE is an evolving field. Nonetheless, the existing body of evidence and analysis already
highlights its relevance and is leading a growing number of practitioners wanting to take MBEE into
account in their assessments of energy efficiency activities. This report is intended to provide a
comprehensive review of the current landscape. Readers are encouraged to build on this report to
share emerging experiences, insights and new research questions with the global energy efficiency
community.

1                     ENERGY EFFICIENCY: THE FIRST FUEL




Energy efficiency is a cost-effective solution to meet energy, climate change, and development goals.
Energy efficiency is also central to the overall World Bank Group engagement in the energy sector
aimed at supporting developing countries’ access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy
services, recognizing that modern energy services can help improve the quality of life for millions
around the world and underpin progress in all areas of development.1 Literature describes energy
efficiency as “the hidden fuel” given its inherent lack of visibility. The narrative around energy
efficiency is changing to position it as the “first fuel,”2 given its significant contribution to
meeting energy demand, as well as the large market for energy efficiency investments (IEA 2015).
In the case of developing countries, energy efficiency provides an opportunity to sustainably
grow energy services and support development and economic growth. The International Energy
Agency’s (IEA) “Bridge Scenario”—which proposes a set of energy actions to raise climate ambition,
in line with the world’s climate goal of limiting global temperature rise below 2°C—identifies energy
efficiency as one of the five measures, and largest contributor, to achieve a peak in emissions around
2020, using only proven technologies and without harming economic growth (IEA 2015).

Investments in energy efficiency can curb energy demand growth and emissions growth in the
near term while fueling economic growth and without compromising goals of greater access
to reliable and affordable energy services. These attributes are making energy efficiency attractive
propositions for national governments, as well as subnational entities. In fact, as urban areas account
for two-thirds of global energy consumption (and greenhouse gas emissions), cities have become a
key focus of energy efficiency policy.

Global energy demand is projected to increase by about 32 to 45% above 2013 levels by 2040,3
with all of the net growth coming from non-OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development) countries—already responsible for 58% in 2013 and increasing 55% in 2040 (IEA
2015).4 According to the IEA Energy Efficiency Market Report, in 2014, energy efficiency investments
since 1990 were estimated to have enabled countries to avoid primary energy imports of at least
190 Mtoe (given existing import patterns), with an estimated value of $80 billion. The potential and
importance of energy efficiency in the context of global energy demand trends in general, and for the
developing world in particular, is huge and merits renewed attention.

Notwithstanding this emerging role for energy efficiency, projections reveal that under existing
policies, the vast majority of economically viable energy efficiency investments (e.g., in buildings,
transport, etc.) may remain unrealized. No country has fully utilized the potential to improve the energy
efficiency of its economy and most still have scope to go considerably further. There are a number of
recommended enabling conditions to address barriers to energy efficiency financing and perceived
risks,5 including the need for clear and easy measurement.6

    “What Gets Measured, Gets Managed”
    An intrinsic challenge facing energy efficiency projects is linked to the particular feature that their
    benefits—energy savings and others—are not physically visible. The difficulty in reliably predicting
    the energy that will be saved and quantifying the associated nonenergy benefits (e.g., environmental
    benefits or increased comfort levels in the case of energy efficiency in buildings) can make it more
    difficult/less interesting for policy makers, investors, and energy users in general to focus efforts and
    resources to scale up energy efficiency. This report seeks to make a contribution to scaling up energy
    efficiency through the planning and design of energy efficiency interventions in the developing countries
    by starting with the basic management principle of “what gets measured gets done.”

    Effective measurement and verification (M&V) systems are crucial not only to capture the energy
    efficiency gains but also to appropriately capture multiple benefits of energy efficiency (MBEE)
    so investment and policy decisions are better informed and enabled. Given that the bulk of energy
    consumption takes place in urban areas combined with significant energy efficiency potential,7
    this report focuses on urban public lighting and buildings, which can also offer demonstration and
    replication potential.

    M&V is recognized as a crucial confidence building tool for assessing the performance of energy
    efficiency interventions. It is also key for sustaining energy efficiency over time. Moreover, M&V can
    be the basis of certain contracts in cases where payments for energy efficiency investments are

    Energy Efficiency is the ratio of the energy service provided (output) by a system compared to the amount of
    energy used (input). This implies that two sets of benefits would accrue to a typical energy efficiency project: first,
    reduction in energy consumption by the system; second, a potential improvement in the level of service (e.g., lighting,
    heating, cooling) delivered by the system without a corresponding increase in energy consumption. Traditionally,
    measurement and verification systems focus on the first which, from an electricity sector perspective, is a primary
    benefit. However, as typical demand-side energy efficiency interventions also closely involve the consumer, the second
    benefit is equally (if not more) important. This is particularly relevant for consumers in the developing countries, where
    level of service in the baseline scenario (i.e., the scenario against which the performance of energy efficiency activities
    is assessed) may be low, and in many cases involve suppressed (unmet) demand, meaning that a key development
    objective is to improve the level of service. This needs to be properly evaluated when appraising energy efficiency
    investment decisions.
    In the context of developing countries and emerging economies in particular, the concept of energy efficiency requires
    shifting from the notion that energy efficiency is about “doing more with less” to “doing even more [energy services] with
    more [energy]” to recognize and take into account the full productive impact and contribution of energy efficiency. For
    the purpose of this report, these nonenergy, co-benefits are being called “Multiple Benefits of Energy Efficiency.”




performance based (e.g., energy performance contracts). Globally, tools and protocols for M&V of
energy efficiency projects have flourished and have continually improved in range of applications and
level of precision. Recent years have seen a rapid emergence of new technology solutions that seek to
simplify and streamline the M&V process. In developing countries, actual energy savings achieved by
localized energy efficiency interventions are often accompanied by growing electricity demand.

The literature on energy efficiency, which is predominantly based on experiences in the United
States and Europe, identifies factors such as rebound effects (i.e., greater energy use enabled by
increased disposable income resulting from energy efficiency measures) as having a negative impact
on the overall benefit from energy efficiency projects. This makes sense from a purely energy use
perspective. However, the so-called rebound effect may also signify an improvement in the overall
level and/or quality of energy service to the consumer. For example, the IEA notes that in the case
of emerging economies countries, the performance of energy efficiency is not so much about
“doing more with less [energy]” (which was applicable to industrialized countries), but rather
“doing even more [energy services] with more [energy]” and contributing to raising standards of
living and promoting prosperity.8



Systematic Measurement of Multiple Benefits of Energy Efficiency
The literature of the past 20 years has identified a wide range of MBEE with varying classifications
applied to different world regions or by different organizations. Terminology also varies among regions,
studies, and organizations. IEA (2014) uses the term “multiple benefits” for MBEE; other terms used
include: “co-benefits,” “ancillary benefits,” “nonenergy benefits,” and “nonenergy impacts.” This report

    uses the IEA term to acknowledge and recognize the multitude of benefits that can be generated
    with scaling up energy efficiency (Figure 1.2). In developing countries where energy demand is
    constrained by insufficient supply to meet energy service needs because of low income, inadequate
    infrastructure, high technology costs, or a combination of these factors, energy efficiency benefits
    can include reducing poverty; increasing energy access; and contributing to economic development,

public health, and environmental preservation. Failure to recognize these multiple benefits leads to an
underestimation of the value of energy efficiency. However, many questions remain regarding how to
account for MBEE in practice and how to integrate them into policy and program investment decisions
and evaluations. Development institutions, including the World Bank Group, have for many years
used MBEE to describe the additional benefits of energy efficiency in project information documents.
However, the reference to MBEE has generally remained anecdotal and has not been systematically
integrated in project outcome indicators or project appraisals.

MBEE are often characterized from the perspective of the beneficiary to which a particular MBEE
accrues. For example, MBEE can be assessed for the recipients of an energy efficiency measure,
for specific stakeholders such as energy providers or building owners, or for society as a whole. For
recipients of an energy efficiency measure, benefits may include, for example, reduced water usage
expenditures from water-saving measures or increased comfort after a building retrofit. For energy
providers or utilities, benefits include the avoided cost of building new power plants and avoided
maintenance cost of transmission and distribution lines. For society, the most often-cited benefits are
environmental, economic, and social. In some cases, benefits are classified at the level at which their
impacts are assessed, for example micro, macro, local, national, or global. Identifying each party’s
perspective or level of analysis helps to differentiate benefits, reduce the risk of double counting, and
ensure a comprehensive approach.

Information about benefits can be used in different ways. Quantified information about benefits can be
part of a communication strategy to raise awareness and increase support for activities that enhance
energy efficiency from industrial, environmental, health, development, or road security stakeholders.
It can be used as part of a marketing strategy to convince potential participants to opt into an energy
efficiency program, or to increase the level of private investment in energy efficiency measures, or to
demonstrate the achieved impacts. To effectively inform and influence policy and investment decisions
based on cost-benefit analysis, it is important to estimate the monetized value of the benefits. The
biggest challenge of estimating MBEE is due to the multidisciplinary nature of MBEE which also
requires engineering, economic, environmental, and health impact assessments. A considerable
number of MBEE have been considered in the literature. Table 1.1 lists the most often-cited MBEE,
along with associated indicators and assessment methods. Effective M&V systems are crucial
not only to capture the energy efficiency gains but also to appropriately capture the MBEE so
investment and policy decisions are better informed and enabled.

 The World Bank approach is in line—and supportive of—the goals of the UN’s Sustainable Energy for All
(SEforALL) which includes the goal of doubling the improvement rate of energy efficiency, along with achieving
universal access to modern energy service and doubling the share of renewable energy in the energy mix. The
tracking of progress of all countries towards the SEforALL three energy goals, is enabled by the Global Tracking
Framework which consists of a suite of indicators and an accompanying data platform. For more information, see
http://trackingenergy4all.worldbank.org

 IEA analysis has shown that energy efficiency is not just a “hidden fuel” but is also the “first fuel” in many large
economies. For example, in 2014, global final energy consumption expanded by 0.7%, but without efficiency
improvements the growth would have been around three times higher (IEA WEO 2015).
3
 Under the IEA’s 2015 World Energy Outlook “Current Policies Scenario”—taking into account only those policies
that were enacted as of mid-2015—global energy demand is projected to increase 45% between 2013 and 2040;
under its “New Policies Scenario”—describing a pathway for energy markets based on the continuation of existing
policies and measures, as well as the cautious implementation of announced policy proposals, even if they are yet
to be formally adopted—global energy demand increases by 32% from 2013 to 2040.

Under the IEA’s New Policies Scenario (IEA 2015).

As is highlighted in the IEA’s World Energy Investment Outlook 2014.
6
 The other listed conditions are: (i) stable and favorable regulatory frameworks; (ii) clear price signals; (iii)
increased knowledge about energy efficiency across stakeholders; and (iv) standardization of the energy efficiency
investment process.
7
 For example, according to the IEA, more than 80% of the global economic energy efficiency potential in buildings
remains untapped under its “new policies” scenario, which assumes that countries follow policy commitments and
plans they have announced (IEA 2015).
8
 The IEA (2016) notes that targeting “increased energy productivity,” which seeks to increase the value of each unit
of energy consumed in an economy, resonates better with policy makers in emerging and developing economies
than “reducing energy intensity.”

This chapter provides an introduction to the definitions, terminologies, and existing measurement
and verification (M&V) protocols for energy efficiency activities. A lexicon of terminologies and key
concepts is provided in Annex 1.

All protocols share the common objective, which is to “assess the outcome” of an energy efficiency
intervention. The three most common terms for the process to measure and verify the performance
of energy efficiency activities are: Measurement and Verification; Evaluation, Measurement, and
Verification; or Measurement, Reporting, and Verification. The terminologies reflect the evolution and
expansion of the scope for M&V over the past three decades. A summary is provided in Annex 2.

Measurement and verification (M&V) approaches continue to share some fundamental principles,
which include quantification of key parameters, such as electricity consumption and greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions before and after implementation of the energy efficiency interventions and a check
of the reliability of the measured data and methodology. In evaluation, measurement, and verification
(EM&V), “evaluation” is introduced to check if the project/program has met its goal. In measurement,
reporting, and verification (MRV), “reporting” is introduced for communicating the progress in
achieving objectives and implementing project related activities. The terminologies are also equally
applicable to single projects or to a portfolio of projects or programs. This report uses the term M&V as
the focus is on quantification of benefits of energy efficiency.

M&V is essential to assess resource savings and to ensure that savings persist over time. It can also
be used to mitigate different challenges that arise in energy efficiency projects. Energy efficiency
practitioners use M&V for several reasons,9 including:

t   Improve engineering design and project costing. The preparation of a comprehensive project
     design and costing should include all M&V activities and costs in the assessment of a project’s
     economics. Good M&V can also inform future project designs.

t   Enhance energy savings through adjustments in facility operations and maintenance.
     M&V can help discover and manage operation and maintenance (O&M) problems and improve
     functional efficiency of the facility, as well as sustain the energy and cost savings over time.

t   Document financial transactions. In energy efficiency projects where financial payments
     are based on performance (e.g., energy performance contract (EPC) projects), the M&V plan
     forms the basis for documenting performance in a transparent manner (which can be subject to
     independent, third-party verification).

t   Enhance financing for energy efficiency projects. Good M&V increases the transparency
     and credibility of the performance of energy efficiency project investments. Such credibility can
     enhance the confidence of investors and financiers in the energy efficiency project’s performance.




                                      Assessing and Measuring the Performance of Energy Efficiency Projects
                                                                                                              9
     t   Support development of broader energy efficiency programs. The performance of energy
          efficiency activities at selected sites, determined by their M&V, can help predict the performance
          at unmeasured sites and potentially justify an expansion of the energy efficiency program.

     t   Provide opportunity to generate emission reduction credits. Robust M&V for energy efficiency
          is essential for the documentation and accounting of associated emission reductions that could be
          sold in carbon markets (where these exist).

     t   Increase public and market awareness of energy efficiency potential. Clear and transparent
          M&V can help raise awareness on the potential of energy efficiency investments and help
          encourage investments.



     2.1 OVERVIEW OF EXISTING MEASUREMENT & VERIFICATION PROTOCOLS
     This section presents an overview of the key M&V protocols used around the world. Most of the
     protocols were developed to assist energy professionals and stakeholders in measuring, computing,
     and reporting savings achieved from energy efficiency projects and programs. The protocols provide
     a framework for measuring and verifying project outcomes in a transparent, reliable, and consistent
     manner.

     Energy professionals and stakeholders use M&V protocols to develop project-specific
     M&V plans. These documents are not standards, hence, there is no compliance mechanism
     associated with the protocols. Practitioners have to decide to what degree their energy efficiency
     activities would conform to the protocols; a decision that typically depends on the projects’
     scope, the use/value/benefits of more rigorous M&V, and the associated M&V cost. The effort
     required and rigor achieved associated with M&V of energy efficiency projects or programs should
     typically be commensurate with the project capital investment and savings risk. In fact, the appropriate
     level of M&V rigor can often be determined by considering three main factors: (i) the predictability of
     equipment operation; (ii) the magnitude of M&V costs in relation to the value of the energy savings
     benefits produced by the project; and (iii) technical capacity of the operators.

     The M&V protocols reviewed are limited to those published and available in the public domain and
     have been categorized by application. A list of the M&V protocols is provided in Annex 3 and a
     descriptive summary of the protocols is provided in Annex 4. Individual energy efficiency project-
     based M&V is used to determine the savings of an individual energy efficiency project (e.g.,
     replacement of inefficient lamps with energy efficient light-emitting diodes (LED) in a building). The
     program-based M&V activities involve evaluating a large number of individual projects leading to
     impact/performance evaluation at the program level (e.g., an appliance replacement program covering
     a particular geographic area). For emission reduction market-based systems, M&V determines the
     energy savings of eligible energy efficiency activities and their associated GHG emission reductions
     which can subsequently be sold. A comparison of M&V protocols by their applications is provided in
     Annex 5.

                This section presents the findings of a review of energy efficiency projects to understand the type
                and extent of M&V provisions for determining the energy performance and whether and how other
                associated social, economic, and environmental benefits have been documented. The review process
                primarily focused on the lighting and public building sector projects.

                1 | The Energy Efficiency Project, Armenia (2012)10 was aimed at energy efficiency improvements
                      in public sector buildings (e.g., administrative buildings, schools, hospitals) and street lighting.
                      The energy efficiency benefits included reduced energy cost, improved comfort level, and
                      nonstructural upgrade of facilities. The publicly available project document provided detailed
                      M&V guidelines to develop a site-specific M&V plan. The M&V guidelines included the formulas to
                      calculate the heating comfort levels and boiler efficiencies. They also included the measurement
                      periods, energy pricing, data requirements, and expected impacts. Post-installation M&V activities
                      were also specified along with provisions for baseline adjustments. The overall monitoring and
                      evaluation of the program was linked to the Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency (R2E2)
                      Fund. It covered the financial viability of energy efficiency subprojects; energy savings from the
                      implementation of energy efficiency measures; the project pipeline; disbursed, committed, and
                      invested amounts; defaults; and GHG reductions. The reporting from the R2E2 Fund was based
                      on the commissioning and O&M reports provided by the contractors. Emission reductions were
                      estimated based on the observed reduction in heating/energy intensity of retrofitted public and
                      other social facilities after implementation of energy efficiency measures. In addition, the R2E2
                      Fund regularly reviewed a sample of subprojects to monitor the progress.

                2 | The Energy Efficient Lighting Carbon Offset Project in India (2003–06)11 was a bundled
                      street lighting energy efficiency project covering seven municipalities. The energy efficiency
                      improvements in street lighting infrastructure consisted of replacing inefficient street lighting fixtures
                      (T12 fluorescent tube lights and sodium and mercury vapor high-intensity discharge light bulbs)
                      to more efficient T5 fluorescent tube lights, including changing magnetic ballasts to electronic
                      ballasts. The project also consisted of installing a load management system to improve energy

            consumption. Dimming of lights was also incorporated in this project. The project yielded energy
            savings up to 60% and improved power factor of 0.95 compared to 0.70 for old installations. As
            it was developed as a Clean Development Project to benefit from carbon finance,12 the project
            followed the specific Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)13 M&V methodology associated with
            “Demand-Side Energy Efficiency Activities for Specific Technologies (AMS-II.C, Ver. 9)” to monitor
            and verify the project’s emission reductions. The project design document included calculations of
            baseline and project emissions based on the same CDM methodology.

3 | The Bosnia and Herzegovina Energy Efficiency Project (2014–18)14 supports energy efficiency
    investments in public facilities. The project aims at demonstrating benefits of energy efficiency
    improvements in public-sector buildings (such as schools, hospitals, and government buildings)
    and supporting a scalable energy efficiency financing model. Project documentation includes
    plans for M&V activities. It also includes detailed terms of reference (TOR) for conducting the
    detailed energy audit, monitoring and evaluation, developing technical designs, and supervising
    the retrofitting of public buildings. The TOR spells out the activities that are to be carried out as
    part of M&V, detailing the energy audit requirements, pre- and post-retrofit activities, reporting
    requirements, possible energy efficiency measures such as upgrading indoor lighting, roof
    thermal insulation and renovation, wall thermal insulation, basement thermal insulation, and
    retrofitting buildings heating, cooling, and domestic hot water system(s).

4 | The Montenegro Energy Efficiency Project (2008–14)15 focused on energy efficiency
    improvements in public facilities such as schools, hospitals, and government buildings. The
    energy efficiency improvements were broadly classified as thermal envelope measures and
    mechanical improvements. The thermal improvement measures consist of insulation of walls,
    roofs, attics, etc. The mechanical improvements consist of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
    (HVAC) improvements and solar thermal water heating systems. M&V activities have been
    carried out as specified in the project’s “Methodology for Technical Monitoring and Evaluation of
    the Results Achieved.” A combined technical monitoring summary report with information on all
    project sites was prepared consisting of a summary of the monitoring program findings, building
    retrofit measures, building retrofit costs, monitoring activities, energy savings, financial savings,
    carbon emission reductions, building comfort, etc. The data measurement periods for each site
    were taken over 14 days on an average.

The analysis of the aforementioned projects suggests that no single M&V approach is equally
suitable in all project situations. The costs of alternative approaches will vary, and the selection of
M&V methods will depend on the characteristics and objectives of individual projects (e.g., projects
involving monetization of energy savings versus program evaluations). The appropriate M&V approach
will depend on its role (e.g., whether it is the basis of payment), type of information that is required,
tolerable risk, and the cost involved. Below are some good practices that can be drawn from the
review of the aforementioned projects which could be used as guiding principles for designing M&V
plans for future energy efficiency projects.

Use of established standard M&V protocol. Established M&V protocols should be considered for
developing M&V plans. There is often no need to start from scratch or reinvent the wheel, in the presence
of internationally approved robust M&V methodologies, including CDM methodologies. As mentioned
above, it is important to also consider the cost associated with using a particular M&V protocol or
methodology, as the magnitude of the M&V costs should be commensurate with the value of the benefits
(e.g., energy cost savings, emission reduction certificates, etc.) produced by the energy efficiency project.

Reducing uncertainty. Ambiguity of outcome can be avoided through a structured analysis method
and use of continuous monitoring, although continuous monitoring may not always be feasible. The

     Energy Efficiency Project in Armenia provided detailed engineering calculations for M&V in the bidding
     document. The Energy Efficiency Project Bosnia and Herzegovina provided a detailed M&V plan in the
     TOR document as well.

     Increase transparency. The requirement to report on the performance of energy efficiency projects helps
     provide transparency. Using an independent third party for carrying out M&V helps enhance confidence in
     reported performance, such as with the Energy Efficiency Project in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

     Measure the co-benefits of intervention. Measuring the social and ancillary benefits of the energy
     efficiency intervention will help in an all-encompassing analysis of the project to enable better
     assessment of a project’s overall impact. The Montenegro Energy Efficiency Project included the
     measurement of the social impact of the initiative through social monitoring and a target evaluation
     survey. (The multiple benefits of energy efficiency are discussed further later in this report).

     1 | Bangladesh Energy Efficiency Improvements Project (2011–13).16 The Bangladesh energy
          efficiency improvement project for street lighting and water pumping was a technical assistance
          project funded by ADB. The main objective of this technical assistance was to introduce
          energy efficiency programs in municipalities by: (a) establishing best practices through pilot
          demonstration projects in Tongi Pourashava; (b) capacity building of municipal engineers and
          officials throughout Bangladesh toward the adoption of energy efficiency projects in street
          lighting and water pumping; and (c) raising awareness among the stakeholders and public
          representatives with regard to energy efficiency initiatives. The activities under this program
          consisted of pilot demonstrations and capacity building using various training programs. The
          declared energy savings from the energy efficiency water pumping program were 0.696 million
          kWh per year and those from energy efficiency street lighting were 0.26 million kWh per year.17

         process consisted of identification and procurement of required M&V equipment (30 single digital
         energy meters, 10 voltage controllers, 10 timer controls), setting up of measuring instruments,
         collection of energy consumption values to establish the baseline energy consumption before
         the implementation of the pilot projects, collection of energy consumption values to estimate
         the energy savings after the implementation of the pilot projects, data analysis, and reporting
         on energy and monetary savings. Further, an assessment was carried out for energy efficiency
         street lighting and energy efficiency water pumping projects to analyze if these could potentially
         be registered as official CDM projects and generate CDM credits based on emission reductions
         resulting from the verified energy savings. The analysis showed that the water pumping project
         could possibly be developed as a programmatic CDM project, but it would not be worth it for street
         lighting, largely due to the high transaction costs (for MRV) that would be involved. Subsequently,
         a project information note was prepared for the water pumping CDM project and submitted to the
         CDM authority (Designated National Authority) in Bangladesh and ADB.

     2 | Visakhapatnam Street Lighting Project, India (2014–15).18 The project was implemented
         by Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) on behest of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal
         Corporation. This was not a typical retrofit project as the street lighting infrastructure had sustained
         considerable damage as a result of Cyclone Hudhud. Proper baseline data were not available,
         since only 10,000 streetlights were operational out of the total 90,000 streetlights.

         The Vishakhapatnam Street Lighting Project uses an annuity-based deemed-savings approach
         to quantify the energy savings. Energy savings from the implementation of the project form the
         basis for arriving at the annuity amount. This methodology is simple to use. The annuity-based
         methodology is based on savings determined by extrapolation of limited measurements to the
         entire area of the street lighting project. Payments are determined from these measurements
         without linking to electricity bills or actual or metered savings. A central control and monitoring
         system has been installed as part of this project, which will help in the automation of streetlights
         and continuous monitoring in the reporting period of the project.

     3 | Energy Efficient Lighting in Commercial Sector, Samoa (2011–15).19 This project was part of
         the program on Promoting Energy Efficiency in Pacific initiative, which was co-financed by ADB
         and Global Environment Facility (GEF). Overall the program covered five Pacific developing
         member countries—the Cook Islands, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu—with a
         goal of reducing energy consumption in the residential, commercial, and public sectors through
         the implementation of energy efficiency measures, and to establish the policy and implementation
         frameworks to move toward the goals of reducing fossil fuel imports, achieving total energy
         savings, and reducing GHG emissions. This particular project involved cost-effective energy
         savings in the commercial sector through the replacement of five-foot T8 fluorescent lamps with
         magnetic ballasts, which have a rated power consumption of 76.9 W (including ballast power
         losses) with energy-efficient LED batteries that have a total rated power consumption of 28.8 W
         (including LED driver). The project was able to achieve energy savings of 145,003 kWh per year,
         cost savings of $53,702 per year, and GHG emission reduction of 116 tCO2 per year.

    The Energy Efficient Lighting in Commercial Sector, Samoa project had a detailed M&V report,
    which described the activities undertaken as part of the M&V exercise. The M&V plan followed
    international protocols such as the International Performance Measurement and Verification
    Protocol (IPMVP) and CDM rules for lighting retrofits. The activities consisted of pre- and post-
    retrofit baseline measurement, along with light quality measurement, sample size selection based
    on IPMVP, etc. The M&V report also provided detailed information on the measurement equipment,
    equipment procured, and also gave the delivery and installation dates along with photographs.

4 | Energy Efficient Street Lighting, Tonga (2011–15).20 Cofinanced by ADB and GEF, this project
    was part of the large program on Promoting Energy Efficiency in Pacific (PEEP2). This energy
    efficiency street lighting project was implemented in the Tongatapu region in Tonga. The project
    aimed to achieve cost-effective energy savings through the replacement of 100/150/250 W high-
    pressure sodium (HPS) lamps together with existing luminaires installed in the Tongatapu Island
    with high-efficiency LED luminaires. The project resulted in energy savings of 67,180 kWh per
    year, cost savings of $20,342 per year, and GHG emission reductions of 60 tCO2 per year.

    The M&V for Energy Efficient Street Lighting Project, Tonga, complied with both IPMVP Option A
    and CDM methodology AMS II.L “demand-side activities for efficient outdoor and street lighting
    technologies.” The M&V activities consisted of pre- and post-baseline measurements, light quality
    measurement, etc. The M&V report provided details in measurement boundary, parameters measured,
    baseline energy savings calculations, and light quality measurement methodology. The document was
    supplemented with information on measurement equipment and photographs of the M&V activities.

These projects also suggest some cross-cutting takeaways such as the following:

Using established standard M&V protocol. Established M&V protocols (as provided in Annex 3) are
available and can be utilized for developing M&V plans. The Energy Efficient Lighting in Commercial
Sector Project, Samoa, and Energy Efficient Street Lighting Project, Tonga, have utilized internationally
accepted protocols such as IPMVP and AMS-II to develop M&V plans.

Reducing uncertainty. Ambiguity of outcome should be avoided through a structured analysis
method and use of continuous monitoring, particularly when energy savings (and/or associated GHG
reductions) generate payment. The M&V plans for Energy Efficient Lighting in Commercial Sector,
Samoa, and Energy Efficient Street Lighting, Tonga, provided detailed methods for baseline and post-
installation measurements. The Visakhapatnam Street Lighting Project uses a centralized control &
monitoring system to continuously monitor streetlights.

Measuring co-benefits of intervention. Measuring the social and ancillary benefits of the energy efficiency
intervention will help in an all-encompassing analysis of the project. The Bangladesh Energy Efficiency
Improvements Project made an effort to evaluate the capacity-building activity carried out under the project.

     2.3 CONCLUSION
     Energy efficiency projects should include, from the beginning, the elaboration of an M&V plan
     that outlines how the performance of the project will be monitored and assessed. The review of
     a sample of projects indicates that while the energy efficiency projects examined include methods
     for estimating energy savings ex ante (i.e., during the project preparation phase), very few projects
     include, from the start, the provisions or methods to systematically measure and assess, ex post, the
     actual performance of energy efficiency projects and programs. This can lead to:

     t      Potential under- or overestimation of energy savings;

     t      Possibility of undermining the credibility of energy efficiency interventions and, thus, their potential
             replication or scale up;

     t      Missed opportunities for learning from the actual performance of the energy efficiency
             interventions; and

     t      Making it difficult to develop and enable energy performance contracts.

     In the case of energy efficiency projects in developing countries, situations of unsatisfied and
     growing energy demand typically affect the assessment of the performance of energy efficiency
     projects. Such situations should be taken into account with baseline assumptions reflecting
     increasing energy consumption in the future. In the advanced economies, an increase in energy
     consumption following the implementation of energy efficiency measures is typically referenced as the
     rebound effect or take-back effect (see Section 3.4). However, in developing economies, increases in
     energy consumption accompanying energy efficiency interventions may be a reflection of suppressed
     demand, where the “baseline” reflects inadequate or unsatisfied quantity and low quality of energy
     services, ignoring the multiple benefits of energy efficiency. These issues are further discussed in the
     following chapters.

3.1 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEASUREMENT & VERIFICATION
Apart from measuring and verifying the energy savings, it is important that the M&V methodology
employed should enhance the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs. The M&V approach should
not be overbearing on the energy efficiency project. It is important to strike a delicate balance between
cost, rigor, and complexity. Some fundamental principles that should be followed with respect to M&V
are as follows:

Accuracy. M&V cost is a major consideration with respect to accuracy. The M&V should be as
accurate as possible with the available budget. M&V costs should be small relative to the monetary
value of the savings being evaluated. M&V expenditures should also be consistent with the financial
implications of over- or under-reporting the performance of a project. Accuracy trade-offs should be
accompanied by increased conservativeness in any estimates and judgments.

Thoroughness. The reporting of energy savings should consider all effects of a project. M&V activities
should be thorough and should be able to use the measurements to quantify all the significant effects
while estimating the program benefits.

Conservativeness. In programs where savings are estimated due to poor data availability,
conservative values should be adopted to avoid any risks in over- or under-estimation of benefits and
impacts.

Measurement/Estimation. Critical performance parameters should be measured, while other less
critical or predictable parameters may be estimated.

Transparency. All M&V activities should be clearly defined and disclosed. The M&V plan and
M&V reports should reflect the actual savings and the methods used for measuring the savings.
Transparency is very important for avoiding any conflict at any stage when it comes to sharing of
benefits among stakeholders.



3.2 UNDERSTANDING THE COST OF MONITORING & VERIFICATION
It is difficult to make generalizations on the costs of M&V because of the wide range of energy
efficiency projects and different activities associated with M&V. International Performance
Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) suggests that M&V costs are typically less than
10% of the total project cost (EVO 2007).

Factors that can influence the M&V costs are as follows:

t   Value of projected savings

t   Complexity of efficiency equipment

     t   Total amount of equipment

     t   Number of interactive effects among resource-consuming systems

     t   Level of uncertainty of savings

     t   Risk allocation for achieved savings between the owner and the energy service company

     t   Other valuable uses of M&V data (e.g., optimizing O&M, selling carbon credits)

     t   Availability and capability of an energy management system

     t   Frequency of M&V activities

     t   Complexity and size of the project

     Based on the type of M&V approach used (Birr 2001), the M&V costs in percentage of total project
     cost could be as follows:

     t   Retrofit isolation with measurement of key parameters: 1%–5%

     t   Retrofit isolation with measurement of all parameters: 3%–10%

     t   Whole facility measurement: 1%–3% (if meters are already installed)

     t   Computer simulation costs: 3%–10%



     Balancing Cost and Rigor
     A challenging aspect of M&V is providing adequate accuracy while ensuring the cost of M&V is
     reasonable. There is no empirical formula or easy way to define a point where rigor and M&V costs
     intersect. One must rely on judgment and experience to determine a cost-effective approach.
     Figure 3.1 represents the incremental value of the information obtained from additional M&V which will
     at some point be less than the cost to obtain it.

     A few strategies for keeping M&V costs low while maintaining the rigor include the following:

     t   Use extensive metering in the baseline period and stipulate values for parameters which cannot
          be metered

     t   Verify key performance items using periodic rather than continuous data collection (should not be
          confused with continuous M&V) to reduce data collection and management issues

     t   Rely upon existing instrumentation, energy management systems, and energy management
          behavioral practices wherever possible

     t   Engage a third-party M&V expert to assist in the development of the M&V plan to ensure key
          agency interests are protected and costs are minimized

     Ultimately, it is also important to consider in which cases the value/contribution of greater M&V rigor

3.3 RECAP OF ENERGY SAVINGS CALCULATIONS
The standard equation for calculating savings from energy efficiency projects is as follows:

                        Energy Savings = Adjusted Baseline Energy – Actual Energy

and

     Adjusted Baseline Energy = Baseline Energy ± Routine Adjustments ± Non-Routine Adjustments

Where,

       Actual Energy = Energy consumption measured during the post-retrofit/post-investment
       performance period

       Baseline Energy = Energy consumption measured during the baseline period

       Routine Adjustments = Adjustments due to regular changes in independent variables (e.g.,
       changing weather conditions, varying production levels)

       Non-Routine Adjustments = One-off or infrequent changes in energy use or demand that occur
       due to changes in static factors (e.g., building facade changes, extreme weather events, building
       extensions, and changes to equipment)

                                                                                                              23
     3.3.1 Energy Cost Savings and Price Risk
     The success of energy efficiency projects is almost always evaluated based on financial returns and
     energy saved. A successful energy efficiency project will result in financial benefit due to reduction in
     energy use, which may be compared to the pre-investment/pre-retrofit level or compared to business-
     as-usual projected energy levels. This is known as energy cost avoidance or cost savings. Energy
     efficiency projects often result in other financial benefits that improve the project’s payback.

                           Project Savings = Energy Cost Savings + Other Financial Benefits

     Where,

         Energy Cost Savings = Avoided energy cost (or cost saving) resulting from the energy efficiency
         project

         Other Financial Benefits = Other areas of project savings (e.g., maintenance cost, future
         equipment replacement cost)

     Non-financial co-benefits can also be evaluated to determine the overall success of the project. The
     equation for cost avoidance is:

                 Energy Cost Savings = Pricing Structure × (Energy Use adjusted baseline – Energy Use actual)

     The energy baseline is adjusted for post-retrofit conditions. The same energy pricing is applied to the
     adjusted baseline as well as the actual energy usage.

     Energy Cost Savings are important as these take into account the changes in factors that determine
     energy use (e.g., changes in site activities, effects of independent variables such as production or
     weather, price risks such as changes to energy contracts, structures, or tariff rates, etc.).



     3.3.2 Uncertainty
     Any measured savings include some degree of uncertainty. Since no instrument can be perfectly
     accurate, all measurements contain some error or difference between the true and observed value. In
     addition, energy savings are based on measured values and to some extent on estimates. The goal
     is to reduce the uncertainty in the reported energy savings values, which can be accomplished by
     limiting the errors in measurements and analysis conducted.

     Calculating the uncertainty in the estimated savings is not required for most projects, but uncertainty is
     often estimated in order to set the overall level of savings guarantee in performance contract projects.
     The uncertainty at the project level falls under four types: measurement, sampling, estimation, and
     modeling. The project often does not contain one or more of the four components. The total project
     uncertainty is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual standard
     errors (SE) of the components, as follows:

                            SEProject = ͙(SEMeasurement)2 + (SESampling)2 + (SEEstimation)2 + (SEModeling)2




     Chapter 3
24
Measurement. Measurement uncertainty is introduced due to metering equipment inaccuracies. For
example, the specifications for a meter may indicate that it is accurate to within ±3%, meaning that any
reading taken using the meter may be up to 3% off in either direction. Additional error in measurements
may be introduced if the instrument is not properly calibrated or if it is inappropriately used. Data
management can also introduce errors. If the accuracy of any instrument is less than suitable, the
measurements may introduce unacceptable levels of error into the energy calculations. Instrumentation
accuracy requirements should be sufficient to ensure that overall energy and cost estimates are
reasonable. Annex 6 provides a note on technologies for M&V.

Sampling. Sampling uncertainty occurs when measurements are taken on a sample and the results
are generalized to the entire population of the appliance/equipment. For example, it may not be
economical to monitor the hours on every fixture in a building lighting retrofit. So a sample is monitored
and the results are applied to the remainder of the lighting population. Sampling uncertainty is
calculated from the standard deviation of the sampled results. When the standard deviation is large,
the uncertainty is also large.

Estimating. Estimates have to be made when values cannot be measured directly. When engineering
estimates are used in place of actual measurements, uncertainty is introduced. This uncertainty needs
to be estimated based on the expected accuracy of the estimated values. For example, the efficiency
of a motor may be estimated rather than measured directly. The estimate would be based on the type
and age of the motor and may result in an estimated stipulation error of ±15% (e.g., 75%, between
60% and 90%). If a building engineer who is familiar with the motor gives additional operational
information about the equipment, the uncertainty may be less, such as ±10% (e.g., 75%, between
67.5% and 82.5%).

Modeling. Modeling uncertainty is introduced when savings are estimated using engineering or
simulation models. The accuracy of any model is based on the ability of the model to account for all
variations in energy use by employing the proper analysis techniques, including all relevant variables
and excluding those that are irrelevant.

Calculating the uncertainty in the estimated savings is not always required, but this uncertainty is often
estimated in order to set the overall level of savings guarantee for each energy efficiency measure.
Including the uncertainty in calculated savings provides a more meaningful statement of savings.
Uncertainty is typically proportional to the complexity of the energy efficiency measure.



3.4 THE REBOUND EFFECT
What is called “rebound effect” assumes an improvement in energy efficiency (at technology or policy
level) but also a portion of the achieved energy cost savings used toward more/better energy services
which constitute a “rebound.” In effect, it is a reduction in expected overall energy savings from an
energy efficiency investment because of behavioral responses leading to energy consumption. A
rebound effect typically lowers the achieved reduction in energy use compared to the forecasted
reduction in energy use that may ignore consumer and/or market responses. Such consumer and

                                                                                                             25
     market-wide responses can occur because the energy efficiency improvement changes relative prices
     and income level.

     The rebound effect refers to that portion of energy savings that is lost due to consumer and
     market responses as a result of energy efficiency improvements. It is the difference between the
     actual reductions in energy consumption and the forecasted reduction in energy consumption, a
     forecast that may ignore the consumer and market responses. The rebound effect can be induced
     as a result of energy cost savings being utilized toward more/better energy services to overcome
     suppressed energy demand or improved product attributes resulting in a market response in the form
     of increased usage, as noted above. Increasingly, literature emphasizes the importance of linking this
     rebound effect to developmental benefits in the case of developing countries.

     For example, the IEA points out that in the case of developing countries, and in particular emerging
     economies, improving energy efficiency often comes along with increasing energy consumption
     (to meet unmet and growing demand for energy services)—something the IEA refers to as “energy
     efficient prosperity.” In the case of these countries, the performance of energy efficiency is not so
     much about “doing more with less [energy]” (which is applicable to industrialized countries), but rather
     “doing even more [energy services] with more [energy]” and contributing to raising standards of living
     and promoting prosperity.21 This shift in how energy efficiency should be considered is reflected in
     the increased focus on the multiple-benefits generated by energy efficiency investments and policies
     and will be discussed in the next chapter. While the energy efficiency literature and measurement
     methods will be evolving to better reflect energy efficiency’s multiple productive impacts, the rebound
     effect is traditionally expressed in the percentage of the forecasted reduction in energy use lost due to
     consumer and market response.

     Example: Consider an appliance that uses 100 kWh per year of electricity. Suppose this appliance
     is replaced by an efficient appliance that is expected to save 10 kWh per year before consumer and
     market responses. The consumer and market responses, as a result of energy efficiency, increase
     energy use by 1 kWh per year, resulting in a rebound effect of 10%, since 1 kWh of the 10 kWh annual
     energy savings is taken back by the consumer and market responses.

     The aforementioned broad definition captures the principle of rebound effect, but it does not dwell
     on different factors associated with how energy efficiency is improved and other energy- and cost-
     related attributes. There are two highly generalized scenarios. It is important to pay close attention to
     consumer behavioral considerations when identifying scenarios applicable to specific projects, as the
     rebound effect in underserved areas, where baseline service level was very low, could be significantly
     high. The scenarios presented below are for illustrative purposes only:

     Scenario 1 | Energy efficiency improves while all other attributes remain constant. In this case, the
         rebound effect can be completely credited to energy efficiency. For example, a car manufacturer
         improves fuel efficiency as a result of an innovation without any increase in product cost and
         also holding other attributes constant. The subsequent market and consumer responses can be




     Chapter 3
26
    considered (close to) a pure concept of rebound as it captures only the responses induced by
    energy efficiency.

Scenario 2 | Energy efficiency improves but other attributes, such as cost of energy services
    and/or product, change (increase or decrease). For example, government policy requires car
    manufacturers to improve fuel efficiency and, in this case, the energy efficiency improvements
    are costly, resulting in an increase in car cost. This may also induce changes in other attributes
    such as size and capacity. Subsequently, price and energy services provided change along with
    energy efficiency. The rebound effect in this case is compounded with energy efficiency and other
    attributes.

When accounting for rebound effect, it is important to distinguish between the two aforementioned
scenarios. Important considerations for the rebound effect include the following:

1 | Energy demand can increase due to many factors. Economic growth and improved technologies
    are among the important factors. It is crucial to understand the socioeconomic, consumer
    behavior, and cultural factors and not rush to labelling everything as a “rebound effect.”

2 | It would be expected that what is traditionally labelled rebound effect could be higher in
    developing countries than in developed countries because of large unmet energy demand that
    may be partly satisfied by using money saved from a particular energy efficiency measure or
    investment. However, the relative size of the rebound effect is unclear. It is theorized that if energy
    services and other goods such as food and clothing are substitutes, the rebound effect is high. If
    they are complements, then the rebound is lower.

3 | As mentioned above, a major misunderstanding associated with rebound is that it is perceived
    as an undesirable effect. This perception comes from focusing on energy reduction as the sole
    objective of a project or program, rather than welfare maximization. Rebound is a product of a
    consumer’s response to changes in relative process, so by preference it provides welfare benefits.
    In fact, while some argue that the rebound effect annuls part of the benefits of energy efficiency
    activities, others (e.g., Gillingham 2014) argue that including rebound effect in energy efficiency
    evaluations is most likely to add to the count of benefits and the only increase in costs are due to
    external costs from additional usage.

4 | In the cases of energy efficiency activities implemented in situations of supressed demand,22 it is
    particularly important to consider how the level of the baseline (against which energy savings are
    assessed) is set.23 For example, in situations with suppressed demand, it may not be adequate to
    set the energy use baseline at a constant level over time, but rather recognize that the energy use
    baseline should be differentiated according to desired and attained level/quality of service. The
    idea is that energy efficiency activities would avoid future (less efficient) energy use while meeting
    the demand for improved level/quality of service.

Rebound effect is a complex phenomenon and is difficult to estimate. At the project level, M&V
activities can include assessment of rebound effect and try to attribute the rebound to the factors
responsible for it (such as productivity, socioeconomic improvement, etc.). Quantifying the rebound

     will be a challenging task unless it is a direct rebound. The rebound effect induced by a program
     or on a macroeconomic scale should be part of the energy efficiency program design. It should
     be incorporated into projections or energy forecasting models during program design stage. Also,
     determining the level of rebound will require good statistical sampling and follow-on analysis to
     estimate the scale of rebound. It is also advisable to consider the improved utility for consumers or the
     improved welfare impact on project beneficiaries, as an economic benefit.

     It is also important to document and account for the benefits and development impacts that may
     come with energy efficiency policies and interventions, so these important impacts of energy
     efficiency are not simply swept under the “rebound” rug. The next section discusses this in greater
     detail.



     3.5 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR UNDERTAKING AN EFFECTIVE MEASUREMENT &
     VERIFICATION PLAN
     There are a number of M&V protocols and guidebooks                  M&V should be a critical aspect of any energy efficiency
     available to successfully prepare and implement project-            projects or programs in order to ensure value for money,
     specific M&V plans. The review conducted in this report             justify continued or increased funding, and establish the
     shows that M&V is an evolving subject and can be                    basis of payment mechanisms.
     adapted to different contexts. It is also important to note
     that the decision to conform to a particular M&V standard
     or protocol is determined by many elements such as region, economics, capacity, and project type.

     A delicate balance has to be maintained between a robust and reliable M&V that is not only cost
     effective, but also easy to implement. When using an international M&V protocol/guideline, it is up to
     the practitioner to decide how rigorously to conform to the guidance document. Often it is advisable
     to use multiple approaches within the same M&V plan without affecting the overall quality of the M&V.
     As an example, it would be acceptable to measure only the “key parameters” in a lighting retrofit while
     measuring “all parameters” for a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) retrofit. This type of
     strategy would help in reducing the overall cost of the M&V without affecting its quality.

     The review of a sample of projects undertaken as part of this report reveals gaps or opportunities for
     strengthening in the current M&V and impact evaluation of energy efficiency projects. The gaps and
     omissions in the M&V activities can lead to improper analysis of the outcomes and loss of confidence
     in the performance of energy efficiency activities. This is especially true in developing countries where
     the energy service company (ESCO) business and project implementation through the route of energy
     performance contract (EPC) are still evolving. Project developers and energy service companies
     should not consider M&V as an extra activity. Instead M&V should be integrated as a value-adding
     activity, which can build the confidence of program stakeholders and ensure fair sharing of
     benefits.

     Inclusion of the multiple benefits of energy efficiency (MBEE) can play a crucial role in enhancing
     the value of M&V for the stakeholders. In many instances, the nonenergy benefits from an energy




     Chapter 3

efficiency project could be much higher than the energy saved. For example, an energy efficiency
street lighting project can enhance lighting quality, reducing road accidents, while increasing the
perception of security among pedestrians. The social benefits can be monetized in the form of
reduced government spending.

  “Suppressed demand” typically refers to situations where a minimum service level to meet basic human needs
(e.g., basic energy services such as lighting, cooking, drinking water supply, and space heating), was unavailable
prior to the implementation of the energy efficiency activity.

                          BENEFITS OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY




The multiple benefits of energy efficiency (MBEE) are typically less tangible and more difficult to
quantify than energy savings. Moreover, policy decision-making tools require that benefits are
monetized to enable comparison with costs of energy efficiency programs. Table 4.1 summarizes
some of the methods used to quantify and, in some cases, also monetize MBEE. Monetizing the
quantified benefits often requires the extra step of assigning a value to the benefits, for example a
carbon price in the case of carbon mitigation benefits or the statistical value of life in the case of
health. A detailed list of methodologies is provided in Annex 7.

Collecting primary data may be expensive (e.g., conducting measurement analysis) and take time
(e.g., conducting surveys). However, once a reasonable level of evidence has been developed
through primary data collection methods for a specific benefit, it is possible to use these
examples as references to estimate probable impact at a larger scale or for a similar situation.

                                                                                                                                   31
     In fact, many of the current valuations of the MBEE rely on estimates from previous studies that have
     established some evidence base. Having an established evidence base derived from a rigorous
     analysis is a key factor to scale up the use of accounting for MBEE.



     4.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE MULTIPLE BENEFITS OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY
     The topic of MBEE encompasses a wide range of impacts, including economic, health and physical
     comfort, social, and environmental (both local and global), among others. Identifying all of the direct
     and indirect benefits of energy efficiency is an evolving field. This section describes some of the
     benefits commonly cited in the literature, generally employed quantification methods, and examples of
     their impacts.



     4.1.1 Recipient Benefits
     Description
     Recipient benefits refer to the benefits that accrue to the
     participants of a program. The range of these benefits are          Low-income households tend to receive greater health and
     large and depend on the target of the program (residential,         comfort benefits from energy efficiency programs because
     commercial, public, and industrial sectors) as well as the          their baseline conditions before improvements are generally
     energy efficiency measures considered (lighting, heating,           lower than those of average-income households.
     cooling, steam, etc.). The importance of these benefits also
     varies according to recipients’ income levels.

     In a study for the state of Massachusetts, USA, 29 different benefits were identified just for the
     residential sector, ranging from noise reduction to more durable homes (Tetra Tech and NMR 2011;
     see Annex 8 for a full list). Table 4.2 describes some of the most common recipient energy efficiency
     benefits beyond energy cost saving benefits. If demonstrated suitably, these multiple benefits can
     become the prime motivation for recipients to participate in a program and invest in energy efficiency
     measures.



     Quantification Method
     Some benefits are relatively easy to measure, such as water savings or O&M reductions. Others
     are subjective and less tangible, such as “increased comfort,” and others, such as improved health
     or productivity, are difficult to measure and require rigorous study to show evidence. Table 4.3 lists
     indicators that can be used for measurement.

     O&M cost savings would constitute a notable portion of an energy efficiency project’s saving benefits,
     yet O&M cost savings are rarely calculated rigorously. Measurement consists of collecting data and
     conducting interviews with facility O&M staff regarding systems operation, occupancy patterns, and
     problems with equipment reliability before and after implementation of an energy efficiency measure.

Health Impacts       Improvement in human health as the result of efficiency measures installed Building measures
                     in residences and businesses include improvements in indoor air quality,
                     better ventilation, moisture control, building envelope noise protection
                     improvements, etc.
Labor Productivity   Improving the energy efficiency of a building can result in gains in worker   Insulation retrofit
                     productivity. Measures such as replacing an older air conditioning or         Heating/Cooling system
                     lighting system with a more efficient system can improve air quality,         improvements
                     increase comfort, and reduce glare on computer screens, all of which          Lighting
                     contribute to increasing employee productivity. Since labor costs generally
                     represent the largest share of a commercial entity’s costs, even a small
                     percentage gain in productivity can result in significant cost savings.
Comfort              Energy efficiency measures affect comfort through temperature, indoor air     Building measures
                     quality, lighting, acoustics, physical space, and humidity.
Energy Access        Energy efficiency increases the level of energy services delivered per unit   All
                     of energy delivered. This is especially relevant for investments in new
                     capacity in developing countries and investment in renewable energy. The
                     amount needed to be invested can be reduced if the energy supplied is
                     used to purchase energy efficient equipment. Energy efficiency maximizes
                     the level of service delivered by energy supply while minimizing its cost
                     and its environmental impacts.
Water Savings        Measures that are designed to save energy and that also reduce water and      Water heating
                     wastewater flows, (e.g., low-flow showerheads).                               Washing machine
                                                                                                   Dishwasher
Property Value       Investments in energy efficiency increase the value of the property where     Building measures
                     the measures are installed. People increasingly value a well-insulated
                     energy-efficient home which is perceived as more comfortable, healthier,
                     and cheaper to run.
Safety               Energy efficiency can improve visibility and therefore public safety. LED’s   House retrofit
                     white color rendering and uniform illumination patterns are considered to     Street lighting
                     improve visibility, which helps reduce criminal activity and can improve
                     safety for drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians.
Competitiveness      Energy efficiency is strongly linked in various ways with competitiveness: Industry programs
                     energy efficiency contributes toward reducing overall company expenses,
                     reduces waste, increases productivity, modernizes production lines, and,
                     in some cases, boosts innovation, all of which contribute to an increase in
                     competiveness for companies. Moreover, by lowering energy costs, energy
                     efficiency also contributes toward reducing the exposure to the risks stem-
                     ming from volatile energy prices.

                                       heating or cooling, etc.)

      Competitiveness                  Market share, cost per unit of output, energy intensity


     O&M cost savings can result from a lower replacement rate of equipment (lamps for example),
     reduced cooling systems inspection, reduced repair costs, or reduced tenant turnover (Cluett and
     Amann 2015).

     Health impacts are generally difficult to measure. Solid evidence based studies, generally using
     randomized control trial (RCT) methods, need to be developed to show the benefits of energy efficiency
     improvements on health. Once evidence is established, modeling can be used to assess impacts
     from energy efficiency on health in other projects, as it is the case in the United Kingdom, later in this
     chapter.

     Labor productivity gains from energy efficiency improvements in buildings are rarely measured
     due to the difficulty of quantifying knowledge-based output from service companies (Miller, et al.
     2009). However, some studies have shown and quantify the productivity benefits of a more energy
     efficient building environment by collecting data on absenteeism, hours worked, tardiness, safety rule
     violations, number of grievances filed, and employee turnover, for example, before and after a program
     implementation (Building Efficiency Initiative 2013; Munch et al. 2012; ASHRAE 2010; Seppanen
     et al. 2006; Hedge et al. 2004; Loftness et al. 2003). These data can be complemented by qualitative
     information collected though surveys that ask employees to report on productivity. Annex 10 provides
     quantitative and qualitative indicators of labor productivity measures.

     Comfort improvements can be measured by the level of satisfaction of building occupants through
     surveys which ask about the comfort of home or workplace (see Annex 9). Comfort benefits can
     also be quantified through a willingness-to-pay survey or through the level of energy taken back
     for increasing thermal comfort (Tetra Tech and NMR 2011; Payne et al. 2015). It is also possible to
     measure thermal comfort improvements by measuring indoor temperature. Some energy efficiency
     measures, like the application of cool roofs, can minimize the heat gain of a building and reduce indoor
     temperature (Garg et al. 2016).

While the benefit of energy efficiency to energy access in developing countries is generally admitted,
methods and metrics to quantify this benefit are still evolving. The first step is to move away from
the binary definition of energy access (having/not having an electricity connection) and to consider
the services that energy enables (lighting, cooling, entertainment, etc.). Greater efficiency increases
access to energy services by expanding the amount of services that can be provided by a fixed
amount (or cost) of energy. The benefits of energy efficiency on energy access can be measured by
an increase in the level of energy services accessed by households, such as lumen hours in the case
of lighting, useful energy in the case of heating or cooling, etc. The World Bank is supporting a multitier
approach where the definition of energy access26 is based on the performance of the energy supplied.
Through this new approach, the benefits of energy efficiency are defined as increased in the duration
of energy services and improvement in the affordability of energy services to households. In this
framework, Tier 1 level of energy access includes the amount of lighting in lumen hours per day and
phone charging. As the tier level increases, the level of energy services is augmented (ESMAP 2014).

Water savings occurring from energy efficiency measures, such as low-flow showerheads, can be
estimated by using engineering supplemented by measurement of water use before and after the
implementation of a measure.

Increased property value is measured by tracking sales data or interviewing real estate experts. An
alternative is to conduct post-upgrade property value appraisal. The Appraisal Institute (2013) provides
real estate appraisers with detailed information on how to analyze the effects of energy performance on
property value. This contributes to showing the lending opportunity for financial institutions. Increased
safety is assessed by measuring the number of accidents before and after a program or by conducting
surveys about the perceived safety improvements from users (Frith and Jackett 2013).

Competitiveness is a widely used term and many definitions are associated with this concept.
Measurement can be defined in two ways: (i) comparatively to others by using data on market share,
or (ii) accordingly to cost indicators, by collecting data on the energy productivity of a company
(reverse of energy intensity).



Understanding Impacts
This section includes select examples of studies that have assessed recipient benefit impacts.

United Kingdom. The Health Impact of Domestic Energy Efficiency Measures (HIDEEM) model was
developed to estimate and monetize the health impacts associated with energy efficiency measures in
houses (UCL 2016). This model is used by the Department of Energy and Climate Change in making
program development decisions.

India. Passive technologies that reduce heat gain such as cool roofs, reflective wall coatings, exterior
shading, etc., contribute to reduce cooling demand and improve thermal comfort. A case study in
Hyderabad showed an average in-room temperature reduction of 2°C and a peak reduction of 4.3°C
(Garg et al. 2016).

                                                                                                              35
     Massachusetts, United States. Tetra Tech and NMR (2011) quantified health and comfort benefits
     by surveying 209 energy efficiency program participants and 213 low-income program participants.
     A willingness-to-pay survey asked participants to value impacts relative to the average bill savings for
     specific measures, mainly building shell and/or heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning improvements.
     This study identified recommended values per participant, ranging from $27 to $279, for 56 different
     benefits that accrued to utilities, occupants, and society. These recommended values are often used
     as reference estimates to quantify benefits in cost-benefit analyses in other states (Rhode Island, for
     example). A complete list of the values per type of benefit is given in Annex 8.

     Bangladesh. Phadke et al. (2015) show that the use of super-efficient off-grid lighting and appliances
     can reduce the cost of off-grid energy service by up to 50% and therefore increase access to energy
     services. The study demonstrates that the use of LED in solar home systems allowed for a reduction in
     the size of and an increase in the demand for additional energy services in the solar home system. A
     20 watt-peak system can deliver the energy services for a household that would have once needed a
     much more costly 50 watt-peak system by using super-efficient equipment.

     Mexico. The Green Mortgage Program was created in 2007 to promote the use of eco-technologies
     in new housing development and retrofit of existing houses in Mexico. Along with average annual
     electricity savings of 600 to 1544 kWh (depending on the climatic zone) and 2,890 to 3,115 kWh
     in gas, the program reduced water consumption by 85 m3 in water per home per year (Buildings
     Efficiency Initiative 2013).

     United Kingdom. A study from the Department of Energy and Climate Change (2013) reveals that
     making energy saving improvements increases a property’s value by 14% on average and up to 38%
     in some parts of England.

     New Zealand. Grimes et al. (2012) assessed the costs and benefits of the Warm Up New Zealand:
     Heat Smart Programme. This program offered subsidies for insulating buildings and/or installing clean
     heating in residences. Detailed evaluation of this program shows that energy benefits alone were
     insufficient to justify program expenditures, but the benefit-to-cost ratio exceeded 4:1 when health
     benefits were included.

     United States Weatherization Assistance Program. According to a retrospective evaluation of the
     2008 WAP, the program’s benefit-cost ratio was 1:4 when only energy savings costs and benefits are
     accounted for, but improves when health and safety benefits and costs are included (US DOE 2015).
     The result is in part because a small share of program costs were invested to address health and
     safety issues found in homes (typically around 15% of the funds invested in a weatherized unit) (ORNL
     2014). For example, while WAP technicians were in homes installing energy-savings measures, they
     fixed broken windows and installed working smoke detectors.

     Mexico. The 2016 Implementation Completion and Results Report for the World Bank Efficient Lighting
     and Appliances project assesses the project’s performance. The project was implemented over the
     2011–15 period and replaced over 45 million incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescent lamps
     (CFL), including a portion distributed to households in low-income communities (including indigenous




     Chapter 4
36
communities) and appliances (refrigerators and air conditioners). The project resulted in energy
savings of over 10,000 GWh and mitigated over 5 Million tCO2e. The report notes, but does not quantify,
other economic benefits, including: (i) delaying or avoiding new power generation infrastructure;
(ii) reduction in consumers’ electricity bills; (iii) mitigation of the burden of the electricity subsidies; and
(iv) enhanced energy security.



4.1.2 Energy Supply Benefits
Description
Benefits to electricity supply are numerous. They include deferring the need to build new infrastructure
to meet growing demand and increasing grid reliability. IEA (2014) identifies 21 multiple benefits that
accrue to energy providers. Table 4.4 describes some of the most-referenced MBEEs related to grid
infrastructure and reliability.

Quantification Methods

In the United States, the typical approach for quantifying MBEE programs is to calculate “avoided
costs,” defined as costs that would have been incurred if the energy efficiency measures had not
been put in place. Different methods, using modeling approaches, are used to calculate energy- and

     costs such as those associated with line losses and reserve margins. See a description in Lazar and

     For impacts of reduced credit and collection costs from low-income energy efficiency programs,
     the quantification method often includes pre- and post-program billing data from a treatment and a
     comparison group. However, as mentioned earlier, collecting primary data may be expensive and
     many of the current valuations of this benefit in utility programs in the United States now rely on
     estimates from previous studies.

     Increased reliability benefits can be assessed by first determining how an energy efficiency project
     affects the number and length of customer outages and then multiplying that expected change by
     the estimated cost of an outage. The estimated cost of an outage is determined based on customers’
     economic activities.



     Understanding Impacts
     2010 Vermont energy efficiency program portfolio assessment. Figure 4.1 reports the costs and benefits
     of Vermont energy efficiency programs portfolio in 2010, taken from the IEA (2014) publication on MBEE.
     The levelized cost of energy efficiency measures is $39 per megawatt hour compared to benefits to energy
     providers estimated at $104.8 per megawatt hour, which results in an overall benefit-cost ratio of 2.3 to 1.
     Avoided distribution capacity costs are the largest nonenergy benefits, equal to 35% of the energy
     benefits. Avoided line losses represent 18%, avoided generation capacity costs represent 16%, avoided
     transmission capacity costs 6%, and avoided reserve requirements 1% of energy benefits.

United States. Table 4.5 reports a range of estimated values for utility financial savings from reduced
credit and collection costs (in USD/year/participant) for eight low-income programs in the United
States. As specified in Tetra Tech and NMR (2011), there are several reasons for the variability in the
magnitude of impacts reported in the literature, including differences in program structure and utility
cost structures and policies.

Kyrgyzstan. Using a RCT method and measuring household’s electricity consumption at the
transformer substation level, Carranza and Meeks (2015) provide evidence on the benefits of
increased reliability of electricity services from a CFL program. Results show that households that
were recipients of the program experienced approximately two fewer electricity outages per month on
average.

Uganda. One of the primary objectives of the World Bank Power Sector Development Operation
project, started in 2007, was to reduce power shortages by implementing energy efficiency measures
and adding new capacity in Uganda. At project closure, the evaluation report found that monthly
energy unmet demand was reduced by about 95% due to an estimated 55 GWh of energy savings
per year through a number of energy efficiency initiatives related to energy use efficiency and load
management (World Bank 2012).

South Africa. Serious electricity shortages experienced in 2008 triggered the implementation of
energy efficiency policies in South Africa. The government decided to include an environmental levy in
electricity tariff to fund the implementation of energy efficiency demand-side management programs
targeting various energy efficiency measures/technologies (e.g., energy efficient indoor and street
lighting, heat pumps, energy management systems, etc.). During the energy crisis, the utility company
Eskom used energy efficiency actively to reduce the gap between supply and demand of electricity.
Energy efficiency is now included as a resource of choice in planning for future energy resources (de
la Rue du Can et al. 2013).

India. Sathaye and Gupta (2010) evaluated the aggregate economic benefits from reducing the gap
between supply and demand of electricity through the implementation of energy efficiency programs in
India. They estimated that the resulting cumulative production increase would contribute $505 billion to
GDP between 2009 and 2017, which can be compared with India’s 2007–08 GDP of $911 billion.

     Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam. Selvakkumaran and Limmeechokchai (2013) focus on the effect of
     energy efficiency measures on energy security in three developing countries: Sri Lanka, Thailand, and
     Vietnam. Results show that energy efficiency in Sri Lanka significantly increases the energy security
     whilst also accruing co-benefits of CO2 mitigation and mitigation of local air pollution. In the case of
     Thailand and Vietnam, energy security is enhanced in the short term.



     4.1.3 Public Budget Benefits
     Description
     Important benefits of energy efficiency programs accrue in the public budget when governments
     are the beneficiaries of the program, such as public buildings or street lighting energy efficiency
     retrofits. This is part of the recipient energy savings benefits which is covered in Section 4.1.1.

     Additional benefits to the public budget exist. In economies that subsidize end-use energy tariffs,
     energy efficiency programs reduce fiscal expenditures on energy subsidies, which enable governments
     to lower deficits or increase spending in other priority areas, such as health and education. Public
     budget increases can also result from increased spending effects (increased tax revenue and reduced
     payout for unemployment benefits). However, indirect benefits should be balanced with decreases in
     fuel/energy tax revenues resulting from decreases in energy consumption. In some countries, fuels are
     taxed at a higher rate than other goods (excise duties), so shifting consumption from fuel to other goods
     will lead to lower tax revenues. Table 4.6 lists public budget MBEE programs.



     Quantification Methods
     While indirect impacts are difficult to quantify and depend on macroeconomic activity impacts,
     reduction of energy subsidies that result from reductions in energy use can be estimated based on the
     cost of energy subsidy per kilowatt hour consumed. However, the level of energy subsidy per kilowatt
     hour or terajoule of energy sold is not always directly available. The IEA and International Monetary
     Fund (IMF) use similar methodologies to estimate energy subsidies, comparing average end-user

      effect                     the saved funds for goods and services, which, in turn, can create jobs and thus reduce payout
                                 for unemployment benefits. Energy efficiency programs can also improve occupant health, which
                                 reduces health care costs. Energy efficiency measures increase property values and thus property
                                 tax revenues. Reduced energy demand also reduces the need for public investment in energy
                                 infrastructure.

prices with the full cost of supply. The difference represents the amount by which an end-use price
falls short of the full cost of supply (IEA 2013; IMF 2013).



Understanding Impacts
Mexico. In Mexico where the presence of subsidies on the price of electricity distorts resource
allocation by encouraging excessive energy consumption and reducing incentives for investment in
energy efficiency, Leventis et al. (2013) found that avoided subsidy payments alone could finance
incentive programs that cover the full incremental cost of refrigerators that are 27% more efficient and
televisions that are 32% more efficient than baseline models.

European Union. Copenhagen Economics (2012) estimates that annual investment of $56 billion
in the energy efficiency renovations of buildings through 2020 in the European Union would result
in permanent public revenue gains and €5 to €6 billion of reduced need for energy-consumption
subsidies, as well as €9 to €12 billion from reduced public spending on energy bills (e.g., in public
buildings and institutions). The study also estimates permanent revenue losses of €4 to €5 billion from
reduced fuel consumption taxes. In total, annual permanent net public revenue gains could reach
€30–40 billion in 2020, if health-related benefits (e.g., fewer hospitalizations) from energy efficiency
renovations are included. In addition, the study estimates approximately 760,000 to 1,480,000 jobs
will be created annually as a result of energy efficiency programs, which would lead to an additional
annual reduction of cost in public budgets.

Germany. The Residential Energy Efficiency Buildings Program of KfW between 2006 and 2014
benefitted 50% of all newly built residential and 33% of all refurbished buildings, as well as 2,000
public buildings. The energy efficiency program created approximately 440,000 jobs, additional tax
revenue, social security contributions, and reduced costs for unemployment amounting to reduction in
the public budget of about €4 to €5 for each Euro spent (Schüring 2014).



4.1.4 Air Emissions Benefits
Description
Air emissions resulting from energy consumption are the major cause of global warming. Some of
these emissions have strong warming effects, but are short lived, classified as short-lived climate
pollutants (SLCPs). Air emissions are also a source of indoor and outdoor pollution and a cause of
ozone depletion. A study from the World Health Organization (WHO 2014a) estimates that 3.7 million
and 4.3 million premature deaths could be attributed to ambient (outdoor) air pollution and household
(indoor) air pollution in 2012, respectively. Outdoor air pollution, notably in concentration of human
settlements like cities, causes a spectrum of health effects, ranging from eye irritation to death.
Additionally, methane emissions are a source of diminished agriculture production. Table 4.7 below
lists air emissions MBEE. Reduced air emissions that result from energy efficiency can contribute
to decreased global warming impacts, improved human health, and reduced ozone depletion.

     Quantification Method
     Methods for assessing benefits of air emissions reductions entail first estimating the quantities of
     emissions reduced and then determining the value of these quantities.

     GHG emissions are estimated by applying emissions factors to the quantity of energy saved. For
     fuel savings, default values27 are available in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2006
     Guidelines. For electricity savings, emissions factors need to be based on the fuel mix of the electricity
     saved (including the transmission and distribution saved). For energy measures that reduce peak
     electricity, marginal emissions factors can be calculated to reflect emissions variations during peak
     periods. Methodologies have been developed to calculate grid emissions factors (e.g., through the
     UNFCCC Clean Development Mechanism). GHG emissions have different global warming potential
     which represents the ability of each GHG to trap heat in the atmosphere relative to carbon dioxide
     (CO2) over a specified time horizon (see IPCC 2007, 2014 and GHG Protocol for more detail).

     Estimating the cost of avoided damages due to GHG emissions reduction can be done by using the
     social cost of carbon. The social cost of carbon is an estimate of the direct effects of carbon emissions
     on the economy—it estimates how much damage climate change will cause by considering net
     agricultural productivity loss, human health effects, property damages from increased flood risk, and the
     value of ecosystem services due to climate change. In the United Kingdom, the social cost carbon value
     has been used in policy analysis and regulatory impact assessment since 2002 and was revised in 2007
     and 2010 (IPCC 2014). In the United States, the government also estimates the social cost of carbon to
     be used by all agencies in their regulatory emissions-reduction impacts analysis. The four social cost
     of carbon estimates are: $14, $46, $68, and $138 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in the year 2025

(2007 dollars), based on 5%, 3%, and 2.5% average discount rates and 95th percentile, respectively
(USG 2010; US EPA 2015). The IMF (2014) uses an illustrative damage value of $35 per MtCO2 based on
a study that estimates taxes on coal, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel needed to reflect environmental
costs.

For air pollutants, different tools exist to estimate the pollutant concentrations and their effect on
human health (mortalities, years of life lost) and crop yield. Quantitative estimates of air pollution health
impacts have become an increasingly critical input to policy decisions, and many governments have
invested in tools that best represent localized impacts and provide timely information. Internationally,
organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank have invested in
similar tools to quantify air pollution-related health impacts for a variety of purposes. Global Model
of Ambient Particulates (GMAPS) is an econometric model developed by the World Bank to predict
ambient PM10 levels for world cities larger than 100,000. Another tool used in the World Bank and
Climate Works Foundation study (2014) is the Fast Scenario Screening Tool (TM5-FASST).

Researchers can then place a monetary value on the damages caused by air pollution and assess the
monetary damages associated with emitting a given type of pollutant. These cost assessments help
optimize policies with respect to their health benefits and costs. Jaramilloa and Muller (2016) estimate
the monetary damages due to air pollution exposure (PM2.5, SO2, NOx, NH3, and VOC) from electric
power generation, oil and gas extraction, coal mining, and oil refineries in the United States. They point
out the importance of considering spatial distribution of population in the impacts of air emissions
when estimating the benefits of policies. The WHO organized a workshop in 2014 to discuss the
evidence for air pollution health effects and propose expert advice on the best options and methods
to estimate health risks from air pollution and its sources. A document reviews available air pollution
analysis methods and tools globally (WHO 2014b).



Understanding Impacts
Global Impacts of Short-Lived Climate Pollutants. The United Nations Environment Program
(UNEP 2016) estimates that, by 2030, using technologies and strategies available today, reduced
SLCP emissions could avoid an estimated 2.4 million premature deaths from outdoor air pollution
annually and about 32 million tons of crop losses per year.

Maryland, United States. Itron (2015) estimated the benefit from reduced air emissions (CO2, NOx,
SO2) from State of Maryland energy efficiency programs at $79 million over the lives of the program,
equivalent to $0.011 per kilowatt hour saved by the programs in 2013, using an assumed CO2 damage
cost of $45 per ton. The study estimated that counting air emissions benefits increases the statewide
benefit-cost ratio to 2:1, a 16% increase over the ratio of 1:8 without air emissions benefits.

United States, the European Union, China, India, Mexico, and Brazil. The World Bank and Climate
Works Foundation study (WB-CWF 2014) examined the benefits from policies that stimulate a shift
to clean transport, improved industrial energy efficiency, and more energy-efficient buildings and
appliances through regulations, taxes, and incentives in six major economies—United States, the

     European Union, China, India, Mexico, and Brazil. The study found that those policies would prevent
     94,000 premature pollution-related deaths and 8.5 gigatons of CO2-equivalent emissions in 2030.

     Global. In a study analyzing more than 150 countries, the IMF (2014) explored how to align fuel taxes
     with environmental damages that reflect global warming, air pollution, road congestion, and other
     adverse environmental impacts of energy use. The study develops a practical methodology, and
     associated tools, to show how the major environmental damages from energy can be quantified for
     different countries and used to design corrective fuel taxes that reflect environmental costs.



     4.1.5 Economic Benefits
     Description
     Energy efficiency improvements deliver benefits across the whole economy, with direct and
     indirect impacts on economic activity, employment, trade balance, and energy prices.

     t   Direct impacts include the additional economic activity associated with local commercial services
          and industries in response to energy efficiency program investments. Energy efficiency programs
          lead to purchases of goods and services in the economy (e.g., labor for energy audits, increased
          sales of energy efficient equipment, labor for training energy auditors, etc.).

     t   Indirect impacts include economic activity associated with increased disposable income or higher
          profits from the cost reductions associated with energy saved.

     Together, these financial flows have multiplier effects locally and regionally on the economic activity
     and job creation. The positive economic multipliers associated with these expenditures are generally
     larger than the impacts from the energy sector.

     Energy efficiency improvements also help alleviate household poverty and are often considered
     a more long-term solution to alleviate poverty than energy subsidies and direct financial
     support, leading many countries to implement energy efficiency programs targeting low-income
     households. A recent publication from the World Bank analyzed the benefits that energy efficiency
     has on diminishing the distributional affordability impact of raising energy tariffs to cost recovery levels
     (Ruggeri Laderchi et al. 2013). Raising energy tariffs to cost recovery levels can result in very high
     increases and energy efficiency can help cushion this impact. The term “energy poverty” (or “fuel
     poverty”) has been developed to refer to situations where households are unable to afford their basic
     energy needs. Three factors influence energy poverty: household income, energy prices, and energy
     efficiency of equipment and buildings.

     When energy efficiency is improved, households can decide to either expand the energy services
     provided from a fixed amount (or cost) of energy or reduce their energy demand and keep the same
     level of service as before the measure, or a combination of both. In all cases, household wealth
     increases. As mentioned in previous sections, when a consumer decides to expand the energy
     services, this reduces the energy savings potential and is often referred to as a direct rebound effect
     or take-back effect in the literature (see de la Rue du Can 2015, for a brief information note on this

topic). However, this can also be considered as an economic benefit of expanding the amount of
energy services that can be provided by a fixed amount (or cost) of energy (IEA 2014). Indeed, the
United Kingdom’s treasury guidance document on project appraisal recommends considering comfort
take-back as a welfare benefit to the consumer (see “United Kingdom” section below). In developing
countries, energy poverty is generally defined in terms of inadequate and unreliable access to
energy services and reliance on traditional biomass. Energy poverty is recognized as a major barrier
to economic growth and to health and well being (UN 2010; IEA 2010). In fact, ensuring access
to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy is recognized as one of the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals adopted in 2015 (UN SDG 7).

Energy efficiency also contributes to reduction in energy prices, as it reduces the demand for energy.
In competitive markets, the marginal unit price of energy increases with the amount required. Therefore,
a decrease in supply due to a reduction of demand results in price reduction. This phenomenon
is referred as Demand Reduction Induced Price Effect (DRIPE) in the United States’ utility industry
(Chernick and Plunkett 2014). Price suppression has been accepted as an energy efficiency benefit by
regulators in Massachusetts, Delaware, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, and Rhode Island.



Quantification Methods
To assess the economic impact of energy efficiency programs, a combination of modeling approaches
is generally needed. First, the total investment necessary from public and private funds is estimated
using technology-based bottom-up models that gather information on the cost of energy efficiency
measures. The total estimated investment is then introduced into economic models to determine
impact on economic activity and job creation. Economic models, such as computable general
equilibrium, are generally used because they cover the whole economy of a country and integrate
input-output tables to estimate the impacts of additional investment in a sector of the economy. How
energy efficiency measures influence economic sectors (i.e., positively or negatively) depends on a
country’s economic structure and on the design and scale of the underlying policies.

There is no consensus on which method to use internationally to define the energy poverty line below
which households are considered to be in fuel poverty. Eurostat, the statistical office of the European

     Union, surveys household income and living conditions annually. Information that relate to energy
     poverty is collected through three indicators:

     t   the percentage of households experiencing an inability to keep their home adequately warm

     t   the percentage of homes that are damp, rotting, or leaking

     t   the percentage of homes that are behind on utility bill payments

     Atanasiu et al. (2014) used a combination of these indicators to describe the current fuel poverty
     situation in Europe. This study estimates that between 50 and 125 million people in Europe currently
     suffer from fuel poverty and are unable to afford proper indoor thermal comfort. Bulgaria and Lithuania
     have the highest rates in Europe of residents unable to keep their homes adequately warm.

     In developing countries, the term energy affordability is often used, notably in the context of tariff
     reforms which require moving from subsidized tariffs to cost reflective tariffs. These transitions have
     a large impact on the energy affordability of households, as the increase can be very steep. Ruggeri
     Laderchi et al. (2013) recommend implementing energy efficiency programs to lower the impact of
     higher tariffs on the affordability of energy services. The multitier approach currently being developed
     by the World Bank’s Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) and described above,
     also helps to demonstrate the impact of energy efficiency interventions as a contributor to a higher
     level of affordability of energy services (ESMAP 2014). The affordability of energy is considered as an
     attribute of achieving energy access.



     Examples
     Global. The IEA (2014) reports that GDP changes from large-scale energy efficiency policies are
     positive, with economic growth ranging from 0.25% to 1.1% per year. According to the IEA, the
     potential for job creation ranges from 8 to 27 job years per €1 million invested in energy efficiency
     measures.

     Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Ruggeri Laderchi et al. (2013) show that energy efficiency
     programs reduce the negative impact of raising energy tariffs to cost recovery levels measures
     on households and the economy. The report assessed, at the micro level for the whole region, the
     distributional impact of raising energy tariffs to cost recovery levels and simulating policy options to
     cushion these impacts. They estimate that most countries in the region could save 0.5 to 1% of GDP by
     improving the effectiveness of social assistance systems and increasing energy efficiency.

     United States. United States Department of Energy (US DOE) employment impact analysis estimates
     the aggregate indirect national job impacts from the implementation of minimum energy performance
     standards, using a model called ImSET 3.1.12 (Impact of Sector Energy Technologies). This is a
     customized version of the national input-output model for building energy technologies.

     European Union. In Europe, many studies have recently been published on energy poverty and the
     need to scale up energy efficiency programs to help alleviate it (Atanasiu et al. 2014; Pye et al. 2015;




     Chapter 4
46
Schumacher et al. 2015; Mzavanadze et al. 2015). However, most studies report the effectiveness
of measures to alleviate poverty as the number of households participating in the programs. No
quantification of the impact of energy efficiency programs on energy poverty was found.



4.2 SUMMARY OF INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE
This section gives a brief overview of the experience in integrating the quantification on MBEE in
energy efficiency investment programs and select international initiatives.



United States
In the United States, MBEE are generally referred to as non-energy benefits (NEB). However, more
recently the term non-energy impacts (NEI) has become more common, to encompass both the positive
and negative effects of energy efficiency programs. Non-energy impacts are grouped into three classes
based on “beneficiary” or “perspective.” These classes are utilities, program participants, and society.

Assessment of non-energy impacts has generally focused on low-income programs where non-energy
benefits are part of the program goals. However, recognizing the additional value that these benefits
bring, an increasing number of state regulators are now working to include them in cost-effectiveness
tests, program design and marketing strategies (Skumatz 2009; Malmgren and Skumatz 2014). In the
United States, energy efficiency programs are funded through utility rates, and each state regulatory
agency has its own mandate regarding the specific test(s) and requirements for demonstrating
program cost effectiveness (Cluett and Amann 2015).

Malmgren and Skumatz (2014) identified four different ways that state regulators include non-energy
benefits in energy efficiency program assessments and cost-effectiveness tests:

1 | Adders. Incorporating an adjustment factor to reflect subsets of non-energy benefits contributions
    to all benefits:

    t   Iowa, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Vermont, New York, Washington DC, and other states
         include simple adders (between 7.5% and 25%) (Skumatz 2014)

2 | “Readily measured” non-energy benefits. Incorporating “easy-to-measure” benefits:

    t   Massachusetts, Vermont, Colorado, New Hampshire, Oregon, Connecticut, Rhode Island,
         Maine, Washington DC, and others such as BC Hydro (Canadian electric utility) include
         subsets of “readily measured” non-energy benefits (Skumatz 2014)

    t   These benefits generally include:

         t   O&M expenditure reductions

         t   Water and sewer usage reductions

     The National Efficiency Screening Project (2014) recommends using alternative screening tests or
     setting a lower cost-benefit screening threshold for programs that have many hard-to-quantify benefits.



     United Kingdom
     The United Kingdom Treasury publishes a guidance document called the Green Book on how to
     appraise proposals before committing funds to a policy, program or project. The Green Book is
     supplemented by additional guidance documents giving more information on particular issues and
     on applying the Green Book in specific contexts. For example, the United Kingdom Treasury provides
     additional guidance for valuation of energy use and GHG emissions for appraisal, as well as an
     excel-based calculation toolkit and data tables containing the carbon values, energy prices, long-run
     variable energy supply costs, emissions factors, and air quality damage costs over the 2010–2100
     period (UK Treasury 2015a; UK Treasury 2015b).

     The background document explains the theory and rationale behind the methodology applied to
     valuing changes to energy efficiency. Direct rebound effect28 is considered as a welfare benefit
     (comfort take-back) to the consumer and is valued using the retail price of energy which is higher than
     the long-run variable costs used for valuing energy savings.

     Payne et al. (2015) describe how the Green Book and its related documents have been applied in
     recent impact assessments of energy efficiency programs in the United Kingdom. (See Annex 11 for
     a summary table showing the value of the different benefits and costs identified which result in the
     benefit cost ratio.)



     European Union
     Horizon 2020—the biggest European Union Research and Innovation program—is funding a three-
     year project entitled Calculating and Operationalizing the Multiple Benefits of Energy Efficiency in
     Europe (COMBI). COMBI aims to quantify the multiple nonenergy benefits of energy efficiency in the
     EU-28 area and was developed because existing research on the MBEE is incomplete and dispersed.
     The overall objective is to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing benefits in Europe for
     policy makers, evaluators, and the interested public and to make research findings accessible. One of
     COMBI’s goals is to develop a graphical online tool to visualize the multiple energy efficiency impacts
     and their aggregation.

     The project is organized around five main working group research topics:

     t   Air pollution

     t   Resources

     t   Social welfare

     t   Macroeconomy

     t   Energy system

Manchester, Copenhagen Economics, and Advanced Buildings and Urban Design as research
partners.



International
The IEA has conducted several workshops on MBEE at which key international experts have shared
their work. This led to the frequently cited 2014 IEA publication describing MBEE in five areas:
macroeconomic development, public budgets, health and well-being, industrial productivity, and
energy delivery. The IEA has also put forward the concept of “energy efficient prosperity” that
considers the social and economic benefits of enhancing energy efficiency, which is especially
relevant for developing countries.29

UNEP (2015) published a report entitled “The Multiple Benefits of Measures to Improve Energy
Efficiency,” which summarizes the results of four detailed studies. The report’s objective is to illustrate
how MBEE can be used to promote efficiency in the Energy Efficiency Accelerators Initiative, which
is part of Sustainable Energy for All. The report estimates energy-savings potential using two different
models, compares the results, assesses the economic impact of realizing the energy efficiency
potential estimated in the G20 countries, and provides case studies of 25 programs in 8 thematic
areas. The survey provides qualitative insights into the economic, social, and environmental benefits
attributable to increased energy efficiency, which macroeconomic models cannot capture.



4.3 SECTOR-SPECIFIC EXPERIENCE
4.3.1 Street Lighting Energy Efficiency Measures
Large energy savings are possible with technology advancements in LED street lighting and controls.
The main benefit of this advanced technology is reduction of energy consumption (often reaching 50%
or more) without compromising the level of lighting. This reduces municipalities’ electricity costs,30
which translates into a reduced budgetary burden. Energy efficient LED streetlights bring additional
benefits such as reduced carbon emissions, improved visibility and public safety, and reduced
light pollution.

Potential MBEE:

t   Maintenance cost savings. LEDs have a longer life than the incumbent units they generally
     replace (10–15 years versus 4–6 years), which decreases maintenance requirements. In addition,
     remote monitoring is often installed with LEDs, which helps to identify system problems in real
     time.

t   Air emissions reductions. As in many other energy efficiency projects, saved energy can reduce
     emissions, depending on the mix of fuels used to generate power.




                                       Assessing and Measuring the Performance of Energy Efficiency Projects
                                                                                                               49
     t   Improved public safety. LEDs’ white color rendering and uniform illumination patterns31 are
          considered to improve visibility, which helps reduce criminal activity and can improve safety for
          drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians. The New Zealand Transport Agency Economic Evaluation
          Manual cites a 35% reduction in crashes resulting from upgrading or improving poor lighting (Frith
          and Jackett 2013).

     t   Reduced light pollution. LEDs are designed to be directional, so their light flow is controllable,
          which can reduce the amount of light directed into the night sky. This feature helps to reduce light
          pollution and sky glow (unnecessary illumination of night sky by artificial lighting). However, the
          greater content of blue wavelength light in LEDs produce more glare, which contributes to light
          pollution (IDA 2016).

     t   Reduced waste. Most conventional fluorescent, high-intensity discharge, or high-pressure sodium
          lamps contain a range of materials, including mercury that can be damaging to the environment if
          not disposed of correctly. Because LEDs contain no toxic materials and are completely recyclable,
          they can greatly contribute to sustainability goals. Additionally, their long operational life span
          means that replacement lamps no longer need to be manufactured, which saves materials, labor,
          and energy.



     4.3.2 Multifamily Buildings
     In countries with cold climates, buildings generally represent the largest source of energy
     consumption. In countries with warm climates, the soaring penetration of air conditioning is
     contributing to increase the share of buildings in energy consumption, notably when the indirect
     energy used for the production of electricity used in building is accounted for. Buildings are also
     considered part of the solution, as a large source of untapped energy efficiency potential exists in this
     sector with investment costs that are lower than the cost of the supply of energy. Moreover, energy
     efficiency in buildings has numerous benefits that are directly tangible to households.

     Potential MBEE:

     t   Lower energy bills. Energy savings allow reducing the cost of energy to the building occupants.

     t   Increased comfort. Measures like improved insulation of buildings or more efficient air
          conditioners contribute in increasing the comfort of the building occupants.

     t   Reduced operation and maintenance. Energy efficiency can reduce O&M costs by reducing the
          frequency or intensity of work needed for addressing equipment, lighting, and building durability
          issues. For example, Cluett and Amann (2015) report a 17% decrease in O&M costs from air
          sealing, roof cavity insulation, and furnace replacement measures in a study of multifamily building
          program MBEE in the United States.

     t   Reduced air emissions. Some energy efficiency projects targeting biomass cookstoves can
          reduce drastically the level of harmful indoor emissions. Moreover, because the main source of




     Chapter 4
50
     energy in buildings is generally electricity, some energy efficiency projects targeting appliances
     and lighting can mitigate GHG emissions and air pollution significantly, depending on the mix of
     fuels used directly and to generate power in the country considered.

t   Economic impacts. The implementation of energy efficiency measures in the building sector often
     results in increases in job creation from local companies that have to implement the measures. In
     some cases, trainings on energy efficiency improvement and energy efficiency assessment are
     also necessary, increasing the labor impact.



4.4 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INCLUSION OF MULTIPLE BENEFITS OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY
IN MEASUREMENT & VERIFICATION
MBEE are often omitted from assessments of the benefit of energy efficiency programs for three
main reasons: lack of data, lack of consensus for quantifying their impact and monetary values, and
lack of resources to conduct the analysis. However, MBEE contribute significantly to economic
growth, social welfare, and environmental health, justifying efforts by policy makers and program
administrators in overcoming these barriers and for including MBEE in evaluations of energy
efficiency programs so that the social benefit of these programs can be optimized. In some
cases, evidence has shown that when MBEE are accounted for, program’s benefit-cost ratio is
increased fourfold (see examples in section 4.1.1, Recipient Benefits). Not accounting for MBEE may
lead to suboptimized allocation of funds.

This recognition has led many national government agencies to increasingly integrate MBEE to
inform energy efficiency policies and program investment decisions. Cost-benefit and appraisal
methodologies are being updated to increase the number of MBEE being considered, quantified, and
assessed. However, many gaps remain in practice and current scientific evidence is largely derived
from studies in North America, Western Europe, and Oceania (mostly Australia and New Zealand).

Although the multitude of energy efficiency benefits makes clear the broad value of energy efficiency
programs, it also creates challenges. A large number of benefits exist. A first selection must be applied
to identify the benefits most relevant to a country’s stakeholders and beneficiaries which correspond to
the overarching goal(s) of the program. Information about benefits can also be used in different ways;
how the information is used determines whether the benefits can simply be quantified in physical terms
or must be expressed in monetary terms.

Once the most valuable or relevant benefit categories are selected for a given purpose, decisions
must be made about how to measure the benefits and how to generate results that are robust
enough to inform energy efficiency policy making. Continued research on the topic of MBEE has
resulted in new modeling tools that can provide comprehensive benefits calculations and streamline
the process. However, tools have typically been developed and used in the United States and the
European Union, and rarely cover developing or emerging economies.




                                     Assessing and Measuring the Performance of Energy Efficiency Projects
                                                                                                             51
     Based on this analysis, the following steps are recommended for incorporation of MBEE in analysis of
     energy efficiency projects:

     1 | Identify the benefits most relevant to the overarching program’s goals and to the counterparts

     2 | Determine the goal of quantifying the benefits (advertising, stakeholder engagement, program
          decision, impact evaluation)

     3 | Consider MBEE at the beginning of a program design and planning

     4 | Determine the form in which benefits will be quantified (monetized or not)

     5 | Develop the evidence base and establish reference studies, most likely based on randomized
          control trial (RCT) methods or willingness-to-pay surveys

     6 | Streamline the quantification process by developing appropriate model and tools

     Quantification of benefits require selecting a method. Less tangible benefits are sometimes quantified
     differently across countries (e.g., comfort level is estimated differently in the United States and United
     Kingdom). Comparison of methods and discussion about which method to apply in the context of
     developing countries can help to build a consensus around the method finally selected.

     Although an increasing number of research projects and publications have recently studied MBEE,
     the focus had tended to be either on developed economies or global macroeconomic impacts.
     Researchers and practitioners commonly agree that accounting for MBEE is especially essential
     for assessing low-income household energy efficiency results. The quantification of MBEE in
     developing countries could also have significant impacts for policy and investment decisions.

     Public sector interest in energy efficiency is expected to encompass multiple benefits, including
     social and economic. MBEE can help identify appropriate incentives to encourage assessment of
     energy efficiency projects. More research is in fact needed to explore MBEE for developing countries,
     to deepen understanding of the opportunities that MBEE offer society, to develop evidence and
     quantify MBEE in their context, to determine transferability of methods used in developed countries
     to developing countries context, and to develop models and tools to provide a robust base for rapid
     decision making.

Based on industry experience, literature review, the M&V protocols summarized earlier, and the review
of projects, the following steps have been outlined. The following steps provide generic guidance on
how to plan and implement M&V for energy efficiency projects and programs.

1 | Role of Stakeholders. Define the roles of different stakeholders with respect to M&V. This is
    particularly important to identify the energy efficiency benefits most relevant to each of the
    stakeholders. There are typically three main stakeholders: (a) energy efficiency project beneficiary,
    (b) energy efficiency project implementer, and (c) project/program administrator. With respect
    to M&V, measurement can be done by the project implementer or project beneficiary or by a
    third party. The verification has to be done by the project administrator or a third party engaged
    by the program administrator. The overall program evaluation should be done by a third party
    independent of the project proponent or program administrators.

2 | Identify the relevant MBEE. Energy savings is the primary goal of most energy efficiency
    interventions. Once the key stakeholders have been identified, identify the MBEE that may be most
    relevant and attractive to the stakeholders (using Table 1.1). The selection of M&V methods will
    depend on the MBEE, including energy savings, identified for the project.

3 | M&V Methodologies. Discuss and develop the M&V plan in close consultation with the
    project proponents (implementer and beneficiary) based on the particular features of the
    energy efficiency project and considering standard M&V protocols, namely, IPMVP or CDM
    methodologies for energy efficiency projects, such as AMS-II.C (demand-side energy efficiency
    for specific technologies) and AMS-II.L (demand-side activities for efficient outdoor and street
    lighting technologies). These are recommended as they are the most comprehensive, transparent,
    and flexible M&V methodologies. CDM-approved M&V methodologies for energy efficiency
    projects can be used for non-CDM projects, focusing the baseline and monitoring aspects of the
    methodologies (while other CDM-specific requirements can be ignored).

    In general, it is still not common practice in developing countries for project implementing
    agencies to use internationally approved M&V protocols, as they tend to lead to additional project
    costs, and the implementing agencies are often not technically equipped to use the international
    protocols. However, particularly where energy savings or other benefits are to be monetized
    or form the basis of payment, these protocols can help strengthen energy efficiency projects.
    When feasible, it is also useful to consider building the capacity of the project stakeholders in
    understanding M&V.

    The M&V plans come in all shapes and sizes and reflect upon the complexity and size of the
    project and the budget of M&V. For example, the retrofit isolation method involves narrowing of
    the measurement boundary to wrap tightly around the system, area, or equipment affected by

                                                                                                            55
         an energy efficiency measure. The purpose is to reduce the effort required to understand and
         incorporate independent variables and static factors that affect site energy use but are unrelated
         to the energy efficiency measure. Though more accurate results may be obtained by avoiding
         complexity, tightening a boundary typically requires additional metering at the boundary edge,
         which may lead to increased M&V cost.

         Ultimately, the project proponent should make a decision on how to conduct the M&V of the
         energy efficiency project at the design stage of the project and clearly lay out the M&V plan—
         along with the identification of factors which may trigger adjustments—for the life of the project.

     4 | M&V Plan Templates. The M&V planning process and standard M&V templates are publicly
         available and can be useful references for developing project-specific M&V plans. There are
         useful M&V guidelines in the public domain: Measurement and Verification for Federal Energy
         Projects of the Federal Energy Management Program and Measurement and Verification
         Operational Guide of New South Wales Government have detailed M&V templates, which are easy
         to use (refer to Annexes 3 to 5 for further details.)

     5 | Activities before and after Implementation. It is often recommended to carry out an energy
         audit—or a detailed investment grade energy audit (IGEA) where appropriate—before the
         implementation of energy efficiency measures and commissioning process (rather than after
         implementation). In fact, this is typically the case where energy savings performance contracts
         are involved. IGEAs help get a better perspective on the feasibility of the measures, thus helping
         in the decision-making process with respect to implementing energy efficiency retrofits. The IGEA
         cost should not exceed 10% of the annual utility bill (US DOE 2011). Commissioning is the quality
         assurance procedure upon implementation of the project. It is a systematic, documented, and
         collaborative process, which includes inspection, testing, and training to confirm that the energy
         efficiency project components meet their requirement. As a general rule, the commission cost
         represents approximately between 0.6% and 1.8% of the project cost (PECI 2002).

         In case an IGEA is not possible, it is recommended to undertake a less intensive energy audit (or
         at a minimum, a walk-through energy audit). For some of the MBEE, additional information may
         have to be collected through qualitative surveys, focus group discussions, and other techniques.

     6 | Third-Party Verification. It is typically recommended that the M&V activities should be carried out
         by an independent third party to ensure transparency in the M&V process. M&V by a third party
         gives unbiased and specialized evaluation of the system and energy performance of an energy
         efficiency project. At the same time, M&V services through the use of a third-party provider need
         to be weighed carefully between budget constraints and quality assurance.

     7 | Deemed Savings Approach. The deemed savings approach consists of multiplying the number
         of installed measures by an estimated (or deemed) savings per measure, which is derived from
         historical evaluations. This approach is attractive because of its simplicity and lower associated
         costs. The Public Utility Commission of Texas used a deemed savings approach to estimate the
         savings generated from its residential lighting program, which involved retrofitting incandescent




     Chapter 5

    lamps with CFLs.32 However, the deemed savings approach typically has less precision (by
    definition) and thus may increase the level of uncertainty of the actual achieved energy savings. A
    deemed savings approach may nonetheless be appropriate if actual measurement is not possible
    for baseline development and energy savings calculations. A deemed savings approach is often
    considered suitable in the case of projects where the key parameters are fairly constant.

    In order to address the higher uncertainty levels associated with deemed savings, it is typically
    recommended to use a conservative approach to address any risk of overestimation of impact.
    A slightly more complex approach to estimating savings—but more robust—is to use simplified,
    predefined calculations that employ a combination of deemed or “default” input assumptions with
    some site-specific inputs and/or sample measurements.

    The deemed savings approach requires no further evaluation, M&V, engineering analysis, or
    market research provided that there is a mechanism to ensure that energy efficiency measures
    are indeed installed and operated in accordance with the measure description and technical
    requirements.

8 | M&V Process. At the beginning of the project, it is important to outline the M&V process. The
    process should be made as simple as possible. An illustrative flow chart is provided in Figure 5.1.
    The schematic highlights the logical process flow, main activities, their output, and quick reference
    notes. For example, once the decision on performing M&V is taken, the next logical step is M&V
    design. M&V design is the main activity. The outputs of M&V design are decisions on M&V option,
    measurement boundary, etc. The quick reference notes draw attention to important factors like the
    feasibility, level of effort, and so on.

9 | Baseline Development. A baseline study should be conducted before the onset of energy
    efficiency activities in order to establish the pre-installation exposure conditions of the outcome
    level indicators. This means determining ex ante the data to be collected and conducting relevant
    measurements and data/information gathering on the pre-energy efficiency project situation and
    energy use. (Although it is not uncommon—yet more challenging—for baseline studies to be
    conducted after the retrofit activities have already begun.) It is important to consider that in some
    cases there may be a need to make adjustments to the baseline (e.g., colder weather may involve
    changing assumptions for the energy needed to provide heating services). It is important to
    consider the possibility of such potential adjustments from the outset.

    t   Baseline data/inventory: A baseline study should mention all the categories and
         subcategories of parameters for which data are collected. An inventory of all equipment
         should be prepared to conduct the verification in the future. The source of the data should be
         recorded properly.

    t   Identification of static factors: Identify the static factors that will affect energy use in the
         measurement boundary but are not included in the routine adjustment. For example, for a
         lighting project, this could be a substantial change that might occur in the operating hours, or
         lux levels.

    t   Measurement techniques: It is recommended that a decision be made about the
         measurement techniques well in advance, and the barriers and challenges that might be
         faced should be listed.

    t   Linkage with planned activities: The baseline study should be closely linked with the critical
         aspects of the monitoring plan so that the data collected can be replicated, if necessary,
         during the ongoing activity monitoring and any subsequent evaluations. Baseline data should
         provide the minimum information required to assess the quality of the activity implementation
         and to measure the development results.

    t   Clear goals and objectives: It is recommended that the project’s logical framework be
         reviewed to ensure that it is clear and well structured. Logical and precisely expressed
         outputs, component level objectives, purpose, and goal for an activity will assist data
         collection, making clear what needs to be measured.

    t   Data management system: Planning should include adequate provision for data collation
         and analysis, including appropriate staff, materials such as computer software and recording
         forms, data storage facilities, and a clear picture of who will need to access data and in what
         form.

    t   Reconstructing baseline data: In the event no baseline study was carried out prior to
         installation and completion of the project and no baseline data are available, reconstructing
         the baseline data is necessary, using secondary data, project records, and interviews.

10 | Post-Implementation. Post-implementation data must be collected using the same principles/
    techniques defined ex ante and as applied to baseline data collection so as to maintain uniformity
    in the data collection process and decrease the associated uncertainties. For example, in an
    energy efficiency street lighting project, it is advisable to use the same energy meter and sampling
    system to record baseline energy consumption and post retrofit energy consumption.

11 | M&V Report. Define the expected final M&V report outline at the beginning of the project.

    t   Use the details within the M&V plan to shape the report, including goals, expected outcomes,
         and measures for success.

    t   Use both words and diagrams to demonstrate the savings.

    t   Add pictures that demonstrate the energy efficiency measures on-site and the process for
         conducting measurements.

    t   Describe step-by-step data analysis and savings calculations. Add equations with
         explanations if they are unfamiliar to the audience.

    t   Report savings figures using an appropriate number of significant digits.

    t   Note that “actual” savings can only be stated for the post-implementation measurement
         period. Any extrapolation beyond this is considered an estimate.

     12 | Risk and Responsibility Matrix. A risk and responsibility matrix should be included clearly
          highlighting the risk and responsibilities associated with M&V along with an approach to complete
          the responsibilities.

     13 | Continuous M&V. Instead of a onetime M&V approach, it is preferable to use continuous
          monitoring with the help of technologies such as energy management systems (EMS) and
          central control and monitoring systems where appropriate and feasible. Verification activities
          can be performed at regular intervals. This approach will help the beneficiary in sustainable
          energy efficiency. However, continuous M&V comes at a cost. It is important to perform a proper
          cost–benefit analysis before committing to invest in it. In most projects where such sophisticated
          equipment is installed, it is considered an energy efficiency measure in its own right with a specific
          payback and, thus, is not included in the cost of M&V. Annex 6 provides a short note on the recent
          advancements in technologies that could be useful in conducting M&V.

     14 | Impact Evaluation. Apart from project-specific M&V, it is recommended to undertake overall
          program impact evaluation for multiple projects within the same portfolio. The impact evaluation
          will estimate the net change in electricity usage, demand, and also the behavioral impacts that are
          expected to produce change in the energy use. This means the impact evaluation will estimate the
          direct impact (i.e., energy savings), and the indirect impact in the form of behavioral changes that
          will lead to energy savings, as well as other potential associated impacts.

     15 | Rebound Effect (and MBEE). A rebound effect is frequently observed in energy efficiency
          projects, although the magnitude is often not so large and does not overwhelm the savings from
          the project. It is often advisable to focus on the economic efficiency of the project in a broader
          sense rather than focusing on the rebound. Instead of considering the rebound effect as a
          deterrent or negative aspect of energy efficiency projects, efforts should be made, as mentioned
          above, to include the social and economic MBEE associated with energy efficiency interventions
          in the impact evaluation. Particularly, in the context of developing countries, consideration of
          energy efficient prosperity, as suggested by the IEA, may be relevant.

Actual Peak Reduction: The actual peak reduction in the annual peak load (measured in kilowatts)
achieved by customers that participate in a utility demand-side management (DSM) program. It
reflects the changes in the demand for electricity resulting from a utility DSM program that is in effect
at the same time the utility experiences its annual peak load, as opposed to the installed peak load
reduction capability (i.e., potential peak reduction).

Adjusted Gross Savings: Gross energy savings that are adjusted to include what can be physically
counted and reliably measured, such as installation/in-service rates, breakage of equipment, data
errors, hours of use, measure persistence rates, and so on. Adjusted gross savings can also be
calculated by applying a realization rate to gross savings estimates. Most regions determine adjusted
gross savings through M&V activities, although the M&V methods vary substantially.

Baseline: Baseline is the starting condition or metric against which the result of an intervention
is evaluated. For energy efficiency projects, it can be defined as the level of energy consumption
that occurs prior to implementation of energy efficiency measures. This can also be referred to
as “business-as-usual,” if the baseline demonstrates independent change in the level of energy
consumption, prior to or during, implementation of energy efficiency projects or programs. The
baseline condition takes into account whether the measure is replacing equipment at burnout versus
retrofitting or changing the performance of existing equipment that has substantial remaining service
life. The baseline can also represent typical business-as-usual conditions for greenfield energy
efficiency interventions.

Baseline Adjustment: The nonroutine adjustments arising during the post-retrofit (or post
commissioning) period that could not be anticipated (and may require custom engineering analysis).

Base Year: The period serving as the reference point to assess the impact/performance of
implementation of an energy efficiency measure or action. The “base year” may be limited to a single
season if the measure’s impacts are not observable in multiple seasons.

Benchmarking: It is a method for measuring the energy performance of a building, process (e.g.,
industrial process) or a program through the tracking of the energy use of a building, process
or a program and then comparing it to the average for a similar building, process or program.
Benchmarking allows direct comparisons of the energy use by accounting for variables such as local
climate, area, patterns of use, operating hours and behavioral changes.

Deemed Savings: A predetermined, validated estimate of energy and peak demand energy savings
attributable to an energy efficiency measure in a particular type of application that may be used in lieu
of direct measurement and verification activities. Also called “stipulated” energy savings.

Demand-Side Management: Demand-side management (DSM) typically involves utility-sponsored
activities designed to save electricity or gas through shaving the peaks during different times of the

     day. The ultimate goal of DSM for most utilities is to avoid the need to invest in new power plants or
     other equipment.

     Energy Audit: An energy audit is an assessment of current energy performance of an industry,
     building, process, equipment, or entity, which is conducted to determine and prioritize energy-saving
     improvements.

     Energy Conservation: Conservation is the process of preserving or using wisely. With respect to
     energy, conservation is reduction in energy-using behavior leading to using less energy services and
     to energy savings. It differs from energy efficiency in the sense that energy efficiency refers to energy
     reduction without sacrificing services.

     Energy Conservation Measure: An energy conservation measure (ECM) is a project conducted or
     technology implemented that reduces the consumption of energy in a facility, industry, equipment,
     process or entity.

     Energy Efficiency: Energy efficiency is the ratio of the energy service provided by a system to
     the energy put into it. Services provided can include building-sector end uses such as lighting,
     refrigeration, and heating; industrial processes; or vehicle transportation. Unlike conservation, which
     involves some reduction of service, energy efficiency provides energy reductions compared to a
     baseline without sacrifice of service.

     Energy Efficiency Program: Energy efficiency programs are a collection of similar projects that are
     intended to motivate customers in a specific market segment to implement more energy-efficient
     technologies and measures.

     Energy Efficiency Projects: An energy efficiency project is an activity or course of action involving
     one or multiple energy efficiency measures at a single facility, industry, site or program.

     Energy Efficiency Certificate: An energy efficiency certificate is a document or a seal certifying
     the authenticity of an electric appliance or a system for being energy efficient. Examples of such
     certificates are the “Energy Star” on appliances and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
     (LEED) certificates (silver, gold, platinum, etc.) for buildings. “White certificates,” a type of energy
     efficiency certificates, are tradable instruments giving proof of the achievement of end-use energy
     savings through energy efficiency improvement initiatives and projects.

     Energy Management System: An energy management system (EMS) is the mechanism to monitor,
     control, and optimize the performance of any energy system.

     Energy Performance Contract: A contract between two or more parties where payment is based on
     achieving specified results, typically, guaranteed reductions in energy consumption and/or operating
     costs. Also known as energy savings performance contract (ESPC).

     Energy Savings Performance Contract: An energy savings performance contract (ESPC) is a form of
     “creative financing” for capital improvement, which allows funding energy upgrades from energy cost
     reductions. Under an ESPC arrangement, an energy service company (ESCO) typically implements a
     project to deliver energy efficiency, or a renewable energy project, and uses the stream of income from




     ANNEX 1 | Lexicon
62
the cost savings, or the renewable energy produced, to repay the costs of the project, including the
costs of the investment.

Energy Service Company: An energy service company (ESCO) is an organization that provides
energy efficiency and DSM-related services to facilities, utilities, industries, and other energy-
consuming establishments.

Free Ridership or Freeriders: The impact of customers targeted by a program who are tracked and
measured by the program, but who would have adopted the recommended practice or measure in
the absence of the program. Freeriders, if present and measured, will decrease a program’s overall
impacts and cost effectiveness.

Free Drivers: Customers that install the energy efficiency measure as a result of the indirect effects of
the energy efficiency program but never collect a rebate or incentive.

Gross Energy Savings: The change in energy consumption and/or demand that results directly
from program-related actions taken by participants in an efficiency program, regardless of why they
participated. This is the physical change in energy use after taking into account factors not caused by
the program (e.g., changes in weather or building occupancy).

Impact Evaluation: The process of measuring the effects and predicted longevity of an energy
efficiency, water efficiency, or renewable energy program with sufficient confidence and precision upon
which to evaluate cost effectiveness and to validate investment decisions.

Investment Grade Energy Audit: An investment grade energy audit is a comprehensive analysis
of potentially priced energy efficiency improvements with a distinct focus on financial concerns and
return on investment.

Key Performance Indicators: Key performance indicators (KPI) are metrics that are used to evaluate
factors that are crucial to the success of a program/project. The KPIs differ for different programs. As
an example for energy efficiency, the KPIs may be energy saved, payback period, etc., or they can
also be social development and improved access to energy.

Market Evaluation: Market evaluations are assessments of the structure or functioning of a market, the
behavior of market participants, and/or market changes that result from one or more energy efficiency
programs. Market evaluations indicate how the overall supply chain and market for energy efficiency
products work and how they have been affected by a program.

Measurement and Verification: Measurement and verification (M&V) is the process for quantifying
energy savings from individual sites or projects (through data collection, monitoring, and analysis)
and ensuring that the energy savings are being generated with a certain degree of confidence. Since
savings cannot be directly measured, the M&V methodology is based on developing a plan to gather
measurements on variables that are affected by the implementation of the energy efficiency project or
measure. M&V can be a subset of program evaluation.

Measurement Boundary: (i) The virtual contour of a device or system separating a set of processes
considered to be relevant, in terms of an energy efficiency improvement action, from those that are not

     relevant. All the energy consumed by the equipment or system(s) within the measurement boundary
     must be measured or estimated. (ii) A notional boundary that defines the physical scope of an M&V
     project. The effects of an ECM are determined at this boundary.

     Metering: Collection of energy and water consumption data over time at a facility through the use of
     measurement devices.

     Multiple Benefits (of Energy Efficiency): The term multiple benefits aims to capture the many
     different benefits to different stakeholders as a result of investment in energy efficiency, apart from the
     energy saved and monitory benefits, which are often overlooked. Multiple benefits are also referred to
     as “co-benefits,” “ancillary benefits,” and “non-energy benefits.”

     Net Energy Savings: Net energy or demand savings are the change in energy consumption and/or
     demand that is attributable to a particular energy efficiency program. Estimating the net energy
     savings typically involves assessing free ridership and spillover.

     Net-to-Gross: An adjustment to overall program impacts that corrects for free drivers and freeridership
     effects.

     Payback Period: A payback period, in the energy efficiency industry, is the ratio of the estimated
     total cost of an efficiency measure divided by its annual financial savings. This figure is one way to
     determine whether an energy efficiency measure is cost effective. More sophisticated versions of this
     calculation may take interest rates and discount rates into account.

     Protocols: Protocols are sets of rules or guidance documents that aim to standardize procedures
     across different economies. In the energy efficiency sector, the term most commonly refers to
     measurement and verification protocols that are used to evaluate energy efficiency projects/programs.

     Rebound Effect (Take-Back Effect): Rebound effect is the term used to describe the effect that the
     lower costs of energy services, due to increased energy efficiency, has on consumer behavior both
     individually and nationally. It is essentially the extent of the energy saving produced by an energy
     efficiency investment that is taken back by consumers in the form of higher consumption, typically in
     the form of more hours of use. It may also take the form of a higher quality of energy service.

     Satisfied Energy Demand: Satisfied energy demand is the level of energy services that would be
     reached with access to better quality and more affordable services, and that would be adequate and
     reasonable for households (usually rural) to meet their basic needs (i.e., satisfied demand is seen
     when the income effect and energy cost effect are overcome).

     Spillover: Additional energy efficiency measures implemented by an energy customer that were
     induced due to participation in an efficiency incentive program. Nonparticipant spillover comprises
     action influenced by an energy program but not linked to participation.

     Suppressed Energy Demand: Suppressed energy demand is the situation where energy services
     provided are insufficient for necessary human development (due to poverty or lack of access to
     modern energy infrastructure) or only available to an inadequate level.

International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP): IPMVP Volume I is an
international measurement and verification (M&V) protocol describing different methods to determine
water and energy savings of energy efficiency projects. IPMVP was first published in 1996 under the
name of North American Energy Measurement and verification protocol (NEMVP).

It was first developed by a volunteer committee under the United States Department of Energy
(US DOE). Since 2001, the committee in charge of IPMVP has developed into Efficiency Valuation
Organization (EVO), a not-for-profit organization to improve the protocol’s content and promote its use.

IPMVP is in its fourth version of publication and is translated into more than 11 languages, describing
the common practices of savings measurement, calculations, and follow-up of energy or water
efficiency projects. IPMVP presents four M&V options to evaluate a project’s savings and the activities
include on-site studies, energy or water flow measurements, and follow-up of independent variables,
calculations, and reports. It also presents the M&V principles, the structure of an M&V plan, and
explanations on measurement boundaries, adjustment bases, measurement period, and reporting
(EVO 2012).

M&V methods prescribed in IPMVP are presented in Table A4.1.

IPMVP presents a framework for transparent, reliable, and consistent reporting on the project’s savings,
which can be used to develop M&V plans for projects. IPMVP Volume 1 is a support document
describing common practices in measurement, calculation, and monitoring of savings achieved by
energy efficiency or water projects at end-user facilities (which are generally buildings, plants, or
factories, but can also be public lighting systems and municipal water distribution networks). M&V
activities include studies of energy efficiency measures implemented at sites, measurement of the flow
of energy or water, identification of independent variables that affect energy usage, baseline modeling,
and savings calculation and reporting. M&V activities carried out by adhering to the IPMVP can help
ensure establishing conservative, transparent, and verifiable savings.

IPMVP consists of three parts as follows:

t   Volume 1 describes the current practices in terms of measuring, calculating, and monitoring the
     savings generated by Energy Efficiency Improvement Actions. It defines the terminology to be
     used in the M&V Plan, as well as the procedures allowing an economically viable determination of
     the energy efficiency savings.

t   Volume 2 is devoted to the internal environmental quality of buildings, in particular the quality of
     indoor air, insofar as their appearance may be influenced by the S2E project.

t   Volume 3 describes the concepts and practices for the determination of energy savings in new
     buildings and gives further implementation examples.

      Option A: Retrofit isolation—key      Key performance parameters are measured that define the energy use of the ECMs
      parameter measurement                 and contribute to the project. The measurements can be for a short duration or con-
                                            tinuous in nature depending on the expected variations in the measured parameter
                                            and length of the reporting period. Parameters that are not measured are estimated,
                                            and these estimates may be based on historical data or on the manufacturer’s specifi-
                                            cations along with the source.
      Option B: Retrofit isolation—         This option is more detailed than Option A in the sense that all the parameters
      measurement of all parameters         required to calculate energy savings of the ECMs have to be measured. This usually
                                            means measuring energy consumption and operating hours.
      Option C: Whole facility              In this approach, energy savings are determined by measuring the energy consump-
                                            tion for an entire facility or sub-facility. Electric, gas meter, and utility billing data are
                                            used to determine the baseline for energy savings calculations. The measurement is
                                            continuous for the entire length of reporting period.
      Option D: Calibrated simulation       Computer simulations of energy consumption of the entire facility or sub-facility
                                            aided by software are used to determine the energy savings. Usually used when
                                            multiple systems affect the facility energy use and no meters exist in the baseline
                                            period. Baseline energy use, determined using the calibrated simulation, is compared
                                            to a simulation of reporting period energy use.

     Comment: IPMVP provides a comprehensive framework for M&V and has become the de facto M&V
     standard in many countries, including the United States. IPMVP helps develop transparent and robust
     M&V plans, though the level of emphasis varies from region to region.


     Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP): FEMP M&V Guidelines were launched in the United
     States to help the federal government agencies measure and verify energy savings achieved in federal
     buildings. FEMP provides guidelines and methods for measuring and verifying energy, water, and cost
     savings obtained from a performance contract targeting federal buildings. The United States Energy
     Policy requires federal buildings to reduce their energy intensity. Hence, to assist federal agencies in
     reducing energy and cost of their building, FEMP was developed. FEMP is basically an application of
     IPMVP for federal buildings. It contains procedures and guidelines for quantifying the savings resulting from
     cogeneration, renewable energy, water conservation, and energy efficiency equipment projects.

     Version 2.2 of the FEMP M&V Guidelines was developed to provide methods and specific guidelines
     for the M&V of energy savings achieved through an energy performance contract targeting a federal
     building. Version 3 of the FEMP M&V Guidelines was published in 2008. It contains procedures and
     guidelines for quantifying savings achieved by projects in cogeneration, renewable energy, water
     conservation, and energy-efficient equipment.

     Currently (as on June 2015) in the draft stage, Version 4.0 includes revised definitions of the four main
     M&V options and provides a tighter overall presentation by moving much of the auxiliary material to

FEMP M&V Guideline Approaches
 APPROACH                           DESCRIPTION
 Option A: Retrofit isolation—key   Key performance parameters are measured that define the energy use of the ECMs
 parameter measurement              and contribute to the project. The measurements can be for a short duration or con-
                                    tinuous in nature depending on the expected variations in the measured parameter
                                    and length of the reporting period. Parameters that are not measured are estimated,
                                    and these estimates may be based on historical data or on the manufacturer’s specifi-
                                    cations along with the source.
 Option B: Retrofit isolation—      This option is more detailed than Option A in the sense that all the parameters
 measurement of all parameters      required to calculate energy savings of the ECMs have to be measured. This usually
                                    means measuring energy consumption and operating hours.
 Option C: Whole facility           In this approach, energy savings are determined by measuring the energy consump-

                                    aided by software are used to determine the energy savings. Usually used when
                                    multiple systems affect the facility energy use and no meters exist in the baseline
                                    period. Baseline energy use, determined using the calibrated simulation, is compared

stand-alone documents. It also includes a new section that provides general M&V guidance for the
majority of the standard energy conservation measures and water conservation measures typically
implemented in federal energy savings performance contracts (ESPC) (US DOE 2008).

M&V methods prescribed in the FEMP are presented in Table A4.2.

FEMP is an application of IPMVP for federal buildings with detailed guidelines and examples on the
approaches applicable to certain energy conservation measures normally found in federal buildings.
Unlike other protocols that only present a general framework, FEMP provides specific measurement
plans adapted to most common measures implemented in buildings.

Comment: FEMP is limited to the United States and is exclusively used for measuring and verifying
energy savings achieved in federal buildings through energy efficiency activities. FEMP and IPMVP are
complementary documents. FEMP M&V Guide is an application document based on the 1997 version
of IPMVP specifically prepared for the federal building sector in the United States. FEMP M&V Guide
also provides a more detailed guidance on the application of different M&V options for specific energy
conservation measures common in federal buildings.


ASHRAE Guideline 14: The ASHRAE Guideline 14 was published in April 2000 with the aim to
standardize the energy savings calculation procedures. This guideline can be considered a more
technical version of IPMVP. The guideline provides three approaches to energy savings as presented
in Table A4.3.

     ASHRAE Guideline 14 M&V Options
      APPROACH                                 DESCRIPTION
      Option A: Whole building approach        This approach uses the main energy meter normally installed by the electricity, gas,
                                               oil, or hot water utility. Measures of energy conservation can address one or more
                                               subsystems in the building. It is often necessary to use billing history to define the
                                               baseline.
      Option B: Retrofit isolation             This approach uses measuring devices to isolate the energy consumed by sub-
      approach                                 systems affected by the extent of energy conservation. The baseline is determined
                                               from the observed measurements before installing the ECM. All parameters must be
                                               measured.
      Option C: Whole building calibrated This method applies to an entire building; computer software is used to create a
      simulation approach                 simulation model of consumption and energy demand for the building. Parameters
                                          affected by ECM are changed in the model to increase the accuracy level of energy
                                          savings results.

     The ASHRAE Guideline requires measurement of all parameters; estimation is not permitted. It requires
     that an uncertainty analysis be introduced and discussed for each measurement plan as well. The
     guideline is well developed, detailed, and exhaustive, hence less flexible and can be difficult to use for
     someone who is not an M&V expert. Also due to it exhaustive nature, the M&V cost will tend to be high
     and hence not very suitable for simple projects (ASHRAE 2002).

     Comment: The ASHRAE Guideline 14 is comprehensive and provides thorough technical description
     of M&V. Though detailed and well developed, Guideline 14 is not extensively used by energy service
     companies (ESCO) or M&V practitioners for the following reasons:

     t    The AHSHRAE Guideline 14 has to be purchased, as opposed to other protocols that can be
           downloaded for free.

     t    Being a highly technical document, it is considered too academic and hence not practical for
           everyday M&V activities.

     t    It is considered less flexible as there is no room for stipulation or limited metering (World Bank
           2013).

     CDM Methodology—AMS-II.C (Demand-side energy efficiency activities for specific technologies)
     and AMS-II.L (Demand-side activities for efficient outdoor and street lighting technologies):
     The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) requires the application of a baseline and monitoring
     methodology in order to determine the amount of certified emission reductions (CER) generated by
     a mitigation CDM project activity in a host country (UNFCCC 2016). “Methodologies for small-scale
     CDM project activities” is relevant to DSM activities in the public sector. AMS-II.C is for demand-side
     energy efficiency activities for specific technologies such as lamps, ballasts, refrigerators, motors,
     fans, air conditioners, pumping systems, and chillers. AMS-II.L is meant for demand-side activities
     for efficient outdoor and street lighting technologies. The CDM methodology document provides

the user with necessary guidelines to develop and implement an M&V plan per the CDM criteria so
as to qualify for emission reduction certificates. The main contents of the guideline documents are
scope and applicability, normative references, definitions, baseline methodologies, and monitoring
methodologies.

Comment: AMS.II.C and AMS.II.L are very comprehensive documents. The documents provide
definitions and calculation methodologies for baseline development along with monitoring techniques.
The project proponents need to follow these guidelines in carrying out the M&V of energy efficiency
projects to qualify for emission reduction certificates.


Australia’s Best Practice Guide to Measurement and Verification of Energy Savings: This best
practice guide was developed by the Australian Energy Performance Contracting Association
(AEPCA) with the support of the Innovation Access Program (IAccP) in 2004. This guide is almost
similar to IPMVP with respect to M&V options. It also uses ASHRAE and FEMP guidelines for
uncertainty and cost evaluation of M&V benefits (NRCan’s CanmetENERGY 2008). The guide aims
to encourage development of energy efficiency projects in Australia with primary focus on energy
savings performance contract.

Comment: The Best Practices Guide is mostly used in the Australian continent.

GSEP M&V Methodologies
 METHODOLOGY                         DESCRIPTION
 Stipulated                          This methodology employs highly probable assumption (preferably a known fact)
                                     that has been agreed on in writing by all stakeholders as part of the M&V plan. (For
                                     example, the time period in which lighting systems will be operational can be stipu-
                                     lated due to it being controlled with timers or building management systems.)
 Measurement                         This methodology implies that the parameter in question will be physically measured
                                     using approved, calibrated measurement instruments and appropriate measure-
                                     ment periods. The measurement period should be long enough to capture the major
                                     energy-governing factors within the facility/boundary, i.e., the measurement period
                                     should fairly represent all operating conditions of a normal operating cycle. The
                                     length of the reporting period should be determined with due consideration of the life
                                     of the EE measure and the likelihood of degradation of originally achieved savings
                                     over time.
 Inference                           In this methodology, a suitable parameter is inferred when its value is determined by
                                     relating this (unknown) parameter to some other (known) parameter or parameters.
                                     There are two circumstances under which this method (inference) can be used:

 Simulation                          This method is a detailed computer simulation of the system (or components of
                                     the system) using commercially available simulation packages. Simulation can be
                                     particularly useful in cases where the interaction between variables is present and
                                     required.

     Management Working Group published this guide in September 2014 with the aim to help
     organizations around the world assess the impacts of energy efficiency projects. The guide provides
     a framework to develop consistent project-specific M&V plans. The guide defines three standard
     parameters (i.e., operating hours, load, and system efficiencies) essential from an energy saving’s
     point of view and presents four methodologies to obtain these parameters.

     Section II of the guide provides a framework for developing a project-specific M&V plan along with
     templates and flowcharts walking the user through the process.

     with implementation.


     The California Evaluation Framework: This framework was published in June 2004 by the California
     Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). The framework provides an approach for planning and conducting
     evaluation of California’s energy efficiency programs.

     The framework provides a systematic approach to conduct evaluation so that all programs are able to
     document their effects and compare to other programs and supply options.

     The framework covers key concepts and considerations required for planning and conducting
     evaluation of energy efficiency programs. The framework details the following nine components
     required for performing program evaluation:

     t   Impact evaluation, and M&V approaches

     t   Process evaluation

     t   Information and education program and evaluation

for energy efficiency programs. The protocols are significantly grounded in the California Evaluation
Framework of June 2004 presented on the previous page.

The evaluation types covered include the following: direct and indirect impact (including the associated
M&V approaches), market effects, emerging technology, codes and standards, and process evaluations.
This document includes a separate protocol for each of the following categories:

t   Impact evaluation—direct and indirect effects

t   M&V (IPMVP)

t   Process evaluation

t   Market effects evaluation

t   Codes and standards program evaluation

t   Emerging technology program evaluation

t   Sampling and uncertainty protocol (for use in determining evaluation sampling approaches),
     reporting protocol (to guide evaluation data collection and reporting)

t   Effective useful life protocol (used to establish the period over which energy savings can be relied
     upon)

Comment: The protocol is used by program evaluators to conduct evaluations of California’s energy
efficiency programs and program portfolios. It is also used by policy makers to plan and structure
evaluation efforts.


National Energy Efficiency Evaluation, Measurement and Verification (EM&V) Standard: Scoping
Study of Issues and Implementation Requirements: Prepared and published in April 2011 by
the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and prepared for the United
States Government, this document presents a study on the scope of developing national-level EM&V
standards. The document provides the following:

t   A set of definitions applicable to an EM&V Standard

t   A literature review of existing standards guidelines related to EM&V and evaluation of bottom-up
     versus top-down evaluation approaches

t   A summary of EM&V-related provisions of the federal legislative proposal that includes national
     (US) efficiency resource requirement

t   An annotated list of issues that are likely to be central to and need to be considered as part of
     developing a national EM&V standard for energy efficiency

     The document identifies four high-level issues associated with developing national EM&V standards
     and proceeds to nine issue topic categories that, if addressed and resolved, would take care of the
     high-level issues.

     The document also provides brief summaries of a few selected EM&V guidelines, protocols, and
     standards and concludes with a draft outline for EM&V national standards.


     Model Energy Efficiency Program Impact Evaluation Guide: The guide was published in November
     2007 as part of the National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency (US). The guide provides guidance
     on model approaches for calculating energy, demand, and emissions savings resulting from energy
     efficiency programs.

     It aims to assist utilities, utility regulators, and others in the implementation of the National Action Plan
     for Energy Efficiency and the pursuit of its long-term goals.

     The guide describes a structure and several model approaches for calculating energy, demand, and
     emissions savings from facility energy efficiency programs that are implemented by cities, states,
     utilities, companies, and similar entities.

     It provides direction on evaluation process and key issues related to documenting, energy and
     demand savings, avoided emissions, and comparing demand- and supply-side resources. The guide
     also discusses the evaluation planning issues as well as presents some evaluation plan outlines.


     Evaluation and Monitoring for the EU Directive on Energy End-Use Efficiency and Energy
     Services (EMEEES): The EU Directive on Energy End-Use Efficiency and Energy Services, also
     known as Energy Service Directive (ESD), requires the member states to achieve the annual energy
     savings targets of 9% or more. EMEEES assists the European Commission in developing methods to
     evaluate the measures implemented to achieve the energy savings targets set out by the ESD.

     EMEEES has prepared a general method for bottom-up and top-down calculation methods plus
     guidelines for ensuring consistency between the results of bottom-up and top-down calculations. The
     bottom-up method starts from data at the level of a specific energy efficiency improvement measure
     (e.g., energy savings per participant and number of participants) and then aggregates results from
     all the measures. The top-down method starts from the global data (e.g., national statistics for energy
     consumption or equipment sales), then going down to more disaggregated data when necessary (e.g.,
     energy efficiency indicators already corrected for some structural or weather effects).

     EMEEES developed 20 bottom-up case applications and 14 top-down cases of these general
     methods, which already cover the largest part of potential ESD energy savings from the energy
     efficiency improvement measures the member states have pledged to implement in their national
     energy efficiency action plans.




     ANNEX 4 | Summary of Monitoring & Verification Protocols
76
ISO 50001 Energy Management Standard (EnMS): ISO 50001 is a voluntary international standard
developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to manage and improve energy
performance.

ISO 50001 EnMS is a framework developed for industrial facilities, commercial facilities, and
organizations to manage energy, which includes energy procurement and use. The EnMS institutes a
structure and discipline to implement technical and managerial strategies to cut energy consumption
and GHG emissions. The standard addresses the following:

t   Energy use and consumption

t   Measurement, documentation, and reporting of energy use and consumption

t   Design and procurement practices for energy-using equipment, systems, and processes

t   All variables affecting energy performance that can be monitored and influenced by the
     organization

ISO 50001 requires continuous energy performance improvement, but it does not include prescriptive
energy performance improvement goals. It provides a framework through which each organization can
set and pursue its own goals for improving energy performance.

Certification by an independent auditor of conformity of the user’s energy management system to
ISO 50001 is not a requirement of the standard itself. To certify or not is a decision to be taken by the
ISO 50001 user, unless imposed by regulation. Alternatives to independent (third-party) certification
include inviting an organization’s customers to verify its implementation of ISO 50001 in conformity with
the standard (second-party verification) or self-declaring its conformity.


EN16001-Energy Management Standard (Europe): The EN16001-Energy Management Standard is
the European standard on energy management, similar to ISO 50001.

EN16001 offers a systematic approach to monitor and reduce the energy consumption in all kinds
of organizations. Like ISO 50001, it is based on plan-do-check-act cycle, with requirements for
establishing an energy policy with solid objectives, putting in place activities to reduce and monitor
energy use, verifying energy savings, and planning improvements. It offers a comprehensive set of
guidelines to meet carbon emission reduction requirements.


The Greenhouse Gas Protocol—A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard: The
Greenhouse Gas Protocol is a multi-stakeholder partnership of businesses, nongovernmental
organizations, governments, and others, spearheaded by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the
World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). The protocol sets global standards
for how to measure, manage, and report GHG emissions. It serves as the basis for nearly every GHG
standard and program in the world—from the ISO to The Climate Registry—as well as hundreds of
GHG inventories prepared by individual companies.




                                     Assessing and Measuring the Performance of Energy Efficiency Projects
                                                                                                             77
     The protocol also offers developing countries an internationally accepted management tool to help
     their businesses to compete in the global marketplace and their governments to make informed
     decisions about climate change.

     The protocol sets out standard and/or guidance on the following: GHG accounting and reporting
     principle, business goals and inventory design, setting organizational boundaries, setting operational
     boundaries, tracking emissions, calculating GHG emissions, managing inventory quality, accounting
     GHG reduction, reporting GHG emissions, verifying GHG emissions, and setting GHG targets.


     EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS): EU ETS is the foundation of the EU’s policy to fight against
     climate change and a key tool to reduce GHG emissions costs effectively. It is the first, and still the
     biggest, international system for trading GHG emissions allowance, covering more than 11,000
     power stations and industrial plants in 31 countries (28 EU countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and
     Norway).

     The system works on the cap-and-trade principle. A cap is set on the total amount of emissions that
     can be emitted by installations covered by the system. Within the cap, companies receive or buy
     emission allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. They can also buy limited
     amounts of international credits from emission-saving projects around the world.

     EU ETS focuses on emissions that can be measured, reported, and verified with a high level of
     accuracy. The system covers emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from power plants, a wide range of
     energy-intensive industry sectors, and commercial airlines. It also covers nitrous oxide emissions from
     the production of certain acids and emissions of perfluorocarbons from aluminum production.

     Businesses must monitor and report their emissions
     each year and have their emission reports audited by              Similar to the EU and its EU ETS, several countries and
     an accredited professional. Accounting and reporting              jurisdictions have implemented multi-sector market-based
     can be done following protocols such as “The GHG                  cap-and-trade programs. (See World Bank 2016b).
     Protocols” summarized above. After each year a
     company must surrender enough allowances to cover
     all its emissions, otherwise heavy fines are imposed. These allowances are then cancelled so that
     they cannot be used again. The accurate accounting of all allowances issued is assured by a single
     EU registry with strong security measures. A company is penalized if it does not surrender enough
     allowances to cover its emissions. It has to buy allowances to make up the shortfall, is “named and
     shamed” by having its name published, and must pay a dissuasive fine for each excess tonne of GHG
     emitted. The fine in 2013 was €100 per tonne of CO2 (or the equivalent amount of N2O or PFCs). The
     penalty rises annually in line with the annual rate of inflation in the Eurozone.


     White Certificate Scheme: White Certificates are obligations imposed on electric and gas utilities to
     attain certain reduction in energy consumption among medium and large energy end users. These




     ANNEX 4 | Summary of Monitoring & Verification Protocols
78
are coupled with tradable energy savings certificates. The scheme has been developed to promote
implementation of energy efficiency in industry.

White Certificate obligations impose energy savings targets on energy companies; if the mandated
targets are not met, they have to pay a penalty. The White Certificates are given to the utilities;
whenever an amount of energy is saved, the utility can use the certificate for its target compliance or
can sell the certificate to parties who cannot meet their targets, similar to emissions trading. They can
be seen as a means of internalizing energy-use externalities and addressing energy efficiency market
failures (Giraudet and Finon 2014).

In Europe, the White Certificate Scheme is implemented in Italy, France, and the UK. The savings
verification approaches used in the three countries are explained in the following paragraphs:

The Italian White Certificate Scheme uses three M&V approaches: deemed savings approach with
default factors for free riding; an engineering approach (delivery mechanism and persistence); and a
third approach based on monitoring plans whereby energy savings are quantified via a comparison
of measured or calculated consumptions before and after the project. All monitoring plans must be
submitted for preapproval to the Regulatory Authority for Electricity and Gas (AEEG) and must conform
to predetermined criteria (Bertoldi and Rezessy 2008).

The French White Certificate Scheme uses a list of standardized actions with the saving evaluation
method. Currently, a number of standard actions are employed in different sectors: 31 in the residential
sector, 22 in the commercial sector, 3 in the industrial sector, and 3 in the transport sector (Bertoldi and
Rezessy 2008).

In the UK Energy Efficiency Commitment Scheme, the savings of a project are calculated and agreed
based on a standard estimate taking into account the technology used, weighted for fuel type, and
discounted over the lifetime of the measure. There is limited ex post verification of the energy savings
carried out by the government in order to inform the design of standardized estimates in future periods
(Bertoldi and Rezessy 2008).

                                         TECHNOLOGIES




     Advancements in information technology have had a big impact on the monitoring of energy efficiency
     programs. An important aspect is continuous M&V. Continuous M&V will help enhance transparency
     and confidence in achieved savings from energy efficiency projects by ensuring that the systems
     designed into a facility actually work as anticipated during operation, and that the facility does not
     overuse energy.

     Some of the new and upcoming technologies that have gained popularity and steady market growth
     in buildings, street lighting, and other public energy efficiency programs are energy management
     systems, central control and monitoring systems (CCMS), and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI).
     All of these technologies have similar modus operandi, in the sense that they have the capability to
     communicate with equipment and at the same time control and monitor them.

     Energy management systems (EMS): EMS are computer-aided mechanisms to monitor, control, and
     optimize the performance of any energy project. When used in reference to building management, they
     are referred to as building management systems (BMS) or building automation systems (BAS). Efficient
     use of EMS can save 10%–40% on electric bills. An EMS can enhance existing operations by allowing
     control of various aspects of energy use, including lighting, and HVAC from a central point, reducing
     error intensity caused by manual operation of these services.

     The Clean Energy Ministerial defines an Energy Management System (EnMS) as a suite of procedures
     and practices that ensure systematic tracking, analysis, and planning of energy use through a Plan-
     Do-Check-Act framework of continual improvement. (www.cleanenergyministerial.org)

     Central control and monitoring systems (CCMS): A CCMS can be regarded as a variation of
     EMS. The CCMS can be used in commercial/public buildings or public infrastructure projects
     such as street lighting and water pumping. There are three basic tasks that should be performed
     to qualify as a CCMS: monitor, control, and schedule. The basic system should be able to monitor
     the energy consumption, voltage, and other parameters. The system should be able to control the
     energy-consuming equipment, and the system should be able to schedule the operating hours of the
     equipment. The ability to remotely manage these three tasks makes the CCMS a vital tool in energy
     efficiency initiatives.

     In the context of street lighting, the CCMS operates either through wires or wirelessly, enabling
     individual lights to be switched on or off, dimmed, and monitored independently. Dimming and
     trimming strategies can then be developed, which contribute to energy savings and allow for lights
     to be independently monitored, reducing the need for scouting. CCMS has excellent monitoring
     capacity by virtue of two-way communication, which makes operation and maintenance easy. Though
     it increases the initial capital costs and requires some lifetime operating costs, CCMS can generate up
     to 20% more energy savings.

Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI): AMI is a combination of smart meters, communication
networks, and data management systems that allows two-way communication between utilities and
customers. Customer systems include advanced meters, visual home displays, home communication
networks, energy management systems, and other equipment that enable smart grid functions in
residential, commercial, and industrial facilities (SMARTGRID.GOV 2015). The customers can use AMI
to remotely monitor and control their energy systems using computers and smart phones.

The objectives of AMI are remote meter reading, error-free data, network problem identification, load
profiling, energy audit and partial load curtailment, demand response, etc.

The AMI consists of various hardware and software components essential for monitoring and recording
data, transmitting information, and controlling usage. The components used in AMI include the
following:

t   Smart meter: An advanced meter capable of collecting and recording information about energy,
     water, etc., and transmitting it to the utility at fixed intervals through communication networks. It
     can also receive information from the utility on pricing, demand response, and faults and convey it
     to the consumer.

t   Communication network: Two-way communication from a smart meter to the utility and vice versa
     as well as with the consumer. Networks such as phone lines, cellular 2G/3G, radio frequency,
     Wi-Fi, etc.

t   Meter data acquisition system: Software applications in the control center hardware and the
     DCUs (data concentrator units) used to acquire data from meters via communication networks and
     send them to the MDMS (ISGF 2015).

t   Meter data management system: Host system that receives, stores, and analyses the metering
     information (ISGF 2015).

t   Home area network: It can be an extension of AMI deployed at consumer premises to facilitate
     the communication of home appliances with AMI and hence enable a better control of loads by
     both utility and consumer (ISGF 2015).

With these advances in communication technologies, it is possible to monitor and control the energy
consumption of appliances and equipment and to record and maintain historical data of every last kWh
used with more precision. However, these advanced technologies come with a cost, which is likely to
go down over time with greater use. Nonetheless, in many cases (especially where energy costs are
high), these technologies can already be justified as they can ensure higher energy savings, reduced
O&M costs, reduced downtime, quick restoration, improved monitoring capacities, and reduced power
thefts.
