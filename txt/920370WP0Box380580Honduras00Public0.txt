THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number

      Regarding the accounting books there are 2 ways in which they can be
      authorized: if the company follows manual accounting procedures, the
      books must be filed before the Mayor's office for authorization. The
      cost ranges between HNL 1-5 per page for three mandatory books. If
      the company opts to keep electronic books, it must request permission
      from the tax authority (Dirección Ejecutiva de Ingresos -DEI) and submit
      separate bound sheets before the Mayor's office by the end of each
      year (or earlier per the company's decision). In this case there are no
      associated costs.

        Environmental Development and Management. Under a major
        government initiative, the National Competitiveness Program
        (Programa Nacional de Competitividad) the municipality (GMDAM)
        entered into an agreement with SERNA in 2007. Under the agreement,
        both entities have computerized all the offices responsible for
        processing the relevant documents and have also trained most of the
        staff. This has increased the number of licenses issued from 30 per

        As of September 4, 2008, the Law on Environment was approved, as
        well as other implementing regulations. Article 78 of the law introduced
        criteria for different categories of environmental approvals depending
        on project risks. Commercial warehouses that fit into Category 1 (Article
        5) are only subject to environmental control rather than a full scale
        study at the local level by the Office of Municipal Environmental
        Development and Management ('UGA' or 'UMA'). It is planned that this

      The new city zoning plan that was introduced in early 2008 is currently
      being operationalized. One of the main features of the plan is the
      change of zoning from residential to commercial and its further
      digitization based on maps from Cadastre and Management
      Engineering (Engenieria Gerencial). Furthermore, the land use
      regulations were amended in April 2008, introducing categories based
      on risk factors. This led to an improvement in the process of obtaining
      the location clearance, including a time reduction. The application is
      checked in the back office to verify whether the new land use is
      compatible with land use regulations.

        The customer hires an electrical engineer certified by the College for
        Mechanical, Electrical and Chemical Engineers of Honduras
        (CIMEQH) to design the external connection according to the
        standards set by the College and to send the design and the
        certificate to Empresa Nacional de Energia Electrica (ENEE) for its
        approval

        An electrical engineer employed by CIMEQH estimates the power
        needed for the project and designs the external connection. For loads
        greater than 1,000 kVA, the engineer should go first to Empresa Nacional
        de Energia Electrica (ENEE) to request a feasibility study. In a case where
        the load is 140kVA, this procedure is not necessary.

        The design and the process of obtaining ENEE's review can only be made
        by an electrical engineer authorized by the CIMEQH. The implementation 17 calendar days              HNL 5,900

        of the design can be done by an electrician. The electrical engineer must
        obtain a certificate by the College for each design that he files with ENEE.
        The certificate states that the engineer is a member of the College and
        has paid his contributions.

        It is recommended that the internal wiring installation be also done by a
        CIMEQH's electrical engineer. Although the internal installation plans are
        reviewed by the Municipality and the Firefighters, in the context of the
        process to obtain a building permit, the final internal installation is not
        reviewed. One way to ensure the quality of the internal installation is to
        hire an engineer authorized by CIMEQH for the installation. In the case of
        a fire due to a malfunctioning installation, it is easier to obtain legal
        satisfaction if it was performed by a member of CIMEQH.

        After having prepared the design, the engineer has to file the certificate

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
in different ways. Higher-income economies tend to look           procedures faster. What reforms making it easier (or
for ways to enhance efficiency by introducing new                 more difficult) to enforce contracts has Doing Business
