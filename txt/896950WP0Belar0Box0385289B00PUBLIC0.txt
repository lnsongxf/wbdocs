                                         Introduction
The Government of the Republic of Belarus (GoB) plans to increase district heating (DH)
tariffs to cost-recovery levels and gradually phase out subsidies, replacing them with social
assistance programs. Residential DH tariffs in Belarus are currently at roughly 10–21 per-
cent of cost-recovery levels. DH subsidies are highly regressive, add costs to business, and
create significant fiscal risks and macroeconomic vulnerabilities.

The purpose of this report is to analyze the social, sectoral, and fiscal impacts of the pro-
posed tariff reform, and to identify and recommend measures to mitigate adverse impacts
of DH tariff increases on the households. The analysis shows that:

•	 The burden of higher DH tariffs will fall most heavily on low-income groups.
•	 The current system of subsidies is unfair, benefitting wealthy customers more than the
   poor.
•	 Cross-subsidies undermine the competitiveness of industries in Belarus
•	 Underpriced residential heat places an increasing fiscal burden on the GoB and risks
   macroeconomic instability.

The analysis shows that a negative social impact is manageable if a tariff increase is accom-
panied by countervailing measures to compensate for the loss of purchasing power, in par-
ticular of the poor, through targeted social assistance and energy efficiency programs. The
reform is more likely to be successful if communication campaigns to address consumer
concerns are carried out before significant price increases, and consumer engagement and
monitoring systems are established. When tariff reform and mitigation measures are prop-
erly sequenced and coordinated, the reform will become more socially acceptable, consum-
ers will benefit from better quality of services, the government will achieve positive fiscal
savings, and the DH sector will become sustainable in the long term. A sustainable DH
sector means:

•	 Financially viable DH service providers—Belenergo and ZhKH—that can afford to
   maintain and invest as much as required to provide the services customers want
•	 The independence of DH service providers from excessive direct fiscal subsidies, and
•	 Well-targeted social assistance for customers struggling to afford the cost of heating.

Table I.1 summarizes the challenges facing the DH sector and the recommended policy
options.

                                 The rest of the report is organized as follows: Section 1 describes the GoB’s plans for the
                                 sector. Section 2 analyzes the principal challenges in the sector that necessitate tariff reform.
                                 Section 3 discusses tariff reform options and the likely impact of pursuing each of these
                                 options. Section 4 concludes by recommending a reform action package that includes cus-
                                 tomer communication and engagement, social protection measures and investments in
                                 energy efficiency. The appendices contain material supporting the analysis in each section.

                      Plans for the Sector?
The GoB has set national targets, planned investments, and continued to enact tariff reform in the DH sector.
National and energy        The GoB’s Strategy for Energy Potential Development sets national targets for the energy
sector programs            sector up until 2020. The overall objective of the strategy is to ensure Belarus’s energy inde-
outline specific invest-   pendence and promote the efficient use of energy resources. The GoB targets relevant to the
ments and targets for      DH sector include:
the DH sector,
                           §	Increasing the share of domestic fuel in the energy mix to 28–30 percent by 2015 and
                             32–34 percent by 2020 from 17 percent in 2010, thus reducing dependence on imported
                             natural gas,
                           §	Reducing the share of natural gas in the energy balance to 64 percent in 2015 and to 55
                             percent by 2020,
                           §	Reducing the energy intensity of GDP by 50 percent by 2015 and 60 percent by 2020
                             (from 2005 levels),
                           §	Phasing out subsidies and cross-subsidies, and
                           §	Restructuring heat tariffs.

                           In line with this strategy, the GoB has enacted a number of DH sector-specific policies and
                           laws described below.

…such as increasing        One of Belarus’s richest natural resources is its forests, which cover 40 percent of the coun-

heat generation,           biomass to 14–15 percent so that, by 2020, at least 32 percent of the fuel used in boilers
                           comes from locally sourced fuels.1

…increasing cost-          The GoB has also set national cost-recovery targets for the residential DH operations of

                           cost-recovery level for residential heat services was only 17.2 percent. Table 1.1 summarizes

Residential tariffs for DH are well below the cost of service in Belarus. Since 2003, production costs have risen
sharply while the cost-recovery levels of residential heat service have dropped by 50 percent. Incremental increases
in residential tariffs have been eroded by inflation and depreciation of the Belarusian ruble to the US dollar. Even if
tariffs were increased by 5 USD per year, the limit before presidential approval is necessary, they would not meet the
30 percent cost-recovery target set by the GoB. A system of subsidies and cross-subsidies between customer classes
and between the electricity and the DH sectors have resulted in an increasing fiscal burden, which worsens as the
cost of service continues to increase.

Residential tariffs are      Residential tariffs are currently at roughly 10 to 21 percent of cost-recovery levels. The
well below the cost of       range depends on factors that include the size of the DH system, fuel used, efficiency of pro-
service                      duction, condition of the networks, and technical characteristics of the customer connec-
                             tion. Figure 2.1 shows how the cost-recovery levels of residential heat service have changed
                             over time in Belarus.

                              Costs faced by suppliers of heating have risen substantially in recent years and are higher
                              than the “economically efficient” level assessed by the Council of Ministers.3 The cost of fuel
                              for use in combined heat and power plants and boilers is the most significant cost faced by
                              suppliers, not least because it is paid in US dollars. The price of importing natural gas from
                              Russia has increased sharply in the past decade, from USD47/tcm in 2005 to USD263/tcm
                              in 2011. Over the same period, the value of the ruble has fallen considerably. This is offset
                              only slightly by the reduction in technical losses in the transmission and distribution sys-
                              tems—currently 16.3 percent for ZhKH and 10 percent for Belenergo. Figure 2.2 shows the
                              rapid increase in the price of natural gas imports since 2005. The import price of natural gas
                              accounts for roughly 60 percent of total heat production costs.

                              The cost of heat production and distribution by ZhKH is thought to be about double that
                              of Belenergo. Contributing factors are (i) economies of scale (Belenergo serves customers
                              in Minsk city and the oblast capitals while ZhKH serves customers in smaller towns and
                              rural areas), (ii) Belenergo’s use of efficient combined heat and power plants (in contrast to
                              the use of heat-only boilers by ZhKH), and (iii) the higher transmission and distribution
                              losses in the ZhKH systems as a result of aging ZhKH assets. Figure 2.3 shows the increase
                              in production costs for ZhKH and Belenergo, as compared to the increase in tariffs.

                            ter tariff. The most recent, N 1166, set the tariff at 80,570 BYR per Gcal against an ”economically justifiable” tariff of 300,000
                            BYR per Gcal. No information is publicly available on the methodology applied for determining the economically justifiable
                            tariff, but it is thought to be a tariff that reflects the actual costs of heat production and delivery.

… and increase prices                                  Since electricity is required to produce and distribute goods from all sectors in an economy,
of consumer goods                                      an implicit tax on industrial electricity use will likely impact the price of nearly all goods
and services                                           and services. To the extent possible, firms facing an electricity tax will pass the tax burden
                                                       on to consumers or other firms in the form of higher output prices.

                                                       Based on an input-output analysis, Figure 2.7 shows the increase in output prices across con-

                                                       use. The impacts range from a 1 percent increase in the output price in the banking and

10     Heat Tariff Reform and Social Impact Mitigation




                                         Based on the household consumption patterns shown in Figure 2.8, Figure 2.9 shows how
                                         the tax burden is distributed across different income groups. Every income group would see
                                         a cost increase on key consumption goods, such as food, clothing, and household articles.
                                         The extra expenditure in absolute terms is the highest for households in the top income
                                         decile, but the impact appears to be modestly regressive, as the percent of expenditures
                                         increased is slightly higher for lower-income households.

                                       cent in 2012. Of this, ZhKH accounts for about 40 percent and Belenergo for the remainder.
                                       Figure 2.5 shows the cost of heat subsidies as a percentage of GDP.

                                       Underpriced residential utility tariffs also create significant fiscal risks and macroecnomic
                                       vulnerabilities. Because Belarus continues to benefit from subsidized import prices for gas
                                       (less than half of the economic price imputed from the European gas price), current finan-

                                       ciency- have had a limited macroeconomic impact. However, the lack of tariff adjustments
                                       and low cost recovery of utility tariffs create significant risks. In case of price hikes for gas
                                       imports the existing imbalances would amplify and likely induce fiscal and macroeconomic
                                       instability. At current tariff and consumption levels, financial losses in the district heating
                                       sector could more than double if Belarus were to import gas at market prices, imposing a
                                       significant fiscal and macroeconomic risk.

                                       consumers regardless of income level. Because higher income households tend to occupy
                                       larger living areas which require more energy for heating purposes, they receive a larger por-

                                       heat subsidy, while the lowest two quintiles receive only 24 percent. Poor households and
                                       those in rural areas also receive a smaller portion of the heat subsidies: 3.5 percent to the poor
                                       and 10.4 percent to rural households. Figure 2.10 shows the distribution of heat subsidies.

                  What Is the Likely Impact of
                               Tariff Reform?
The impact of tariff      The impact of tariff reform depends on how the GoB decides to implement it. To be consis-
reform depends on         tent with the government’s vision to gradually phase out heat subsidies, this report explores
how it is implemented     three tariff increase scenarios in the medium to long term: one under a differentiated pric-
                          ing regime (where customers of Belenergo and ZhKH are charged different tariffs) and two
                          under a uniform pricing regime (where all customers are charged the same tariff). Table
                          3.1: Tariff Reform Options 2015–2020 describes the three tariff reform options and cost-re-
                          covery targets for 2015, 2017, and 2020.

The financial burden      Because 61 percent of households, 81 percent in urban and 14 percent in rural areas, are
on households will        connected to the DH network in Belarus, a tariff increase will have a profound impact on
increase,                 many households.

…and the poor will        Specifically, increasing tariffs to 60 percent and full cost-recovery levels will significantly
suffer the most           reduce the affordability of DH for households in the poorest quintile. At full cost-recovery
                          levels under the uniform price scenario, 30 percent of households in the poorest quintile
                          living in urban areas would spend more than 20 percent of their income on heating com-
                          pared to 0.2 percent under the 2012 price. Under the differentiated price scenario, 12 per-
                          cent of households in the poorest quintile living in rural areas would spend more than 15
                          percent of their income on heating. Figure 3.1 shows the impact of tariff increases under
                          different price scenarios by income group.

 …in both rural and                   The results are somewhat different for rural and urban customers depending on whether a
 urban areas                          differentiated or uniform pricing regime is adopted. Rural poor households in the poorest
                                      quintile that rely on DH services for heating are most vulnerable under the differentiated
                                      pricing scenario and are expected to spend 23 percent of their income on DH at full cost-re-
                                      covery levels. This is because the cost of DH service provided by ZhKH is about double
                                      that of Belenergo’s. ZhKH needs to raise tariffs to a much higher level in order to reach the
                                      targeted cost-recovery rate.

                                      In contrast, the urban DH consumers in the poorest quintile will be most heavily affected
                                      under the uniform pricing scenario. They are expected to spend 21 percent of their incomes
                                      on DH services at full cost-recovery levels. On average, urban households spent more than
                                      rural households on DH, possibly because rural households are more likely to use and have
                                      access to substitutes such as wood, peat, and coal. Figure 3.2 and 3.3 show affordability lev-
                                      els of DH services for households who are connected to DH under various pricing scenarios

16   Heat Tariff Reform and Social Impact Mitigation




 …during the coldest         The impact of higher heating tariffs will be most acutely felt in winter. The heating season in
 times of the year,          Belarus normally begins in October and ends in April. Accordingly, household expenditure
                             on heat tariffs spikes in the first and last quarter of the year. In 2012, households that were
                             connected to DH spent, on average, 1.5 percent of their monthly income on DH services
                             in the fourth quarter and 4.5 percent in the first quarter. At full cost recovery levels, urban
                             households in the bottom 40 percent income group, under the uniform price scenario, will
                             spend approximately 23 percent of income on DH services in the first quarter; rural house-
                             holds in the bottom 40 percent, under the differentiated price scenario, will spend 21 per-
                             cent. Figure 3.4 shows the impact of tariff reform by price scenario, location, and time of
                             year on households in the lowest two quintiles.

                             In addition to added heating expenses in winter months, fruits and vegetables are more
                             expensive; and electricity bills also go up due to shorter daylight time. Finally, penalties for
                             delay in paying utility bills are more likely to occur in winter months. All of these have made
                             the financial situation of low-income households most stressful during the winter season.

                             To cope with a heat tariff increase, poor households are more likely to cut back on con-
 …and they are forced        sumption of food and clothes than on heat. In focus group discussions, 90 percent of the
 to cut expenditure on       participants from poor households without social benefits, 67 percent of those from poor
 other essential goods.      households with social benefits, and 53 percent of those from middle income households
                             said they would reduce food expenditures to cope with a tariff increase. Figure 3.5 describes
                             various coping strategies indicated by focus group participants in case of an increase.
                             Appendix D details the methodology and scope of focus group discussion. The majority of
                             buildings (92 percent) in Belarus are not equipped with apartment-level meters and heat
                             regulators. Participants in the focus group also complained about their inability to control
                             heating costs. In case of overheating, householders prefer to open windows rather than
                             report to service providers, in order to avoid conflict with neighbors

 Women are expected                          Tariff increases are expected to have a more pronounced impact on women than men as
 to be more vulnerable                       they are typically paid less and have fewer job employment opportunities. Moreover, single
 to tariff increases.                        parent families are more often headed by women, including single female pensioners, and
                                             women with young children often have difficulty finding part-time work. In the first quar-
                                             ter of 2012, 62 percent of women were employed compared to 69 percent of men. In 2011,
                                             women in Belarus earned 26.3 percent less than men.

                                             In addition, focus group discussion reveals that there are noticeable gender differences in
                                             coping strategies. While men report they would work more or change jobs in response to
                                             higher utility payments, women are more likely to reduce their expenditures on food or to
                                             seek help from relatives and friends. Women are generally more sensitive about potential
                                             tariff increases and report strong insecurity about their future well-being in case of tariff
                                             increases.

 On the other hand,                          On the positive side, the proposed tariff increase would generate large fiscal savings and
 tariff increases will                       utility revenues. It is expected that, with the increase in tariffs to the full cost-recovery level,
 generate fiscal savings                     the total fiscal savings will amount to 1.6 percent of GDP by 2020. Tariff reform under the
 and utility revenues                        differentiated pricing scenario will also make Belenergo heat sales profitable, allowing for
                                             more investments in new infrastructure and energy efficiency measures. Figure 3.6 shows
                                             the fiscal savings from each pricing scenario.

 …while lower                                Lowering cross-subsidies would also open fiscal space to allow for reductions in electricity
 cross-subsidies will                        tariffs for nonresidential consumers. If nonresidential electricity prices are decreased to the
 improve industry                            level of cost of service, the average unit energy cost of manufacturing could decrease by about
 competitiveness.                            24 percent. The wood, textile, food, and paper industries, which have some of the lowest
                                             export share in output (Figure 3.7), would benefit the most because they use more energy to

                                                would be reduced by between 25 and 28 percent after the removal of cross-subsidies.

                       We recommend the following three approaches:

                       1.	 Enhancing customer communications and engagement
                       2.	 Improving social protection mechanisms, and
                       3.	 Encouraging investments in supply and demand-side energy efficiency

                       The paragraphs below describe each of the approaches in more detail. The sequence of the
                       reforms is important to its success. Promoting customer understanding and winning trust
                       is a critical first step which can then run in parallel with the medium to long-term efforts
                       to improve social protection mechanisms and encourage investment in energy efficiency.5

1. Improve communi-    Focus group discussion and stakeholder analysis reveal that there is limited support for tar-
cation and consumer    iff reform among residential consumers because of their lack of knowledge and awareness
engagement by          of tariff setting and reform processes. The lack of information has been identified as one
                       of the most aggravating factors for residential consumers as they often learn about tariff
                       increases only after receiving the bill.

                       Infrequent and insufficient interaction between DH providers and the customer base has
                       also contributed to consumers’ lack of trust in service providers, which further undermines
                       support for reform. The key to increasing public acceptance of DH tariff increases is devel-
                       oping a comprehensive communication and consumer engagement strategy that fosters
                       a culture of inclusion, along with a public awareness campaign explaining the need for
                       reform.

                       Focus group discussions reveal that the public is more likely to support a tariff increase if
                       there are corresponding increases in wages and other benefits (such as pensions and social
                       assistance), an upgrade in DH service (utilization of new technologies and modernization
                       of equipment), greater transparency from service providers reflected in clearer bills, and
                       introduction of individual metering and heat controls.

…developing a com-           Communication strategies should address the public’s concerns by explaining the ratio-
prehensive communi-          nale for a tariff increase, the government’s plans for protecting the poor, and the means by
cation strategy and          which it will improve the transparency and accountability of the DH sector. Similar efforts
                             in the neighboring former Soviet Union countries present useful examples of a reform
                             strategy in which communication was the key to reform implementation (Appendix G).
                             Communication efforts should also focus on motivating people to save energy and gaining
                             public support for the development and upgrading of the energy system.

                             Communication activities should involve all key government institutions (at both national
                             and local level) and utilities in a systematic manner and target consumers at the regional,
                             city, district and village level. This would require a national agency to coordinate various
                             ministries and agencies to develop guidelines on the best methods of interacting with dif-
                             ferent consumer groups. Messages from various organizations should be consistent and
                             complementary, rather than contradictory. The national agency could offer such ready-
                             made messages to communicate with the public.

                             Public information products, such as social advertisements, posters, leaflets, and brochures
                             should be developed at the national level. This is more cost effective than doing it locally
                             and ensures that the public hears a “single voice”. The consumers’ most preferred channels
                             of communication for information on utility services are utility bills, national and local
                             mass-media, tenants meetings, hotlines, information boards, and internet. Appendix H
                             offers recommendations for specific measures to improve public outreach about heat tariff
                             reform.

                             exclusion from the policy debate, various strategies could be applied to address this issue.
                             For example, people could be invited to comment on the reform process through feed-
                             back mechanisms, such as public surveys and online consultations. Institutional arrange-
                             ments could be made to ensure citizen’s feedback is processed, analyzed, and factored into
                             decision-making.

                             Communication campaigns and consumer engagement efforts should particularly target
                             women as focus group discussions reveal that women are more involved than men in man-
                             aging utility bills and interacting with service providers regarding the quality of services.

                             Providing more and better information and feedback mechanisms would also help improve
                             the transparence and accountability of utilities and address consumers’ key concerns. In
                             addition, consumer monitoring mechanisms could be established by introducing perfor-
                             mance benchmarks and key performance indicators, such as fuel efficiency and the cost of
                             production.

                        protection benefits are categorical, poorly targeted, and inadequate. Appendix I provides a
                        review of existing social protection programs in Belarus. The only income-tested program
                        is the Public Targeted Social Assistance Program (GASP), which provides short-term (6
                        months of the year) income support to financially distressed families. It remains tiny: in
                        2012, its maximum coverage was 2.8 percent of population; its budget was 0.08 percent
                        of GDP. The government has considered reintroducing the Housing and Utility (H&U)
                        Subsidies Program that existed until 2009. The program provides social assistance to house-
                        holds whose housing and utility expenses exceed 15 of their income (in rural areas) and 20
                        percent (in urban areas). However, the scheme does not account for income disparities and
                        therefore is not sufficient to protect the poor.

                        There are two ways in which the targeting and coverage of social protection mechanisms
                        could be improved to mitigate the adverse impact of tariff increases on the poorest 20 per-
                        cent of the population:

                        a. Expanding or topping-up GASP, and/or

                        b. Refining the H&U program

                        In addition, introducing levelized payment plans presents another cost-effective strategy to
                        help households manage the seasonality of utility expenses.

…linking mitiga-        The first option to mitigate the impact of tariff reform is to expand or restructure (top-up)
tion measures to        the existing poverty-targeted cash transfers program, GASP. To reach the target coverage
the existing transfer   of the poorest 20 percent, GASP would need to be expanded 10 times, and the income
program…                threshold greatly raised to allow more households to qualify for the benefit. As a result, the
                        program budget would considerably increase to reach as much as 1 percent of GDP in 2015
                        and stay high in the following years. On the other hand, the program would yield a high
                        reduction in poverty: the poverty rate among the poorest 10 percent would drop twofold
                        after the transfer (Table 4.1).

                        To reduce the program’s cost, GASP may be augmented by a supplemental flat benefit. The
                        supplement would be paid on top of the regular GASP benefit received by those who pass
                        the income threshold. Such a flat benefit could also be offered to other households affected
                        by the tariff increase with incomes above the regular GASP threshold but below a separate
                        threshold established specifically for the top-up.

                        Given the low coverage of GASP, however, such a supplemental benefit would significantly
                        exceed the “base” benefit program and would look more like a separate program. In addi-
                        tion, the current restrictive eligibility criteria in GASP may impede households in the 2nd
                        decile from getting the top-up benefit, even with a higher income threshold. Therefore, it
                        would be important to combine the supplemental benefit with some expansion of GASP,
                        including reconsidering GASP’s ability to be more inclusive without compromising on the
                        targeting accuracy of the benefits.

                                          At lower cost, the GASP top-up option would have a poverty impact comparable to its
                                          expansion scenario and would be more efficient. Table 4.2 summarizes the simulation results
                                          under a scenario when the regular GASP benefit is expanded to cover the first decile while
                                          the supplemental flat energy benefit is provided to the population in the second decile. This
                                          way, the entire program ensures the target coverage of the bottom 20 percent population
                                          but incurs half the cost (0.5 percent of GDP) of the GASP expansion scenario. It achieves a
                                          similar poverty reduction impact with better targeting accuracy.

                                          Several other considerations should be taken into account for GASP adjustment. First, the
                                          eligibility rules would need to be revisited to allow quick response and inclusion of more
                                          households. Second, according to stakeholder analysis and focus group discussions, the
                                          GASP program is associated with the stigma of poverty. The program would need to be
                                          rebranded to improve its image. Third, the current 6-month payment period of GASP lim-
                                          its the program’s efficiency. The payment period for benefits and/or top-ups should be 12
                                          months for the time of the tariff reform or be specifically linked to the heating season.
                                          Fourth, administration of the benefits is fully handled at the local level with local authorities
                                          determining the eligibility and paying the benefits from their budget. This means that the
                                          budget pressure on poorer regions would be higher as the demand for benefits would be
                                          higher there. Furthermore, in their combined roles of checker and payer, the local author-
                                          ities could restrict access to the benefits to offset increased spending. To mitigate this risk,
                                          the central budget may guarantee additional transfer for the regions in case the demand
                                          exceeds available budget resources. Finally, the oversight and control functions should be
                                          strengthened to mitigate the risk of system abuse by both providers and beneficiaries.

…re-introducing the                 The H&U subsidy program was phased out in 2009. Some advantages to re-introducing the
H&U subsidy benefit,                H&U subsidy include public familiarity with the program and its specificity to energy tar-
or                                  iffs. Furthermore, if reintroduced, the GoB will be able to learn from past lessons to create
                                    a more efficient and streamlined program. However, the design of the program does not
                                    differentiate consumption patterns and income levels of households. Therefore an import-
                                    ant drawback of this program is that it does not provide any support to a large share of gen-
                                    uinely poor households who use alternative fuels for heating or who are too poor to afford
                                    to spend 15 or 20 percent of their income on heating. Empirical evidence suggests that this
                                    type of programs is also quite regressive, with the majority of the benefits going to middle
                                    and upper income households.

                                    To improve the coverage of the poor with H&U benefits, households may be compensated
                                    for a share of the heating bill based on their per capita income. Such a refined formula
                                    would use an income-test to determine eligibility and to differentiate benefit payments
                                    based on income levels. For example:

                                    •	 Households from the 1st and 2nd deciles would be compensated for the expense above
                                       10 and 15 percent of their income, respectively
26       Heat Tariff Reform and Social Impact Mitigation




                                  •	 Households from the 2nd and 3rd quintiles would be compensated for the expense
                                     above 20 percent of their income.

                                  The simulation results presented in Table 4.2 suggest that the refined H&U benefit would
                                  cover more households in the lowest deciles as compared to the “old” benefit (84 and 60
                                  percent vs 48 and 25 percent in 2015 and 2017, respectively) and fewer funds would be
                                  leaked to better-off households (5 and 25 percent vs 37 and 63 percent of benefits going
                                  beyond the bottom quintile in 2015 and 2017, respectively). Spending for the refined ben-
                                  efit would be higher in 2015 but still remain at a sustainable level of 0.014 percent of GDP;
                                  in 2017 the two programs would require a similar budget.

                                  The refined H&U benefit would significantly reduce the incidence of households with
                                  high H&U related costs (H&U expenses above 15 percent of annual income) among those
                                  belonging to the bottom decile (from 18.9 to 1.3 percent in 2017). In comparison, the “old”
                                  H&U benefit would only reduce the percentage of households in the bottom decile who
                                  spent more than 15 percent of annual income on H&U from 18.9 to 16 percent in 2017
                                  (Table 4.1). Table 4.2 compares the old H&U subsidy program to the refined program in
                                  terms of benefit coverage, targeting accuracy and fiscal cost for 2015 and 2017.

                                  Although it is more convenient for households to receive the in-kind benefit (no need to
                                  collect cash transfers every month), H&U benefits are less transparent than GASP and
                                  distort incentives for energy efficiency once household expenditures are above the 15/20
                                  percent threshold. Table 4.3 compares the advantages and disadvantages of the GASP and
                                  H&U programs. Appendix J lists social assistance programs implemented in other Eastern

                        The H&U benefits could be further streamlined if administered under the Ministry of
                        Labor and Social Protection rather than the Ministry of H&U. It is not the role of H&U
                        service to determine vulnerability and thus eligibility for social assistance. The Ministry of
                        H&U could help social protection units to calculate/verify H&U costs and to check eligibil-
                        ity and determine the benefit. In fact, relatively simple software may offer a technological
                        solution to checking eligibility and determining the benefit size. That would also reduce the
                        workload for the social workers. Applying for income support in a single unit makes even
                        more sense given the similarity of information/data collected for GASP and H&U benefits.
                        It would also provide a more client-centered approach, allowing clients to apply for any
                        benefit in a single place.

                        Administration of both GASP and H&U benefits is currently fully handled at the local
                        level with local authorities determining the eligibility and paying the benefits from their
                        budget. This means that the budget of poorer regions would be put under higher pressure
                        because of higher demand for benefits. The literature suggests that centrally financed social
                        protection programs generally work better while locally financed ones typically suffer from
                        low coverage, payment arrears, and poor protection offered in poor localities. For the above
                        discussed mitigation measures to work it is recommended that the financing arrangements
                        be switched from local to central financing, with complementary investments in a stronger
                        oversight and control system.

payment plans.          This can be hard for households to manage from a cash-flow perspective. Under a lev-
                        elized payment plan, customers make identical, fixed payments every month, regardless
                        of their actual consumption in any given month. Levelized payment plans help ease the
                        cost of heating during the coldest months and recoup utility revenues during the sum-
                        mer months. A levelized payment plan would average annual energy consumption over a
                        12-month period, basing monthly charges on past energy usage and estimated future rates.
                        Bills may be adjusted every six months to minimize the difference between actual costs and

                        efficiency improvement in Belarus, there are, nevertheless, more improvements that can
                        be made on both the supply- and demand-sides in the DH sector. It is important to note
                        that many of the measures described below have a cost. A tariff increase will therefore be
                        needed to fund many of the measures. Appendix K provides a more detailed analysis on the

                        which is less than half of that in the Grodono Oblast at 117.3 USD/Gcal. The difference
                        between the lowest and highest cost of heat supply within one oblast is also substantial and
                        ranges from 24 to 51 percent (Figure 4.1).

                               energy-efficient engineering systems (Figure 4.3). Retrofitting and upgrading old building
                               stocks therefore presents potentially large energy savings.

                       kept by the DH companies rather than returned to local government. The savings may
                       be used for additional investments or for financial reward of the personnel who contrib-
                       uted to the improvement in energy efficiency.
                    •	 Gradually reduce the subsidies and cross-subsidies related to heat production.
                       Reducing subsidies will, to some extent, motivate the DH companies to reduce costs.
                       Whereas many improvements in energy efficiency require capital expenditure, some can
                       be achieved through low-cost (or no-cost) changes in management.
                    •	 Make additional financing available to the DH companies. Such financing could
                       include financing by multilateral development banks, like the World Bank, or by
                       government.
                    •	 Publicize and disseminate results achieved by other DH companies in improv-
                       ing energy efficiency. Disseminating the results of other efforts helps DH companies
                       improve their own performance. Publicizing the results also helps owners and custom-
                       ers understand how their DH service provider compares in performance to others.

… investing in DH   Based on the case studies of three representative towns and analysis of technology gaps
infrastructure      in western DH systems (Appendix K), the following supply-side EE measures are recom-
                    mended to improve production efficiency. The investments also contribute to improving the
                    efficiency, quality, and sustainability of urban utility network and infrastructure upgrading.

                    •	 Replacing old, low efficiency boilers with newer, more efficient ones. Many DH plants
                       and boilers in Belarus are in need of rehabilitation. Some boilers have been running for
                       more than 30 years and are past their technical life span. As a result, these boilers are
                       running at 50 – 60 percent efficiency levels.
                    •	 Converting from natural gas boilers to boilers using renewable fuels. Heat gener-
                       ated in state-of-the-art wood-fueled boilers is estimated to be about 10 percent more
                       cost effective than traditional natural gas fired boilers at today’s prices. Since natural gas
                       import prices are expected to increase more than the price of wood, the cost efficiency
                       of wood-fueled boilers is likely to improve over time.

                                           •	 More rational boiler sizing. Some boilers in Belarus run at only 30 – 40 percent of their
                                              design capacity, especially during the summer months when typically only hot water service
                                              is needed. This results in higher fuel use because boilers running at lower capacity factors
                                              typically are also less efficient. Such inefficiency could be avoided if more smaller-capacity
                                              boilers are installed. Some of these units could therefore be shut down completely during the
                                              summer months, leaving a smaller number of units to run at relatively high capacity factors.
                                              The units shut-down in summer could be restarted in winter to meet heating demand.
                                           •	 Replacing steam with hot water boilers. In some areas, steam boilers are still used, a
                                              legacy of times when there was a larger industrial load. These steam boilers are now used
                                              primarily to serve residential customers (for example, in Starye Dorogi). Steam boilers
                                              are less efficient in serving the needs of residential customers than hot water boilers.
                                           •	 Replacing networks. Replacement of worn-out network parts, where the heat losses and
                                              water losses are high, with pre-insulated pipes is one of the most important investment
                                              priorities. Payback periods for networks are usually longer than paybacks for other DH
                                              investments, but investment in the network is essential to keeping the DH system oper-
                                              ating in a sustainable way.
                                           •	 Reduction of the network dimension and optimization of the network routes. Due
                                              to the reduction in heat loads over (last decades), the routing and dimensions of some
                                              network parts need to be changed. As in other transition countries, consumption has
                                              dropped as some consumers have left the DH system and energy efficiency measures
                                              have been introduced. In such cases the dimension of the DH pipes should be reduced
                                              and a more direct route from the heat generation plant to the consumers considered in
                                              order reducing heat losses in networks. For instance, in Volkovysk one consumer with
                                              a capacity of 0.4 Gcal is connected with the DH through a 1.5 km network (one pipe
                                              counting), without any other consumers connected to this network branch.
                                           •	 Replacing pumps. Replacement of old, low efficiency network pumps, which are often
                                              oversized, has a big potential to reduce electricity costs.

                                           The economic rates of return of the above investments depend on site- specific details,
                                           such as the efficiency of old boilers and the number of operating hours per year. Table 4.4
                                           describes the economic performance of some of the recommended investment components
                                           based on the data of the case study towns.

                                      Network renovation projects are usually high cost investments with long payback periods.
                                      The investment cost per km and achieved savings depends very much on the diameters of
                                      the installed network parts. However, replacement of the network is often a technical must
                                      in order to keep the whole DH system operational. Table 4.5 shows results of the economic

                                         ings. With CTPs, temperature is controlled at the CTP, which provides heat to a group of
                                         buildings. The supply of heat to each single building depends on the average demand of
                                         the buildings connected to the CTP. With building-level ITPs, temperature is controlled
                                         independently in each building, and the heat supplied to the building depends on the

                                         Soviet norms, and heat losses though the building construction elements are high. The
                                         highest potential for energy savings lies in insulating external walls, replacing windows,
                                         and insulating roofs.
                                      •	 Apartment-level heat metering and regulation. Heat is currently metered at the build-
                                         ing level, and residents do not have the ability to measure and control heat consumption
                                         in their flats. Internal piping in most buildings is vertical, making flat-level heat meter-
                                         ing complicated since all customers take heat from the same pipes. It is assumed that, in
                                         parallel with increases in heating tariffs, the incentives to have flat-level heat regulation,
                                         metering, and billing will increase.

                                      At the current level of the residential heat tariff, however, none of the suggested EE mea-
                                      sures would be feasible. As shown in Table 4.6, payback periods of all investment compo-
                                      nents are very long, with the payback of the whole investment more than 75 years.

                                            As shown in Table 4.7, by increasing tariffs to reflect cost, installation of thermostatic valves
                                           and ITPs would become most profitable. The NPVs of these investment components are
                                           positive, starting from 2017, under all price increase scenarios. Under a full cost recov-
                                           ery tariff, the simple payback of these investments is only two to five years. The whole
                                           investment package also becomes economically feasible under 100 percent cost-recovery
                                           scenarios.

36   Heat Tariff Reform and Social Impact Mitigation




 A recommended road-         The above analysis shows that the burden of higher DH tariffs falls most heavily on
 map for heat tariff         low-income groups. However, the negative social impact is manageable if the government
 reform.                     improves existing social protection systems and scales up energy efficiency programs. It
                             should be recognized that, while a number of easy-to-achieve opportunities might be avail-
                             able, addressing energy efficiency comprehensively also requires longer term investments
                             and it takes time for the benefits to reach the households. An effective social assistance
                             package should therefore consist of both welfare transfers that offer immediate relief and an
                             energy efficiency program that provides a sustainable long-term solution.

                             As noted above, the sequence of the reform is critical. The reform program will be most
                             effective if the GoB:

                             1.	       Leads with a consumer communication campaign while

                             2.	     Putting in place better social protection mechanisms, including grants to demand-
                             side energy efficiency targeting at low-income households, and

                             3.	      Taking measures to encourage investments in supply and demand-side energy
                             efficiency.




                             When mitigation measures are properly coordinated, the heat tariff reform will become
                             more socially acceptable, consumers will benefit from better quality of services, and the
                             government will achieve positive fiscal savings. Figure 4.4 illustrates a proposed timeline
                             for implementing the package of reforms described in this note.
