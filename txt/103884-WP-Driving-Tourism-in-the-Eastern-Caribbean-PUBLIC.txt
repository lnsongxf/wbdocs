Executive Summary




The impact of the global 2008 crisis on Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)
economies was particularly hard and has lingered on until today. Poverty was relatively high
in the OECS (between 18 and 38 percent) before the crisis and is likely to have worsened
since. The main priority of OECS governments is to enable a resumption in growth in a
more sustainable, inclusive and resilient manner. As evidenced in the paper, as an important
source of employment and a key economic pillar, tourism plays a significant role in resuming
growth in the region. However, despite ongoing reforms in the sector, the region’s share of
global tourism has been declining, and the industry’s competitiveness is low in comparison
to comparator countries. This paper will argue that a regional ferry system could potentially
make a positive contribution to tourism in the OECS and, therefore, it is worth studying
further through a separate feasibility assessment.
   As it relates to competition between a ferry system and the cruise industry, as the paper
will demonstrate, the class of travelers who uses the ferry is very different from cruises,
with the former serving stay-over visitors who may be interested in traveling to multiple
destinations. The paper will show that there is evidence of both complementary and
substitution effects between cruise and stay-over tourism in the OECS. However, existing
estimates suggest that substitution of cruise for stay-over tourists would likely result in a
net positive impact on the economy. Moreover, as it relates to travel within the region, the
paper will show that there is little cross-elasticity of demand between air and sea travel, and
only significant changes in price or trip durations could cause passengers to switch from
one mode of transport to the other. A regional ferry system would encourage a new class of
travelers, and, therefore, will allow the region to tap into a potential new market of tourists,
including local, intra-regional tourists who find it difficult to travel by air, as well as stay-
over international tourists who may be interested in traveling to more than one island.
   Regional ferries are not new to the OECS: the region has had a regional ferry system in
the past and, currently, there are a number of sub-regional or country-level ferry systems
that are operational (appendix B). The existing system is a mix of fast and slow ferries. As
discussed in the paper, the ferry system in the region faces significant challenges (regulatory,
infrastructural and institutional) that would prevent them from offering regional-level
services. These challenges have also affected the fate of many regional ferry proposals by
different potential investors to the governments in the region.
   In particular, one of the key obstacles facing the development of the OECS ferry system is
that the ferry proposals in the past have, generally, not been coordinated regionally. Rather,
they have, generally, been the result of random discussions between individual governments

and ad-hoc investors. Investor interest for a regional ferry exists, but a regionally-organized,
transparent and professionally-managed procurement process is essential for the success of
a regional ferry system.
   Of course, in addition to a regional ferry system, it is important to be aware of the other
factors that would be essential to boost tourism in a sustainable manner. These include
improving the experiences of tourists in any one destination, improving the quality of service
and the productivity of the tourism sector and better tourism promotion and packaging.
Moreover, if tourism is to have spillover effects to the rest of the economy by having a
multiplier effect on growth and job creation, it is also important to strengthen the linkages
between tourism and other sectors in the economy that support it, such as agribusiness, and
to improve the productivity of those sectors. However, these issues will need to be explored
through a separate study.
   This paper serves as background for a feasibility assessment of a regional ferry system,
notably by providing data and statistics on the movement of people, cargo, prices of moving
within the region, existing fleet of ferries, etc. It notably draws interesting lessons from two
successful regional ferry systems: the Greek ferry system and the Baltic Sea ferry system.
   As it relates to the movement of cargo through a regional ferry system, based on available
evidence, there is a relatively low level intra-regional trade, and an excessive number of
available vessels in the region. However, there are significant shortcomings in the way they
provide services and operate (unscheduled services, old and sometimes unsafe vessels, with
poor operational methods of loading, unloading and carrying cargo). It is not clear whether
a new regional ferry system per se would be able to better facilitate the movement of cargo in
the region, or, whether improvements to the existing cargo services (e.g., improved logistics
and better coordination amongst shippers, more reliable services, etc.), combined with a
better business environment for trade would be sufficient to give goods produced in the
OECS access to a regional market. These are issues that ought to be studied separately, and
are important factors that will also affect the feasibility of a regional ferry system.
   Nevertheless, as it relates to the movement of motor vehicles, what is evident is that it
is almost impossible within the region (due to customs laws and regulations that do not
acknowledge the temporary importation of vehicles). There are no cross-border ro-ro
ferries that would allow trucks carrying cargo to get on the ferry and off at the destination.
The inability of moving motor vehicles within the region also affects tourists who may be
interested to travel within the region by car.
   A follow-up feasibility assessment should look into the extent in which a new regional
ferry system of passengers and cargo could be integrated or linked to the current ones, and
should provide a detailed business and investment plan for a regional ferry system, with
financial projections.
   The recommendations of the present paper have been summarized in Table 4.1.
CHAPTER 1
Background: OECS Tourism Profile and Trends




1.1 Introduction
The 2008 global crisis exposed the existing vulnerabilities in the Organization of Eastern
Caribbean States (OECS). As a result, the region continues to experience weak growth,
elevated fiscal imbalances, and heightened risks to financial system stability. Per capita
­
income in the region declined on average by 4.5 percent between 2008 and 2012.
   The OECS has not yet recovered from the effects of the 2008 global economic crisis.
Economic growth in the region contracted for four consecutive years after the onset of the
global economic crisis in 2008 (on average, by 1.5 percent per year) and led to a cumulative
drop of six percent in total output during 2009–12. Although there has been a slight rebound
in 2013, with regional real output growth averaging 0.7 percent, economic activity in most
countries has remained sluggish.
   The main priority for the region is to resume growth in a sustainable, inclusive and
resilient manner, and tourism, as an important source of employment and a key economic
pillar, has a significant role to play. In fact, tourism accounts for approximately 60% of
export earnings, 40% of gross domestic product (GDP), and 40% of total employment in
the region (Table 1.1).
   The role of tourism has increased in the OECS over the past two decades (Figure 1.1).
A general trend has been a reduction in the role of agribusiness (and, in some cases,
manufacturing) and an increase in the role of tourism.
   The tourism sector will continue to be the main pillar of economic growth for these small
island economies, which have limited options for economic diversification (World Bank
2012a), except in sectors linked to tourism. Therefore, a competitive and robust tourism
sector is critical, especially since this cross-cutting sector has significant opportunities for
linkages to other areas of economic activity, including construction, agribusiness, and
financial services and could have spillover effects on the rest of the economy.
   There is a strong case for developing strategies for strengthening the stay-over tourism
versus cruises in the region. The OECS ratio of cruise to stay-over arrivals (air and sea)
roughly averages 2.5 in 2011 (Figure 1.2). However, stay-over visitors spend significantly
more than cruise-ship passengers—roughly US$50 vs. US$1,000 per visitor for the OECS
in 2012—and such differences are important in terms of the impact of tourism in local
economies (Briceno-Garmendia et al. 2013). While passengers of a cruise ship consume by

going on local excursions, and going shopping at the country being visited, stay-over visitors
spend much more on hotels, restaurants, excursions, transportation, and shopping per stay.
In their recently published paper, Briceno-Garmendia, et al. state that:

    “It should not come as a surprise that between 2000 and 2011, the number of ­   international
    ­
    cruise-ship passengers increased about 66% while the income generated by all passengers
    measured in terms of traceable spending increased only about 25% from approximately
    ­
    US$95 ­ billion in 2000 to US$1,180 million in 2011” (Briceno-Garmendia et al. 2014, 74).

   These arguments make a strong case for developing the strategies for increasing cruise
passengers’ local spending (e.g., through improving the experiences of cruise passengers on
each island) and, over time, increasing the number (and, more importantly, spending) of
stay-over visitors.
   In addition, going forward, there is potential for the OECS governments to utilize cruise
tourism as a strategic complement to stay-over visits. Survey data from Curacao and the
Cayman Islands indicate that cruise visits can act to increase future demand for stay-over
tourism (Carolina and Pau 2010; Shamsub et al. 2006). The results confirm several important
factors that could increase the willingness to return such as information available to tourists
and entertainment opportunities on the island.
   For the region to gain a larger share of the global tourism market and drive growth
in the region, it is important to develop a strategy that would increase (a) international
tourist flows to the region, (b) intra-region travel by foreign tourists and local residents,
and, (c) tourism expenditure and receipts per tourist. Any increase in the number of tourists
must be planned carefully, so that it does not exceed the carrying capacity of the islands,
and so that it manages and mitigates the negative effects of an increased tourism (littering,
congestion, environmental damage, etc.). At the same time, for tourism to have a multiplier
effect on regional growth and job creation, and to contribute to a reduction of poverty and
increased shared prosperity, it is important to strengthen the sector’s linkages with the rest of
6	    Driving Tourism in the Eastern Caribbean



the economy.1 To achieve these goals, the following could be important contributors: (a) the
development and implementation of a regional tourism promotion, including improved
information sharing and connectivity with distribution channels; (b) the facilitation of the
movement of people and goods within the OECS, including the removal of regulatory and
infrastructure barriers; (c) improvements to the competitiveness of the tourism sector in
ways that are sustainable and inclusive, including the quality of services and variety of
the experiences offered to tourists at any one destination2; and (d) improvements to the
productivity of (and strengthening the linkages with) the other sectors (such as agribusiness)
that support tourism3.
   This paper will be focusing on points (a) and (b),4 and will argue that important
contributions to the growth of tourism in the region could come from a strategy that would
encourage regional collaboration5 (e.g., by branding the OECS as one destination), allow

  Strengthening linkages between tourism and agribusiness is particularly important. According
to a survey conducted in 2008 by the World Bank Group with hotels, cruise lines and marinas in
the region, while most hotels procure services locally, very few purchase local agricultural goods,
as local production is neither competitive nor large enough to accommodate hotels´ demand.
According to this survey, only 32% of tourism food demand is currently sourced locally (World
Bank 2008). In fact, most of the food products that are imported account for a higher share of a
hotels’ total expenditure. There is, therefore, significant room for the linkages between the two
sectors to be strengthened. According to the survey, most hospitality operators, particularly hotels,
demonstrate high willingness to increase the share of local products and services purchased; in
addition, local suppliers of goods and services are willing to focus more of their efforts on the
needs of the tourism industry.
2
  Some issues related to non-competitive tourism offering and poor service quality not necessarily
covered in this paper that may be important to tackle include: inconsistent and weak application
of quality standards on tourism accommodation and services; poor development and management
of many tourism assets and access leading to tourism attractions, and the deterioration of what
already exists; poor access to credit to develop new product offerings or to improve existing
standards; lack of a coordinating mechanism to maintain a dialogue between tourism service
providers to package (and promote) new products; low level of tourism skills, due to disconnect
between tourism training programmes and the needs of the private sector, as well as weakness in
soft skills of those who offer services to tourists; and the region’s limited visibility. In addition, there
is competition amongst the countries over the same target markets as opposed to coordination to
attract new inbound tourists to the region.

  A more productive and resilient agriculture sector, including better linking producers and processors
to market, can have a considerable impact on reducing rural poverty and unemployment, particularly
among the youth. Bolstering selected value chains, with emphasis on developing productive alliances
in marginalized areas, will benefit the most vulnerable segments of the population and increase the
prosperity of local communities.

  While points (c) and (d) are also important in the development of a regional tourism approach,
they are beyond the scope of this paper, and require a separate analysis.
5
  It is important to emphasize that a regional approach is recommended as one component of
a broader tourism strategy. In this regard, the importance of country-level efforts to make
improvements to the competitiveness of the tourism sector, including the quality and variety of
the experiences offered to tourists, should not be undermined. These merit an independent study,
which would be beyond the scope of the current paper.

international tourists to move more easily from one island to another (i.e., “island-hopping”
or multi-destination travel), and make it easier for local residents (and goods, particularly
motor vehicles) to move better among the various islands through a possible regional ferry
system6. For reasons discussed in the paper (in particular, the large supply of existing vessels
for carrying cargo in the region), the question of the contribution of a new regional ferry
system to the better movement of cargo requires further analysis through a more in-depth
feasibility study of the ferry system.
   This paper is divided into four parts. Chapter 1 provides the background information
on tourism related reforms and trends in the region, and benchmarks the performance of
the sector in the region against the broader Caribbean region and the world. Chapter 2
provides a justification for why the concept of “island-hopping” and a regional ferry system
could contribute to the development of tourism in the OECS region, and why, therefore, it
would be worthwhile to undertake an in-depth feasibility assessment for the development
of this system. This section also provides some of the key obstacles for the development of a
regional ferry system, which need to be addressed if the system is to be successful. Chapter 3
provides some background key data and information for the feasibility assessment, including
a benchmarking against the Greek and Baltic systems, and the potential competition between
air and ferry, as well as between stay-over versus cruise tourism. Chapter 4 provides a set of
recommendations and next steps.


1.2  Snapshot of Ongoing Reforms in Tourism in the OECS
The OECS countries, individually and collectively, are actively promoting their tourism
industries. Table 1.2 shows some of the strategies being pursued by OECS governments.
As can be seen from the table, reforms related to transportation are echoed in a number of
country reform agendas.
   OECS governments understand the importance of regional tourism collaboration. The
OECS Tourism Policy of 2011 acknowledges that more can be achieved through synergy
and collaboration “than individual states can achieve on their own.” The policy also
highlights the importance of establishing “a mechanism for joint tourism marketing and
promotion” and refers to island-hopping as one possible strategy. The Protocol of the
Eastern Economic Union, contained in the Revised Treaty of Basseterre Establishing the
Organization of Eastern Caribbean States Economic Union also emphasizes the importance
of regional collaboration. For example, Article 19.2 of the Protocol states that: “within this
context, each Protocol Member State shall work towards the progressive harmonization
of air and maritime transport policies, which encourage the orderly growth of the sector,
particularly, with respect to tourism and trade.” Article 21 of the Protocol states that:
“Protocol Member States agree to establish a mechanism for joint tourism marketing and
promotion.”

 It is important to point out that improving the air transport is not the focus of this paper, but an
important issue that has been studied before, and should be pursued seriously.

   Despite its importance, other than a few collaborative initiatives in the area of tourism
(Table 1.2), regional cooperation is generally weak. Since around the mid-1990s, for example,
individual countries have been constructing their own international airports and paying
airlines to fly into their countries. St. Vincent and the Grenadines is reportedly investing
more than US$300 million to build a new international airport on the mainland; Dominica
is also considering a new international airport. In addition, OECS countries subsidize
airlines through various measures: direct payments to regional carriers, minimum revenue
guarantees, and marketing support agreements. Data on payments to airlines is difficult to
obtain; however, the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association conducted a study on the
use of airline subsidies in 2009. Nine countries reported paying a total of US$50 million
a year to airlines (World Bank 2012b).

1.3  International Travel Patterns and Tourism Competitiveness in
the OECS7
Regarding tourist8 arrivals, OECS lagged in comparison to the overall Caribbean between
2012 and 2013. In 2013, Table 1.3 shows that the OECS maintained a low share of
total Caribbean tourist arrivals—with a 5.2% share—and grew by only 1.0% in com-
parison to 2.5% in the overall Caribbean. At the country level, tourist arrivals patterns
in the OECS (plus Barbados) group were quite disparate, ranging from 508.5 thousand
arrivals in Barbados to 7.2 thousand visitors in Montserrat. In terms of tourist arrival
growth, the OECS was led by Anguilla, which grew by 6.8% in 2013 (see Table A.13)
(CTO 2014a). Between 2006 and 2013, the OECS (plus Barbados) growth performance
was always below that of the overall Caribbean and its share of total Caribbean tourists
has slightly decreased during that period (CTO 2007, 2009, 2010a, 2010b, 2012, 2013a,
2013b, 2014a).

  A tourist is: “A visitor staying at least 24 hours in the country visited” (CTO 2014b). In other
words, this implies that a tourist is a stay-over visitor. It is worth noting that cruise passengers are
not considered as stay-over visitors (tourists) but as same-day visitors, even if the ship overnights
at the port.

  Box 1.1  Performance and Competitiveness in the OECS—Key Messages

  •	 In 2013, the OECS maintained a low share of total Caribbean tourist arrivals.

  •	 As with tourist arrivals, the OECS performed below the Caribbean on tourism receipts.

  •	 The OECS performs below the Caribbean region in competitiveness indicators.

  •	 The OECS should benefit from positive prospects for the US and European economies in 2014.




  Box 1.2  Global Trends in Tourism

  In 2013, the biggest recipients of tourists in the world were: Europe, the Asia-Pacific and the America.
  Figure B2.1 shows that Europe welcomed the most tourists during that year, with 563.4 million arriv-
  als, accounting for 51.8% of world inbound tourism. Europe’s share was followed by that of the Asia
  Pacific (22.8%); the Americas (15.5%); and the Middle East and Africa, which both embraced a modest
  share of approximately 5%a
     Between 2012 and 2013, relative growth was strongest in the Asia Pacific (6%), Europe and Africa
  (both 5%). These three regions were followed by the Americas (3%) and the Middle East (0%).

       Internationally, the top spenders in outbound tourism in 2013 were: China, with US$128.6 billion; the
    United States (US$ 86.2 billion); and Germany (85.9 billion). Despite the rise of China, key traditional source
    markets together still remained the top spenders worldwide, with 7 advanced economies in the top ten.
       In 2013, Europe was the biggest recipient of international tourism receipts, with a 42.2% share
    (Figure B2.2). This was followed by that of the Asia-Pacific (31.0%); and the Ameri­cas (19.8%).
       Between 2012 and 2013, China and Russia have been leading growth in international tourism
    spending, while the Asia-Pacific region has received the highest growth in receipts. During that
    period, developing economies have thus been leading growth both in tourism expenditures and
    receipts. China’s tourism spending increased by 26.1% in 2013 and was followed by Russia, with
    24.9%; and Turkey, with 17.7%. Regarding tourism receipts, the Asia Pacific region demonstrated
    an 8% increase in 2013, while the United States and Europe also recorded robust growth, with 6%
    and 4% respectively. In contrast, growth in tourism receipts in Africa remained stagnant (0%) and
    decreased by −2% in the Middle East.
       The United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) forecasts for 2014 an increase in tourist
    arrivals ranging between 4% and 4.5%. The organization expects that prospects for the Asia Pacific
    region will remain the strongest, with growth expected to reach 5%–6%. It projects an increase in
    Africa between 4% and 6%, compared to 2013, while both Europe and the Americas are expected to
    grow between 3% and 4%.

   As with tourist arrivals, the OECS performed below the Caribbean on tourism receipts.
In 2013, the OECS maintained a low share of total Caribbean tourism receipts—4.8%.
Receipts grew by a modest 1.9%, compared to 2.1% in the Caribbean. At the country level,
St. Lucia collected the highest tourism receipts across the OECS, with US$354 million;
Anguilla demonstrated the highest growth in receipts, with an 8% increase (ECCB 2014).
Between 2006 and 2012, the OECS’s share of total Caribbean receipts declined from 5.2%
to 4.8% (ECCB 2014; UNWTO 2009, 2010, 2013a, 2014a).
   In contrast to the Caribbean, the highest growth in tourist arrivals in the OECS (plus
Barbados)—in relative terms—came from Canada between 2012 and 2013. According to
Table 1.5, the country within the OECS (plus Barbados) that received the highest growth
in visits from Canadians was Grenada, with 27%. This was followed by the US, with 0.9%
growth in arrivals in the OECS (plus Barbados). Grenada also demonstrated the highest
growth in arrivals from the US at 16.1%. In contrast, arrivals to the OECS (plus Barbados)
from Europe decreased 1.4%, led by Grenada (−16.1%). Arrivals from the “Other” group
declined 0.7% in 2013.

   However, in absolute terms—as with the Caribbean—the United States (US) and Europe
maintained the largest share of tourist arrivals in the OECS (plus Barbados), with 34%
and 32% respectively. Table 1.5 shows that St. Lucia received the most tourists from this
market with 128.3 thousand arrivals. This market was closely followed by Europe (30.8%
share), with Barbados receiving the most tourists in 2013 (209.8 thousand). Barbados also
accounted for the largest share of arrivals from the “other” group, which held 24.1% of
total OECS (plus Barbados) arrivals, and from Canada, which sourced 10.8% of total OECS
(plus Barbados) tourists.
   Overall, 82.4% of total tourists9 to the OECS (plus Barbados) usually come for holidays
(Table 1.4) while the remaining tourists mainly come for business purposes Anguilla received
the most tourists travelling for leisure, with 95.6; followed by Antigua and Barbuda (95.1%)
and St. Kitts and Nevis (89.8%).
   The average stay of tourists from different parts of the world varies. As an example,
according to Figure 1.3, tourists to Barbados from the UK and Europe tend to stay longer
than tourists from the US.10

  Most definitions (e.g., from UNWTO and CTO) qualify a tourist as an over-night visitor and do
not necessarily take into account the actual purpose of visit: UNWTO 2014c; CTO 2014b.

   Typically, a multi-destination travel would require an ability to stay longer. As will be explained
later in the paper, a shorter duration of stay is not an inherent characteristic of the American
tourists, however. In other parts of the world (e.g., Greece), Americans do stay longer. This may
suggest that, as one tourist in the OECS interviewed noted, if there are “things to do,” Americans
will stay longer.

   The average room occupancy rate in the OECS is only slightly below that of the Caribbean.
The latest official data from the Caribbean Tourism Organization (CTO) on occupancy
rates at the country level dates from 2010. Table 1.4 shows that room occupancy rates in
the OECS in 2010 approximately averaged 58.1%, while the overall Caribbean averaged
61.1% (CTO 2014b). On a larger scale, it is worth noting that the Caribbean’s average
rate was slightly above that of the Americas for both 2011 and 2012 (see Table A.10)
(UNWTO 2013b).
   Out of the 140 countries assessed in the latest World Economic Forum (WEF) Tourism &
Travel (T&T) report, only one Caribbean country was ranked within the top 50: Barbados,
with an overall score of 4.88 out of 6.0.11 The latest edition of the WEF T&T Report assessed
the performance of 6 countries in the Caribbean: Puerto Rico ranked 52nd (4.36); Jamaica
ranked 67th (4.08); Trinidad and Tobago ranked 83rd (3.93), the Dominican Republic was
86th (3.88) and Haiti ranked 140th (2.59). Other countries in the OECS are not included
in the assessment. However, given that Barbados outperforms by far the OECS countries in
tourist arrivals12 and visitor expenditures13, it would not be far-fetched to assume that, if the
OECS countries were included in this scoring, they would have fallen below Barbados, and
most other Caribbean States (WEF 2013).
   Positive prospects for the US and European economies in 2014 should be beneficial for the
OECS. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects that the impetus for global growth
should come largely from recovery in advanced economies. The main markets for the OECS,
from which tourist arrivals usually originate from, namely the US and Europe, are expected to
grow respectively by about 2.8% and 1% in 2014 (IMF cited in CTO 2014b). The CTO expects
that tourist arrivals in the Caribbean will increase between 2% and 3% in 2014 (CTO 2014b).


1.4  Intra-Regional Travel Patterns and Costs in the OECS
Regarding intra-Caribbean travel, the OECS demonstrated the largest decline in arrival
flows amongst all sub-regions within the Caribbean region in recent years. Statistics for
2013 reveal that 2.1% more Caribbean residents traveled within the Caribbean than in
2012. However, Table 1.6 shows that the OECS is the only region where intra-regional arriv-
als declined in 2013, with a reduction of 3.4%. The “Other Caribbean” region dominated
growth in intra-regional arrivals, with a rise of 3.7% between 2012 and 2013, reaching a
total of 973.7 thousand arrivals.


11
   Measurement of the overall score was based on the performance of three main pillars: T&T
regulatory environment (including: policy rules and regulations; environmental sustainability; safety
and security; health and hygiene; prioritization of Travel & Tourism); business environment and
infrastructure (including: air transport infrastructure; ground transport infrastructure; tourism
infrastructure; ICT infrastructure; price competitiveness in the T&T industry; T&T human, cultural
and natural resources (including: human resources; affinity for Travel & Tourism; natural resources;
cultural resources).

   In absolute terms, the OECS received the smallest share of intra-regional travel within
the Caribbean, with a total of 273.0 thousand arrivals. Approximately 1.6 million regional
residents travelled within the Caribbean in 2013, and the highest share of this market
was received by the “Other Caribbean” region, with a total of 973.7 thousand arrivals.
This sub-region was followed by the “Other Commonwealth” region, which accounted for
347.6 thousand visits. Figure 1.4 shows that in 2012, within the region, Barbados receives
the most intra-Caribbean visitors, with 96,487, followed by Trinidad with 81,327 (2010).
   Contributing factors in the decline in intra-regional travel include the high costs and
logistical challenges of travel by air and the lack of any practical alternatives for moving
around the Caribbean. Within the OECS, scheduling and flight frequency are important
logistical challenges in an air travel market dominated by a monopoly (Briceno-Garmendia
et al. 2013). It frequently costs more to travel to a neighboring OECS destination than it
does to fly to Miami or beyond. Travelling intra-regionally also involves frequent stopovers,
sometimes overnight. To illustrate both points, in one recent case it cost US$850 to fly from
Grenada to St. Kitts return; involving an overnight stop in Antigua on the outward leg
(scheduled); and another on the return leg (unscheduled).
   Leeward Island Air Transport (LIAT) is the principle airline in the region,14 and
its fares are high by international comparison. Table 1.7 shows average air fares for


14
  Other airlines serving parts of the region are: Caribbean Airlines (National airline of Trinidad and
Tobago. In the OECS, it mainly serves St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia and Grenada); SVG
Air (based in St. Vincent and the Grenadines islands, service includes flights to Grenada, St. Vincent,
Dominica within the region); WINAIR (government-owned airline based in Sint Maarten. In the
OECS region, it mainly serves Anguilla, Antigua, Dominica and St. Kitts and Nevis); Mustique
Airways (an airline based in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, in the region, serving mainly Grenada
and Saint Lucia beyond St. Vincent and the Grenadines); and Conviasa (the largest airline in
República Bolivariana de Venezuela. In the OECS, it serves Grenada and Dominica).

mid-2014 are more than four times higher than an inter-European travel, on a per-mile
basis.15
   Table 1.8 shows the price breakdown for a LIAT ticket, involving flights to seven regional
destinations.16 It is important to note that the taxes on LIAT tickets are not significantly
higher than the taxes imposed on carriers in Europe and, based on information received
from stakeholders, there has been no significant increase in the taxes applied to LIAT tickets
over the last 5 years.17
   The region has seen a gradual increase in airfares over time. Table 1.9 shows that fares
have increased by an average of 40.4% from 2010 to 2014 on a representative list of intra-
regional routes.
   Based on the World Bank database, global crude oil prices rose by 31.7% between 2010
and 2013 (World Bank 2014a). For US domestic airlines, fuel accounts for about 35% of
operating expenses (Atlanta Journal Constitution 2012). LIAT’s fuel expenses will be higher due
to challenges of short distances and multiple take-offs and landings. Even if LIAT’s fuel costs
are 55% of total operating costs, then a 31.7% increase in fuel price would translate to a fare
increase of about 17%. This implies that the largest part of LIAT’s 40.4% fare increase between
2010 and 2014 was most likely due to non-fuel (and, as explained earlier, non-tax) cost increases.

   The Eastern Caribbean18 sub-regions have huge variations in connectivity. Table 1.10
shows the number of direct flights from and to various islands, as of October 2012.
   St. Lucia, Antigua, Barbados, and St. Vincent19 have the most outbound flights in the
region. St. Lucia benefits from its central location within the island chain. Figure 1.5 shows
the total number of daily outbound flights per day.

     The “Eastern Caribbean” includes the OECS plus Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago.

   While privatizing LIAT, or outsourcing its management and operations to the private
sector, or allowing fair competition in the airline industry are potential options for
improving inter-regional travel, based on previous experiences and information provided
by some stakeholders these are not politically feasible, at this time. The regional carrier
is in the midst of a major re-fleeting program, including a US$65 million loan from the
Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). The Caribbean has had only one low-cost airline:
REDjet. This new entrant to the regional aviation market was launched in 2011 by the
Barbadian entrepreneur Ralph “Bizzy” Williams. Although the airline had a short history
(it flew for only 9 months before its collapse in March 2012), its principals maintain that
the demise of the low-cost carrier was caused not for want of a travelling public, but due to
the regional governments supporting their own airline to the detriment of a private sector
entrant. (“Our bookings grew very strongly from 2,500 per month to 10,000 per month in
our last quarter”).20 Given the circumstances, a regional ferry system that would facilitate
inter-island travel is worth considering.

Multi-Destination Travel and a Regional Ferry System
Could Positively Impact Tourism in the OECS




2.1  Uniqueness of Each Island Provides a Basis for the
Development of Multi-Destination Travel
Each of the islands in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) region has
­
features that could make the experience of island-hopping or multi-destination travel
attractive. The tourism product is far from homogeneous across the OECS islands, with
­
distinctive physical and cultural attractions on each of the eight islands. Box 2.1 summarizes
the features found of each island.




  Box 2.1  Unique Features of the OECS

  Antigua and Barbuda
  Antigua is an established tourism destination; known as “the island of 365 beaches.” It is a popular
  yachting destination, with such events as the Antigua Classic Yacht Regatta (April 17–22) and the
  world famous Antigua Sailing Week (April 27–May2). The latter draws more than 1,500 sailors and
  some 5,000 spectators every year.a

  Barbados:
  Barbados is the leading tourism destination in the region, with 508,520 arrivals in 2013. Popular in
  the UK market, which accounted for the largest share (32.4%) of visitor arrivals in 2013,b Barbados
  caters to the high-end market with five-star properties like Sandy Lane, plus the low-budget seg-
  ment. This relatively flat island has a population density of 659 people per square kilometer, the
  world’s 12th highest. Barbados is more developed than the OECS, with a more diversified tourism of
  all the islands.

  Dominica:
  Dominica is known as “The Nature Isle” or the island with 365 rivers—both are equally valid. Dominica
  is the “other” Caribbean, definitely not your typical sun-sea-sand holiday. Dominica boasts a verdant,

                                                                                    box continues next page



                                                   23
24	   Driving Tourism in the Eastern Caribbean




  Box 2.1  Unique Features of the OECS (continued)

  mountainous interior, French-influenced language and culture, and communities of Carib or Kalinago
  peoples, the last of the indigenous inhabitants of the Caribbean. Dominica is becoming popular as
  an eco-tourism destination. In 2012, more than 4,000 French tourists holidaying in Martinique took
  short-stay excursions to Dominicab on the L’Express des Iles ferry for a few days before returning to
  Martinique and to France.

  Grenada:
  The southernmost of the Windward Islands, Grenada is “an enclave of quiet.” The hilly capital of
  St.  George’s is generally regarded as one of the world’s most beautiful harbor towns, featuring
  old  Georgian-era buildings with red clay tiled roofs and the picturesque Carenage, a working
  harbor and  popular tourist attraction. The town is surrounded by several well-preserved historic
  forts, remnants of long-forgotten European wars, and their spillover effects on Grenada and other
  Caribbean islands.

  St. Kitts and Nevis:
  This island consists of two islands separated by a two-mile strip of water. St. Kitts features flat
  rolling hills, gradually sweeping upward toward Mount Liamuiga, formerly known as Mount Misery,
  which at 3,792 feet is the highest mountain in the entire Eastern Caribbean. The well-preserved
  Brimstone Hill Fortress is the largest fort in the Eastern Caribbean. Across the water sits Nevis,
  originally called Nieves by Columbus after the clouds that perpetually engulf the towering Mount
  Nevis. Nevis features the Four Seasons hotel and golf club as well as several small intimate inns sitting
  at higher elevations.

  St. Lucia:
  St. Lucia is a lush volcanic island, world famous for the Pitons, a pair of almost vertical mountains
  descending into the sea, a drive-in volcano. The island is known amongst climbers. The northern end
  of the island is well developed, with hotels, villas, private homes, and the Rodney Bay Marina, the
  most popular yachting destination in the region. Like Dominica, St. Lucia has a French-influenced
  culture, and English is mixed with the local patois on the streets.

  St. Vincent and the Grenadines:
  The quintessential island-hopping, with the mainland and the seven inhabited islands of the
  Grenadines: Bequia, Mustique, Mayreau, Canouan, Palm, Petite St. Vincent, and Union Islands.
  Sitting within the Grenadines are the world famous Tobago Cays, a pristine horseshoe-shaped
  reef surrounded by small uninhabited islands. Not surprisingly, St. Vincent and the Grenadines is
  an extremely popular sailing destination, both for charter yachts and round-the-world cruisers on
  extended stays.

2.2  There Is Potential Demand for Multi-Destination Travel and a
Regional Ferry System
There is apparent demand for intra-region travel via a regional ferry system. According to
tour operators active in the region, a ferry that makes it easier for tourists to travel from
one island to another will have a positive impact on tourism trends in the region. As part of
this paper, the World Bank Group team carried out a survey of leading tour operators in the
Caribbean (appendix C). The findings include:

	   1)	 About 90% of tour operators say that clients often inquire about multi-destination
        holidays to the Eastern Caribbean.
	   2)	 Most people who are interested in multi-destination holidays (84%) are discouraged
        from multi-destination holidays because of the high cost of regional air travel.
	   3)	 All respondents believe that a well-run ferry service could significantly increase
        the attractiveness of the Eastern Caribbean Region as a whole. The large majority
        (70%) feel a ferry service could increase the overall flow of international tourists to
        the Eastern Caribbean by more than 5% over time; 25% feel the increase would be
        less than 5%.

   A truly regional ferry system would also be welcomed by local residents. As it relates to
local residents of the islands, the team also carried out a survey of travel agents within the
region, regarding intra-region travel.1 The findings include:

	   1)	 Most (53%) travel agents book more than 50 trips a month within the Eastern
        Caribbean2 region.
	   2)	 The most common reason for travel within the Caribbean is visiting friends and
        relatives —at 59%, followed by business travel at 29%.
        ­
	   3)	 Most travel agents (81%) say that their clients frequently inquire about traveling
        around the Eastern Caribbean by ferry. However, the actual number of travelers
        who would be interested in a ferry could be higher; many travelers within the region
        (mainly local residents) would not bother to ask their travel agents about ferry
        service because they know it doesn’t exist.
        ­
	   4)	 Finally, travel agents feel a ferry service could materially increase the flow of tourists
        within the region. A large majority of respondents (77%) feel that a regional ferry
        service could increase the number of tourists by more than 10% over time; 23% feel
        the increase would be between zero and 10%.




1
  While these surveys of tour operators and travel agents are encouraging, further development of
a ferry project will require more extensive market research. This would include actual surveys of
tourists visiting the main destinations within the region as well as surveys of Eastern Caribbean
residents regarding their views about traveling by ferry, voyage preferences, willingness to pay, etc.
2
  The OECS plus Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago.
26	    Driving Tourism in the Eastern Caribbean



   Tourists could provide a high level of demand for a ferry service. In 2013, 1.5 million
tourists visited the OECS.3 In addition, 82.4% of all OECS (plus Barbados) tourist arrivals
are for holidays (CTO 2010c). Tour operators and agents surveyed estimate that the flow
of tourists who visit the region for leisure could increase between 5 and 10 percent, in the
presence of a regional ferry.4 This adds up to a significant number of potential additional
tourists in the region.
   Anecdotal information collected in preparation of this report suggests there is a large
untapped demand among local residents for a regional ferry system. The groups and events
that could generate ferry demand include:

	     1)	 Cricket tours and tournaments are a major source of tourists, well-suited to ferry
          travel. When the English cricket team plays overseas, its organized fan club, known
          as the “Barmy Army,” will religiously follow the team from island to island. With
          more than 5,000 members,5 the Barmy Army brings together like-minded cricket
          fans from around the world to enjoy the game and the international camarade-
          rie surrounding it. Among the Barmy Army and other cricketing nations such
          as Australia, cricket tours to the West Indies are particularly popular because of its
          carnival atmosphere and, world-class cricket matches. International tournaments
          and matches usually take place almost all year around.6 In 2014, Although reliable
          statistics on the number of cricket fans attracted to the region are not available,
          stakeholders from across the region reported that a significant impact of cricket on
          regional tourism—but it has the potential to be much bigger.
	     2)	 In addition to international cricket, there is now the Caribbean Professional League
          (CPL).7 In 2014, this tournament will take place between July 11 and August 17,
          featuring the biggest names in global cricket and a total of 31 cricket matches, 25 of
          which will be played in the OECS and Barbados. This, plus other cricket tours and
          tournaments would provide excellent opportunities for charter ferry services because
          the games are near to each other, without time gaps in between. The CPL attracts
          thousands of visitors, both local and overseas.
	     3)	 Moreover annual music festivals and carnivals attract large amounts of visitors from
          other Caribbean islands. Stakeholders reported that, during times of these special events,
          all flights into and out of the respective islands become fully booked. Box 2.1 shows
          some of the carnivals and festivals that occur throughout the year within the Eastern
          Caribbean region, all of which draw thousands of regional and overseas visitors.


3
  Typically, a multi-destination travel would require an ability to stay longer. As will be explained
later in the paper, a shorter duration of stay is not an inherent characteristic of the American tourists,
however. In other parts of the world (e.g., Greece), Americans do stay longer. This may suggest that,
as one tourist in the OECS interviewed noted, if there are “things to do,” Americans will stay longer.
4
  However, this preliminary analysis cannot take the place of a robust market sounding, before firm
decisions could be contemplated on a ferry project. This would include extensive surveys of tourists,
perhaps at arriving airports, in each of the main destinations within the region.

	     4)	 In addition to local students, there are 18 international universities in the Eastern
          Caribbean. Interviews with some of these students demonstrate their willingness
          to make the most of their limited stays in the Caribbean; based on information
          provided to the dean of one of the universities in Grenada, these students would
          welcome a regional ferry system that would allow them to travel more easily (and
          cheaply) within the region. Many would like to have the ability to rent a car and
          visit the different islands that way. This option would only be possible if there is a
          regional ferry system that would allow cars to get on and off.

   Recent Caribbean experience has shown that travelers (both residents and tourists) will use
a regional ferry system when it exists. For example, more than 4,000 French tourists visiting
Martinique take L’Express des Iles ferry to Dominica each year. Arrivals to Dominica from
Guadeloupe and Martinique increased from 17,575 in 2007 to 23,011 in 2012—all of whom
traveled by ferry.8 Figure 2.1 shows the growth of visitor arrivals to Dominica from Martinique
and Guadeloupe, as well as tourists from France who were on holiday in the French territories.


2.3  A Regional Ferry System Is Not New to the Region
A regional ferry system is not a new concept to the Caribbean region. In the 1990s, a mixed
cargo/passenger ship called the M/V Windward plied a regular route between Barbados,
St. Vincent, Trinidad, and Isla Margarita in República Bolivariana de Venezuela, carrying a
mixture of excursionists, tourists, and hucksters (small traders who accompany their goods
from island to island). Figure 2.2 shows that from its inception in 1992, the Windward
quickly built up a passenger, carrying on average 13,000 passengers a year from 1993 to
1998. In 1999, the vessel was sold after reaching the end of its economic and technical life.

   The M/V Windward also made inroads into the regional cargo market. Figure 2.3 shows
that cargo tonnage rose steadily through its years of operation.
   Currently, 11 ferry companies operate in the Eastern Caribbean, with 21 vessels with a

L’Express des Iles and the much smaller Twin Island Ferry Services.9 L’Express des Iles successfully
operates between the French West Indies, Dominica and St. Lucia but only covers a small part of
the regional market. A snapshot of the existing ferry systems operating in the region is attached
as appendix B.

2.4  Investor Interest for a Regional Ferry System Exists
The region has seen many ferry project concepts by potentially interested investors come
and go. The most recent are:

   Caribbean Rose: In August 2008, a new ferry service was announced to commence
	1)	
   service in that year. It was to originate in Trinidad. It was believed that the ferry had
   arrived from Canada to be outfitted and would travel a route to include St. Lucia,
   St. Vincent and Barbados. However nothing further was heard of this project.
   Bedy Lines Limited: In 2010, this Grenada-based project for a regional ferry s

   planned to acquire a large vessel with accommodation for 900 passengers, 175 motor
   vehicles and cargo. The plan was to connect the islands of Barbados, St. Lucia, Trinidad,
   Grenada and St. Vincent with daily services. However, port authorities in the region ruled
   that the vessels, ex-Staten Island ferries, were unsuited to Caribbean marine conditions.

 The most sustainable international service involves the French islands of Martinique and
Guadeloupe, which flank Dominica. Because of strong cultural ties between St. Lucia and Martinique,
the carrier l ’Express des Iles connects St. Lucia, Martinique, Dominica, and Guadeloupe. Beyond this,
international services can only be found between St. Kitt’s and Antigua, Antigua and Montserrat, and
Montserrat and St. Kitts. The remaining services are all domestic, with ferries connecting St. Kitts with
Nevis, Grenada with Carriacou and Petit Martinique, and St. Vincent with the Grenadines.

   Fast Caribbean Ltd: In September 2010 Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Kamla
	3)	
   Persad-Bissessar announced the government’s intention to launch a ferry service
   linking Trinidad and the Eastern Caribbean, and invited proposals from suitable
   investors. Five companies responded and Fast Ferry Caribbean Ltd was selected.
   This Barbados-based consortium was said to be chartering a 112-meter wave pierc-
   ing catamaran similar to those operating on the Trinidad to Tobago route. However
   the project reportedly failed to secure the subsidies needed to make it succeed.

   Caribbean and República Bolivariana de Venezuela. This is not a fast ferry project
   and would involve longer transit times, usually overnight.

   a fast ferry service among the Eastern Caribbean islands. Two fast catamaran-type
   ferries are needed, with a capacity of about 200 passengers as well as 10–15 vehicles.

   One of the key reasons why all these and other such projects have failed to launch is because
of a lack of coordination among governments at regional level. Most projects originate
from unsolicited proposals to one government, or from random investors approaching
individual governments; there has been no coordinated regional ferry project involving
all the governments. In addition, the potential regional ferry system faces the challenge of
untried routes, high operating costs and limited ability to pay on the part of the travelling
public. None of the participating governments have thus far been willing to commit subsidy
funds to a regional ferry project.

2.5  Challenges Facing a Regional Ferry Project and Island-Hopping
While many people and groups would welcome ferry service, such a project would face
several major challenges that, if not removed, will hamper this approach’s success. Aside
from the lack of coordination among governments at regional level mentioned above, other
challenges include:
   Outdated and cumbersome regulations and restrictions. Throughout the region, the
movement of people and goods is hampered by complex, time-consuming, and expensive
regulations. They were implemented decades ago and have not been modernized to allow for
smoother passage. For example, although a Grenadian ferry operates between Grenada and
Carriacou, and Vincentian ferries operate from St. Vincent to Union Island, there is no ferry
service across the marine boundary between Union Island and Carriacou—a distance of two
miles. Both ferry operators reported that they do not cross boundaries because of the hassles
and high costs involved. As reported by the owner of the high-speed ferry “Jaden Sun,” it can
cost up to US$2,000 just to pay clearance, port, Customs and agency fees. During the 2007
Cricket World Cup, all Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries enacted the “Sunset
Legislation” to ease passage from one CARICOM country to the other. Once visitors had
cleared into one participating country, they did not need to clear into succeeding CARICOM
countries; the airline would simply notify the authorities via their passenger lists. According
to all stakeholders involved, the system worked well; however, all countries went back to the
old cumbersome methods immediately after the end of the 2007 Cricket World Cup. If these
or similar regulations were implemented in a regional manner, they could make inter-island
	                                                 Driving Tourism in the Eastern Caribbean	       31



travel less cumbersome, leading to a positive impact on tourism. A ferry project, by its very
nature, requires close collaboration between the governments of participating countries,
which must agree on a common set of regulations, incentives, and other conditions for
private sector ferry companies operating internationally. The OECS and CARICOM are
working on several initiatives designed to simplify and harmonize travel procedures, but it
is unclear when those efforts will bear fruit and whether they will be sufficient.
   Countries in the region do not recognize the temporary importation of vehicles. They require
the “importer” to pay a fee of up to 6% of the vehicle’s value, plus a bond and other expenses
and hassles. This makes it difficult for tourists to travel by car from one island to another. It
also hampers the movement of cargo from one island to another because goods need to be off-
loaded onto a boat and then to another vehicle at the destination, increasing costs.
   Many customs and immigration agencies operate according to limited timetables, forcing
arriving vessels to wait or pay overtime charges. For example, according to tourists interviewed
for the preparation of this report, who had been sailing, arriving after 4 p.m. would cause
significant delays because there are no customs agents available on some islands at that time.
Additional fees were needed to be paid to bring a customs agent after-hours. Whereas visiting
yachts would be able to wait until the following day to clear in, ferries operating on tight
schedules do not have that luxury, and therefore have to incur overtime costs.
   Shore-based infrastructure is inadequate—in some instances cases, non-existent. Virtually
all countries would need to invest heavily in shore-based infrastructure, such as ferry
terminals, docks, and facilities for fast processing of passengers. One solution suggested by
some of the Port Authorities was for the ferry to use existing cruise ship terminals in each
island; however, this could involve scheduling difficulties during the cruise-ship season from
October to April, which would need to be taken into account. In addition, some islands do
not have facilities of offloading cargo and people at the same location, creating logistical
difficulties for any ferry that would carry both.
   There has been no coordination at a regional level to open the project for a regional ferry
system to public bidding, following transparent and clear procurement rules. As mentioned
earlier, the proposals that have been floating in the region have been the result of random
discussions between individual investors and individual governments, rather than a public and
open, regional procurement process. This has contributed significantly to none of the projects
getting off the ground. For a ferry system to succeed, a concerted regional effort will be required.
The governments of the region should, first, undertake an open and transparent procurement
effort for the project, instead of one-on-one discussions with random investors by individual
governments. This process would allow some of the existing ferry operators in the region to bid
and compete fairly in the process as well. Towards this end, a regional body or entity should
undertake the responsibility to call for proposals and to have a proper mechanism to evaluate
the proposals. Then, should subsidies be required,10 a commitment from all the governments in
the region is important.11 While this issue has not been assessed thoroughly in this paper (and

  This needs to be subject to a separate feasibility study for the regional ferry system.

developed as part of a feasibility assessment of a regional ferry system.

the challenges facing LIAT may have other causes), based on anecdotal information collected,
some stakeholders in the region blamed the challenges of LIAT in the failure of all governments
in the region to provide the necessary financial support, and for some countries to be receiving
a free-ride at the expense of those countries who finance LIAT. Should subsidies be required for
the regional ferry system (which, as explained in the paper, even in the successful ferry systems
like Greece they are), it is important to avoid the free-ride problem.
   Virtually all vessel operating costs are abnormally high in the Caribbean. Except in
Trinidad and Tobago, fuel (bunker) costs are among the highest in the world. There are
no maritime training schools in the OECS, so ship operators must send their ratings to
maritime training in either Trinidad or Jamaica at considerable expense. In addition, spare
parts and specialist services have to be brought in from abroad, adding transport expenses
and taxes. Potential ferry operators have also, so far, been unable to find suitable vessels at
an economic price.
   Activities and entertainment for tourists outside of resorts is limited in OECS countries.
For multi-destination travel to be interesting, improving the experience of tourists at each
destination is also essential.12 According to a 2013 survey,13 amongst tourists, cultural
heritage and culinary activities ranked much higher in importance than the traditional
beach and watersports activities typically associated with the Caribbean. A relatively high
proportion of respondents demonstrated interest in shopping opportunities, especially
amongst females, respondents from the UK, Canada and the Caribbean. According to
some tourists interviewed during the data collection phase of this report, there are no
true shopping areas geared toward tourists and not many attractive onshore activities
(no historical places to visit, no interesting culinary experiences, not a large option of
outdoors activities, etc.). In addition, many tourists said shops and services were often
closed (such as on Saturday afternoons and Sundays), and they had concerns about the
quality of services that they would receive onshore. A separate study would be important
for identifying how service quality and tourist experience could improve (as well as
the productivity of the sector), making the OECS a more attractive destination and to
encouraging tourists to visit multiple islands.

Preliminary Data for Assessing the Feasibility of a
Regional Ferry System




3.1  Regional Ferry at Work: Greek Case-Study
At first glance, Greece and the Eastern Caribbean have certain similarities and significant
differences. They both consist of many islands separated by relatively short distances by sea,
with a heavy reliance on tourism. In the Greek islands, the average distance of the five most
popular ferry routes is about 140 nautical miles1 In the Eastern Caribbean, the average dis-
tance of ferry routes from St. Lucia to Grenada and Barbados is about 91 miles.2 However,
Greece receives approximately 17 million visitor arrivals a year, compared to approximately
1 million in the OECS and about 3.3 million for the broader Eastern Caribbean region.
Greece is closer to Europe—but the Caribbean region has the US market nearby. Greek
islands do not have to deal with borders.
   The number of people who travel the Greek islands via ferries suggests demand for
“island-hopping” is strong.3 The Greek ferry system has approximately 60 vessels, multiple
service providers, and daily trips to most islands (up to 10–12 hours overnight). Prices in
the Greek ferry system range from a30–a130 per person. In addition to the 17 million
visitors, the system also transports 2 million cars and 500,000 trucks per year (Figure 3.1),
generating an annual turnover of about a400–a500 (XRTC Consultants 2010).
   Despite the large numbers of passengers the Greek ferry industry carries each year,
government subsidies are required to keep the fleet afloat. Figure 3.2 shows that government
subsidies to the Greek ferry industry rose from a27.6 million in 2005 to a40 million by
2010. By 2012, the subsidy was reported to have grown to a80 million (Lloyd’s List 2012).
   In Greece, an extensive domestic airline sector exists alongside the ferry industry. Table 3.1
shows that 75% of domestic inter-island passenger traffic in the Greek islands is by ferry,
compared to only 25% by air (Rigas 2009).

   Average Greek ferry fares are about 35% lower than the applicable airfares (Table 3.2).

of origin of tourists visiting the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and
Greece are different (Table 3.3),5 the average duration of tourists in the OECS is slightly
higher, with 10.3 days (Table 1.4).

concern regarding any multi-destination tourism strategy in the OECS region is that most
visitors are Americans, and they generally have a shorter duration of stay (Figure 1.3 shows
an example of Barbados6). This assumption, however, may not necessarily be valid: the
shorter duration of stay is not an inherent characteristic of American travelers. In Greece,
where there are many tourist attractions and activities, for example, the duration of stay of
American tourists has usually been above the average 9.2 days (Figure 3.3). In other words,
longer durations of stay and island-hopping could very well be feasible, even if Americans
are the dominant market providing tourists to the OECS region.

3.2  A Viable Cross-Borders Ferry System: The Baltic Sea Case Study
The Baltic Sea provides an interesting case study where ferry is a widespread mode of
transport, not only domestically as in the case of Greece but also across borders (Map 3.1).
­
Every year, more than 130 million passengers travel by ship in the European member states
around the Sea (2009 data, ESaTDOR 2013a). For many countries in the region such as
Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden, maritime passenger transport is of particular impor-
tance considering the size of their national population. Estonia for example, has 9.8 passengers
per inhabitant in 2013 while sea transport generally accounts for more than 70% of all
their passengers in international traffic.7 The ferry system also plays an important role in
transporting vehicles. In 2006, 13.4 million registered cars, or 15% of the passenger vol-
­
ume, passed through the region’s ports.
   The Baltic Sea provides interesting lessons relevant for the functioning of a regional
system in the Eastern Caribbean, on the importance of the simplification of border-crossing
procedures. Simplification of border-crossing procedures following the EU accession of four
countries in 2003 and their subsequent implementation of the Schengen Agreement in 2007
might have contributed to a stable increase in ferry and tourism demand. Figure 3.4 shows
an example of the number of passengers in international traffic through Estonia’s ports
between 2000 and 2013. It shows a clear increasing trend in both international inflows and
outflows through the country since their Schengen implementation in 2007. More generally,
the ease of access associated with EU membership is considered to have at least partially
contributed to an increase in tourism demand in the region (Jarvis and Kallas 2008; Hall,
Smith, and Marciszewska 2006).

   Due to concentrated demand, ferry services in the Baltic Sea are populated by
commercially viable carriers. In 2011, 30 ferry companies connect 90 routes and 38 ports
in the region. On many routes with high demand such as Tallin-Helsinki, Sassnitz-Ronne,
Ystad-S ´winoujs´cie and Trelleborg-Rostock, connection is competed among several carriers
(Wiskulski and Bar-Kolelis 2012).
   At the same time, there are various Public Obligation Services (PSO) routes that are
unprofitable and require state subsidies. In most cases, PSO routes are domestic as they are
essential services by nature. However, subsidies might also be provided on international
routes. For example, A PSO route between Finland and Sweden exists on the basis that it
provides a vital link between Finland and Sweden, and would not have been commercially
viable without subsidies. Funding for the service comes primarily from the Finnish
Government, while some districts in Sweden also contribute to the financing of the contract
(Transport Research Institute 2010).
   Experience of EU countries in public tendering of PSO ferry services and subsidy schemes
offers useful lessons to cases where the market is unable or unwilling to provide an adequate
service on a given route. In Denmark for example, tendering has moved from a “least
cost” method towards multi-criteria evaluation in order to identify the economically most
advantageous bid, reflecting the need to consider service quality as well as cost. In the case
Greece, the profitable routes are in practice required to cross-subsidy unprofitable routes
through a customer surcharge, which might have consequences on allocative efficiency.
Norway appears to be a successful case where competitive tendering of individual routes
has achieved both cost efficiency as well as service quality (Baird and Wilmsmeier 2011).
Nevertheless, there are also tradeoffs in terms of economies of scale that can be achieved with
bidding for bundles of routes. Table 3.4 below summarizes several strengths and weaknesses
associated with different approaches.

3.3  Costs and Services Associated with Ferry Travel in
the OECS Region
As mentioned earlier, 11 existing ferry companies operate in the Eastern Caribbean region.
Table 3.5 shows that seven of the eleven employ the new breed of catamaran-type fast ­  ferries;
with average speeds of 20 knots and upwards. The other four operate slower traditional
vessels (average speeds 12–15 knots). However, none of the ferries provides a service at a
regional level (due to obstacles that will be discussed in the next section of the paper).
   There is a wide disparity in the types of ferry services in the Eastern Caribbean region—
and in fares charged. Table 3.6 shows the fares by the various ferry operators in the region.
When expressed as a cost per mile, ferry fares range from a low of only 9 US cents per
mile on the highly subsidized Trinidad–Tobago Ro-Ro ferry service to $2.71 per mile from
St. Lucia to Martinique on the L’Express des Iles fast ferry. Figure 3.5 shows the wide
disparity in ferry fares per nautical mile in the Eastern Caribbean. On the slower traditional
ferries, passengers pay in higher transit times. As we will explore later in the section, fast
ferry operator face much higher operating costs than do operators of slower vessels.
   Overall, the Eastern Caribbean ferries’ average cost is US$1.06per nautical mile
(Figure 3.6). This works out to about 57 percent of the average cost per mile travelled on
Leeward Island Air Transport’s (LIAT’s) Eastern Caribbean routes in May 2014 (Table 3.7).

Caribbean ferry fares are significantly higher than Greek fares. Table 3.8 shows that Greek
ferries charge an average of US$0.50 per mile travelled. These ferry fares are less than half
the average fares (US$1.06) in the Eastern Caribbean.10However, it must be noted that the
Greek ferry system operates at a much higher scale than in the Caribbean; carrying around
18 million passengers per year. Consequently, Greek ferry vessels are several times larger
than their Caribbean counterparts, and therefore reap significant economies of scale.11

   The average capacity of a sample of Greek ferries is about 1,400 passengers and 640 cars; versus
the Caribbean ferry industry, which has an average vessel capacity of only 279 passengers.

   Ferry costs per mile are influenced by voyage distance (Figure 3.6). For example, port charges,
clearance, and agency fees can total up to US$2,000 per entry,12 whether the vessel has travelled
10 or 100 miles from its port of embarkation. With average distances of less than 40 miles per
segment, ferries will face challenges in offering an attractive per mile tariff; because fixed port
charges account for a higher percentage of total costs than they do on longer voyages.
   It is only on the longer voyage segments that fares fall to levels of about US$1 per mile or
lower. The one exception is the Osprey Ferry in Grenada, which has a fare of US$0.91 per mile
on a voyage of only 34 nautical miles. A similar pattern is found in the Greek ferry industry.
Figure 3.7 shows that Greek ferry fares per mile travelled decreases as voyage distance increases.
   Prices are also affected by speed. The traditional slower ferries charge fares that are
significantly lower than fast ferries (Tables 3.7 and 3.8 above); however you pay for it in
higher transit times (for the time of travel associated with different vessel speeds, please see
appendix F). In fact, the average fare charged by the Eastern Caribbean fast ferry operators
is about 70% of the average cost per mile of a LIAT ticket in 2014 (Table 3.7). This is
similar to the pattern found in the Greek ferry industry.13 Figure 3.8 shows that fares per
mile increase in direct proportion to vessel speeds.

  Some of the justifications for why faster ferries charge higher fares are that fast ferries typically do not
carry as many passengers, so cost per passenger becomes higher (see appendix F). In addition, the original
cost of the boat is, often, higher, due to the expensive light materials used to allow for faster speed.

   To appreciate the real “cost of speed,” the following are average Greek ferry fares at
different vessel speeds14:

       •	 At average 14.1 knots; fare = US$0.37 per nautical mile

       •	 At average 22.4 knots, fare = US$0.66 per nautical mile

   In fact, there seems to be a global trend towards slower ferries. With virtually the world’s
entire ferry fleet forced to switch from low sulfur fuel to diesel due to International Maritime
Organization (IMO) efforts to curb pollution, the choice for operators is now one of raising
fares or reducing transit speeds by half. Though global average operating speeds were
only 11 mph to begin with, most companies have chosen to reduce this by half (5.5 mph),
doubling transit times for commuters and tourists alike (Sea Phantom International n.d.).
Indeed, globally, convention ferries (as opposed to fast ferries) are more in demand. Although
conventional ferries constitute 24% of the total number of vessels globally, they account for
54% of passengers carried. Cruise vessels constitute 9% of the total number, but 23% of
the passengers. The fast ferries have 37% of the number of vessels but only 22% of the
passengers.
   Given the global trends, the impact of speed on fares, and the unique features of the OECS
region discussed above, conventional ferries may be an appropriate model for the region
(for the impact of speed on time of travel and costs, please see appendix F). Such ferries
could become part of the tourism experience for international tourists, while providing a
cheaper means of getting from point A to point B for local residents. The ferry type and its
appropriate speed need to be looked at through a separate feasibility study for the regional

ferry system, which will determine the best speed for the ferry, given the distances, input
prices, potential volume of travel, as well as other factors, such as the conditions of the
waters through which the vessels travel.

3.4  Cargo and Its Movement in the OECS
At a global level, the ferry market remains slightly behind the airline industry in the num-
ber of passengers carried annually. Table 3.9 shows that in 2010, the worldwide ferry
industry carried 2.06 million passengers, compared with the airline industry’s 2.52 million
(Sea Phantom International n.d.). The global ferry market in 2012 is estimated to be worth
over US$15 billion.15 In 2007, the average numbers of passengers and vehicles carried per
trip were as follows (The Cornell Group 2008):

      •	 Passengers: 251;

      •	 Cars: 33.6;

      •	 Trucks: 5.4;

      •	 Buses: 0.1.

   In fact, worldwide vehicular traffic has been growing at a faster rate (6% per annum),
versus about 2% per annum for passengers. Virtually all cargo on ferries is carried by trucks
and trailers, driven onto Ro-Ro (Roll-on Roll-off) vessels16; which adds substantially to
ferry profitability.

   In terms of the movement of goods in the OECS, the vast majority of the region’s imports
originate from extra-regional sources, transported in bulk or containerized vessels. All countries
of the region have trade imbalances, importing up to three or four times of their exports. This
creates inefficiencies and high costs because ships return with empty containers. The ratio of
imports to exports in the main shipping states of the OECS are (tonnages) (GOPA 2009):

       •	 Dominica: 5–1;

       •	 Grenada: 10–1;

       •	 St. Lucia: 5–1;

       •	 St. Vincent: 4–1

   Other than a few established intra-regional trade routes, trade and traffic within and
between the islands of the OECS is very limited (Tables 3.11 and 3.12). Intra-regional
cargo volumes are very small (usually less than a container load (LCL) carried in
informal “schooners”17), and many of the countries produce similar products (agriculture,

and Ajagunna 2012; AVRA 2011). These four studies agree on the principal features and
challenges facing Eastern Caribbean trade and shipping:

       •	 Small volumes of inter-regional trade; very little of which is containerized.

       •	 Skewed pattern of cargo movements, with all of the islands importing multiples of
          what they export. For example, St. Vincent and the Grenadines imported 48,530
          tons from the Eastern Caribbean region in 2009 (chiefly from Trinidad and Barbados);
          yet it exported only 6,644 tons to the region.

       •	 High freight tariffs due to small volumes and imbalanced freight traffic.

       •	 Most of the Eastern Caribbean’s intra-regional traffic is carried small break-bulk
          vessels or “schooners.”
          ­

       •	 Most of the schooners are owned by small operators, frequently the captains, who
          operate in an unscheduled manner, pursuing opportunities as they arise.

   Given the small volume of trade within the OECS, there is considerable excess number of
ships operating within the region. According to the findings of one study: “With the present
underutilization of the existing fleet, there is clearly no need to expand existing transport
capacity” (GOPA 2009).18

   However, there is space for improvements in the processes of the existing transport system.
In particular, some issues that stakeholders believe need to be considered are: innovation in
the type of containers that would be better tailored to small trade volumes of the region;
ensuring that current operating vessels are well-adapted to carry small cargo volumes; better
harmonization in the scheduling and integration of the operating vessels.
   Further study will be needed to determine: how the current cargo ships system could be
improved and to what extent it could be integrated with a new regional ferry system; whether
a new regional ferry system would be needed to facilitate the movement of goods; and
how/whether a new regional ferry system could contribute to the strengthening of linkages
between tourism and agribusiness at a regional level. This could be studied further within
the context of a more detailed feasibility study for a regional ferry system. On the one hand,
as mentioned earlier, the volume of trade is currently very low, and there is an over-supply
of cargo ships in the region. On the other hand, linkages between tourism and agribusiness
are generally weak in the OECS region, with opportunities for improvement. Based on a
2008 study (World Bank 2008), 89% of meat, 81% of dairy products, and 41% of fruits
and vegetables consumed by the region’s tourism sector are imported. The said report
identifies fruits and vegetables as the areas with the strongest potential for deeper linkages
with the tourism sector. According to the mentioned study, the transportation component
of these products is about half of their imported value, so OECS producers could be price
competitive. However, domestic markets can be saturated quickly, and attention must be
paid to expanding access to regional markets. Improved access will require better intra-
regional connectivity for the transport of goods. In fact, the mentioned study concludes
the lack of timely, effective shipping (including refrigerated capacity) contributes to the
weak development of intra-regional trade as well as to weak linkages between tourism and
agriculture.19 Understanding how and whether a regional ferry system with an equipped
fleet that would operate in a more efficient, scheduled and reliable manner would help in
addressing these issues, or whether the existing fleet of cargo ships could be better utilized,
need to be subject of a separate analysis, and should be taken into account in the feasibility
assessment for the regional ferry system.

  Some of the issues encountered when supplying the tourism sector, discussed in a 2014
Agro-Tourism Meeting (OECS Secretariat 2014) include:
­
•	 Lack of information on demand—quantity needed, quality standards, and prices offered;
•	 Spot market model—hotels require produce on demand rather than ordering in advance to allow
   time to plan production;
•	 Transportation challenge for delivery within the OECS region (less than container loads, LCLs);
•	 Late payment—over 90 days in some instances;
•	 Broader issues—sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures to manage pests and diseases;
•	 Manufacturers face a challenge of seasonality in raw material supplies;
•	 International chefs are reluctant to use local produce in their menus;
•	 Politics of the corporate hospitality industry;
•	 Hotels being price-led, making local products price-uncompetitive;
•	 Product returns—hotels return many products to farmers (e.g., due to lack of storage).

3.5  Competitive Effects of a Stay-Over Tourism Strategy versus
Cruise-Based Tourism20
Competition effect between stay-over tourism and the cruise industry is limited, as they
serve different market segments. Existing data on travelers’ profiles for the Caribbean and
elsewhere suggest that cruisers and stay-over tourists have significant differences in key
characteristics such as age, income, and employment status. Cruisers are typically older,
have higher median household income and are more likely to be retired. For example, survey
data in 2011 on a sample of US customers reveal that cruisers have a median age of 47, with
a median household income of $97,000 and are 20% likely to be retired. In contrast, non-
cruiser vacationers are relatively younger with a median age of 46, median household income
of $75,000 and only 15% likely to be retired (Cruise Lines International Association—CLIA
2011). Moreover, monthly data on tourist flows show that the cruise and stay-over markets
exhibit different seasonality patterns (Figure 3.9). Stay-over tourist flows fluctuate year-
round and peak during both summer and winter months. In contrast, cruisers tend to arrive
in the winter months around December-March and stay away during May-October.
   Empirically, there is evidence of both complementary and substitution effects between
cruise and stay-over tourism in the OECS. Econometric analysis on aggregate tourism flow
data from 1985–2004 (Bresson and Logossah 2008)21 reveals that there is large heterogeneity
in the interacting effects between stay-over tourism flows and cruise tourism flows across the
Caribbean. Nevertheless, the OECS countries in general are less likely to see crowding out in

   A regional ferry will be used by stay-over visitors as opposed to cruise passengers. Therefore,
a regional ferry would be more closely linked to a stay-over based tourism strategy rather than a
cruise-based strategy. Thus, understanding the competition effects between stay-over and cruise
tourism would be important.
21
   The study also suggests a stronger trend toward crowding out effects in the more recent period.

this period (Figure 3.10). In fact, Grenada experienced a strong complementary relationship
between the two types of tourist flows.
   If the cross-elasticities between the two types of tourism stay either positive or slightly
negative (less than one) as the existing estimates suggest, substitution of cruise for stay-over
tourists would likely result in a net positive impact on the economy. In the Caribbean, the
oligopolistic cruise tourism industry has significant more bargaining power than individual
governments and port authorities and has utilized its position to force destination countries
to compete (Bresson 2009). This asymmetric market power means the profit margins for
cruise destination countries are potentially minimized.


3.6  Competitive Effects of a Regional Ferry System:
Sea Travel vis-à-vis Air Travel
Applying international perspectives to the OECS suggests there may be a market for
OECS tourism that has remained untapped due to the unavailability of a regional ferry
system. Based on the experience of Greece, and the available literature (Rigas 2009), sea
­
and air travel serve two different market segments, with little competition between them.
According to a study of Greek tourists, travelling by ferry from one island to another (i.e.,
island-hopping) may not be a matter of passengers’ nationality but of other characteristics,
such as age and nature of tourism. For example, sea travel tends to be preferred by group
travelers and younger tourists, probably due to the lower fares. In contrast, passengers
traveling by air tend to fall in the middle-age and higher-income categories. They also travel
in groups but in lower percentages and less frequently than those opting for boats.
   In addition, there is the ability to take a vehicle onto a ferry, something air travel does not
provide. In fact, the ability to take motor vehicles into a ferry is key for those who travel via
ferry, and one of the main reasons for why many would not switch to air travel at any cost.

According to the available statistics, only 30% of the ferry passengers globally are classified
as Walk Ons—passengers traveling without vehicles (Sea Phantom International n.d.).
Moreover, a VisitScotland commissioned research on the island-hopping market showed
that around two-thirds of island-hoppers predominantly used ferries and took a vehicle.
This underlines the importance of excellent ferry connections to this market segment.22
   There is some cross-elasticity of demand between air and sea travel (Figures 3.11 and 3.12) only
with significant changes in price and trip durations. Based on the previously mentioned study in
Greece, a small change in trip duration would not affect air demand significantly. It would take
a reduction in trip duration of more than 30% for air passengers to consider taking the boat.
An important segment of demand (28%) does not consider traveling by boat an alternative, no
matter what the trip duration. For those who travel via sea, a small reduction in airfares would
have little impact on boat demand; however, a reduction in prices of more than 30% would have
an important impact in demand for sea travel (more than 60%). On the other hand, almost a
third of boat passengers (27%) would not shift modes from sea to air under any circumstances.

   While there is not a lot of information available in the OECS to assess the competitive
effects of a regional ferry system on LIAT, limited past experience suggests that substitution
effect might be small as there is still significant unfulfilled demand for air and ferry travel
in these markets. When L’Express des Isles opened a new ferry service in 2011 between
Dominica and St. Lucia (Dominica News 2011), the estimated seats on LIAT on the same
route still more than doubled from 3,003 to 7,371 between 2011 and 2012.23
   Nevertheless, a regional ferry could open up competition in the market for local residents.
Customer surveys conducted by LIAT in 2012 shows that the majority travels for leisure
(61.9%) and family visits (20%), following by business travel (17.5%), and travel for
medical purposes (0.6%) (LIAT 2012). Given non-business passengers are typically more
price-sensitive and have more flexibility in travel time, the data suggests that a significant
number of current LIAT customers could be potential ferry customers. If the OECS countries
could overcome existing regulatory burdens to facilitate a regional ferry system, competition
will likely result in lower prices and better services on both modes of transports.
   There is also potential for a regional ferry to replace LIAT’s short (unprofitable) routes.
According to LIAT, 35% of their flights are not profitable. One of their main challenges is
having high capital intensity per seat mile due to the presence of many short trips. In 2010 for
example, 50% of LIAT trips are below 100 Nms while 80% are below 200 Nms (LIAT 2010).
While both the airline and ferry industries are characterized by economies of scale, per unit
fixed cost for LIAT is potentially higher on routes below 100 Nms. Figure 3.3 compares the
current fare structures between LIAT and two fast ferry operators against distance travelled by
route. It shows that the unit fare per mile for the two ferry companies falls with distance much
faster than for LIAT initially. If we assume similar rates of mark-ups over average cost, the
differences in cost per mile between air and ferry travel appear to be very high at the distance
just below 100 Nms but narrow quickly between 100 and 200 Nms. If in fact, a regional ferry
has a cost advantage over certain routes, there is an opportunity to put in place new ferry
services, reduce the number of unprofitable flights and the needs to subsidize LIAT.24
   If, as the studies suggest, a ferry system would facilitate tapping into a new market of
tourists, developing such a system could, potentially, make an important contribution to the
economies of the OECS. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the countries
in the Caribbean region should focus on decisive reforms to foster competitiveness, enhance
productivity and raise private sector investments. The IMF identifies diversifying the tourism
market as one of the key ways of achieving this goal (IMF 2014). The concrete estimate of
the contribution of the regional ferry system will depend on the type of system that would
be most appropriate for the region, including the type of ferry, its capacity, fares and taxes
charged, etc., which will become clear through a separate feasibility assessment.

   Annual data compiled from Diio transport database. Air travel capacity between Dominica and
St. Lucia decreased significantly during 2007–09 partly due to LIAT’s acquisition of Caribbean Star
Airlines Limited and several other airlines stopping their operations. In fact, Dominica invested in
LIAT in 2013 due to their dependence on the airline (Briceno-Garmendia et al. 2014).
24
   On the other hand, a negative impact is to drive the market for air travel on certain routes even
thinner to eventually disappear. Consumers with the most inelastic demand (such as business
travelers) might be worse off.

Recommendations




Based on the analysis contained in this paper, the table below contains a number of con-
crete recommendations and next steps. In summary, the recommendations highlight that
it is important to facilitate regional collaboration, including facilitating the movement of
people and goods by assessing the feasibility of a regional ferry system and facilitating its
implementation should it be feasible (this includes preparing and carrying out the bidding
process, developing strategies to fund the infrastructural gaps and addressing infrastructural
issues and regulatory obstacles that hinder the movement of people and goods); enhancing
the uniqueness of each island and the experiences of tourists on each island; and developing
and implementing regional tourism promotion approaches that would highlight the region
as one destination, while emphasizing the uniqueness of each island.

OECS Tourism Competitiveness in a Global Context1




A.1  Global Tourism Trends and Outlook
This section provides an overview of key global trends in the tourism sector in 2013. It is
divided into five parts: the first section examines the overall global tourism performance,
notably focusing on trends in international arrivals and receipts, as well as on main market
sources of tourists and tourism spending in 2013—both in terms of relative growth and
absolute share. The second and third parts break down global trends in international tour-
ist arrivals and receipts at the regional level. The fourth part assesses the Travel & Tourism
(T&T) competitiveness of each region. Finally, the last part examines prospects for the tour-
ism sector in 2014 and beyond.


A.1.1  Overall Tourism Performance
Following the financial crisis—in a difficult economic climate and shrinking budgets—the
tourism sector has demonstrated remarkable resilience. In 2013, the global tourism sector
proved once again its strong capacity to adapt to changing market conditions. In a global
economy showing signs of fragile recovery from the financial crisis but still functioning in
“low gear,” the number of international tourist arrivals has increased over the past year.
The United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) estimates that international
inbound tourism grew by 5% in 2013. An additional 52 million tourists2 travelled in 2013,
reaching a total of 1,087 million (see Figure A.1).
   Growth in international receipts also increased, by 5% in real terms, in 2013. Tourism
receipts worldwide reached an estimated US$1,159 billion in 2013. In absolute terms,
receipts around the world grew by US$ 81 billion, from US$ 1,078 billion in 2012
(UNWTO 2014a).
   The tourism sector remains critical for economic development and sustaining employment,
in both advanced and developing economies. A strong tourism sector directly contributes to

trip includes an overnight stay” (UNWTO 2014c).

national income and improves balance of payments, while also making significant indirect
contribution, via tourism’s multiplier effect. Tourism helps connect countries and economic
sectors, and provides an impetus for the development of infrastructure—critical attributes
for a country’s economic competitiveness. Tourism may also support the development of
value chains; such as with agribusiness and transportation. In 2012, the tourism industry
accounted for one in eleven jobs on the planet. In the same year, the sector accounted for
9% of GDP (translating into US$ 6 trillion), providing 120 million direct jobs and another
125 million jobs in related industries. Many developing economies are in the process of
shifting away from manufacturing to service economies, which are generally much more
labor-intensive than mechanized, manufacturing economies. As this shift occurs, the share
of tourism employment out of total employment will probably increase further, as will the
share of tourism contribution to total GDP (WEF 2013).
   Developing economies—especially China and the Russian Federation—have been leading
growth in international tourism spending in 2013. Table A.1 shows that most countries that
traced significant growth in 2013 were developing economies. The rising purchasing power
of the growing middle class in some of these economies has driven global tourism spending
trends upwards. As of 2012, Chinese tourism spending had increased almost eightfold in
12 years. In 2013, China continued its surge, sustaining the highest growth worldwide
in tourism spending, with an increase of 26.1% in spending, up to a total of US$128.6
billion (UNWTO 2013a; WEF 2013). As Table A.1 shows, China was followed closely by
Russia, which increased its spending by 24.9% in 2013, reaching a total of US$53.5 billion.
In comparison, the performance of key advanced economy source markets was moderate,
with the exception of Australia, which increased spending by 8.8%. France increased spending
by 4.9%, recovering from a weak 2012, whereas growth in tourism spending by the United
States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Canada ranged between 2.3% and 3.5%.

   China also maintained the highest share in total international tourism spending worldwide,
outperforming the United States. This represents a staggering pace of growth, as in 2005,
China was ranked only 7th worldwide in international tourism spending. In 2012, China
became the world largest tourism spender, overtaking long-time top spenders Germany and
the United States which now respectively hold 3rd and 2nd position in the ranking. Aside
from China, Russia also showed an impressive increase in tourism spending in recent years;
moving up to two places in 2012 and up to one more place in 2013, reaching the 4th place
in the ranking (see Table A.2). As a result, the United Kingdom fell down to 5th place in
2013. Brazil also moved up two places in 2013, entering the top ten spenders in the world,
with a total of US$ 25.1 million (UNWTO 2014a). However, key traditional source markets
together still held the majority of total international spending worldwide. Table A.2, which
displays the top 10 countries in international tourism expenditure, shows that 7 countries
out of 10 are advanced economies, with spending ranging from US$ 86.2 billion (the
United States, 2nd position) to US$ 27.0 billion (Italy, 9th position).

strong in tourist arrivals. Many developing markets are becoming increasingly attractive
tourist destinations, and this has been reflected in tourist arrival trends at the regional level,
especially in the Asia Pacific. Indeed, when breaking down the global growth pattern in
international tourist arrivals, Map A.1 shows that relative growth was strongest in the Asia

Pacific (6%) where the number of international tourist visits grew by 14.5 million in 2013,
reaching a total of 248.1 million arrivals. Growth in demand for international tourism was
also high in Europe (5%) and in Africa (5%), with an additional 2.9 million arrivals, reach-
ing new a record of 55.8 million.
   In line with these regional trends, at the sub-regional level, the strongest growth
performance in 2013 occurred within the Asia Pacific region: in South-East Asia (10.5%).
Within Europe, growth was led by Central & Eastern Europe (6.5%) as well as Southern &
Mediterranean Europe (5.7%). In Africa, North Africa was the sub-region that demonstrated
most robust growth (6.1%). In the Americas, both Central America and North America
grew by approximately 4% in 2013 (UNWTO 2014a).
   At the country level, relative growth in tourist arrivals was strongest in Thailand with
a 26.5% increase compared to 2012, followed closely by Japan, with arrivals increasing
by 24.0%. Table A.3 shows that the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan and Vietnam also
showed robust growth in tourist arrivals in 2013, with approximately 11%. In the rest of
the top ten ranking, growth ranged from 10.2% to 9.3%.
   Despite the robust growth performance of developing economies, Europe still welcomed
the most tourists in 2013. Europe led in absolute growth, welcoming an additional
29.0 million tourists, raising the overall number of tourists to 563.4 million. As Figure A.2
shows, Europe accounted for 51.8% of world inbound tourism in 2013. This performance is
quite remarkable in light of the economic challenges in the region and as it follows an already
robust 2011 and 2012. In 2013, the Asia Pacific region held a 22.8% share of world inbound
tourism, with 248.1 million tourists, followed by the Americas which received a 15.5% share;
and the Middle East and Africa, which both embraced a modest share of approximately 5%.

   The two sub-regions which accounted for the largest share of international tourist arrivals
in 2013 were both in Europe: Southern & Mediterranean Europe (201.4 million) and Western
Europe (174.3 million). In the Asia Pacific region, North East Asia held almost half the
region total share of visits, with 127.0 million arrivals out of the 248.1 million arrivals in the
overall region. In the Americas, North America handled more than 2/3 of the total regional
share of visits, welcoming a total of 110.1 million tourists. Within Africa, the Sub-Saharan
region hosted the most tourists, with a total of 36.2 million arrivals (UNWTO 2014a).
   At the country level, France maintained the largest share of tourist arrivals in 2013;
followed by the US, with 69.8 million arrivals; and Spain, with 60.2 million arrivals.
However, Table A.4 shows that the top ten countries included four emerging economies:
China (55.7 million arrivals); Turkey (37.8 million arrivals); Russia (28.4 million arrivals)
and Thailand (26.5 million arrivals), which moved from the 15th to the 10th position in the
ranking. The remaining three countries in the top ten were Italy, with 47.7 million arrivals;
Germany, with 31.5 million arrivals; and the United Kingdom, with 31.2 million arrivals.


A.1.3  International Tourism Receipts—Regional Breakdown
As with international tourist arrivals, the Asia Pacific was the fastest growing region in inter-
national tourism receipts in 2013, with a rise of 8%. Map A.2 shows that the Americas and
Europe also recorded robust increases in receipts with 6% and 4% respectively. Growth in
international tourism receipts slightly outpaced growth in international tourist arrivals in
most regions, apart from Africa and the Middle East where growth in receipts was below
growth in tourist arrivals.

   At the sub-regional level, South-East Asia showed the highest growth in international
tourism receipts with a surge of 9.7%; followed closely by North East Asia which grew by
9.3%. Just like for growth in tourism arrivals, and in line with regional trends, the Asia
Pacific region was home of the two fastest growing sub-region in the world in international
tourism receipts. Within Europe, patterns for this indicator varied in comparison to the
tourist arrival indicator, as growth in the region was mainly driven by Northern Europe,
with a 7.1% increase, rather than Eastern and Southern Europe. In the Americas, tourism
receipts growth was led by North America with a progression of 7.8%, reaching a total of
US$ 171.0 billion. Finally, within Africa, North Africa growth in receipts decreased by −1.4,
while the Sub-Saharan region grew by only 0.6% (UNWTO 2014a).
   At the country level, Asian Pacific destinations dominated the ranking in tourism receipt
growth. As Table A.5 suggests, all four leading destinations in tourism receipts were in the Asia
Pacific, led by Japan (25.3%), Thailand (23.1%); and Hong Kong SAR, China and Macao
SAR, China (respectively 17.7% and 18.1%). Asia Pacific was also home of 3 additional
countries in the top 10 demonstrating robust growth: the Philippines (15.3%), India and
Indonesia (respectively 12.0% and 12.2%). The two remaining European countries in the
ranking: Greece and the United Kingdom, also posted double-digit increases, progressing by
14.9% and 13.2% respectively.
   As with tourist arrival indicator, Europe maintained the largest share of international
tourism receipts worldwide (42.2%) with an additional US$ 35.3 billion in 2013, reaching
a total of US$ 489.3 billion. However, it is worth noting that Europe’s share of receipts
was less significant than its share of tourist arrivals in 2013, which accounted for more

global tourism receipts than global tourist arrivals, respectively holding 2.9% and 4.1%

the Asia Pacific accounted for 31.0% of tourism receipts worldwide, increasing earnings by
US$ 29.8 billion to reach US$ 358.9 billion, while it held 22.8% of global tourist arrivals.
In the same way, the Americas held a 19.8% share of worldwide receipts, increasing by
US$ 16.3 billion to a total of US$ 229.2 billion, while it only held a 15.5% share of global
tourist arrivals.
   The leading sub-regions which received the highest shares of global tourism receipts
in 2013 were also usually the ones that accounted for the largest share of international
tourist arrivals. Indeed, as with tourist arrivals, the highest share of tourism receipts
worldwide was embraced by Southern & Mediterranean Europe, which accounted
for US$ 187.3 billion in tourism receipts. Again, as with tourist arrivals, Europe was
led by Southern & Mediterranean Europe and by Western Europe, which received
US$ 167.9 billion. Within the Asia Pacific, North-East Asia held the largest share of
regional tourism receipts in 2013, with US$ 184.7 billion. Americas’ overall share of
tourism receipts was led by North America, with a total of US$ 171.0 billion while
Africa’s overall share was led by Sub-Saharan Africa, which enclosed US$ 24.0 billion in
receipts in 2013 (UNWTO 2014a).

   At the country level, the United States received the largest share of international tourism
receipts, with a total of US$ 139.6 billion. As Table A.6 shows, the US performed very well
in 2013, and its share of tourism receipts was more than twice the share of the 2nd country
in the ranking, namely Spain, which collected US$ 60.4 billion. Among the top ten tourism
destinations in international tourism receipts, France ranked 3rd, with US$ 56.1 billion,
followed by China, with US$ 51.7 billion and Macao SAR, China, with US$ 51.6 billion.
The rest of the countries in the top 10 ranged from US$ 43.9 billion (Italy) to US$ 38.9
billion (Hong Kong SAR, China), and Thailand progressed from the 9th to the 7th place in
the top 10.


A.1.4  Tourism and Travel Competitiveness—Regional Breakdown
Europe remained the leading region in tourism competitiveness, according to the rank-
ing of the latest T&T Competitiveness report from the World Economic Forum (WEF).
Table A.7 shows that all top five spots—out of the 140 economies assessed in the latest
report—in 2013 were held by European countries. Switzerland maintained its top position
in the rankings, which it has retained for five consecutive editions, since the very first T&T
Competitiveness Report. The remaining four European countries at the top of the ranking
were: Germany and Austria, both with an overall score of 5.39; and Spain and the United
Kingdom, both with an overall score of 5.38. Measurement of the overall score was based
on the performance of three main pillars: T&T regulatory environment; business environ-
ment and infrastructure; T&T human, cultural and natural resources.

   Regional breakdowns in the WEF report assess the top competitive countries within each
region. The Americas was led by the United States with an overall score of 5.32, followed
by Canada (5.28 overall score) and Barbados (4.88 overall score). In the Asia Pacific region,
countries that performed best were Singapore, with an overall score of 5.23, Australia and
New Zealand (both 5.17 overall score). The Middle East and North Africa region of the
WEF report was led by the United Arab Emirates, scoring 4.86, followed by Qatar (4.49
overall score) and Israel (4.34 overall score). Finally, countries at the top of the ranking in
Sub-Saharan Africa were: the Seychelles (4.41 overall score), Mauritius (4.23 overall score)
and South Africa (4.13 overall score) (WEF 2013).


A.1.5  Prospects for the Tourism Sector in 2014 and Beyond
The positive results of the tourism sector in 2013 and the expected global economic improve-
ments in 2014 set the stage for another positive year for tourism worldwide. As prospects
for the global economy are gradually brightening, the improving economic outlook will
support further growth in the travel and tourism sector. The UNWTO expects that growth
in international arrivals will continue in 2014 and beyond, as highlighted by Figure A.4.
The organization forecasts an increase by 4–4.5% in 2014, above its long-term forecast
of 3.8% per year between 2010 and 2020.
   The tourism industry, which now accounts for one in eleven jobs worldwide, could
rise to one in ten jobs by 2022. The annual economic impact research carried out by the
World Travel and Tourism Council and Oxford Economics found, in part, that direct T&T
employment is expected to grow at an average 1.9% per annum over the next 10 years,
compared with total employment growth of 1.2% each year through to 2022 (WEF 2013).

   In 2014, at the regional level, the UNWTO expects that prospects for the Asia Pacific
region will remain the strongest, with growth in tourist arrivals expected to reach 5–6%.
The UNWTO projects an increase in Africa between 4% and 6% compared to 2013, while
both Europe and the Americas are expected to grow between 3% and 4% (UNWTO 2014b).


A.2  Caribbean versus World and Americas Tourism Performance
This section looks at the tourism performance of the Caribbean region in 2013, in compari-
son to the rest of the world and the wider Americas. It is divided into five sections: The first
section examines trends in international tourist arrivals, both in terms of relative growth and
absolute share of arrivals. The second section focuses on market sources of tourist arrivals
to the region. The third examines trends in tourism receipts, both in terms of relative growth
and absolute share, and hotel performance. The fourth section assesses the competitiveness
of the Caribbean region, based on the latest WEF report published in 2013. Finally, the last
section looks at prospects for the tourism sector in the region in 2014.


A.2.1  International Tourist Arrivals
In 2013, growth in tourist arrivals in the Caribbean does not compare favorably to the
global average. In 2013, the Caribbean struggled to maintain growth levels with a growth
rate of 2.2%, as compared to 3.0% between 2011 and 2012. As Table A.8 shows, growth in

arrivals in the Caribbean in 2013 was well below the global average. It was also below the
average growth rate in the Americas, of 3.2%. In comparison to all regions, the Caribbean
ranks second to last, just before the Middle East, which retracted by −0.2%.
   Within the Americas, the growth performance of the Caribbean compared to other sub-
regions was fairly weak. At the sub-regional level, Table A.8 highlights that the Caribbean
placed last in the rankings. North America led growth within the Americas, with a rise of
3.5% in tourist arrivals; followed by Central America (4.2%) and South America (2.6%).
   At the country level, patterns within the Caribbean region were disparate, with a wide
range between the top performers and the countries at the bottom of list. In the Caribbean,
Haiti had the highest growth in tourists in 2013, with 20.2%; followed by Guyana, with
11.6%; and Aruba, with 8.3% growth. The performance of these countries was competitive
compared to the top performers at the global level in 2013. At the bottom of the list, arrivals
to Barbados shrank by 5.2%, US Virgin Islands by 4.7% and St. Vincent and the Grenadines
by 3.5% (CTO 2014a; UNWTO 2014a).
   In 2013, the Caribbean held 1.9% share of worldwide tourist arrivals and 12.6% share
within the Americas region, with a total of 21.2 million arrivals. Figure A.5 shows that
in 2013, North America held 65.6% of total tourists within the Americas, with a total
of 110.1 million arrivals. North America was followed by South America (16.3%); the
Caribbean; and Central America, which only collected a 5.5% share translating into 9.2
million arrivals.
   At the country level, the Dominican Republic, received by far the most tourists in the
region with 4.7 million arrivals; followed by Cuba (2.9 million) and Jamaica (2.0 million).
However, on the global stage, these numbers remain modest in comparison to the 2013
top ten performers worldwide—displayed in Table A.4—which ranged from 69.8 million

tourist arrivals (the United States) to 26.5 million (Thailand).Two additional countries
received more than 1 million tourists this year: Puerto Rico (1.6 million) and the Bahamas
(1.4 million). Most other Caribbean destinations received below one million tourists
(CTO 2014a; UNWTO 2014a).


A.2.2  Tourist Arrivals—Market Sources
The highest growth in tourist arrivals did not come from traditional market sources.
Arrivals from “Other” sources grew by 7.4%, with Guyana receiving the highest growth
in tourist visits from this market (86.7%). This market was by followed the United
States with 1.8% growth in arrivals to the Caribbean. The number of European tour-
ists also increased—by 1.4%— while number of tourists from Canada remained rela-
tively stagnant (0.9%). Finally, the number of European tourists fell by 3.7% in 2013
as a result of weak European economies (CTO 2014a). Earlier estimations from the
Caribbean Tourism Organization (CTO) suggested that the highest growth in tourist
arrivals to the Caribbean between 2012 and 2013 came from South America. According
to those early estimates, tourist arrivals to the Caribbean from this region in 2013 grew
by 13% (CTO 2014b).
   However, the main source of tourist arrivals in the Caribbean region—in absolute terms—
remained the United States, accounting for 43.3% of total arrivals, with 7.4 million tourists.
Most American going to the region visited the Dominican Republic (1.6 million), followed

States market was followed by the “Other” group, with a 22.6% share; Europe, with a
18.4% share; and Canada, sourcing 15.7% of total arrivals.

A.2.3  Tourism Receipts and Hotel Performance
As with tourist arrivals, growth in international tourism receipts in the Caribbean was
relatively low, in comparison to the world’s average. Tourism receipts in the region grew
by 2.1% between 2012 and 2013, which is almost comparable to the tourist arrival
growth rate in the region for the same period (2.3%). As Table A.9 shows, growth in
receipts in the Caribbean was well below the world’s average (5.3%) and the Americas’
average (6.4%).
   Within the Americas, growth in tourism receipts in the Caribbean was also fairly low in
comparison to the other sub-regions in 2013. At the regional level, as with growth in tourist
arrivals, Table A.9 shows that the Caribbean did not perform well and ranked last among
the three other sub-regions. The region was led by North America, which grew by 7.8%,
followed by Central and South America (both 3.2%) and the Caribbean.
   In absolute terms, the Caribbean region in 2013 collected 2.1% of global tourism receipts.
At the global level, the Caribbean thus held a slightly better share of tourism receipts than of
tourist arrivals (1.9%) (UNWTO 2014a).
   Within the Americas, the Caribbean held a 10.8% share of tourism receipts, with a total
of US$ 24.8 billion. Figure A.7 shows that the Caribbean and South America lost a slight

share of tourist arrivals to North America in 2013, while Central America’s share remained
constant. The Caribbean share of arrivals moved from 11.4% in 2012 to 10.8% in 2013,
while the share of South America declined from 11.1% to 10.5%, with a total of US$ 23.9
billion. Central America maintained its 4.1% share, with a total of US$ 9.4 billion tourism
receipts in 2013. North America held almost ¾ of the region’s total tourism receipts in 2013,
with a total of US$ 171.0 billion.
   In 2012, performance indicators for the hotel sector in the Caribbean demonstrated the
highest growth among other sub-regions in the Americas. Table A.10 displays hotel sector
performance in the main sub-regions of the Americas in 2012; measuring average occupancy
rate; Average Daily Rate (ADR)3; and average Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)4.
In all three categories, the Caribbean outperformed all other sub-regions of the Americas.
Indeed, the Caribbean scored the highest growth in all categories across the region between
2011 and 2012: the Caribbean averaged 4.5% growth in occupancy rate; 3.9% in ADR;
and 11.4% in RevPAR (UNWTO 2013b). Between 2012 and 2013, the performance of
these three indicators increased further: average occupancy rate increased by 1.2%, ADR by
6.2% and average RevPAR by 7.6%.
   In 2012—in absolute terms—the Caribbean hotel sector performed the best among
other sub-regions. Average occupancy rate in the Caribbean was the highest in the region,
with 66.5%. In 2012, the Caribbean was followed by South America, with a 65.0% average
occupancy rate; North America, with 61.4%; and Central America, with 57.4%. Regarding
ADR, the Caribbean far surpassed the other sub-regions with US$170 per room, versus
US$141 in South America and US$114 in Central America. Finally, in RevPAR, the Caribbean

A.2.4  Caribbean Tourism and Travel Competitiveness
Out of the 140 countries assessed in the latest WEF T&T report, only one Caribbean
country was ranked within the top 50: Barbados, with an overall score of 4.88.
The latest edition of the WEF T&T Report assessed the performance of 6 countries in the
Caribbean: Puerto Rico ranked 52nd (4.36); Jamaica ranked 67th (4.08); Trinidad and
Tobago ranked 83rd (3.93), the Dominica Republic was 86th (3.88) and Haiti ranked
140th (2.59) (WEF 2013).
  Within the Americas, the performance of Caribbean countries was scattered. Out of the
27 countries assessed in the Report for the Americas region, Barbados ranked 3rd regionally
while Haiti held the last position in the ranking. Most Caribbean countries were in the
middle of the range, with Puerto Rico ranking 8th; Jamaica holding the 12th spot; Trinidad
15th and the Dominican Republic ranking 17th (WEF 2013).


A.2.5  Prospects for the Tourism Sector in 2014
Overall, it is expected that 2014 should be a better year for the Caribbean. According
to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the impetus for global growth should come
largely from recovery in advanced economies. The main markets, from which tourist
arrivals usually originate from, namely the United States and Europe, are expected to
grow respectively by about 2.8% and 1% (IMF cited in CTO 2014b). The CTO expects
that tourist arrivals in the Caribbean will increase between 2% and 3% in 2014. Cruise
activity should pick up as well, as more ships have been delivered, several of which will
be deployed in Caribbean waters. For 2014, cruise passenger arrivals should increase by
about 3% (CTO 2014b).


A.3  OECS versus Caribbean Tourism Performance
This section examines more specifically the performance of the Organization of Eastern
Caribbean States (OECS) countries (plus Barbados in some sections) in comparison to
the wider Caribbean region. The first section assesses the importance of tourism for
the OECS. The second section examines tourist arrival trends in the region—both in
terms of relative growth and absolute share. The third section assesses the implications
of these trends on the tourism competitiveness of the OECS. The fourth section exam-
ines market sources of tourism inbound in the OECS. The fifth section assesses tourism
receipts and hotel performance—using hotel occupancy rate as a proxy due to the scar-
city of available data. Finally, the last section focuses on prospects for the tourism sector
in the OECS in 2014.

A.3.1  The Importance of Tourism for the OECS
Tourism is a primary driver of growth and an important source of employment for the
OECS. Table A.11 shows that in 2013, the sector accounted for more than half of total
export earnings in most countries. Anguilla received the largest share of export earnings
from T&T (89.2%). In 2013, Anguilla was followed by Antigua and Barbuda (76.1%) and
St. Lucia (61.3%). The sector also directly and indirectly contributed significantly to GDP
and employment in most countries during that year. The sector’s total contribution to GDP
reached 62.9% in Antigua and Barbuda while its direct contribution to GDP reached 19.3%
in Anguilla. In 2013, these two countries also received the largest total contribution of T&T
to employment (57.8% and 58.8% respectively) as well as direct contribution to employ-
ment (18.0% and 23.8% respectively) across the OECS. Evidence shows that over the past
two decades, the sector’s contribution to GDP has increased, as traditional agricultural
exports contracted with the expiration of preferential trade access to European markets.


A.3.2  Tourism Arrivals
Average tourist arrival growth in the OECS (1.0%) lagged in comparison to the overall
Caribbean between 2012 and 2013. Table A.12 shows that the OECS ranked 4th out of the
6 sub-regions in the Caribbean, just before the French territories (0.3%) and US territories
(−1.7%). In 2013, the leading sub-region within the Caribbean in relative growth was the

“Other Caribbean” region—which includes large destinations such as Cuba, Dominican
Republic, Haiti and Suriname—reaching 6.8% growth in arrivals, adding up to about 8.2
million arrivals.
   At the country level, growth in tourist arrivals was led by Anguilla, with a 6.8% increase
between 2012 and 2013. Table A.13 highlights that within the OECS (plus Barbados),
4 countries demonstrated growth in tourist arrivals in 2013: Anguilla’s performance was
followed by St. Lucia, which progressed by 3.9%; St. Kitts and Nevis (3.2%) and Grenada
(0.9%). However, tourist arrivals declined in the remaining five countries: by 5.2% in,
Barbados; by 3.5% in St. Vincent and the Grenadines; by 1.5% in Montserrat; by 1.2% in
Antigua and Barbuda; and by 0.9% in Dominica.
   In absolute terms, the OECS maintained a low share of Caribbean tourist arrivals in
2013. Figure A.8 shows that in 2013, the OECS accounted for only 5.2% of total Caribbean
tourists—the same share it had in 2012—with a total of approximately 1.0 million
arrivals. The OECS countries ranked just above the French Caribbean, which accounted
for the lowest share in the region (2.5%). The “Other Caribbean” group received the
largest share of total arrivals (42.2%) in 2013, reaching up 8.2 million arrivals. In the
same year, US territories held 11.8% of total arrivals—with 3.9 million tourists—while
the Dutch Caribbean held 9.7% and the “Other Commonwealth” countries 28.6%,
collecting 5.6 million tourist arrivals.
   Within the OECS (plus Barbados), Barbados received the largest share of tourist arrivals
in 2013, with 508.5 thousand arrivals. Table A.13 shows that Barbados was followed by

St. Lucia, which received 318.6 thousand tourists in 2013; and Antigua and Barbuda, with
243.1 thousand tourists. All remaining countries received flows in arrivals ranging from
116.5 thousand arrivals in Grenada, to 7.2 thousand arrivals in Montserrat.
   The modest performance of the OECS tourism sector 2013 was matched by difficulties to fully
recover from the financial crisis. Most OECS countries have strong service-based economies
and the financial crisis has been undermining their growth performance and exposing balance
sheet vulnerabilities built up over many years In contrast, commodities exporters in the
Caribbean, such as, Belize, Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago which together
produce oil/gas, minerals, and agricultural goods benefited from high commodity prices and
demonstrated better resilience and recovery from the crisis (IMF 2013).
   The tourism sector in the OECS (plus Barbados) was significantly affected by the Financial
Crisis and has had difficulties recovering. Figure A.9 shows that the OECS’s (plus Barbados)
share of Caribbean tourists has progressively declined over time between its 2006 pre-crisis
level and 2013. The OECS (plus Barbados) moved from a 9.8% share in 2006 to a 7.8%
share in 2013. This trend suggests that other sub-regional groups within the Caribbean have
been more resilient and performed better both during and after the crisis (CTO 2007, 2009,
2010a, 2010b, 2012, 2013a, 2013b, 2014a).
   Figure A.10 shows that growth in tourist arrivals in the OECS (plus Barbados) was also
strongly affected by the crisis and has had difficulties recovering. Between 2006 and 2009,
growth in tourist arrivals moved from 4.8% to -10.9%. Since then, growth progressively
recovered, reaching 3.5% in 2012—however still under its 2006 pre-crisis growth level
of 3.7%. Between 2012 and 2013, growth dropped again to 0.3%. In comparison, the

overall Caribbean showed better resilience and recovery from the crisis. Between 2006
and 2013, the OECS (plus Barbados) growth performance was always below that of the
Caribbean, but the growth gap widened for most years after 2006. In 2006, the growth
difference between the overall Caribbean and the OECS (plus Barbados) was fairly small,
with 1.1%, but reached 4.5% in 2009 (-6.2% in the Caribbean and −10.7% in the OECS
plus Barbados). The 2012 growth rate in tourist arrivals in the Caribbean was back to its
pre-crisis level, even slightly outpacing it, reaching up 4.9% (CTO 2007, 2009, 2010a,
2010b, 2012, 2013a, 2013b, 2014a).


A.3.3  Implications for OECS Tourism Competitiveness
As a result of these trends, the OECS region is becoming increasingly less competitive
amidst other destinations in the world. This point was recently emphasized by Ms. Virginia
Paul, head of Trade Policy Unit/Officer in Charge Economic Affairs Division in the OECS
Secretariat, during her remarks at the opening of the 12th OECS Tourism Ministers meeting
in Dominica on Thursday April 24 2014. She stressed that the OECS has been losing “its
already undersized share of the Global tourism market.” Ms. Paul pointed out that statis-
tics obtained from the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and the Eastern Caribbean
Central Union (ECCU) evidenced that the share of world tourist arrivals in the Caribbean
has been on a general downward trend over the last decade. She stated that: “In 2000, the
ECCU share of global tourist arrivals was 0.132% […] and last year, it reached a low record
of 0.092%” (Caribbean Journal 2014).
84	   Driving Tourism in the Eastern Caribbean



  In 2013, within the OECS (plus Barbados) group, the strong tourism performance of
Barbados—in absolute terms—suggests that the tourism competitiveness of the other
countries for that year may have been lower. The latest edition of the WEF T&T report
within that group only includes Barbados, which scored 4.88. However, in light of the
tourism assessment performed in the sections above, we can assume that if the remaining
countries were included in the report, they would probably have fallen below Barbados
(WEF 2013).


A.3.4  Tourist Arrivals—Market Sources
In contrast to the Caribbean, the highest growth in tourist arrivals in the OECS (plus
Barbados), between 2012 and 2013, came from Canada. Table A.14 shows that the three
countries within the OECS (plus Barbados) that received the highest growth in tourist vis-
its from this market were: Grenada (27.0%); Antigua and Barbuda (25.9%) and Anguilla
(8.6%). This market source was followed by the US, with 0.9% growth in tourist arrivals
in the OECS (plus Barbados). Grenada demonstrated the highest growth in arrivals from
this market with a 16.1% increase; followed by St. Lucia, with 11.5%; and Anguilla with
8.9%. In contrast, arrivals to the OECS (plus Barbados) from Europe retracted by 1.4%,
especially in Grenada (−16.1%), St. Lucia and Montserrat (both −5.2). Arrivals from the
“Other” group also decreased in 2013 (−0.7%); with −9.8% in Barbados; −8.6% in Antigua
and Barbuda; and −4% in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
   However, in absolute terms—as with the Caribbean—the US maintained the largest share
of tourist arrivals in the OECS (plus Barbados), with 34.3%. Table A.14 shows that St. Lucia
(128.3 thousand), Barbados (120.6 thousand) and Antigua and Barbuda (88.8 thousand)
received the most tourists from this market. This market was closely followed by Europe
(30.8% share); with Barbados (209.8 thousand), St. Lucia and Antigua and Barbuda (both 88.5
thousand) receiving the most tourists in 2013. With 110.8 thousand tourists, Barbados also
accounted for the largest share of arrivals from the “Other” market category, which held 24.1%
of total arrivals in the OECS (plus Barbados). Finally, Canada sourced 10.8% of tourists to the
OECS (plus Barbados); with Barbados (67.3 thousand), Antigua and Barbuda (30.4 thousand)
and Grenada (9.3 thousand) receiving the most tourist arrivals from this market.
   In 2013, the OECS (plus Barbados) demonstrated a slightly different market structure
than the overall Caribbean. For instance, Figure A.11 shows that European arrivals
account for 30.8% of 2013 arrivals in the OECS (plus Barbados), compared to 18.4% for
the wider Caribbean. This may have resulted in a longer average stay, as tourists from the
United States typically stay for much shorter periods than do Europeans.
   Regarding intra-Caribbean tourism, the OECS demonstrated the largest decline in
tourist arrival flows amongst all sub-regions within the Caribbean region. Estimates from
CTO in 2013 reveal that 2.1% more Caribbean residents visited neighboring destinations
than in 2012. However, Table A.15 shows that the OECS is the only region where intra-
regional arrivals declined in 2013, with a reduction of 3.4%. The “Other Caribbean” region
dominated growth in intra-regional tourist arrivals, with a rise of 3.7% between 2012 and
2013, reaching a total of 973.7 thousand arrivals.

   In absolute terms, the OECS received the smallest share of intra-regional travel within the
Caribbean, with a total of 273.9 thousand arrivals. Table A.15 shows that approximately
1.6 thousand regional tourists travelled within the Caribbean region in 2013, and the highest
share of this market was received by the “Other Caribbean” region, with a total of 973.7
thousand arrivals. This sub-region region was followed by the “Other Commonwealth”
region, which accounted for 347.6 thousand visits.


A.3.5  Tourism Receipts5 and Hotel Performance
Between 2006 and 2013, growth in visitor expenditures in the OECS was severely affected
by the Financial Crisis. Figure A.12 shows that in 2007; visitor expenditures in the OECS
grew by 5.3% but fell down to -8.9% in 2009. In 2011, growth recovered to 4.6%, but
decreased again to 1.9% in 2013. The OECS growth in tourism receipts over that period
was always below that of the Caribbean, except for 2010 and 2011 (ECCB 2014; UNWTO
2009, 2010, 2013a, 2014a).

  In this section, the comparisons conducted in tourism receipts between the OECS and the
Caribbean are based on data from two different organizations (UNWTO for the Caribbean and
ECCB for the OECS) and should thus be used with caution. The goal is to give a general idea of the
trends but data, definitions and measurement between these two organizations may differ.

   At the country level, Anguilla received the highest growth in visitor expenditures among
the OECS countries. Between 2012 and 2013, Anguilla grew by 8.0% and was followed
closely by Dominica, with a 7.7% increase; and St. Kitts and Nevis, with a 6.4% increase
(ECCB 2014).
   As with tourist arrivals, between 2006 and 2012, the OECS share of total tourism receipts
in the Caribbean decreased almost consistently over time. Figure A.13 shows that between
2006 and 2012, the OECS share declined from 5.2% to 4.5%. However, in both 2011 and
2013, the OECS share increased from the previous year (ECCB, 2014; UNWTO, 2009,
2010, 2013a, 2014a).
   At the country level, St. Lucia collected the highest share of tourism receipts across the
OECS countries. In 2013, St. Lucia received US$ 353.9 million in visitor expenditures;
followed by Antigua and Barbuda, with US$ 307.7 million; and Anguilla, with US$ 121.7
million (ECCB 2014).
   Unfortunately, data collection on the performance of the OECS hotel sector is scanty at
best, and sometimes non-existent. There are no legal requirements for hotels to send data to
their respective Tourist Boards, so most do not. The latest official data from CTO on room
occupancy rates at the country level dates from 2010.
   Based on available data for 2010, the average room occupancy rate in the OECS is below
that of the Caribbean for the same year. Table A.16 shows that the room occupancy rates
in the OECS in 2010 approximately averaged 58.1%, while the overall Caribbean averaged
61.1% (CTO 2014b).
   At the country level, Grenada received the highest room occupancy rate in 2013.
Table A.16 shows that Grenada was followed by Barbados (67.1%); and St. Lucia (58.0%).

A.3.6  Prospects for the Tourism Sector in 2014
Positive prospects for the US and European economies in 2014 should be beneficial for the
OECS. The IMF expects that the impetus for global growth should come largely from recov-
ery in advanced economies. The main markets for the OECS, from which tourist arrivals
usually originate from, namely the United States and Europe, are expected to grow respec-
tively by about 2.8% and 1% in 2014 (IMF cited in CTO 2014b). The CTO expects that
tourist arrivals in the Caribbean will increase between 2% and 3% in 2014 (CTO 2014b).

APPENDIX B
Existing OECS Ferry Operations




There are 11 ferry companies operating within the Eastern Caribbean; with 21 vessels
and a total seating capacity of 5,853 passengers. Only two ferry services carry vehicles,
both on domestic routes. Only two ferry companies operate internationally: the Martinique-
based L’Express des Iles and the much smaller Twin Island Ferry Services. Existing ferry
services are:

1.  St. Kitts and Nevis Ferries
Four ferries link the islands of St. Kitts and Nevis, a distance of 10 miles: The Caribe Breeze,
Caribe Queen, Caribe Surf, and Sea Bridge. These are older, privately owned vessels that
carry the vast bulk of people between the twin-island federation.

2.  The Antigua to Barbuda Ferry
The Barbuda Express is a small wave-piercing ferry that links both islands.

3.  Twin Islands Ferry Service Ltd (TIFS) Antigua and Montserrat
This company commenced regular ferry services from Antigua to Montserrat in 2009. The
fares for the ferry service are approximately US$47 for an adult one-way-trip and US$93
for an adult return trip.

4.  L’Express des Iles
The only sustained cross-border ferry service in the Eastern Caribbean, L’Express des
Iles has been providing a regularly scheduled service between Guadeloupe, Dominica,
Martinique, and St. Lucia for the past 27 years. The company operates three high-speed
ferries:

   •	 Gold Express and Silver Express: 360 passengers, no vehicles. Built by Austral in
      Australia; eight years old. These vessels operate on the routes to Dominica and
      St. Lucia.

   •	 Liberte: 430 passengers, plus vehicles. Built by Austral, three years old. This boat
      plies the routes between the French territories.

On the HSC (high speed craft) Gold Express, the standard tariff is a75 for one- or two-
segment journeys. The company reports that its ferry operations are hampered by com-
plex, expensive and time-consuming customs and Immigration procedures at each port of
entry. In addition, there are usually not enough immigration officers on duty to handle a
sudden disembarkation of over 100 passengers. The company carries passengers and only
the cargo passengers bring with them; there is no dedicated cargo service. This is in keep-
ing with the company’s business plan—to concentrate on passenger traffic between known
destinations.
   L’Express des Iles has experienced contrasting fortunes with regard to its international
routes from the French territories of Martinique and Guadeloupe. As shown in Table T,
Dominica has benefitted from a steady increase in ferry traffic; from residents of Martinique
and Guadeloupe and from visiting French tourists on multi-destination holidays. However,
ferry traffic between Martinique and St. Lucia has been drastically curtailed due to travel
restrictions placed on Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) nationals by
immigration authorities in the French territories, including proof of funds, medical insurance,
and place of abode.1

5.  St. Vincent and the Grenadines
Several ferries operate between the mainland St. Vincent and the Grenadine Islands. These
include Admiralty Transport,2 Bequia Express,3 Mustique Ferry, and Jaden Lines4—all

­ rovide ferry services of varying types in the island chain. The HSC Jaden Sun operates a
p
short duration service between St. Vincent, Bequia, and Union Island, the southernmost in
the St. Vincent and the Grenadines island chain. Other ferries operate the same routes at
slower speeds, with longer transit times.

6.  Osprey Lines Grenada5
This ferry connects Grenada with its sister isles of Carriacou and Petite Martinique.
Osprey does not operate a regular service to the neighboring Union Island because of cus-
toms and immigration hassles and expense. Their principal vessel, Osprey Express, carries
220 passengers at a maximum speed 30 knots, although it travels at 20 knots to conserve
fuel. The company reports that it had to pay import duties on their vessels; they received no
concessions at all from the government.
   Currently, Osprey Lines carries about 65,000 passengers per year, down from 100,000 a
few years ago.6 Standard fare is US$31 from Grenada to Carriacou; US$20 from Carriacou
to Union Island (groups only). Generally, the company carries about 10% tourists—although
this has declined with the falling trend of overall tourist arrivals. The vessel carries small
amounts of cargo, mainly accompanying passengers’ plus vegetables for the government
marketing board to Carriacou.

7.  Trinidad–Tobago Ferry7
This government-owned company operates a Ro-Ro (Roll-on Roll-off) ferry service
between Port of Spain and Tobago. Ridership has grown from 100,000 to over 1 million
passengers in five years (Footprints Advisors 2011). In 2007, the T&T Spirit was commis-
sioned into service. This vessel is 97.2 meters in length with speed of 30–40 knots. It can
accommodate 765 passengers and 200 cars. On board facilities include a cafeteria, bar,
and VIP lounge.
   Built in 1997, the T&T Express was purchased by the Government of Trinidad and
Tobago and commissioned into service in 2006. It is 91.3 meters in length with a speed
of 38–40 knots, enabling the vessel to complete the journey between the two islands in
2½ hours. It can accommodate some 840 passengers and 200 cars/vans. Facilities include a
café/restaurant area and a bar as well as a ramp for the disabled.

8.  Port of Spain to San Fernando Water Taxi—Trinidad8
In 2010, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago bought four ferries—Paria Bullet, Calypso
Sprinter, Trini Flash, and Carnival Runner. All were made by Austral in Australia and carry

Questionnaires to Tour Operators in Europe and
Travel Agents in the Region




C.1  Tour Operators Survey
Questionnaires were sent to 114 leading tour operators in the UK, Europe, and the US
(via Survey Monkey), seeking their informed opinions on the desirability of an Eastern
Caribbean ferry service. All questions were backed up by quantifiable estimates of demand,
where applicable. In total, 20 responses were received, a response rate of 17.5%. These are
the 17 identified tour operators who participated in the survey (three respondents filled in
the survey “incognito”):

Even allowing for a certain amount of hubris; this still indicates a high level of interest
among tour operators for a regional ferry service. Some of the written comments are also
instructive:

      •	 “We specialise in multi-island holidays and think this would be a great idea. Our
         clients often come to us for guidance, so if there is a good, reliable service available
         then I’m sure we would use it. In fact, we have been asked about ferry services
         between the islands many times.”

      •	 “From St. Lucia, this would be very popular to link to St. Vincent and the Grenadines
         and Martinique in particular. Services would need to be timely, regular, affordable,
         and flexible.”

      •	 “Fully endorse this idea. I use the ferry service from St. Lucia to Dominica frequently,
         works very well and is reasonably comfortable but better option than Leeward Island
         Air Transport (LIAT) in travel times. Downside is the tedious and uncomfortable
         customs and immigration on both islands, so these would need to be upgraded as
         currently off-putting. The service is used by many of the island traders, so has atmos-
         phere of its own, but more tourists also using it now” (David Kevan, CHIC Locations).

      •	 “There is a big demand for island-hopping from our clients. We use SVG wherever
         we can—we avoid LIAT whenever we can—and we use ferries sometimes. Very
         interested to hear about your plans” (Gerry Copsey, Just Grenada).
         ­

      •	 “The current trend is definitely island hopping and as a tour operator who knows the
         region well, we really encourage this. The flights can sometimes make it difficult, so
         I really think a ferry service would be excellent. I think people would find it much
         more convenient and enjoyable than constantly going back and forth to the airport
         and having to put up with constant delays on the flights.”

      •	 “This is a fantastic idea and one that we would completely endorse. It would make
         the world of difference to our business as well as being beneficial to the islands and
         the environment. Please make this happen, and if there is anything that we can do to
         help, please just ask!”

    4              Air fares on the regional airline LIAT are expensive, averaging around US$400 per trip
                   to neighbouring islands. How much of a deterrent is this to your clients who wish to go
                   island-hopping?

    5              If there were a modern, safe and inexpensive ferry service serving the Eastern
                   Caribbean, how many of your clients do you think would be interested?
                   (a) Hardly any (0–5 percent)                                                          5.0

                   the high season (December to April) do you think would be interested in booking
                   multi-destination packages using the ferry?

 Question no.                                     Responses                                       Percent
 8              Please feel free to make additional comments on the topics of island-hopping and a
                fast ferry service for the Eastern Caribbean:
                It very much depends on how long the fast ferries will take and if you/they can make
                sure they have a reputation for reliability, decent service and above all safety.
                I think this is an excellent idea and wish you every success with your venture.
                We specialise in multi-island holidays and think this would be a great idea. Our clients
                often come to us for guidance so if there is a good, reliable service available then I’m
                sure we would use it. In fact we have been asked about ferry services between the
                islands many times.
                We only deal with luxury clients so cost is not a issue, convienience, speed and ease
                are. Many will go on shared or private charters due to ease rather than cost. The ferry
                service may prove more popular with a more mass market clientelle.
                Our market is luxury and therefore our answers relate purely to that sector, which is
                perhaps not relevant to the question.
                From St. Lucia this would be very popular to link to St. Vincent and the Grenadines
                and Martinique in particular. Services would need to be timely, regular, affordable
                and flexible.
                Inter island travel is certainly dauntingly expensive. Yes it is one country but the
                Bahamas has fast and efficient inter island ferry service covering the same sorts of
                distances as you would find in the Windward Islands. It would be nice. GHS
                Fully endorse this idea. I use the Ferry service from St. Lucia to Dominica frequently,
                work very well and is reasonably comfortable, but better option than LIAT in travel
                times. Downside is the tedious and uncomfortable customs and immigration on both
                islands so these would need to be upgraded as currently off-putting. The service is
                used by many of the island traders, so has an atmosphere of its own, but more tourists
                also using now. David Kevan - Chic Locations.
                There is a big demand for island-hopping from our clients. We use SVG wherever we
                can - we avoid LIAT whenever we can - and we use ferries sometimes. Very interested
                to hear about your plans Gerry Copsey Just Grenada group the biggest issue we face
                is in LIAT... poor service and reliability gives neither customer or Tour Operator the
                confidence to arrange more interesting itineraries. I have felt for sometime a good
                regular and reliable inter island ferry service would enhance our program dramatically
                and give a very interesting dynamic to the destination. Good luck and please keep
                me informed!
                The current trend is definitely island hopping and as a tour operator who knows the
                region well, we really encourage this. The flights can sometimes make it difficult, so i
                really think a ferry service would be excellent. i think people would find it much more
                convenient and enjoyable than constantly going back and forward to the airport and
                having to put up with constant delays on the flights.
                This is a fantastic idea and one that we would completely endorse. It would make the
                world of difference to our business as well as being beneficial to the islands and the
                environment. Please make this happen and if there is anything that we can do to help,
                please just ask!

C.2  Travel Agents Survey
Survey questionnaires were sent to 64 leading travel agencies in the Eastern Caribbean
region; non-delivery notifications reduced it to 53. In total, 17 responses were received,
which equates to a creditable 32% response rate. These are the 10 of the travel agents who
were identified (seven respondents filled in the survey “incognito”):


     1. Windsor Travel, Barbados
     2. New Era Travel, Trinidad
     3. Travel and Tours, St. Vincent
     4. Hibiscus Travel, St. Lucia
     5. Trade Winds Travel, Trinidad

     7. Cruise World, Barbados
     8. Joy’s Travel, Grenada
     9. Cox & Co, St. Lucia
    10. Whitchurch & Co Travel, Dominica

Results of the travel agent survey indicate a high degree of interest in a regional ferry service
among travel agents and their clients.

 3              How many of your clients ask about travelling by ferry?
                (a) It never happens                                                                 6.3
                (b) Rarely (maybe 5–10 percent)                                                    12.5
                (c) Sometimes (10–20 percent)                                                      50.0
                (d) Often (above 20 percent)                                                       31.3
 4              Air fares to regional destinations are expensive. If there were a modern, safe ferry
                service serving the Eastern Caribbean, charging fares that were about half of the
                applicable air fares; how many clients do you think would be interested in travelling
                by ferry?
                (a) Hardly any (0–5 per month)                                                       6.3
                (b) A few (5–20 per month)                                                         25.0
                (c) Some (above 20 per month                                                       68.8
 5              Do you regional think a regional ferry service could increase the number of foreign
                tourists visiting the Eastern Caribbean by making the region an attractive destination
                for multi-destination travel and island-hopping?
                (a) Not at all                                                                       0.0
                (b) Maybe a bit (less than 10 percent)                                             23.5
                (c) Somewhat (more than 10 percent)                                                76.5
 6              Please feel free to make additional comments on the topics of island-hopping and a
                ferry service for the Eastern Caribbean:
                It would have to be efficient, fast, safe and of a good standard especially if catering for
                tourists and Caribbean vacation travellers.
                long overdue
                I think that although persons deire a less costly means of travelling through the
                caribbean. Getting to the destinitation in quick time is going to be a factor.
                good idea......
                In the TnT market we sell the domestic ferry tickets and almost every long weekend
                the sailings go very quickly. apart from that any normal weekend the sailings are
                full. To have a ferry service to other Caribbean islands would very much cater to that
                market and offer new alternatives for them
                This would be a welcomed by locals also
                It would have to be efficient, fast, safe and of a good standard especially if catering for
                tourists and Caribbean vacation travellers.

APPENDIX D
Schooners Running in the OECS




Almost all of the inter-island schooners currently operating in the Eastern Caribbean are
flagged in St. Vincent. Many of them are owned by Vincentians (Carriacou and Petite
Martinique, the Grenadian territories within the Grenadines, also have active shipping
and trading sectors). Ships operating at different islands of the Organization of Eastern
Caribbean States (OECS) include (Briceno-Garmendia et al. 2013):


D.1 Dominica
About 16 schooners operate out of Dominica, most based at Portsmouth in the north of the
island. Main trade is in agricultural products outbound, and the whole range of break-bulk
inbound, mostly from Trinidad. Recently, an outbound trade in vegetables has developed to
Antigua. A ship owner from Plymouth recently bought a second-hand passenger ferry with a
360-seat capacity, but he is having difficulty getting the vessel certified for international transit.
   The below map shows the trade into and out of Dominica graphically:

St. Vincent and the Grenadines has the largest fleet in the region, comprising 21 informal
vessels based in Kingstown but trading throughout the Eastern Caribbean. This includes the
ferries operating on the domestic trades between the mainland and the Grenadines as well
as vessels plying the St. Vincent to Trinidad and Barbados trades.

D.4 Grenada
Four informal vessels operate out of Grenada, based in St. George’s. They run a regular sched-
ule to Port of Spain, departing Tuesday evening and returning Friday morning. Southbound
cargoes include small amounts of agricultural produce (the huckster trade) and scrap metal;
while building materials, spare parts, light manufactures, and foodstuffs are northbound. In
addition, several small Ro-Ro vessels from St. Vincent occasionally trans-ship vehicles and
other break-bulk cargo from Barbados. Grenada also has the Osprey ferry, which carries
small amounts of cargo to Carriacou and Petite Martinique.

Global Ferry Industry




This section looks at the global ferry industry and draws lessons that could be applied to a
new ferry project in the Eastern Caribbean. The first section looks at the current state of the
overall industry; the second section describes the various types of ferries and their different
uses. Finally, the third section looks at the new breed of fast ferries, including operating
performance, such as speed, fuel consumption, etc.


E.1  The Global Ferry Fleet
In 2012, the global ferry fleet consisted of 1,183 vessels of various sizes and characteristics.
A primary distinction in ferry types is whether the vessel carries both passengers and vehicles
or passengers only. The main types of ferry vessels are:
   Walk-On Ferries: These tend to be smaller, travel shorter routes, have no beds, and carry
no vehicles nor cargo.
   Passenger/Vehicle Vessels (RoRo Vessels): These tend to be larger, travel longer distances,
often have beds and carry cars, trucks, and buses. Generally speaking, shorter faster routes
are growing in demand while longer routes are in decline.
   Vehicle-Only Ro-Ro Ferries: These carry exclusively cargo and offer either no f cabins for
drivers or at most a limited number (usually, only 12 driver spaces due to classifications of
vessel types for insurance purposes).
   Hydrofoils: Hydrofoils are high-speed, passenger-only ferries. They had their peak in the
1960s and 1970s, but since then there has been a steady decline in their popularity. They are
technically complex, expensive to build and require high maintenance.
   Catamarans: Catamarans are an increasingly popular ferry type. They are generally
operated as passenger boats and are popular wherever they are used. Speed is the major
factor of a catamaran and for this reason catamarans have become increasingly popular
ferry types.
   The Fast-Ferry Segment: These “walk-on” vessels operate on shuttle services in large
cities, coastal operations, and sightseeing; while high-speed ferries are found in longer
routes, carrying both passengers and vehicles. The fast-ferry segment has posted the largest
gains in the world ferry market. The table below shows that the Mediterranean has by far
the largest proportion of fast ferries (designated HSC for “high speed craft” as opposed to
the M/V or “motor vessel” for traditional ferries).

E.2  International Regulation of the Ferry Industry
The ferry industry is heavily regulated in terms of safety, environmental impact, and security.
Ferries that operate solely within the confines of one nation are regulated by that nation.
However, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is the United Nations body
responsible for establishing regulations for international shipping. Three key international
IMO Conventions govern international shipping are1:
   Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS): The SOLAS Convention in its successive forms is generally
regarded as the most important of all international treaties concerning the safety of merchant
ships. Its most important provisions relate to:

       •	 Construction—subdivision and stability, machinery, and electrical installations;

       •	 Fire protection, detection and fire extinction;

       •	 Life-saving appliances;

       •	 Radiocommunications;

       •	 Safety of navigation;

    •	 Carriage of cargoes;

    •	 Safety measures for high-speed craft (HSC).

The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL): This
is the main international convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environ-
ment by ships from operational or accidental causes.
    International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for
Seafarers (STCW): The 1978 STCW Convention established basic requirements for ensuring
competent personnel in international shipping. The Manila amendments to the STCW
Convention were adopted in 2010, marking a major revision of the regulations.

APPENDIX F
Criteria for a Feasibility Assessment of a Regional
Ferry System




This appendix discusses some of the key criteria that a feasibility assessment and a subsequent
viability gap financing scheme of a regional ferry system needs to take into consideration.


F.1  Potential Routes
A feasibility assessment of the regional ferry system would need to carry out an in-depth eval-
uation of the potential routes. For example, should trips by sea be limited to nearby islands
(i.e., before seasickness sets in)? The survey of potential tourists, as well as an assessment of
the experiences of other countries would be helpful in answering this question. Some pro-
posed ferry routes that could be assessed further in a feasibility study are included in Box F.1.
   This pattern of potential regional linkages is shown in Map F.1 below.


  Box F.1  Potential Ferry Linkages in the Eastern Caribbean

  Northern Circle: Historically there are close linkages among the Northern Caribbean islands; people
  move freely, seemingly immune from restrictions. The sub-region is served by ferry from Antigua to
  Barbuda and from St. Kitts to Nevis. There is also a ferry from Antigua to Montserrat. Occasionally,
  ferries will put on ad hoc charters to St. Maarten, chiefly for shopping. There is interest in fast-ferry
  service for day trips to Montserrat to view the volcano damage.
     Express des Iles: The region’s only sustained international ferry service, Express des Iles, provides
  regular fast-ferry services from Guadeloupe in the north to St. Lucia in the south.a This has a posi-
  tive impact on connectivity within the sub-region. For example, tourists are increasingly taking the
  ferry from Martinique to Dominica (the Nature Isle), spending a few days in eco-lodges, rain for-
  ests, etc. With coordination of arrival and departure times, Express des Iles could interconnect with a
  ­
  southern-based ferry operator.
     Barbados–St. Lucia: Both islands are major regional tourist destinations: Barbados with 508,520 arriv-
                                                                                               ­ nvironment
  als in 2013, St. Lucia with 318,626. However, each island offers a vastly different physical e
  and tourism product. Barbados is a relatively flat island with many beautiful beaches, restaurants, and
  tourist attractions; while St. Lucia has dense mountains, the Pitons, and French-influenced culture.

    Box F.1  Potential Ferry Linkages in the Eastern Caribbean (continued)

       The Grenadines: The Grenadine Islands, located halfway between St. Vincent and Grenada, are the
    quintessential island-hopping experience. Including the world famous Tobago Cays, the Grenadines
    attract thousands of visitors every year, most of whom accept the high cost and hassles in traveling
    to remote destinations. There is a great deal of movement within the Southern Grenadines, most of
    which occurs in small informal boats and goes completely unrecorded.
       Trinidad—Grenada: There are strong historical, cultural, and trade links between Trinidad and
    Grenada. About 30,000 passengers per year fly the route, or 600 per week.b Successive administra-
                                                                                              ­ pecial events
    tions have tried to launch ferry projects—without success. Charter ferries are put on for s
     carnivals, cricket), with constant calls for such a ferry service to be made permanent. According to
    (­
    local informed opinion, a low-cost ferry service would significantly increase passenger traffic between
    Trinidad and Grenada.
    a.  The most sustainable international service involves the French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe,
    which flank Dominica. Because of strong cultural ties between St. Lucia and Martinique, the carrier l ’Express
    des Iles connects St. Lucia, Martinique, Dominica, and Guadeloupe. Beyond this, international services can only
    be found between St. Kitt’s and Antigua, Antigua and Montserrat, and Montserrat and St. Kitts. The remaining
    services are all domestic, with ferries connecting St. Kitts with Nevis, Grenada with Carriacou and Petit
    Martinique, and St. Vincent with the Grenadines.

   One option to assess would be whether it would be prudent to use L’Express des Iles ferry
for the northern islands, and to develop a ferry system that would serve the southern islands
(Map F.2). This new ferry service serving the south could interconnect with L’Express des
Iles in St. Lucia for onward journeys to Martinique, Dominica, and Guadeloupe. Currently,
according to stakeholders, the limited traffic from the Leeward Islands to the more southerly
Windward Islands, coupled with long sea times, may argue against putting on a ferry route
linking Antigua to the southern islands. Finally, as noted earlier, sea conditions may pose an
obstacle to ferry routes between Barbados and Trinidad or Grenada.


F.2  Voyage Distances
For some Caribbean voyages, even at high speeds, sailing times can be lengthy, involv-
ing overnight trips. Table F.1 below shows the distances between islands in the Eastern
Caribbean, and the associated sailing times at various vessel speeds. Voyage distances

F.3  Potential Fare Structures
In Greece, which has well developed air and sea networks serving upwards of 20 million
passengers a year, the average ratio of ferry to air fares is about 35 percent (Rigas 2009).
However, given the small size of the Eastern Caribbean market, an initial appropriate
target for a ferry to charge may need to be different (e.g., at about 50 percent of appli-
cable air fares, Table F.2), with the hope that the rates will drop as volumes increase.
Alternatively, to lower the prices charged to the levels that resemble global averages, gov-
ernment subsidies may be needed. The worldwide price average per passenger for a ferry
is at US$ 20.51 (Sea Phantom International n.d.). Table F.2 below shows how a potential
fare structure for a ferry project which is at 50% of Leeward Island Air Transport (LIAT)
fares is significantly above the worldwide fare average (not taking into account any gov-
ernment subsidies). A potential fare structure will be an important element of the feasibil-
ity assessment.

F.4  Potential Vessel Speed
Another important question that a feasibility study needs to answer is the potential vessel
speed, taking into account the longer time of travel in a slower ferry, the higher costs associ-
ated with higher speed, as well as sea conditions. Compared to flying, travelling around the
region by sea would usually entail the better part of a day’s travel. Table F.3 below shows
transit times by air and by ferry at different speeds.
   As mentioned earlier, in both the Caribbean and Greece, fast ferry fares are almost twice as
high as on the slower ferries, and the different types of ferries have different fuel consumption.
Table F.4 below shows fuel consumption of typical ferries at different passenger capacities
and speeds, which should be taken into account when choosing the most appropriate type
of ferry for the region.
   To appreciate the real “cost of speed,” the following are average Greek ferry fares at
different vessel speeds1:

       •	 At average 14.1 knots; fare = US$0.37 per nautical mile

       •	 At average 22.4 knots, fare = US$0.66 per nautical mile

   Marine conditions are another key determinant of vessel speed. It is uncomfortable—
and sometimes dangerous—to maintain high speeds in rough waters; particularly when
heading against prevailing winds and currents. Fast ferry operators in the Caribbean
routinely reduce vessel speeds in order to provide their customers with a more comfortable
ride.2

F.5  Ferry Operating Costs
In determining the financial feasibility of a potential ferry system, the assessment needs to
take into account the ferry operating costs. Based on information provided by the shipping
industry experts, in the global shipping industry, operators procure new vessels by one of
two principal methods: outright purchase, or time charter. When a shipping company pur-
chases a vessel outright (either new or second hand), it becomes responsible for all costs
of crewing the vessel, maintenance, annual dry docking, insurance, plus all the other costs
associated with the daily running of the ship. The other method of acquiring tonnage is to
time charter the vessel. Under a time charter arrangement, one shipping company “rents”
a vessel from another shipping company; paying a flat fee to cover all operating costs, plus
financial costs and hopefully a margin of profit. Shipping operators frequently add new ton-
nage via time charters; as this reduces the capital costs associated with fleet expansion.
114	 Driving Tourism in the Eastern Caribbean



   In a situation where a new ferry is being launched, it is important to evaluate whether
acquiring vessels through the time charter route would be a more prudent option or not. Time
charter it would relieve the operator of having to invest large sums of money in purchasing
vessels for a speculative new venture. In addition, if adjustments to the number and type of
vessels are needed after start-up, this could easier be done by changing a time chartered fleet
than by selling owned vessels and buying replacements.
   Based on information provided by shipping industry experts, fast ferries cost more
to operate than traditional slower boats. Faster ferries generally cost more to buy, own,
insure, crew and maintain than slower boats. The new fast catamarans are more expensive
and technically complex than traditional mono-hull ferries. Fast ferry operators in the
Caribbean complain about the high cost of importing engine parts and mechanics to
maintain these vessels. Fast ferries have to be crewed by captains and engineers holding
qualifications from internationally recognized maritime authorities, who are more
expensive than locally recruited crews. Some of these reasons explain why the daily time
charter rate for fast ferries is estimated to be 10 percent higher than traditional slow
ferries.
   In addition to time charter costs on the vessels, a feasibility assessment needs to look
at voyage costs. These include fuel, port charges, clearance fees, agents’ fees, and other
expenses associated with sending a vessel from point A to point B.


F.6  Passenger, Vehicle, and Cargo Forecasts
Passenger forecasts form an important part of the feasibility assessment. Since the ferry
industry is characterized by high fixed costs, the costs per passenger falls rapidly as the
number of passengers increases.
­
   Similarly, the feasibility assessment needs to take into consideration the potential
movement of cargo and vehicles. As mentioned earlier in the paper, current regulations in the
OECS region prohibit the temporary movement of vehicles around the region. In the Greek
ferry system, large Roll-on Roll-off (Ro-Ro) vessels carry a mixture of foot passengers, cars,
trucks and buses; at a ratio of 8.7 foot passengers to every vehicle.


F.7  Sea Conditions
In addition to sailing distances, consideration has to be given to sea conditions. According
to stakeholders, voyages to and from Barbados, located to the east of the Windward and
Leeward island chain, in the rough Atlantic waters would be a challenge. According to
stakeholders, ocean passages from St. Lucia and St. Vincent are the easier crossings to
Barbados; sailing from more southerly directions (e.g., from Grenada or Trinidad and
Tobago), vessels would encounter stiff Atlantic wind and waves head-on, which could
result in a rough ride. For these reasons, even though there is fairly heavy passenger
traffic between Barbados and Trinidad, the feasibility assessment needs to look further
into whether a direct ferry route between both islands would be advisable. For the same
reason, similar assessment needs to be made of the routes between Grenada towards
Barbados.

F.8  Passenger Preferences
Any regional ferry system needs to take into consideration passenger preferences. Preliminary
assessments seem to suggest that Caribbean passengers may prefer shorter sea voyages. For
example, 93.6 percent of trips from Dominica to Martinique are made by ferry—a voyage
of about 1.5 hours. From St. Lucia to Dominica, where the voyage time extends to four-
plus hours, only 39.1 percent of trips from are made by ferry (GOPA 2009). There may, of
course, be other explanations for these patterns, which need to be explored further. As part
of the feasibility assessment, a survey of foreign and local tourists would be important in
determining priorities, as well as an ideal speed for the ferry.
   Another area of preference that a potential survey needs to take into consideration is the
experience of ferry itself. The tour operator survey shows that many tourists are interested
in multi-destination holidays. One enjoyable way of doing so would be by ferry, where the
journey, amid a tropical island setting, becomes a tourist attraction in itself (unlike flying).
A survey of local and international tourists could assess whether, indeed, this would be feasible.

F.9 Preliminary Estimates of Costs, Revenues, and Subsidies for the
     Southern Islands’ Ferry
Given all the considerations discussed above, this section provide some preliminary pro-
jections on the costs, revenues and subsidies for a new ferry system linking the southern
islands—Trinidad, Grenada, St. Vincent, Barbados and St. Lucia, consistent with Map F.2 in
this appendix. It is important to remember that the discussion in this section is on the basis of
rough outline of possible costs and revenues, on the back of stated assumptions. A detailed
analysis and feasibility would be needed before decisions on setting up a regional ferry are
made. For simplicity, the estimates will take into account different scenarios of potential fare
structures and customers’ demand while holding several technical assumptions of the ferry
system fixed. We assume a time charter arrangement for the ferry system since there is high
uncertainty in terms of customer demands at start-up. We will also assume the same type
of vessel (and associated costs) in both scenarios with and without vehicle transportation.
Details on the basic assumptions on the supply side are presented in Table F.5 below.

   Under the assumption above, the ferry system is characterized by constant marginal cost
and average cost that falls rapidly with passenger demand. Figure F.1 below demonstrates
the average cost associated with the Grenada–St. Vincent and St. Lucia–St. Vincent ferries
at different rates of demand. The distance is shorter between St. Lucia and St. Vincent
so the (chartered) cost of running the ferry is lower for the same number of voyages. If
the annual demand is at 5,000 passengers per year, the break-even fares need to be as
high as 366 US$ and 235 US$ for Grenada–St. Vincent and St. Lucia–St. Vincent routes
respectively. However, if demand increases to 20,000 passengers per year, the break-even
fare would fall to 90 US$ and 60 US$ only. For the break-even fares to reach below 100
US$, the annual demand for the Grenada–St. Vincent ferry needs to reach 19,000 per
year, or approximately 16% of Grenada’s total tourist arrival in 2013. If 5% of St. Lucia’s
international tourists3 engage in island-hopping using the ferry, the break-even fare for the
St. Lucia–St. Vincent ferry could fall below 70 US$, which is below 50% of the current
LIAT fare on the same route.
   To understand the effects that passenger demands have on the financial position of the
ferry system, we will consider two target fare structures and different assumptions of tourist
and resident demands associated with them. As discussed in section C above, two potential
ferry fare structures are pricing at around 50% of the air tickets on the same route, or at
35% as the norm in the Greek case. It will be assumed that such a ferry system will induce
20% and 30% of the current LIAT customers on each route to switch to ferry, respectively.4

 St. Lucia and Grenada total tourist arrivals in 2013 are 318,600 and 116,500 respectively.
4
 We do not have direct evidence for the cross-elasticities of ferry and air demand at different prices.
Therefore, we experimented with different assumptions on the percentage of LIAT customers who
will switch to ferry at the two ferry fare structures to understand their implications on aggregate
ferry demand. The two ferry fare structures that we look at are, first, when the ferry fare is at about
50% of LIAT and second, when it is at 35%. When the fare structure is at 50%, based on the
118	 Driving Tourism in the Eastern Caribbean



A rough estimate on international tourists’ demand for the ferry service is derived from the
travel agent survey (see Appendix C) as well as the number of tourist arrivals in 2013 in
each country. The assumption, based on the survey results is that an additional 7.65% of
regional tourists and 8.5% additional international tourists can be expected to engage in
island hopping.5 To be more conservative, we use two scenarios that for each country, 2% or
5% of the current tourist arrival will be engaging in island hopping using the ferry services.
We further assume that as is the norm in Greece, about 10% of passengers will take vehicles
in the scenarios where vehicle transport is feasible. These assumptions result in the demand
estimates presented in Table F.6 below.
   Table F.7 presents estimates on the aggregate profitability of the ferry system using
the assumptions and scenarios presented above. It is clear that profits are higher when
vehicles can be taken on board. Under the current assumptions, setting ferry price at 50%
of the air fare is the preferable option. In the best case scenario where demand for island
hopping can be expected to reach 5% of the current tourist arrivals and vehicles can be
taken on board (scenario 1B with vehicles), total annual profit of the ferry system exceeds
1.8 mil US$. However, if only 2% will engage in island hopping, subsidies will be required
in all cases.
   The above estimates present several plausible scenarios and indicate that there is
potential for a profitable ferry system. However, subsidies might also be needed especially
in the first few years if demand is slow to pick up. These estimates ignore several important
considerations, including seasonality of demand which can further reduce profitability.
A feasibility study will need to take into account all the issues that have been discussed so
far. In addition, an important factor to consider is whether an efficient tendering scheme



table above, the aggregate ferry demand, calculated as the total of demand from LIAT customers
who switch to ferry, as well as from new international tourists, on all routes, is at 40–64% of
the aggregate LIAT demand on all routes (For this calculation, we use the assumption that the
new LIAT demand equals old LIAT demand, less the number of customers switching to ferry, or
227907-45581 = 182326. The aggregate ferry demand in 2 scenarios are 45581+28346=73927
and 45581+70865=116446 respectively. In other words, the ratio of new LIAT demand to ferry
demands are 40% and 64% respectively). Using the same approach, when the fare structure is
at 35% of LIAT fare, the aggregate ferry demand, based on the above table, is at 60–87% of
the aggregate LIAT demand on all routes. We consider these assumptions to be conservative,
given the evidence on an existing route with both air and direct ferry services in the OECS
(St. Lucia-Martinique): When the ferry fare is at 70% of the average airfare, then the number of
trips made by ferry is 250% the number of trips made by air (GOPA 2009). Relative ferry demand
compared to air demand is lower under both our assumptions than in the OECS case even though
the fare structure is such that the ferry to air fare ratio is lower in both our scenarios compared
to the OECS.

  Out of all responders, 76.5% indicate that a regional ferry can increase international tourists by
more than 10% for multi-destination travel, while 23.5% think that the increase will be between
0 and 10%. The expected increase in demand could be estimated as a weighted average of these
([76.5%*10%]+[23.5%*0]). The same methodology has been used for calculating regional tourists.
Given the sample size, response rate and nature of the survey, these numbers should be taken with a
lot of caution.
