KEY MESSAGES
The national HIV response in Belarus includes several priority prevention and treatment
programs. However, the country could increase the impact of its investment through a
combination of measures:

   Optimizing allocations of the same amount of funding available that was in 2013
    (US$20 million) over 2015–20 could reduce new HIV infections by 7 percent and
    deaths by 25 percent.
   Doubling the investment in high-impact programs would require approximately US$29.5
    million and would achieve a remarkable reduction in new infections by 43 percent and
    in deaths by 51 percent over 2015–20 compared to 2013 allocations, at a cost of
    US$4,700 for an infection averted and US$12,300 for a death averted.
   Further strengthening the focus on and scaling up antiretroviral therapy (ART) are at
    the center of optimized allocations. These allocations will increase ART coverage to 60
    percent of people living with AIDS (PLHIV) and are predicted to achieve a 50 percent
    reduction in deaths and contribute to minimizing new infections.
   Scaling up prevention for key populations—particularly harm reduction for people who
    inject drugs (PWID) (including needle and syringe exchange programs and Opiate
    Substitution Therapy (OST)—is a core element of all optimized allocations.
   To finance the required scale-up of ART and prevention for key populations, a combination
    of increased domestic financing and exploring technical efficiencies is required.
    Reviewing unit costs for programs and the 52 percent of HIV funds that goes into
    management and other costs could contribute to achieve higher coverage with available
    resources.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
As part of a regional initiative, in 2014–15 Belarus conducted an HIV AE analysis to inform
more strategic investment in HIV programs.

Nevertheless, Belarus continues to experience a growing epidemic, which, however, is
projected to remain concentrated in key populations. People who inject drugs (PWID)
continue to account for approximately 50 percent of new infections. Moreover, although
transmission is shifting toward sexual transmission, even in 2030 (assuming constant
program coverage and behaviors), over 33 percent of infections are projected to remain
among PWID.

In Belarus in the early 2000s, the HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men
(MSM) was relatively small. However, according to Optima estimates, MSM have become
a rapidly growing segment of the epidemic and, by 2030, are projected to account for 1 in 7
new infections according to Optima. The epidemic among female sex workers (FSW) and
clients accounts for approximately 1 in 10 new infections, and this share is projected to remain
stable.

Large proportions of HIV acquisition in the general population in Belarus likely are due
indirectly to transmission in three key populations: female sexual partners of men who
inject drugs, MSM, and clients of sex workers.

Different optimization and scenario analyses were carried out in this allocative efficiency
(AE) study.

The first consistent finding of these analyses was the critical role of scaling up ART,
which will substantially impact both incidence and deaths. The Optima model suggests that
ART can be scaled up through increased initiation of PLHIV already known to be HIV positive
and increased HIV testing and counseling (HTC) for key populations. HIV testing for the
general population was not found to be among the most cost-effective strategies for initiating
treatment.

A second consistent finding is the continued need for scaling up HIV services for people
who inject drugs. From an HIV prevention perspective, needle and syringe exchange
programs will be the most cost-effective investment to further reduce rates of needle-sharing.
However, beyond them, OST has critical benefits for HIV prevention, treatment adherence, and
health in general so should be scaled up as well.

A third consistent finding is that Belarus could increase the impact of its HIV program by
reallocating funds to high-impact programs. It could enhance this impact by increasing the
total funding available to the HIV response so that high-impact programs could be scaled up
further. With optimized allocations of the same amount of funding available as in 2013
(US$19.7 million), over 2015–20, new HIV infections could be reduced by 7 percent and
deaths by 25 percent.

    The analyses also established the optimized mix and cost of programs to achieve national
    targets, which for the purpose of this exercise were defined as impact targets for HIV
    incidence and deaths: reducing incidence by 45 percent, reducing deaths by 65 percent,
    and reducing MTCT to below 1 percent. The analyses suggest that, to fully achieve national
    targets, approximately US$58 million will be required, which is nearly 3 times current
    investment. The large funding requirement for fully achieving national targets is driven
    primarily by the very large necessity for HTC to achieve the specified ART coverage.
    Considering available funding and given unit costs, fully achieving current targets is ambitious.

    Doubling the investment in high-impact programs would require 148 percent of total 2013
    spending (US$29.5 million). However, compared to 2013 allocations, over 2015–20, the
    148 percent would achieve a remarkable reduction in new infections by 43 percent and in
    deaths by 51 percent.

    In this optimized allocation, there would be substantial increases in ART, NSP, and OST
    allocations in both amount and percentage. Allocations for MSM and FSW programs would
    increase in amounts, but would remain at approximately the same percentage levels as in
    2013. Behavioral change and communication (BCC) programs would be defunded; HTC,
    PMTCT, and management cost would remain stable. This result is particularly relevant from a
    policy perspective because it would substantially impact both incidence and deaths. By 2020,
    10,000 new infections and 5,100 deaths could be averted as compared to business as
    usual (2013 levels of allocations).

    If unit costs and management cost in all program areas could be reduced by 32 percent2
    without a loss in service quality, the same results cited above (reduction in new infections by
    43 percent and in deaths by 51 percent) could be achieved at the level of total 2013 spending.
    However, such a substantial reduction in unit cost may not be realistic, and additional
    technical efficiency analysis would be required to determine the extent of possible unit cost


    2   32% is the reduction in cost required to offset a 48% increase in resource need (32% = 100%–100%/148%).

reductions. Therefore, other options including additional resource mobilization could be
considered.

These options could include looking for other funding sources for programs such as STI control
and blood safety that have major benefits beyond HIV. In practice, the most promising option
for achieving these additional impacts would be a combination of measures: more focused
allocations; increased investment; reduced unit costs in some programs; and identification of
alternative and cofinancing from non-HIV budget lines for programs such as STI control, blood
safety, and OST. Between 2010 and 2012, Belarus increased the proportion of government
spending on health to over 13 percent, thereby allocating more to health than the 2012 global
average of 11.7 percent. Despite increases in both its domestic and international funding for
the HIV response, in a regional comparison, Belarus’ overall levels of HIV funding are low
relative to the size of its epidemic.3




3   In 2013 Belarus spent US$800 per estimated number of PLHIV in a range of 490 –2,201 in 6 countries of the
    Region. This figure was arrived at by dividing the total spending included in the country Optima spreadsheet by
    the total number of PLHIV according to global HIV estimates as per UNAIDS (2014).

1.       INTRODUCTION
1.1      Need for allocative efficiency
Globally, HIV programs are faced with the need to scale up prevention and provide treatment
to a larger number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) than ever before. In the current
environment of increasingly limited resources for HIV responses, focused design and efficiency
in program delivery are essential to ensure that programs can do more with less.

In the 2011 United Nations Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS, countries agreed to reduce
sexual and injection-related transmission by 50 percent, virtually eliminate mother-to-child-
transmission (MTCT), initiate 80 percent of eligible people living with HIV (PLHIV) on
treatment, and end HIV-related discrimination by 2015 (UNGASS 2011). The 2014 UNAIDS’
Gap Report illustrated that substantial additional efforts will be required in most countries to
achieve these targets. Despite the progress made since 2010, HIV remains among the
unfinished agenda items in the 2000 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that was
transitioned in the Sustainable Development Goal 3.3 (SDGs).4

Against this background, UNAIDS globally defined a Fast-Track strategy to achieve the goal of
Ending AIDS by 2030 (UNAIDS 2014b). A core element of the Fast-Track approach are the 90-
90-90 targets (UNAIDS 2014d). Their goals are that, by 2030, 90 percent of all PLHIV are
diagnosed; 90 percent of diagnosed PLHIV are on ART; and 90 percent of PLHIV on ART are
virally suppressed. The Fast-Track approach also emphasizes the necessity to focus on the
geographic areas and communities in the world that are most affected by HIV and
recommends that resources be concentrated on the programs that have shown the greatest
impact.

In this context, UNAIDS and cosponsors globally are promoting a shift toward investment
thinking in the design of HIV responses to maximize the impact of program investment and
best realize the long-term health and economic benefits of HIV programs. A number of
countries are developing investment cases to understand HIV epidemics as well as to design,
deliver, and sustain effective HIV responses. The investment cases are complemented with a
human-rights-based approach to health care. To support HIV investment cases, a group of
countries in the World Bank’s ECA Region are conducting AE analyses. In 2014–15, these
analyses were carried out in Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, and
Ukraine as well as in a number of countries outside the ECA Region ( Republic of Tajikistan
2014). This report summarizes the results of these analyses for policy makers, program
leaders, and technical experts in Belarus.

2                                                  Optimizing investments in Belarus for the national HIV response



    The concept of allocative efficiency (AE) refers to the maximization of health outcomes using
    the least costly mix of health interventions.5 HIV allocative efficiency studies generally try to
    answer the question “How can HIV funding be optimally allocated to the combination of HIV
    response interventions that will yield the highest impact?” This concept is critical not only to
    maximize current and future impact. The concept also is an integral element of transitioning to
    full domestic financing and sustainability of the response because a response that is
    allocatively and technically efficient will be easier to sustain.

    There is wide consensus that, in many settings, better outcomes could be achieved with a given
    amount of HIV funding, or that given outcomes could be achieved with less HIV funding if
    resources were distributed optimally or resources were used in the most efficient ways.

    1.2      Objectives of the analysis
    In its National Strategic Plan (NSP), Belarus has set the priorities for its HIV response by 2020.
    Key targets include:

        ART is being provided to 80 percent of the estimated number of PLHIV in need of ART in
         2020
        HIV transmission from mother to child is less than 1 percent
        No cases of HIV transmission occur during blood transfusion and transplantation
        Thirty percent of the estimated number of PWID using opioids (estimated at 18,450) and
         10 percent of the estimated number of PWID (of 75,000) are covered by the OST program
        100 percent of key affected populations’ representatives (PWID, MSM, FSW, MSW)
         receiving HIV prevention services are covered by TB screening and referred to TB
         institutions
        Coverage of key affected populations by HIV prevention programs is increased:
        ∙ PWID – Up to 60 percent of estimated size
        ∙ FSW – Up to 45 percent of estimated size
        ∙ MSM – Up to 40 percent of estimated size
        Coverage of key affected populations by HIV testing and counseling is increased:
        ∙ PWID – Up to 44 percent of estimated size
        ∙ FSW – Up to 25 percent of estimated size
        ∙ MSM – Up to 16 percent of estimated size
        90 percent referral and linkage to care is provided to key affected populations (PWID,
         MSM, FSW, MSW) who visit HIV prevention services
        Morbidity of HIV associated TB is decreased
        100 percent of health care workers doing invasive procedures are provided with modern
         individual protection
        100 percent of donor blood is tested for HIV with ELISA and PCR using NUT technologies
        80 percent of youth in school are covered by HIV prevention programs.
    These output and outcome targets translate into the following impact targets:



    5   Technically, allocative efficiency can be achieved within a fixed budget envelope (maximize impact with given
        amount of money) or within defined impact targets (minimize cost to achieve a given impact).
Introduction                                                                                                        3



    Incidence (2013) was 12 per 100,000 people per year (overall population), and the target
     is 7 per 100,000 per year by 2020:
    Equivalent to a 45% decrease in incidence by 2020.
    AIDS-related deaths (2013) were 2.8 per 100,000 per year (overall population) and the
     target is to keep AIDS-related deaths below 1.0 per 100,000 per year (overall population).
    ∙ Equivalent to approximately 65 percent decrease in deaths.6
Given the limited resources available, additional prioritization based on in-depth AE analysis
was conducted to redefine program coverage targets for maximum impact with different
scenarios of resource availability, and to support additional operational planning and
budgeting.

The findings of this study will assist the Government of Belarus to strengthen its HIV
investment case, through which it attempts to increase effectiveness of HIV investments and
define corresponding priorities, strategies, and impacts of the response. The national HIV
allocative efficiency study was designed to answer the following main questions:

1. How can Belarus optimize the allocation of its current HIV funding?
2. What might be gained from increased investment in HIV programming?
3. What is the minimum expenditure required to meet national targets and how should
   funds be allocated to achieve the targets?
4. What are the health and financial impacts of implementing different ART
   guidelines?




6   After the modelling was carried out, the targets were revised using 2014 data: HIV incidence (2014) is 20 per
    100,000, and target by 2020 is 15 per 100,000.

    From 1995 to 2012, the level of health spending in Belarus fluctuated. It declined from 1995 to
    2009, reaching its lowest point in 2008 at 7.9 percent. The level peaked in 2010 with 13.4
    percent (Figure 2.1) and remained consistently above 13.0 percent between 2010 and 2012.
    The proportion of government health expenditure in 2012 was also above the global average
    of 11.7 percent.

    In Belarus, 80 percent of health expenditure is incurred by government (Figure 2.2). Twenty
    percent of expenses is private and out-of-pocket. In the late 1990’s and early 2000’s, the
    contribution of nonprofit organizations exceeded 5.0 percent of total health spending, but,
    after 2009, their share declined. In 2012 nonprofit organizations and private insurance
    accounted for less than 1.0 percent of health expenditure.

Since the mid-2000’s, external assistance to Belarus increased, peaking in 2010 at US$134.8
million (Figure 2.3). Health, population policies, and HIV/AIDS accounted for 5.3 percent –14.9
percent of all external assistance. HIV/AIDS has been a key focus of external assistance to the
health sector and, in some years, exceeded all other support to health and population policies.
In 2012 external support to Belarus for HIV/AIDS was US$6.9 million and all other support to
health US$7.6 million.

The majority of HIV funding is through the public sector, which accounted for 63 percent of
expenditure on HIV in 2012 (Figure 2.4). International partners financed 37 percent of all HIV
spending. Compared to overall health spending, a larger proportion of HIV expenditure is
externally funded. Unlike for general health spending, private spending on HIV/AIDS does not
play a significant role. It is assumed that there are out-of-pocket expenses for items including
condoms and needles in pharmacies, which are not recorded here. The Global Fund is the
major external funding partner for Belarus’ HIV response, providing 95 percent of HIV funding
in 2012 (Figure 2.5).

The total funding envelope available in Belarus for HIV programs increased gradually from
2011 to 2013. This increase occurred despite a 37 percent decline in international funding
over the same period and was due mainly to a 62 percent increase in government funding in
2013 (Figure 2.4).

    Of the overall budget allocated to fight the HIV epidemic in 2013, 24 percent was used to fund
    treatment and care programs for PLHIV. Although 61 percent of ARV treatment costs were
    borne by the government, no government funds were utilized for ARV drug costs.

3.     METHODOLOGY
This section outlines the main steps taken and tools applied to carry out the analyses
presented in this report. Additional details are available in the appendixes.

3.1    Optima Model
To carry out the analyses, the partners used Optima, a mathematical model of HIV
transmission and disease progression integrated with an economic and program analysis
framework. Optima uses HIV epidemic modeling techniques and incorporates evidence on
biological transmission probabilities, detailed infection progression, sexual-mixing patterns
and drug-injection behaviors. In consultation with in-country experts, Optima was calibrated
to HIV prevalence data points available from the different subpopulations (such as female sex
workers, injecting drug users, and men who have sex with men), and to data points on the
number of people on ART.

To assess how incremental changes in spending affect HIV epidemics and determine an
optimized funding allocation, the model parameterizes relationships among the cost of HIV
intervention programs, the coverage level attained by these programs and the resulting
outcomes. These relationships are specific to the country, population, and prevention program
being considered.

Using the relationships among cost, coverage, and outcome in combination with Optima’s
epidemic module, it is possible to calculate how incremental changes in the funding level
allocated to each program will impact on overall epidemic outcomes. Furthermore, by using a
mathematical optimization algorithm, Optima is able to determine an optimized allocation of
funding across different HIV programs (appendix A).

3.2    Analytical framework
The study was conceptualized by a regional steering group involving The Global Fund, UNAIDS,
UNDP, and convened by the World Bank. A national technical group convened by UNAIDS in
collaboration with government was formed. Country-specific objectives of the analysis and
parameters were outlined in a Scope of Work document. Epidemiological, program, and cost
data were collected by in-country experts with technical support from international partners
using an adapted MS-Excel-based Optima data entry spreadsheet. In November 2014, a
regional mathematical modelling workshop was conducted in Yerevan, Armenia. In this
workshop, national experts and specialists from international partners including the Global
Fund, UNAIDS, UNDP and the World Bank worked together with mathematical modelers from
UNSW to carry out modelling analyses using the Matlab software package. This regional
process also aimed at data comparison, exchange, quality assurance, and development of
capacities in HIV epidemic and response analysis using mathematical modelling techniques.
Preliminary results then consulted on with government experts and other in-country partners
and summarized in this report.

     Optima is a flexible model that enables the user to decide which populations, programs, time
     frames, and funding levels to consider in a country analysis. Table 3.1 summarizes the main
     parameters, which were identified based on contextual, epidemiological, national strategy,
     program, and funding information; and agreed with in-country stakeholders.

     Note: * = A comprehensive four-pronged approach to PMTCT includes additional elements such as provision
     of contraception. For the vast majority of women in this concentrated epidemic setting, the primary purpose of
     contraception is not PMTCT but pregnancy prevention. Thus, it was decided not to include cost in relation to
     contraception in this analysis (apart from the cost for condom promotion for key populations covered in FSW,
     MSM, and PWID programs). The same logic applies to other related services.
Methodology                                                                                                    11



Populations include key populations, which are defined around the dominant factor
influencing HIV acquisition; and general populations, which are disaggregated by age and sex.
Programs were divided in two categories:

1. Direct programs, which directly affect HIV incidence or deaths and which therefore could
   be included in the mathematical optimization analysis
2. Indirect programs, which are cross-cutting expenses or have indirect or unclear effects
   on health outcomes and were not included in the mathematical optimization.
Within direct programs, some service packages target specific key populations (FSW, MSM,
and PWID). Others (HTC, ART, PMTCT) cut across all populations including key populations.

Based on program spending per person reached, cost-coverage outcome relations were
developed. Calibrations and cost-coverage outcome relations were produced in collaboration
with experts from Belarus (appendixes B and C).

The costs per person reached were derived from 2013 program spending and coverage data
(Table 3.2). These costs are not strictly comparable among countries, particularly for
prevention programs, whose packages differ. In other words, higher unit cost may not
necessarily mean lower technical efficiency but also could mean a more comprehensive
package. Costs per person reached in Belarus are below regional average and median costs for
most programs except PWID-NSP programs. Additional analysis would be required to
determine in which areas technical efficiencies could be realized.

3.3      Limitations of analysis


     There are some gaps in data, particularly for the general population. As in other models,
      estimates of HIV prevalence in the general population were derived from data in pregnant
      women as a proxy for prevalence in the general population.
     For this analysis, standard classification of cost data in line with National AIDS Spending
      Assessments (NASA) was used. However, there are differences in program packages among
      countries, which limit comparability of findings.
     As the basis for determining program cost, the analysis used past ratios of expenditure to
      coverage, rather than unit costs from a costing of future programs. Using past cost and
      results has a number of advantages over using projected costs from plans and budgets,
      which ultimately, are predictions of future cost. However, the method applied also has a
12                                                   Optimizing investments in Belarus for the national HIV response



          disadvantage because there may be future increases or decreases in cost in relation to new
          approaches, implementation arrangements, or technologies.
         The modeling approach used to calculate relative cost effectiveness among programs
          included assumptions around the impact of increases or decreases in funding for
          programs. These assumptions were based on unit costs and observed ecological
          relationships among outcomes of program coverage or risk behavior and the amount of
          money spent on programs in the past. This model also assumed that increased spending
          would result in some saturation.
         The analysis did not determine the technical efficiency of programs. Gains in technical
          efficiency would lead to different unit costs and therefore affect resource allocation.
         Modelling the optimization of allocative efficiencies depends critically on the availability of
          evidence-based parametric estimates of the effectiveness of individual interventions.
          Although these estimates were derived from a global systematic literature review,7 they
          may vary in specific countries and populations depending on various factors, particularly
          the levels of adherence to interventions. All programs and spending categories for which
          such parameters cannot be obtained, such as enablers and synergies, could not be included
          in the mathematical optimization. Nevertheless, because they still have important
          functions in the HIV response, they have been treated as fixed costs and, in specific
          scenarios, adjusted with specific justifications.
         Effects outside the HIV endpoints are complex to consider (including non-health benefits
          of OST, effects of needle exchange on hepatitis, and effects of condoms on contraception
          and STIs). Given that, for OST, the majority of benefits exceed HIV outcomes, specific
          consideration was given to consider the non-HIV benefits of OST (appendix A). However,
          given the complexity of interactions between interventions and their non-HIV benefits, this
          approach was applied only for OST. Similarly, the model does not seek to quantify human
          rights; stigma and discrimination; or ethical, legal, or psychosocial implications, but
          acknowledges that these are important aspects to be considered.
         Different models may not always produce exactly the same projections as those produced
          by Optima. The partners used the best possible data, the combined experience from model
          application in over 20 countries, and regional comparison and validation of inputs through
          comparison among different sources including data from clinical records, surveillance, and
          research.

     Based on the available data, the model was calibrated as described in appendix B and
     produced the HIV epidemic estimates summarized in Table 4.2 and Figure 4.1. The estimates
     suggest that, in 2014, there were 22,600 PLHIV in Belarus, a number that was consistent with
     the registered number of PLHIV, and moderately lower than the estimated number of PLHIV in
     the Global HIV Estimates based on Spectrum (25,000). The estimated number of new
     infections in 2014 was 2,900 (2,700 in Spectrum) and AIDS-related deaths approximately
     1,000 (<1000 in Spectrum, 1,200 as upper bound). Both figures are within the confidence
     bounds of Spectrum estimates.

Understanding HIV transmission dynamics and modes of transmission is a critical foundation
for developing HIV responses. Figure 4.1 describes the breakdown of PLHIV, new infections,
and deaths in Belarus among different sub-populations. PWID account for approximately 50
percent of new infections. However, only just over 33 percent of PLHIV are PWID, and fewer
than 33 percent of AIDS-related deaths are among PWID, which is explained by the higher
background mortality among PWID from non-AIDS-related causes.

4.2 What are the expected trends in the epidemic if current
conditions are maintained?
The analysis carried out in Optima assumed the maintenance of current conditions, defined as
stable behaviors and stable coverage of programs.

The model estimated the evolution of annual new HIV infections (2000–30) in each
subpopulation. With current coverage of programs, Belarus’ HIV epidemic is predicted to grow
from an estimated 2,900 new infections per year in 2014 to approximately 4,500 in 2030
(Table 4.3). People who inject drugs continue to account for the single largest segment of new
HIV infections. The number of new infections among PWID is projected to continue growing.
However, their share of new infections is projected to decline over time from approximately 67
percent of all new infections in 2000 to approximately 50 percent of all new infections in 2015
to approximately one third in 2030. The epidemic among female sex workers and their clients
contributes just over 10 percent of all new infections, and the FSW epidemic’s relative
importance in the epidemic overall is projected to be stable.

     The epidemic among MSM contributed only a relatively small fraction of new infections
     between 2000 and 2010, but in 2013 contributed approximately 7.0 percent of new infections.
     The available HIV prevalence data suggested an increase in HIV prevalence among MSM from
     3.1 percent in 2008 to 6.2 percent in 2013. Considering the level of risk behavior and current
     service coverage, the model projects that the MSM epidemic will be the fastest growing
     component of the HIV epidemic. After 2025, the number of new infections in MSM is predicted
     to exceed the number in sex work settings. Female adults account for the second largest share
     of new infections received after PWID. However, this group is less involved in transmitting
     HIV, but acquires HIV infections from male sexual partners including PWID, former PWID,
     clients of FSW, and bisexual MSM (Figure 4.2).

     HIV incidence rates in 1,000 person years are shown in Figure 4.3. Throughout 2000 –30, HIV
     incidence will remain highest among people who inject drugs (PWID). This result suggests
     that, based on current projections, drug-injecting behavior is likely to remain a dominant risk
     factor. HIV incidence rates among FSW and their clients will grow only moderately. In contrast,
     based on projections of current trends, HIV incidence rates among MSM are expected to grow
     rapidly.

4.3 How will outcomes improve by optimizing allocations
under the current funding level?
Optimization analyses were carried out for different funding levels and different policy
questions in line with the agreed Scope of Work document. Results show some differences in
nuances for different policy questions but also indicate some overarching trends. When
interpreting the results, one should note that all management cost and other cost for related
health services were kept stable and were not included in the mathematical optimization
(appendix A). All optimization analyses suggest that there is room for substantial
improvement of current allocations among the program areas as detailed below.

The first optimization presented here describes optimized allocations with constant funding at
the 2013 HIV spending level available up to 2020.

4.3.1. Optimized allocations at the current level of spending
The optimization analysis in Figure 4.4 shows results for current funding volume (2013
expenditure) allocated optimally to minimize both HIV incidence and HIV-related deaths. In
line with country guidance, a weighting of 40–60 was applied for new HIV infections averted
versus HIV-related deaths averted.

This analysis suggests that, if current funding and current unit costs are maintained, the
highest impact programs in Belarus would be ART and prevention programs for PWID
including needle-syringe and OST programs.

                                                    KEY MESSAGE
would be substantial: they would achieve a 25
percent reduction as compared to current With current funding, unit cost, and
allocations. However, the effect on new assumptions of fixed costs, the effect on
infections would only be 7 percent as averting deaths and new infections would be
compared to current allocations and therefore highest if ART and prevention for PWID

                                                    allocations, optimized allocations would

epidemiological impact due to low prevalence

from a modelling perspective, either initiating
already diagnosed PLHIV on ART or providing
HTC within programs for key populations would be more cost effective. In practical terms, HTC
certainly still would be required. However, what the model suggests is that, as long as the
resources remain insufficient to initiate more people on ART after HTC , scaling up HTC to the
general population would not be as cost effective as scaling up ART and programs for PWID
(which include HTC).

Similarly, at current funding levels, prevention programs for MSM and FSW would not be part
of optimized allocations. However, given the epidemiological role of these groups these
programs remain important to sustain. What happens in the mathematical optimization is that,
the limited funding would be absorbed by ART and programs for PWID, which, with the given
assumptions, would be more cost effective in averting deaths and new infections. If the total

       level of funding cannot be increased, this would imply that unit costs of programs would need
       to be reduced to cover essential programs. The analysis treated a large proportion of HIV-
       related cost as fixed cost (see Figure 4.6, pie segments shaded in grey and red for PMTCT) in
       the mathematical optimization and savings could also be identified within these programs.

       4.3.2. Program coverage with optimized allocations at current levels of spending
       The allocations in Figure 4.5 correspond to the coverage levels expressed in Table 4.3 for the
       priority programs. Table 4.43 illustrates that, due to the larger weight on averting deaths and
       the dual effect of ART on incidence and deaths, coverage of ART would increase most
       substantially. PMTCT coverage would remain high because the cost was treated as fixed.
       Coverage of NSP programs would more than double, while OST programs would increase six-
       fold. As mentioned above, with these increases, given unit costs and the high fixed cost, there
       would not be any funding left for other programs.

Note: * = As explained in the narrative these programs remain important from an epidemiological point of
view and should continue to be provided. Therefore there is need to increase overall funding for the HIV
response or reduce unit costs; ** = HIV testing and counselling would continue to be provided as part of
programs for key populations. Also, other persons requesting to be tested for HIV should continue to receive
the service, even if they are not part of key populations. What the model suggests is that from a cost-
effectiveness perspective expanded testing for the general population is not among the most cost-effective
programs if no additional resources are available.

In this analysis, cost amounts for indirect programs and PMTCT were kept fixed. Table 4.5
breaks down the cost of programs that were not included in the optimization and that account
for US$10.5 million, or 52 percent, of all HIV spending. Management costs account for only 10
percent of these costs, or 5 percent of total HIV response costs. The largest proportion of these
other costs go to STI control and blood safety as well as training and management.

4.4 What might be gained from increased funding and how
should reduced funding be prioritized?
The optimization of current funding (Error! Reference source not found.4.4) shows that
reallocating current funding would improve outcomes but would be insufficient to achieve
high coverage levels and impact for all key segments of the epidemic. The optimization results
( in Figure 4.5 show optimized allocations at different budget levels. Total HIV spending per

       PLHIV was US$800 in 2013 in Belarus, which was below average compared to other countries
       in the region, in which allocative efficiency analyses were conducted.8 Therefore, it is relevant
       to explore how larger amounts of funding could be allocated optimally.

Although the likelihood is small that the country will move immediately to either 0 percent or
200 percent of funding, this analysis is helpful in understanding an epidemic’s dynamics in
relationship to the level of programmatic investments. (1) The analysis shows which services
are the most essential in case of reduced funding. (2) It shows to what extent the same impact
could be achieved with less funding. (3) The analysis illustrates whether additional investment
would lead to saturation of impact or whether additional large gains could be made with
additional investment. (4) Scenarios in which higher coverage and impact are achieved with
more funding also are useful as starting points from which to discuss implementation
efficiency: how to achieve the same coverage and impact with lower funding.

The analysis of allocations and impact at different funding levels also has four important
implications. (1) It suggests that current allocations are making a significant impact compared
to zero spending. (2) At current levels of spending, a substantial impact on averting deaths
could be achieved with a better focus on ART, but the effect on HIV incidence would be limited.
(3) At 150 percent of current spending on direct programs, optimization suggests an
additional increase of ART as well as a substantial increase of funding for PWID. (4) At 200
percent of current spending on direct programs, allocations for ART would increase further
and, in addition to funding for PWID programs, allocations for FSW and MSM programs would
be part of the optimized mix.

Table 4.6 summarizes the different allocation amounts and corresponding programmatic
impacts. Increasing allocations to 150 percent of spending on direct programs (124 percent of
total 2013 spending) would reduce deaths by 42 percent and reduce incidence by 30 percent,
mainly by increasing allocations to programs for PWID and ART. Since management and other
costs already account for over 50 percent of HIV response costs, it was assumed that these
programs and PMTCT would continue at their current funding levels. In practice, this
assumption would require additional, more nuanced analysis because some management costs
are expected to grow with scale, while other areas will develop technical efficiencies.

     Table 4.6 demonstrates that higher investment (150 percent and 200 percent of current
     program spending) would produce substantial additional impacts. The effects of such
     increased allocations is elaborated in Figure 4.6. It illustrates the optimized allocations if the
     amount invested in direct programs is doubled while management and other fixed cost
     (including PMTCT) remain stable. This optimized and increased allocation equals 148 percent
     of 2013 spending (far right column in Table 4.5).

     This optimized allocation would enable substantial increases in ART, NSP, and OST allocations
     in both amount and percentage. Allocations for MSM and FSW programs would increase in
     amounts but remain at approximately the same percentage levels as in 2013. HTC would
     remain stable at US$2.4 million. This optimized allocation would achieve a remarkable

In this optimized allocation, the annual cost for direct programs is US$19.1 million. The total
annual cost for the HIV response US$29.5 million, which is 48 percent more than was spent in
2013. One way to achieve the same results at lower cost would be to reduce unit costs of
programs. If unit costs and management cost in all program areas could be reduced by 32
percent9 without a loss in service quality, equal results could be achieved at the level of total
2013 spending. However, although examples for lower unit costs for specific programs do exist
in the region, such a substantial reduction may not be realistic. Regional comparison of
program costs has great limitations because coverage and cost definitions vary among
countries. However, available data suggests that, in many program areas, cost is already below
both the regional average and median costs in Belarus. Additional technical efficiency analysis
would be required to determine the extent of possible additional unit cost reductions.
Therefore, other options, including additional resource mobilization, could be considered.
Another option would be to look for other funding sources for programs, such as STI control,
that have major benefits beyond HIV. In practice, the most promising option for achieving
these additional impacts would be a combination of measures: improved allocation mix,
increased allocations, reduced unit costs, and identification of alternative and cofinancing from
non-HIV budget lines for programs such as STI control and OST.

4.5      How much does it cost to achieve national targets?
The optimizations presented so far in this report are seeking optimized spending at different
funding levels. In other words, they are seeking the best health impact on new infections and
deaths with different given amounts of money. The following optimization results are based on
a different approach. They explore the optimized mix to achieve a given impact target in line
with national targets at the lowest possible cost. Based on a discussion with experts from



9   The reduction in cost required to set off a 48% increase in resource need is 32% (32% = 100% –100%/148%).

     Belarus, two different sets of targets were modelled: one moderate set of targets and one more
     ambitious set of targets aligned to national targets and international commitments.

     For the purpose of optimization analysis, it is not useful to include the full set of coverage
     targets as outlined in section 1. Coverage targets constrain the optimization analysis, which
     would be forced to meet the spending requirements for all programs to meet coverage targets
     rather than to identify the optimized mix and minimum amount required to meet national
     targets. Therefore, impact targets were used in this analysis and formulated as described in
     Table 4.7.

     4.5.1. Optimized allocations and cost to achieve moderate targets: stabilize the
             epidemic
     The results in this section show the minimal spending required to achieve moderate targets by
     2020, which was a main result requested by the Belarus country team. Achieving moderate
     targets would require an increase in programmatic spending from US$9.5 million–$14.8
     million (Table 4.7, Figure 4.7). The increased investment would go primarily to ART, prevention
     programs for female sex workers and MSM, NSP, and OST. In addition, a large proportion of
     funds for general-population HTC and BCC programs would need to be reallocated toward
     them. In this analysis, management and other costs as well as PMTCT were assumed to remain
     stable for the same reasons as outlined above. As a result of this allocation, new HIV infections
     would remain below the baseline value of 2,900 new infections in 2014 over 2015–20.

4.5.2. Optimized allocations and cost to achieve national targets
The optimized mix of programs to achieve national targets (reduce incidence by 45 percent,
reduce deaths by 65 percent, reduce MTCT to below 1 percent) is presented in Figure 4.8. The
analysis suggests that, to fully achieve national targets, approximately US$58 million will be
required. This large funding requirement is driven primarily by the very large need for HTC
(US$17.1 million), which, together with the allocation to treatment (US$13.1 million), would
absorb 51 percent of all HIV spending. Programs for PWID would absorb another 16 percent of
resources (NSP US$5.9 million and OST US$3.2 million). These allocations will reduce
cumulative deaths by 62 percent and new infections by 64 percent. These results also imply
that, due to the dual effects of ART on survival and averting new infections, achieving a large
mortality reduction will over-achieve the target to reduce HIV incidence.

The analysis suggests that full achievement of national targets requires over 230 percent more
funding than do moderate targets (US$25.2 million). The allocation for doubling spending on
direct programs (US$29.5 million) described in section 4.3 (Figure 4.6) reduced incidence by
43 percent and deaths by 51 percent. For this reason, and it could be argued that the national
targets may be overly ambitious within the given ti.me frame, unless unit costs can be reduced
or budgets increased substantially.

     4.6       Efficiency gains from optimized allocations
     This section explores the financial implications and gains from different allocations as
     developed in previous sections.

     As summarized in Table 4.6 “business as usual” using 2013 allocations would mean an
     estimated 23,300 new infections and 10,000 HIV-related deaths between 2015 and 2020.
     Optimally allocating the same amount of funding (without any cost increases or technical
     efficiency gains) would imply 21,700 new infections and 7,500 deaths, that is, a reduction in
     deaths by 25 percent and in new infections by 7 percent. Table 4.9 shows the costs per
     additional infection and death averted for 3 different allocations. The lowest cost per infection
     and death averted can be achieved by doubling spending on direct programs (to?
     approximately US$29.5 million). Aiming for very high coverage and more ambitious impact
     targets makes programs more costly again. The reason is that increasing coverage becomes
     more expensive when approaching saturation-coverage levels and the increasing cost to
     achieve the HTC coverage needed to achieve high ART coverage.

4.7 Health and financial impacts of implementing different
ART guidelines
A specific analysis was carried out to establish the impact of scaling up ART. The impact of
scaling up Belarus’ ART program so that all PLHIV are eligible to begin treatment regardless of
their CD4 count is compared to the baseline scenario of current ART coverage.

The results presented below are for the following level of testing and treatment coverage:

   80 of all PLHIV diagnosed by 2020
   90 of those diagnosed on ART by 2020
   90 of those on ART with viral suppression by 2020.
The full achievement of 90-90-90 targets by 2020 for the entire population of PLHIV was
considered unrealistic. Consequently, as a proxy for 90-90-90 among key populations, an 80
percent diagnosis of all PLHIV was used––still considered a highly ambitious target. This target
translates to 72 percent of all PLHIV being on ART and 65 percent of all PLHIV being virally
suppressed by 2020. Figure 4.9 and Table 4.10 show the additional impact of such a test and treat
scenario as compared to current allocations and current ART coverage. This analysis shows that if
such high levels of coverage and adherence can be achieved, a substantial reduction in new
infections and deaths could be achieved by 2030. A test and treat scenario could reduce HIV
incidence by 61 percent.

It needs to be emphasized that such high levels of ART coverage and adherence will be very difficult
to achieve, particularly in key populations such as PWID. It is plausible that adherence support
would need to include substantial scale-up of other prevention programs for PWID and OST.
Moreover, to achieve such high rates of HTC among FSW and MSM would require reduction in
stigma and high coverage of prevention and HTC outreach, which might require additional
investment. Thus, the additional annual estimated cost of US$12.4 million could be an
underestimate of the comprehensive HIV response cost to achieve high ART coverage and
adherence, particularly for PWID.

     The following figures show the effect of the test and treat approach compared to current
     conditions (including current ART coverage). The projections show that applying a test and
     treat approach would have the potential to both stabilize HIV incidence and reduce HIV-
     related deaths by 2030. However, the additional annual cost of US$12.4 million would take the
     total annual HIV response cost to US$32.2 million. Therefore, the cost of the test and treat
     scenario would exceed the cost of optimized allocations to stabilize incidence (US$25.0
     million), as well as optimized allocations to minimize both incidence and deaths (US$29.5
     million).

     It is useful to compare the impact and cost of the “test and treat only” scenario to the “double
     spend on direct programs” optimization to minimize both HIV incidence and deaths. Although
     the exclusive focus on scaling up test and treat would avert slightly more deaths (5,300 vs.
     5,100), the optimization to “double spend on direct programs” would avert substantially more
     new infections (10,000 vs. 7,400). The “double spend on direct programs” also would require a
     lower level of investment (US$29.5 million vs. US$32.2 million). Overall, this comparison
     suggests that a combination of programs established through optimization with a strong, but
     not exclusive, focus on scaling up ART would have the strongest impact on Belarus’ epidemic.
5.     CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This section summarizes the 10 main implications of the epidemic and optimization analyses
carried out as part of the Belarus HIV allocative efficiency study.



1
       The epidemics among PWID, MSM, and FSW including clients account for
       approximately two-thirds of new HIV infections in Belarus and need to remain the
       core focus of HIV programs. Prevention, HIV testing, and treatment need to be
targeted primarily at these key groups. At the same time, programmatic efforts to also reach
their sexual partners need to be enhanced. Belarus is progressing from an early concentrated
epidemic among PWID to an advanced concentrated epidemic in which sexual transmission
from key populations to their sexual partners, most commonly women aged 15–49, will
continue to grow. In this context, HIV transmission in key populations remains the “engine” of
the epidemic, while transmission also will reach other groups. Therefore, there is continued
need to focus the generation of strategic information, analysis, and planning on key
populations, particularly PWID, MSM, FSW, their clients, and their sexual partners. If the focus
is kept on them, new trends such as growing incidence among MSM can be understood and
addressed early.



2
       It is critical for Belarus to continue to prioritize the ongoing ART scale-up and
       substantially increase the allocation to ART. If the same funding level is available as
       in 2013 (US$20 million), ART allocations should be increased from US$3.0 million in
2013 to US$4.9 million, which would increase the proportion of PLHIV on ART from 19 percent
to 31 percent. This increase in allocations would be the main contributor to reduce deaths by
25 percent with 2013-level funding. With an additional 50 percent of total funding available,
the allocation to ART should increase to US$8.5 million, achieving coverage of 62 percent of all
PLHIV and reducing deaths by 51 percent compared to 2013 allocations. Rather than aiming
for widespread HTC for the general population to initiate ART, it will be important to focus on
identifying PLHIV from key populations, particularly PWID, MSM, FSW, and their clients and
their sexual partners.



3
      Addressing the HIV service and wider health needs of people who inject drugs
      remains a critical priority for Belarus. Needle and syringe programs should be
      further scaled up as part of a program package for PWID that includes HTC and condom
promotion. Opioid substitution therapy has important effects on HIV prevention and ART
adherence and should be doubled in coverage from 4 percent to 10 percent. However, since
health and social benefits of OST go far beyond HIV, additional funding from outside the HIV
response would reflect the wide range of benefits and contribute to the increased scale and
sustainability of OST programs.



4
     To address the growing MSM epidemic, MSM programs need to increase in
     coverage. These programs will require pragmatic outreach approaches through
     informal networks while continuing efforts to reduce the stigma and discrimination of
MSM. With current funding levels, MSM programs would not be part of the optimized mix.

                                              29
30                                           Optimizing investments in Belarus for the national HIV response



     With a 50 percent increase in total funding for HIV, MSM programs would increase moderately
     in coverage from 16 percent to 18 percent. This result suggests that unit costs should be
     reviewed and that strategies to achieve higher coverage with given or, if available, increased
     resources could be explored.



     5
            Focused programs for FSW should be sustained and reach the FSW at the highest
            risk of HIV. There is a need to provide clinical services and outreach to FSW with strong
            geographic prioritization. With current funding levels, FSW programs would not be part
     of the optimized mix; yet, with a 50 percent increase in resources for the HIV response, it could
     reach 16 percent of all FSW. Just as for MSM programs, unit costs should be reviewed and
     strategies to achieve higher coverage with given or, if available, increased resources could be
     explored.



     6
            Programs for the general population are much less cost effective compared to
            programs for key populations and should receive reduced allocations. HTC should
            remain available as the entry point for ART and other services but be focused on key
     populations, particularly if the current total funding envelope for the HIV response cannot be
     increased. In the analysis, PMTCT was considered a fixed cost, but it should be provided as cost
     efficiently as possible, particularly in low-volume sites. Funds allocated to BCC programs for
     the general population should be reallocated to the specified high-impact programs including
     ART and prevention for key populations.



     7
           Belarus funds several other programs through its HIV response including blood safety
           and STI control, although the primary benefit of these programs goes beyond the HIV
           response. If alternative funding for blood safety and STI programs could be
     identified, while advocating for the continued need to sustain the full HIV budget of
     US$19.7 million, the alternative funding would free up US$7.2 million. That amount then
     could contribute a large portion of the funding required to achieve higher impact on HIV
     incidence and deaths. Similar effects could also be achieved by reducing training costs, which
     accounted for US$1.0 million in 2013.



     8
           This analysis was not focused on identifying technical efficiencies; therefore, no specific
           technical recommendations can be made. Big-picture comparison to other countries––
           which has a number of limitations––showed that the cost range per person reached in
     Belarus is similar to ranges in other countries. However, given limited resources in Belarus, it
     is worth conducting additional technical efficiency analysis focused on the programs
     that absorb the largest proportion of funding (ART, OST, and PWID/NSP programs;
     management; and other costs).

     Apart from the growing needs of the HIV epidemic, a number of complementary health
     priorities require continued attention and should be allocated additional funding outside HIV
     budgets. Such funding would include harm-reduction programs for people who inject drugs
     (PWID), particularly, opiate substitution therapy. OST has important impacts not only on
     reduced needle-sharing and increased HIV treatment adherence but, more broadly, also on
     health and wellbeing and reduced rates of drug-related crime.



     9
           “Business as usual” would imply additional growth of Belarus’ HIV epidemic and an
           estimated increase in the annual new infections by 50 percent by 2030. Solely changing
           the mix of programs would not be sufficient to reverse the increase in the epidemic.
     Therefore, domestic and international resource mobilization for HIV programs remains
     a priority. Increases in funding by 10 percent to 50 percent compared to 2013 may be
     required to reduce HIV incidence and deaths by 40 percent–50 percent. Very ambitious
     medium-term targets such as reducing deaths and/or incidence by over 60 percent by 2020
Conclusions and recommendations                                                                31



would require even larger increases in funding. The team’s analyses suggest that very high
value for money can be obtained with approximately a 50 percent increase in funding (or less
if technical efficiencies and savings can be achieved). .

APPENDIX A.                 TECHNICAL SUMMARY OF OPTIMA
Appendix A provides a brief technical overview of Optima. A more detailed summary of the
model and methods is provided elsewhere (Kerr and others 2015). Optima is based on a
dynamic, population-based HIV model. Figure A.1a summarizes the populations and mixing
patterns used in Optima. Figure A.1b shows the disease progression implemented in the
model. Optima tracks the entire population of people living with HIV (PLHIV) across 5 stages
of CD4 count. These CD4 count stages are aligned with the progression of the World Health
Organization (WHO) treatment guidelines, namely, acute HIV infection, >500, 350 –500, 200–
350, 50–200, and 50 cells per microliter. Key aspects of the antiretroviral therapy (ART)
service delivery cascade are included: from infection to diagnosis, ART initiation on first-line
therapy, treatment failure, subsequent lines of therapy, and HIV/AIDS-related or other death.

The model uses a linked system of ordinary differential equations to track the movement of
PLHIV among HIV health states. The full set of equations is provided in the supplementary
material to a summary paper on the Optima model. The overall population is partitioned in
two ways: by population group and by HIV health state. Individuals are assigned to a given
population group based on their dominant risk.10 HIV infections occur through the interactions
among different populations by regular, casual, or commercial (including transactional) sexual
partnerships; through sharing of injecting equipment; or through mother-to-child
transmission. The force-of-infection is the rate at which uninfected individuals become
infected. The rate depends on the number and type of risk events to which individuals are
exposed in a given period (either within their population groups or through interaction with
other population groups) and the infection probability of each event. Mathematically, the force
of- infection has the general form:



where λ is the force-of-infection, β is the transmission probability of each event, and n is the
effective number of at-risk events (that is, n gives the average number of interaction events
with HIV-infected people through which HIV transmission may occur). The value of the

10   However, to capture important cross-modal types of transmission, relevant behavioral parameters can be set to
     non-zero values (for example, males who inject drugs may engage in commercial sex; some MSM may have
     female sexual partners).


                                                        33
34                                                      Optimizing investments in Belarus for the national HIV response



     transmission probability β varies across CD4 count compartments (indirectly reflecting the
     high viral load at early and late stages of infection); differs for different modes of transmission
     (intravenous drug injection with a contaminated needle-syringe, penile-vaginal or penile-anal
     intercourse, and mother-to-child); and may be reduced by behavioral interventions (for
     example, condom use), biological interventions (for example, male circumcision), or ART.
     There is one force-of-infection term for each type of interaction, for example, casual sexual
     relationships between male sex workers and female sex workers (FSW). The force-of-infection
     for a given population will be the sum of all interaction types.11 In addition to the force-of-
     infection rate, which is the number of individuals who become infected with HIV per year,
     there are seven other ways by which individuals can change health states.12 The change in the
     number of people in each compartment is determined by the sum over the relevant rates
     described above multiplied by the population size of the compartments on which they act.13




     11   For sexual transmission, the force-of-infection is determined by:
             HIV prevalence (weighted by viral load) in partner populations
             Average number of casual, regular, and commercial homosexual and heterosexual acts per person per year
             Proportion of these acts in which condoms are used
             Proportion of men who are circumcised
             Prevalence of sexually transmissible infections (which can increase HIV transmission probability)
             Proportion of acts that are covered by pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis
             Proportion of partners on antiretroviral treatment (art)
             Efficacies of condoms, male circumcision, post-exposure prophylaxis, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and art at
              preventing HIV transmission.
          For injecting-related transmission, the force-of-infection is determined by:
            HIV prevalence (weighted by viral load) in populations of people who use a syringe and then share it
            Number of injections per person per year
            Proportion of injections made with shared equipment
            Fraction of people who inject drugs on opioid substitution therapy and its efficacy in reducing injecting
             behavior.
          For mother-to-child transmission, the number of-infections is determined by:
             Birth rate among women living with HIV
             Proportion of women with HIV who breastfeed
             Probability of perinatal HIV transmission in the absence of intervention
             Proportion of women receiving prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), including ART.
     12   First, individuals may die, either because of an average background death rate for that population (which is
          greater for older populations or for people who inject drugs) or because of HIV/AIDS (which depends on CD4
          count). Second, in the absence of treatment, individuals progress from higher to lower CD4 counts. Third,
          individuals can move from undiagnosed to diagnosed states based on their HIV testing rate, which depends on
          CD4 count (for example, people with AIDS symptoms or primary HIV infection may have a higher testing rate)
          and population type (for example, FSW may test more frequently than males in the general population). Fourth,
          diagnosed individuals may commence ART at a rate depending on CD4 count. Fifth, individuals may experience
          treatment failure due to lack of adherence to therapy or development of drug resistance. Sixth, people may
          initiate second and subsequent lines of treatment after treatment failure. Finally, while on successful first- or
          second-line treatment (that is, effective viral suppressive therapy), individuals may progress from lower to
          higher CD4 counts.
     13   For example, the change in the number of undiagnosed HIV-positive FSW with a CD4 count between 200–350
          cells per microliter is:




          where UFSW2002350 is the current number of undiagnosed HIV-positive FSW with a CD4 count between 200–
          350 cells per microliter; UFSW3502500 is the same population but with higher CD4 count (350 –500 cells/mL); t
          is the disease progression rate for the given CD4 count (where 1/t is the average time to lose 150 CD4 cells/mL);
          m is the death rate; and h is the HIV testing rate. (Note: This example does not consider movement among
          populations, such as FSW returning to the general female population and vice versa —something which is
          included in Optima.)

Note: Each compartment represents a single population group with the specified health state. Each arrow
represents the movement of numbers of individuals among health states. All compartments except for
“susceptible” represent individuals living with HIV. Death includes all causes of death.

Each compartment (Figure A.1b, boxes) corresponds to a single differential equation in the
model, and each rate (Figure A.1b, arrows) corresponds to a single term in that equation. Table
A.1 lists the parameters used in Optima; most of these are used to calculate the force of
infection. The analysts interpret empirical estimates for model parameter values in Bayesian
terms as previous distributions. The model then must be calibrated: finding posterior
distributions of the model parameter values so+ that the model generates accurate estimates
of HIV prevalence, the number of people on treatment, and any other epidemiological data that
are available (such as HIV-related deaths). The calibration can be performed automatically,
manually, or a combination. Model calibration and validation normally should be performed in
consultation with governments in the countries in which the model is being applied.

     HIV Resource Optimization and Program Coverage Targets
     A novel component of Optima is its ability to calculate allocations of resources that optimally
     address one or more HIV-related objectives (for example, impact-level targets in a country’s
     HIV national strategic plan). Because this model also calculates the coverage levels required to
     achieve these targets, Optima can be used to inform HIV strategic planning and the
     determination of program coverage levels. The key assumptions of resource optimization are
     the relationships among (1) the cost of HIV programs for specific target populations, (2) the
     resulting coverage levels of targeted populations with these HIV programs, and (3) how these
     coverage levels of HIV programs for targeted populations influence behavioral and clinical
     outcomes. Such relationships are required to understand how incremental changes in
     spending (marginal costs) affect HIV epidemics.14 Logistic functions can incorporate initial
     start-up costs and enable changes in behavior to saturate at high spending levels, thus better
     reflecting program reality. The logistic function has the form:



     where L(x) relates spending to coverage; x is the amount of funding for the program; A is the
     lower asymptote value (adjusted to match the value of L when there is no spending on a
     program); B is the upper asymptote value (for very high spending); C is the midpoint; and D is
     the steepness of the transition from A to B. For its fits, the team typically chose saturation
     values of the coverage to match behavioral data in countries with heavily funded HIV

     14   A traditional approach is to apply unit cost values to inform a linear relationship between money spent and
          coverage attained. This assumption is reasonable for programs such as an established ART program that no
          longer incurs start-up or initiation costs. However, the assumption is less appropriate for condom promotion and
          behavior change communication programs. Most HIV programs typically have initial setup costs, followed by a
          more effective scale-up with increased funding. However, very high coverage levels have saturation effects
          because these high levels require increased incremental costs due to generating demand and related activities for
          the most difficult-to-reach groups. Optima uses a logistic function fitted to available input data to model cost–
          coverage curves (Appendix 2).
Appendix A                                                                                                                37



responses.15 To perform the optimization, Optima uses a global parameter search algorithm
called Bayesian adaptive locally linear stochastic descent (BALLSD). BALLSD is similar to
simulated annealing in that it makes stochastic downhill steps in parameter space from an
initial starting point. However, unlike simulated annealing, BALLSD chooses future step sizes
and directions based on the outcome of previous steps. For certain classes of optimization
problems, the team has shown that BALLSD can determine optimized solutions with fewer
function evaluations than traditional optimization methods, including gradient descent and
simulated annealing.

While all HIV interventions have some direct or indirect non-HIV benefits, some programs
including opiate substitution therapy (OST) or conditional cash transfers, have multiple
substantial proven benefits across different sectors. Such additional benefits were reflected by
using the approach of a cross-sectoral financing model to effectively distribute the costs in
accordance with the benefits. By adapting standard techniques from welfare economics to
attribute the benefits of OST programs across the benefiting sectors, it was estimated that
average HIV-related benefits are approximately only 10 percent of the overall health and social
benefits of OST. Therefore, only 10 percent of the OST cost was included in the optimization
analysis.

Uncertainty Analyses
Optima uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for performing automatic
calibration and for computing uncertainties in the model fit to epidemiological data. With this
algorithm, the model is run many times (typically, 1,000–10,000) to generate a range of
epidemic projections. Their differences represent uncertainty in the expected epidemiological
trajectories. The most important assumptions in the optimization analysis are associated with
the cost-coverage and coverage-outcome curves. To incorporate uncertainty in these curves,
users define upper and lower limits for both coverage and behavior for no spending and for
very high spending.16




15   Program coverage for zero spending, or behavioral outcomes for zero coverage of formal programs, is inferred
     using data from early on in the epidemic or just before significant investment in HIV programs. Practically, the
     team also discussed the zero and high spending cases with local experts, who could advise on private sector HIV
     service delivery outside the governments’ expenditure tracking systems. For each HIV program, the tea m derived
     one set of logistic curves that related funding to program coverage levels and another set of curves (generally,
     linear relationships) that related coverage levels to clinical or behavioral outcomes (the impacts that HIV
     strategies aim to achieve).
16   All available historical spending data and achieved outcomes of spending, data from comparable settings,
     experience, and extensive discussion with stakeholders in the country of application can be used to inform these
     ranges. All logistic curves within these ranges then are allowable and are incorporated in Optima uncertainty
     analyses. These cost-coverage and coverage-outcome curves thus are reconciled with the epidemiological,
     behavioral, and biological data in a Bayesian optimal way, thereby enabling the calculation of unified uncertainty
     estimates.

APPENDIX C.              COST-COVERAGE OUTCOME CURVES
Table C.1 shows the cost-coverage outcome curves used to generate the allocative efficiency
(AE) in Belarus results. The relationship between program spending and coverage is shown in
the left subfigure. This relationship describes the level of output (availability of a service to a
specific proportion of the target population) achieved with a specific level of financial input
(cost in US$). For example, this relationship would describe how many female sex workers
could be provided with a standard package of services with an investment of US$0 –US$1
million. The relationship between coverage levels and outcome is shown in the middle
subfigure. This relationship describes the proportion of people who will adopt a specific
behavior (such as condom use or consistent use of ARVs leading to viral suppression). The
subfigure on the right shows the cost-outcome relation, which combines the left and middle
subfigures and shows the direct relationship between cost and outcome. These relationships
were produced in collaboration with Belarus experts.

APPENDIX D. ADDITIONAL RESULTS: INFECTIONS
RECEIVED VS. INFECTIONS TRANSMITTED
The ratios of HIV transmission (infections caused) versus HIV acquisition (infections received)
among populations in 2013 are shown in Figure D.1. The populations with a value below 1
receive more HIV infections than they cause. Although men 50+ cause many more new
infections than they receive, their contribution to new infections is not very large due to the
relatively small number of new infections and PLHIV in this group. The “Male 50+” group also
includes former PWID and clients of FSW who were infected earlier and aged into this group
but who still may pass on HIV. Their presence also explains the high ratio of infections
transmitted versus received. However, what Figure D.1 demonstrates is that clients of sex
workers, male PWID, and males 25–49 (who include former FSW clients and PWID) transmit
more infections than they receive. This fact can be explained by the high levels of transmission
from these groups to female youth and adults.

Allocative efficiency   Within a defined resource envelope, AE of health or HIV-specific
(AE)                    interventions provides the right intervention to the right people at the right
                        place in the correct way to maximize targeted health outcomes.
Behavioral              Discourages risky behaviors and reinforces protective ones, typically by
intervention            addressing knowledge, attitudes, norms, and skills.
Biomedical              Biomedical HIV intervention strategies use medical and public health
intervention            approaches to block infection, decrease infectiousness, and reduce
                        susceptibility.
Bottom-up costing       Costing method that identifies all of the resources that are used to provide a
                        service and assigns a value to each of them. These values then are summed
                        and linked to a unit of activity to derive a total unit cost.
Cost-effectiveness      Form of economic analysis that compares the relative costs and outcomes
analysis (CEA)          (effects) of two or more courses of action.
Effectiveness           Degree of achievement of a (health) outcome in a real-world
                        implementation setting.
Efficiency              Achievement of an output with the lowest possible input without
                        compromising quality.
Financial               Ability of government and its partners to continue spending on a health or
sustainability          HIV outcome for the required duration and to meet any cost of borrowing
                        without compromising the government’s, household’s, or other funding
                        partner’s financial position.
HIV incidence           Estimated total number (or rate) of new (total number of diagnosed and
                        undiagnosed) HIV infections in a given period.
HIV prevalence          Percentage of people who are infected with HIV at a given point in time.
Implementation          Set of measures to ensure that programs are implemented in a way that
efficiency              achieves outputs with the lowest input of resources. In practical terms,
                        improving implementation efficiency means identifying better delivery
                        solutions. Doing so requires improving planning, designing service delivery
                        models, and assessing and addressing service delivery “roadblocks.”
                        Implementation efficiency will improve the scale, coverage, and quality of
                        programs.
Incremental cost-       Equation commonly used in health economics to provide a practical
effectiveness ratio     approach to decision making regarding health interventions. ICER is the
(ICER)                  ratio of the change in costs to incremental benefits of a therapeutic
                        intervention or treatment.
Model                   Computer system designed to demonstrate the probable effect of two or
                        more variables that might be brought to bear on an outcome. Such models
                        can reduce the effort required to manipulate these factors and present the
                        results in an accessible format.
Opioid substitution     Medical procedure of replacing an illegal opioid, such as heroin, with a
therapy (OST)           longer acting but less euphoric opioid. Methadone or buprenorphine
                        typically are used, and the drug is taken under medical supervision.

     Opportunistic infection   Treatment given to PLHIV to prevent either a first episode of an OI
     under medical             (primary prophylaxis) or the recurrence of infection (secondary
     (OI prophylaxis)          prophylaxis).
     Pre-exposure              Method for people who do not have HIV but are at substantial risk of
     prophylaxis (PrEP)        acquiring it to prevent HIV infection by taking an antiretroviral drug.
     Program effectiveness     Program effectiveness incorporates evaluations to establish what works
                               and impacts disease and/or transmission intensity, disseminating
                               proven practice, and improving the public health results of programs.
     Program sustainability    Ability to maintain the institutions, management, human resources,
                               service delivery, and demand generation components of a national
                               response until impact goals have been achieved and maintained over
                               time as intended by the strategy.
     Return on investments     Performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment
     (ROI)                     or to compare the efficiency of a number of different investments. To
                               calculate ROI, the benefit (return) of an investment is divided by the cost
                               of the investment; the result is expressed as a percentage or a ratio.
     Saturation                Saturation here refers to the maximum level of coverage that a program
                               can achieve. When approaching very high levels of coverage―which for
                               different programs may be 70 to 90 percent ―it becomes increasingly
                               difficult and expensive to reach more beneficiaries, as the remaining
                               beneficiaries are hard-to-reach due to location, low motivation, or other
                               social factors. These effects of increasing cost to reach saturation are
                               also referred to as saturation effects.

     Technical efficiency      Delivery of a (health) service in a way that produces maximum output at
                               the lowest possible unit cost while according with operational quality
                               standards.
     Top-down costing          Costing method that divides total expenditure (quantum of funding
                               available) for a given area or policy by total units of activity (such as
                               patients served) to derive a unit cost.
     Universal health          Universal health coverage (UC), is defined as ensuring that all people
     coverage (UC)             have access to the promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, and
                               palliative health services that they need, of sufficient quality to be
                               effective, while ensuring that the use of these services does not expose
                               the user to financial hardship.
