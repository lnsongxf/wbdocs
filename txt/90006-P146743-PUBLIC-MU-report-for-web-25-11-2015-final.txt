    Chapter 2
Mauritius Economic
  Development
Since independence in 1968, Mauritius’ economic performance
has been strong, associated with efficient government, diligent
economic policies, human capital accumulation, and fast growth
in FDI, tourism, and exports. However, structural and institutional
challenges led the Government of Mauritius to liberalize its
industrial, trade, and labor policies in the mid-2000s. The reforms
had an immediate, positive impact on the Mauritian economy’s
performance but brought increasing income inequality. Traditional
textile and agriculture sectors contracted while tertiary sectors
expanded. Among the economic challenges are relatively low
productivity that stunts growth, widening skills mismatches, and
rigid labor regulations. Moving forward, Mauritius’s GDP growth
rate appears to be close to its long-run potential. Achieving high-
income country status will depend on Mauritius’ ability to improve
the labor force’s skill set, develop infrastructure, and further
improve the business environment to attract FDI and generate
domestic investment. Inclusiveness remains the main challenge of
the current growth pattern and will be analyzed in later chapters.

  In the mid-2000s, a bold package of policies and institutional reforms deepened the efforts initiated in the preceding
  years and it aimed at addressing some politically sensitive reforms as well. The ambitious reform program was structured
  around four pillars: (i) fiscal consolidation and public sector efficiency; (ii) trade competitiveness; (iii) improving the
  investment climate, and (iv) widening the circle of opportunities. The empowerment program, which included a
  workfare scheme emphasizing training and skill-building, supported the reforms. The list below outlines main reforms
  introduced in Mauritius in this period:
  A.	 Consolidating Fiscal Performance and Improving Public-Sector Efficiency
     •	 Fiscal rule (public debt legislation)
     •	 Public financial management reforms
     •	 Revamping of tax system (single flat tax on personal and corporate income)
   	
  B.	 Enhancing Competitiveness
     •	 Tariffs reduced
     •	 Regulations for export processing zone (EPZ) and non-EPZ firms unified
     •	 Improving telecommunication services

  C.	 Improving the Business Climate
   •	 Business registration, regulation, and insolvency revamped through new legislation
   •	 Restrictions on land acquisition by foreigners eased
   •	 New labor-market legislation for widening the circle of opportunity through greater participation

  D.	 Inclusion and Sustainability
   •	 The National Empowerment Foundation as umbrella institution minimizing social costs of economic transformations
   •	 Education reform launched
   •	 Background analytical work to improve efficiency of the SP system

   How Growth and
  Economic Reforms
Translates into Income
  Distribution of the
      Households
Earlier studies found noticeable progress on human-
development indicators in Mauritius, including life
expectancy, maternal and infant mortality, enrollment
measures, and access to primary education for both genders.
This study confirms that the general well-being of the
population has improved between 2007 and 2012. Household
consumption and income have both increased in real terms,
and absolute poverty has declined. However, the growth
was not equally shared. When it comes to growth, people in
the middle of the distribution and the rich have benefited
more than the bottom 40 percent. Income inequality and
relative poverty have increased. Poverty depth has also
increased. Growth of the bottom 40 percent was much less
than the average growth rate. Professionals and generally
skilled workers benefited the most from growth, while the
unemployed and inactive population lagged. In terms of the
levels of poverty and inequality, Mauritius is comparable
to many other middle-income countries, but it is behind in
terms of the shared-prosperity indicators.

                                       Box 2: Overview of inclusive growth concept 8

     The need for more “inclusive growth” has been recognized in many countries. During the past decade, many developing nations
     had stable and often high rates of economic growth, including China, Vietnam, India, Mozambique, and Bangladesh. But the extent
     to which this growth has been shared differs greatly, with many of the countries experiencing higher income inequality. In some
     places, the greater inequality takes on a regional dimension—as in Ghana and Nigeria, where the northern parts have traditionally
     been left behind.9 However, many Latin American countries have successfully reduced income inequalities. Cash transfers played
     an important role, along with increases in other public investments and macroeconomic stability.

     Inclusiveness of growth and shared prosperity are essential ingredients in any successful growth strategy. Inclusiveness is a
     multidimensional concept that encompasses equity, equality of opportunity, and protection in market and employment transitions.
     The inclusive growth approach takes a longer-term perspective because it focuses on productive employment, rather than on
     direct income redistribution, as a means of increasing incomes for excluded groups.

     Inclusiveness covers a broad range of issues—for example, changes in the market structure, access to finance, discrimination
     in labor and product markets, and conditions in the informal sector. The micro dimension captures the importance of structural
     transformation for economic diversification and competition. The World Development Report 2013 emphasizes the role of labor-
     market institutions. It highlights the importance of looking beyond macroeconomic growth and taking into account distributional
     concerns and the extent to which people feel they take part in the decisions that shape their lives.

     Extensive research addresses various aspects of inclusive growth and shared prosperity. As stated above, inclusiveness
     is a multidimensional process related to economic factors, human capital, and political and social dimensions. It combines
     improvement in average level in various indicators as well as distributional component. The following is a table map of different
     measures generally associated with inclusiveness of growth. Inclusive growth method is a multidimensional approach taking in
     the consideration inequality in economic, human capital accumulation, social dimensions on the relatively long period of time and
     in a sustainable manner. For growth to be inclusive productivity must be improved, new opportunities for employment created,
     and the gains should be shared across population groups.

    Although the surveys are generally comparable over time,
some variables’ definitions have changed, leading to difficulties
in comparing some results. For example, the definition of em-
ployment sectors is among the indicators that have changed.

                                   and promoting “shared prosperity”

  The World Bank Group has established ambitious goals to reduce international poverty and boost shared prosperity. These two
  goals and their respective indicators can be summarized as:

  1. End extreme poverty: the percentage of people living with less than $1.25 a day to fall to no more than 3 percent globally by
  2030.
  2. Promote shared prosperity: foster income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the population in every country.
  Ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity are also unequivocally about progress in non-monetary dimensions of
  welfare, including education, health, nutrition, and access to essential infrastructure as well as enhancing voice and participation
  of all segments of society in economic, social, and political spheres. Ending extreme poverty within a generation and promoting
  shared prosperity must be achieved in ways that are sustainable over time and across generations. This requires promoting
  environmental, social, and fiscal sustainability. The shared prosperity indicator implies a direct focus on the incomes of the less
  well-off—a departure from the common practice of focusing only on growth in GDP per capita and implicitly relying on the
  “trickle down” impact to benefit the bottom of the distribution.

  To analyze shared prosperity in Mauritius, this section compares the mean annual growth rates of the poorest 40 percent of
  the population and the total population over five years—i.e., for 2007 to 2012. The annual growth rate is measured using the
  following formula:




                                                       , where idot is the annual growth rate of per adult equivalent income, F is the
  final value for income, S is the initial value of income, and y is the number of years over which the annual growth rate has been
  calculated.

      Chapter 4
Poverty, Vulnerability
 and the Middle Class
Close to 80 percent of Mauritius’ population could be classified
as middle class. A worrisome trend has been the increase in the
relative size of the vulnerable population. Demographically,
being in a smaller family or one headed by a male provides
better odds of being middle class. Having more education—the
key to employment in higher-paying sectors—is a path to middle-
class status; so is employment in some of the growing sectors of
Mauritius’ economy. The relative numbers of poor remained the
same between the two HBS surveys and appear to be well covered
by various social protection schemes. The highest growth in the
vulnerable was among female-headed households, those who
receive large amounts of transfer income, and those employed
in household services, other low-skilled occupations, and the
unemployed.

                                              Box 4: Literature on the middle class

  A long and growing literature focuses on the middle class, its characteristics, and its importance to economic growth and
  stability. The emergence of many of today’s high-income countries has often been attributed to the development of a middle
  class. This group is dominated by people with a vested interest in a stable society, who accumulate savings, invest in education
  for themselves and their children, and in other ways make investments in human and social capital. They advocate good
  governance, rule of law, and economic stability. Considerable evidence points to links between faster economic growth and an
  expanding middle class.

  While these intellectual and policy concepts have a long history, no consensus has been reached on how to define and measure
  the middle class. Easterly (2000),14 for example, takes a relativist approach, defining the middle class as those between the 20th
  and 80th percentile of the consumption distribution. Bhalla (2009)15 takes an absolute approach, defining the middle class as
  those with annual incomes over US$3,900 in purchasing power parity terms. Banerjee and Duflo (2007)16 use two alternative
  absolute measures—those with daily per capita expenditures of US$2 to US$4 and those with daily per capita expenditures
  between US$6 and US$10. Ravallion (2009)17 takes a hybrid approach, defining a “developing world middle class,” as with a
  range of incomes between the median poverty line of developing countries and the US, and a “Western world middle class.”

  Absolute definition the middle class: Many have tried to define and characterize a global middle class and to distinguish it
  from the global poor. The upper and lower bounds are often defined in an ad hoc manner.18 Banerjee and Duflo based their two
  ranges—a lower middle class at US$2 and US$4 a day per capita (adjusted at purchasing power parity) and an upper middle

     class between US$6 and US$10—on a sample of household surveys in 13 low- and middle-income countries.19 The lower bound
     of US$2 a day reflects developing-country standards—few people who have incomes above the threshold are considered poor
     in these economies. However, the upper bound of US$10 a day would still be regarded as poor in developed countries, where
     the threshold for poverty is about US$13 a day. With economic growth over the past decade and a half, 1.2 billion people in the
     developing world have joined the ranks of the middle class—by its standard. However, many of them would still be considered
     poor in the developed world—thus the need for separate middle-class thresholds for the developed and developing worlds.

     Relative definitions: In developed countries, a different approach is often adopted—defining poverty on a relative basis, such
     as people who have incomes less than 60 percent of the mean. In less developed countries, others have adopted a relativist
     approach—for example, Easterly defined middle class as consumption between the 20th and 80th percentiles.20 Others define
     the middle class as those with per capita incomes between 75 percent and 125 percent of median per capita income.21

     Subjective definitions of the middle class: A long tradition in the sociological literature involves subjective definitions of the
     middle class, where people are asked how they rank in the income distribution.22 Much of this research has been done in
     developed countries, where much more data is available.23

     Characteristics of the middle class: Once middle class is defined, it is important to analyze the group’s characteristics and
     determine how they differ from the poor in terms of occupation, consumption patterns, family size and household composition,
     place of residence, education, health, and other variables. Then the direction of causality needs to be determined. Do households
     with certain characteristics become middle class or do households with “middle class” characteristics adopt different behaviors
     to stay middle class? In Mauritius, the middle class exhibits some quite distinct social and economic characteristics that are
     important for policy. Most studies define the middle class based on income or consumption and then compile characteristics of
     those falling into that class. This study will do the same.

     Why the middle class is important: Historical studies have pointed to the importance for overall economic growth of having a
     middle class that earns a larger share of a country’s income. For example, an expanding middle class was a driving force behind
     the growth of many of today’s high income countries in Western Europe. A number of studies have shown that economic growth
     is higher in countries with larger middle classes. Three reasons are often given for this. First, new entrepreneurs who have
     delayed consumption create employment and productivity for the rest of society. Second, the middle classes are a source of
     vital inputs for the entrepreneurial class. Third, the middle classes are willing to pay more for better quality goods, increasing
     investment levels and raising income levels for the entire society. Another study by Easterly defines a middle-class consensus
     as a national situation with neither strong classes nor ethnic differences. He shows that lower ethnic polarization and higher
     income shares held by the middle class are associated with a range of desirable development outcomes—higher incomes,
     faster growth, better health and education, more political stability, less civil war, and more democratic societies.24 The opposite
     of middle-class economies are unequal ones, where wealth flows to a small number of people, and several studies show that
     high inequality is associated with poor growth outcomes.

Causes of Poverty and
Vulnerability Changes
Lagging shared prosperity had an adverse impact on poverty in
Mauritius. The reduction of poverty would have been almost twice
as large and stronger if inequality had not worsened. The most
important contributor to poverty reduction was social protection
incomes and subsidies, contributing 74.1 percent. Labor Incomes
also reduced poverty, but their contribution was 18.2 percent.
Demographic changes associated with decreasing household size
and lower dependency ratios contributed 17.2 percent. Rising
labor and self-employment incomes among initially better-
off groups contributed to the increase in the inequality. The
deterioration of the traditional agriculture and textile industries
and improvement of the trade and services sectors had the
most prominent impact on the increase in inequality. Economic
growth and diminished inequality are equally important for
poverty reduction and its possible eradication in Mauritius.
Assuming a neutral growth scenario, 40 percent cumulative
growth in consumption per capita would be required to halve
the poverty rate from 7.9 percent to 4 percent. Based on these
assumptions, it will take close to 15 years to completely eradicate
poverty. However, our projections do not suggest inequality
will decline, and poverty is not expected to fall fast. Micro-
simulation analysis suggests that improved targeting of the social
protection, combined with a decline in unemployment could result
in significantly lower poverty in Mauritius, measured against a
baseline scenario.

                                 Box 5: Measuring growth to poverty elasticity

  Traditionally, poverty economists project the incidence of poverty as a function of economic growth, using the consumption-to-
  poverty elasticity, an empirically measured index. It quantifies how much poverty reduction occurs for each 1 percent increase
  in per capita consumption. The responsiveness of poverty reduction to growth is a function of the number of people living just
  above poverty line. If the elasticity is high, poverty responds strongly to economic growth. If it is low, even strong growth will be
  relatively ineffective in reducing poverty.

  The impact of growth on poverty can also be captured by estimating the elasticity of growth to poverty, a measure of the
  reactivity of poverty with respect to changes in the average per capita expenditure. Following Duclos and Araar (2006), we used
  the following general formula for the elasticity :




  where P(a) is the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke poverty measure with parameter α, f(z) and F(z) denote, respectively, the probability
  density function and the cumulative density function of per capita expenditure and z is the absolute poverty line.

   Growth to poverty elasticity in Mauritius
  Mauritius’ relatively moderate inequality is associated with relatively high elasticities to growth and inequality, and the elasticity
  to growth fell over time due to increasing inequality. Mauritius has a relatively high elasticity of poverty to consumption
  expenditures—at -3.35 in 2007 and -3.10 in 2012 (Figure 41). This corresponds to the elasticity levels of Eastern Europe’s
  middle-income countries (Ukraine and Russian Federation); it is much higher than other middle-income countries in Africa. For
  example, Botswana’s elasticity is about 1 percent.

  Elasticity is twice as high in Mauritius than in other countries. This means that a relatively high proportion of the population is
  living close to the poverty line, and small growth rates lead to rapid poverty reduction. The opposite is true as well; relatively
  small adverse changes in growth have a strong impact on poverty. The worrisome sign, however, is that elasticity fell between
  2007 and 2012 due to the increase in inequality. Mauritius has even higher elasticity of poverty to inequality, and it has remained
  almost unchanged over time (Figure 40). Inequality really matters, pointing to the importance of developing social and economic
  policies that foster pro-poor growth.

      into growth and inequality (or redistribution) components. We used                                    due to the growth of mean per capita expenditure, and (ii) the

                                        Box 7: ADePT microsimulation approach used to project poverty and inequality

     We used a micro-simulation approach to project the distributional impacts of macro shocks in Mauritius through 2019. Micro-
     simulation is the process by which information on aggregate projected changes in output, employment, and transfers are
     used to generate changes in labor and non-labor income at the micro level through structural models. The microsimulation is
     conducted in four main steps.

     First, we used population growth projections to adjust for demographic changes between the base year of 2012 and 2015
     and 2019. This allowed us to explicitly take into account changes in dependency ratios and adjust for changes in the size of the
     working-age population.

     Second, we used the projections from labor-force status and labor earnings models to replicate projected changes in aggregate
     total and sectoral output and employment. We calculated the total number of individuals that needed to be reassigned between
     employment and non-employment and across employment sectors to match projected aggregate changes in total and sectoral
     employment. Initially non-employed individuals could become employed, employed individuals could become non-employed,
     and individuals could change sectors.

     Third, we used the earnings model to predict earnings for two groups of workers: those with no previous earning history and
     those who change sectors. Earnings are a function of both observable and unobservable individuals. Once all workers were
     assigned positive labor earnings, total earnings in a sector were adjusted to match aggregate projected changes in output.

     Fourth, we simulated the distributional impact to changes in social protection and in sources of non-labor income. We assumed
     that capital and financial income would grow at the same rate as real GDP, international remittances would remain constant in
     real terms at 2012 levels, and domestic remittances would change at the same rate as labor income.

Social Protection
  in Mauritius
Mauritius’ social protection (SP) programs played a significant
role in ensuring the poor benefit from economic growth through
redistribution of resources. Convergence, average transfers,
and generosity of the social protection system all significantly
increased between 2007 and 2012. Close to 75 percent of the
poverty reduction could be linked to SP expansion in Mauritius.
Without the SP system, poverty would be almost three times
higher, and inequality would be 12 percent higher. While the
majority of poverty reduction is attributable to Social Assistance
(SA) schemes, social insurance (SI) programs were responsible
for a minor improvement in poverty outcomes. The weak poverty
focus of individual SA schemes and a lack of coordination across
programs undermine the effectiveness of social safety nets.
Proxy means tested SA programs should be developed to reduce
inequality and improve the programs’ efficiency.

 Labor Market
Characteristics
and Challenges
I.	 Mauritius Labor Market characteristics and recent trends
Major transformations in the labor market led to shifts in
employment patterns and increases in wage disparities. The
tightening of the Mauritian labor market was associated with
growing skills mismatches and a lowering demand for traditional
employment. The Mauritian labor market has undergone a
shift from such labor-intensive industries as textiles to more
knowledge-intensive ones, including finance and tourism. We
can already see the increasing, but somehow still marginal,
importance of these industries and occupations for the overall
economy. From 2007 to 2012, Mauritius’ real wages surged
by more than 8 percent. Workers in the services sector receive
the highest salaries. Tourism and the tertiary sector highlight
the ongoing upward trend, with pay around 40 percent higher
than agriculture in 2012. STEM and high-hech occupations pay
considerably higher salaries.

                                     Box 8: Surge of foreign workers in Mauritius
     Mauritius has experienced a substantial increase in foreign workers—from 3.5 percent of the labor force in 2003 to 4.5
     percent of labor force in 2013 (Figure 62). According to Statistics Mauritius, the number of foreign workers has increased
     from around 17,000 in 2003 to more than 26,300 in 2013. The number of foreign workers has increased by 54 percent during
     this period, while the labor force grew only 11.3 percent. In addition, the number of work permits has grown significantly in
     recent years

     Most of the foreign workers take jobs in lower-skilled occupations, but some are high-skilled. The most frequent professions
     are machine operators (more than 60 percent), sewers, fish cutters, spinners, thread and yarn Masons, general site managers,
     production technicians, concrete plant machine operators, bakery product workers, bartenders, stonemasons, construction
     plasterers, general carpenters, general public relations officers, cooks, and hotel/restaurant employees. Forty percent of the
     foreign workers come from Bangladesh, with a large increase since 2009. The number of migrant workers has also increased
     from India, Madagascar, Nepal, Morocco, Lebanon, Korea, Japan, Israel, Indonesia, Haiti, Algeria, Argentina, Burundi, Congo,
     and Denmark. The share of foreign workers who are males has been steadily growing, reaching close to 63 percent. In 2013,
     81.4 percent of the foreign workers were employed in the manufacturing sector, with 70.3 percent in textiles. Almost all (96.6
     percent in 2013) work in the relatively large enterprises.

     Migrant workers are often filling vacancies for unattractive jobs that no longer appeal to Mauritian job seekers. The increase
     in demand for foreign workers is associated with skills mismatches and deteriorating wages in the primary sectors, including
     textiles. Companies turn to foreign workers to alleviate the shortage of skilled labor in the manufacturing and construction
     sectors.

          increase over the next 11 years. Second, the tails of                     legislation—that are serving as effective tools for
          the wage distribution show diverging evolutions: the                      protecting the most vulnerable workers from falling
          top half has seen an increase in real wages, while                        too far behind.
          the bottom half has seen real wages deteriorate.
          The discontinuity occurs almost exactly at the 50th
          percentile.                                                       F.	Rigidity of labor regulations

          proxy for skill content, we first calculate the each
          occupation’s mean years of education,57 and then                  183.	 Despite     changes in labor regulations, wage
          we then sort these occupations into deciles of the                        determination in Mauritius depends heavily on the
          average years of education. Finally, we plot the                          non-market forces and collective agreements. Before

          those same occupations. The figure clearly shows a                        market bargaining power, hampering the ability
          polarization of employment, with modest growth at                         of the economy to create new jobs. Under the old

                           Box 10: Educational attainments in Mauritius 2001-12
 Education in Mauritius is organized in four cycles (UNESCO, 2010): pre-school, primary, secondary, and higher education. Pre-
 school (ages 0-5) is organized in two separate phases to meet different needs: toddlers (ages 0-3), known as early childhood
 development (ECD), and early childhood care and education (ECCE, ages 3-5). With the 2008 reform, primary education now
 lasts six years, divided into three two-year cycles. Primary education is mandatory from age 5. At the end of primary school,
 all pupils take a standardized national test, the Certificate of Primary Education (CPE). It serves two purposes: measuring
 achievement and verifying eligibility for admission to secondary education. Secondary education consists of two cycles. The
 first has two stages: Forms 1-3 provide students a more or less common curriculum and Forms 4-5 prepare students for the
 O level, covering both core subjects and a wide range of optional modules. The second cycle prepares students for the A level.
 Higher education is offered by polytechnics and universities. Polytechnics generally offer two-year programs in information
 technology or business and administration, while universities offer three-year bachelor’s degrees, potentially followed by
 two-year master’s degrees in various subjects.

 Educational attainment lowers the probability of being inactive and raises the probability of being employed. Figure 74 shows
 additional evidence of this beneficial link. Looking at the 2012 labor-force status for people in each of the four educational
 categories allows us to identify two clear points of discontinuity—the first at the end of primary school, the second at
 post-secondary graduation. Completing the lowest educational level increases the probability of being employed from 11.5
 percent to 50.9 percent and almost halves the probably of being inactive from 87.8 percent to 46 percent. The jump between
 secondary degree and post-secondary education is less abrupt but still considerable, with an increase of 11 percentage points
 in the share of employed and a decrease of 12 percentage points in the share of inactives. Surprisingly, the proportion of
 unemployed rises with education, but this is due to the very different share of inactives among the four categories.

 The results displayed in Figure 76 suggest three clear messages. First, completing any education level, even the lowest one,
 substantially diminishes the probability of being out of the labor force. Second, the benefits of obtaining a post-secondary
 degree have increased over time; between 2001 and 2012, the gap between the probabilities of being inactive with a post-
 secondary degree and with no degree declined by 10 percentage points. Third, moving from finishing primary school to a
 secondary degree does diminish the probability of inactivity, but the difference is negligible and fairly constant.

     Low female labor supply is a phenomenon common to many economies at all stages of economic development.60 Labor-force
    participation is influenced by short- and long-term factors. In the short run, it responds to wages and general unemployment
    levels; in the long run, it fluctuates with cultural expectations and roles, incentives and institutional rules set in the labor
    market, returns to education, and long-run productivity. The meager women’s participation rate might result from lower
    human capital or social norms, consequent divisions of tasks within the family, or other factors. Simple descriptive statistics
    such as those in Figure 76 and Table 7 do not capture all these effects. To show obtain more informative results and start to
    understand the high inactivity rate, we will resort to a simple estimation of the probability of being inactive, given a series of
    control variables.61

    In Figure 77, we show the difference in probability of inactivity between men and women for 11 years, holding constant
    educational levels, age, marital status, and child-rearing duties. We see that women are still substantially less likely to
    participate in the labor market, but we can also appreciate the dramatic fall in the inter-gender gap.

 In Table 8, we clarify what drives both level and rate differentials between the two genders.62 The coefficients should be
 interpreted as the difference in probability of being inactive between men and women with the same characteristics.63

 In terms of levels, getting married exhibits the highest probability differential at both the beginning and end of the period. A
 married woman has an almost 59 percent higher chance of being economically inactive than a married man in 2001 and a
 40 percent higher chance in 2012. An increase in family size and, specifically, the number of children increases the chance of
 being inactive—but to a lesser extent.

 The probability differential monotonically decreases with educational levels. In 2001, female primary-school graduates had
 an 11 percent higher chance of being inactive; the difference disappeared for post-secondary graduates. In 2012, post-
 secondary trained women actually had a lower probability of being inactive.

 In terms of changes, the differential between married men and women has decreased steeply, largely because the gap
 between highly educated individuals now favors women. For the remaining characteristics, the differential probabilities
 persist and are fairly constant.

                         Box 12: Determination of NEET employment—empirical model
  This box analyses the characteristics affecting youths’ probability of being NEETs. In Table 9, we show the impact of selected
  family and individual demographic characteristics on the probability of falling into this particularly disadvantaged group in
  2003 and 2012 and the differences between the two periods. Clearly, parents’ education and family income have the largest
  influence. In 2003, fathers’ education decreased the probability of being NEETs by 2.6 percent and mothers’ by 3.3 percent.
  The figures for 2012 suggest a change—now, only fathers’ education is negatively related (4.7 percent) to the probability
  of falling into the NEET category. Family income, represented by fathers’ wages, is expressed in log terms and should be
  interpreted as the percentage change in the probability of being NEETs associated with a 1 percent increase in wages.

  The coefficient for females reflects the improved conditions discussed in the previous section. Compared to boys, they had
  a 10 percent higher chance of being NEETs in 2003, but their comparative situation dramatically improved in 2012, when
  the coefficient was down to 3.9 percent. The only other factor increasing the probability of being NEETs is the presence of
  other siblings. This is true only for 2003, while the coefficient for 2012 is quite precisely estimated at 0, expressing a lack
  of correlation between these two factors in that year. Only two characteristic showed statistically significant changes—
  the number of siblings (not influencing NEET probability in 2012) and the female covariate. All other variables are fairly
  constant.

              Firm-Level Analysis 67




  This chapter was prepared by Leora Klapper (DECRG-FDP) and Peter van Oudheusden (DECRG-FDP) as material for the
67	

analysis “Mauritius Inclusiveness of Growth and Shared Prosperity: Micro Analysis and Labor Productivity Gains.” We thank the
Mauritian Company Registrar for providing the data used in this analysis.
Mauritius’ institutional framework has improved in recent years, and
the country performs relatively well compared to other SSA countries
when it comes to access to financial services. However, it has mixed
ratings on global competitiveness indicators. Small enterprises
reported infrastructure and informal sector practices as major
impediments, and they continue to face challenges to increasing
market share and employment. Small firms are more leveraged than
large ones in Mauritius. The large firms indicate shortages of skilled
workers and labor regulations are their major challenges.
The entrance of new firms has been stagnant since the global
financial crisis. The number of new firms almost quadrupled
between 2002 and 2008 but remained unchanged in the subsequent
years. Business creation stagnated despite the introduction of the
reforms at the end of the 2000s, which made it easier and cheaper
to start a company. In 2007-12, the construction and services
industries saw the most new firms, while startups were relatively
low in textiles and manufacturing. The inequality in firms’
revenues has widened in recent years, especially among older
firms. On average, SMEs are unprofitable and disadvantaged in
terms of growth prospects. Firms in agriculture and textiles are
less profitable than those in trade, construction, and services. The
number of firms with new loans has increased since beginning of
the 2000s, but it dropped after 2009, with the lingering fallout
from the financial crisis. Credit increased in trade and services
and fell in manufacturing. Financial vulnerability is especially
high for small firms and new corporations.

     Information is only available for some of the firms that obtained
 credit in a year. For earlier years, information is available for more than
 70 percent of the firms; this share declines to around 50 percent for the
 more recent years.

      Note that the results only highlight relationships and
      cannot establish causality.

APPENDIX C: LABOR ANALYSIS
C1. HIGH-TECH SECTOR
In Chapter 8, we introduced the definition of high-tech sector. This classification exploits data on the sector of economic
activity of the individual employer, collected in the CMHPS. The definition of sector of activity follows the NSIC standard,
a national adaptation of the ISIC (International Standard of Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities) consisting of
a coherent classifications of all economic activities based on a set of internationally recognized concepts and classification
rules.
This classification is subject to periodical updates to capture the cyclical transformations of world economy. For this
reason, two different revision of the ISIC classification, revision 3.1 and the revision 4, corresponding to revision 1 and 2
respectively in the national adaptation, are implemented in the 12 CMPHS waves analyzed. Revision 1 is used between 2001
and 2010, while the newest revision 2 standard is adopted in the last two waves.
For specific purposes, researchers often need to modify the aggregation provided by the ISIC structure to capture alternative
concepts, such as the high-tech sector. Alternative but standardized aggregations have been created. In our analysis, we
have exploited the OECD definition of high-tech industries. We have decided to adopt the ISIC revision 4 definition and adapt
the earlier waves to the later classification by consulting the UN correspondence tables freely accessible on Internet. Even
though we have tried to apply the utmost care, some discrepancies might still occur between the two classifications.

                          C2. LABOR MARKET PARTICIPATION
                          We have estimated a multiple regression model via Probit. The estimated equation is:

                                       P (yi=1|x) = f (ai +b1 female + b2 married + b3 kids + b5 age2 + b6 Rodrigues
                                                    + b7 primaryedu + b8 secondaryedu + b9 tertiaryedu + Ei

                          Where yi is a dummy variable assuming value 1 if the individual is inactive, female is a dummy variable for being female,
                          and b1 is the coefficient of interest. The other variables included as controls are:
                           •	 Married = 1 if individual is married 0 otherwise;
                           •	 Kids = number of kids in the family;
                           •	 Age = age of the individual;
                           •	 Age2 = age squared;
                           •	 Rodrigues = 1 if individual resides on the island of Rodrigues, 0 otherwise;
                           •	 Primary_edu = 1 if individual’s highest educational level is primary education, 0 otherwise;
                           •	 Secondary_edu = 1 if individual’s highest educational level is secondary education, 0 otherwise;
                           •	 Tertiary_edu = 1 if individual’s highest educational level is tertiary education, 0 otherwise.

                          The coefficients are the marginal effects at the mean for the covariate female in each of the 11 survey years and can be
                          interpreted as the difference in probability of being inactive attributable to gender only..

        Labor discusses the results of a linear probability model for the probability of falling into the NEET group given a series of
        covariates. The model estimated takes the form:

        Where yi is a dummy variable assuming value 1 if the individual is a NEET are two dummy variables indicating the respective
        years interacted with the following controls:

        Pr (yi=1|xi) = 2003 * f (b1 + b2 siblings + b3 fatheredu + b4 motheredu + b5 fatherlog (wage) + b6 mother active
                              + b7 female + b8 Rodrigues ) + 2012 * (b9 + b10 siblings + b11 fatheredu + b12 motheredu
                             + b13 fatherlog (wage) + b14 mother active + b15 female + b16 Rodrigues ) + Ei

          •	   Siblings = number of siblings;
          •	   Father_edu = highest educational level for the individual’s father;
          •	   Mother_edu = highest educational level for the individual’s mother;
          •	   Father_log(wage) = individual’s father log of monthly wage;
          •	   Mother_active= 1 if individual’s mother participates in the labor market, 0 otherwise;
          •	   Female = 1 if individual is a woman 0 otherwise;
          •	   Rodrigues = 1 if individual resides on the island of Rodrigues, 0 otherwise.

C.3.1 WAGE REGRESSION
In section 2.2, we have estimated a wage regression. The estimated equation is:
Where is the monthly wage for the individual i, is a dummy variable equal 1 if the individual’s highest degree is for primary

    log (wi ) = ai + bn xi + bn+1 primaryedu + bn+2 secondaryedu + bn+3 tertiaryedu + Ei

school, is a dummy variable equal 1 if the individual’s highest degree is for secondary school, is a dummy variable equal
1 if the individual’s highest degree is for post-secondary school. , and are the coefficient of interest indicates a vector of
control variables including:
 •	 Married = 1 if individual is married 0 otherwise;
 •	 Kids = number of kids in the family;
 •	 Age = age of the individual;

C3.2 SCHOOLING EQUATION
In Table 6, we discussed the results of a schooling equation obtained from an estimated linear probability model for the
probability of accessing one of the four increasing educational levels given a set of covariates. The exact specification of
the model is the following:
Where s = 1,…,4 indicates one of the four possible educational categories (no education, primary education, secondary
   Pr (si =1|xi ) = ai + bn xi + Ei

education, post-secondary education) that we have created. i indicates individual i and a vector of control variables
including:
  •	 Female = 1 if individual is a woman 0 otherwise;
  •	 Siblings = number of siblings;
  •	 Age = age of the individual;
  •	 Rodrigues = 1 if individual resides on the island of Rodrigues, 0 otherwise;
  •	 Father’s education = father’s educational category;
  •	 Mother’s education = mother’s educational category;
  •	 Father’s income quartile 2/4 = 1 if the individual father’s work income falls in the second, third or fourth quartile of
     the distribution, respectively, 0 otherwise:
  •	 Father (mother) unemployed = 1 if the individual’s father (mother) is unemployed, 0 otherwise;
  •	 Father (mother) employed = 1 if the individual’s father (mother) is employed, 0 otherwise;
  •	 Father (mother) inactive = 1 if the individual’s father (mother) is inactive, 0 otherwise.
Table 6 displays the full specification of this regression for each of the 10 years considered. It only displays a subset of
covariates for six selected years.

C3.3 INTERGENERATIONAL MOBILITY
In section 2.3 Figure 75, we have displayed and discussed the evolution of family background and its impact on offspring
schooling achievement. The graph shows a plot of the R2 of a linear probability model for each of the four educational
categories we used and for each of the 10 years for which we have data.
The specification of the model is:

 Pr (si =1|xsi ) = asi + bsn xsi + Esi

Where s = 1,…,3 indicates one of the three possible degrees (primary education, secondary education, post-secondary
education) that we have created. i indicates individual i and a vector of control variables including:
 •	 Father’s education = father’s educational category;
 •	 Mother’s education = mother’s educational category;
 •	 Father’s income quartile 2/4 = 1 if the individual father’s work income falls in the second, third or fourth quartile of
    the distribution, respectively, 0 otherwise.



C3.4 FEMALES GRADUATION PROBABILITIES
In section 0 we have discussed Mauritian’s women educational achievements and compared it to those of men. These
graduation probabilities are obtained via a linear probability model taking the form:

Pr (si =1|xsi ) = asi + b1 female + bs1 + n xsi + Esi

Where s = 1,…,4 indicates one of the four possible educational categories (no education, primary education, secondary
education, post-secondary education) that we have created. i indicates individual i, female is a dummy variable for being
female and the associated slope parameter, b1, is the coefficient of interest. xi a vector of control variables including:
 •	 Siblings = number of siblings;
 •	 Age = age of the individual;
 •	 Rodrigues = 1 if individual resides on the island of Rodrigues, 0 otherwise;
 •	 Father’s education = father’s educational category;
 •	 Mother’s education = mother’s educational category;
 •	 Father’s income quartile 2/4 = 1 if the individual father’s work income falls in the second, third or fourth quartile of
    the distribution, respectively, 0 otherwise;
 •	 Father’s (mother’s) unemployed = 1 if the individual’s father (mother) is unemployed, 0 otherwise;
 •	 Father’s (mother’s) employed = 1 if the individual’s father (mother) is employed, 0 otherwise;
 •	 Father’s (mother’s) inactive = 1 if the individual’s father (mother) is inactive, 0 otherwise.

APPENDIX D. OAXACA-BLINDER DECOMPOSITION

Given two groups of individuals—group a and group b—an outcome variable Y, and a set of predictors x, the Oaxaca-Blinder
decomposition decomposes variation in Y between group A and B to a part explained by the set of predictors and a residual
part that is unexplained. Formally, the question is establishing how much of the group difference is accounted for by the
group difference in the predictors:
R = E(Ya ) - E(Yb )
Where E(Y) denotes the expected value of the outcome variable, based on the linear model:

Yi = x' bi + ei with E(ei ) = 0 and l Î (a;b)

X is a vector containing the regressors and a constant, b contains the slope parameters and e is the error term. The mean
outcome difference can be expressed as the difference in the linear prediction at the group specific means of the regressors:

If we want to identify the contribution of group differences in predictors to overall outcome differences, the previous
R = E(Ya ) - E(Yb ) = E(Xa )’ ba - E(Xb )’ bb
equation can be rearranged as:
Where b* is the nondiscriminatory coefficient vector. This formulation can be thought of as being the sum of two components:
Is the part of the outcome differential that is explainable by group differences in the predictors, while the second term of
R = {E(Xa ) - E(Xb )}’ b* + {E(Xa )’ (ba - b* ) + E(Xb )’ (b* - bb ) }

the equation:
Is the unexplained part that in labor economic literature on group differential is usually attributed to discrimination. An
   Q = {E(Xa ) - E(Xb )}’ b*
important disclaimer is that the term U captures also all the potential effects that unobservable characteristics play in
explaining wage differentials and for this reason estimates of discrimination based on the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition
   U = {E(Xa )’ (ba - b* ) + E(Xb )’ (b* - bb ) }
should be taken with caution.

Source: Mauritian Company Registrar and authors’ calculations. Notes: OLS regressions. Coefficient is significantly different from 0 at the *** .01,
**  .05, and * .10 level. Robust standard errors are in parentheses. The omitted categories are (large) firms that are normally leveraged, have current
ratios above two, and were incorporated before 2007, and are in the services industry. Profitable firms have positive earnings before interest and
taxes (EBIT), and the return on assets (ROA) is defined as EBIT divided by total assets. Columns (1)-(3) deal with the extensive margin of profitability
and estimate a linear probability model. Columns (4)-(6) deal with the intensive margin of profitability.

A “small” firm is defined as having MUR10 million in sales or less, a “medium” firm as having between MUR10 million and MUR80 million in sales,
and a “large” firm as having more than MUR80 million in sales. Highly leveraged firms have liabilities-to-asset ratios above two-thirds. Firms with
short-term liquidity problems have current ratios below one, those with short-term liquidity risk have one between one and two, and others have
one above two. The liabilities-to-assets ratio is defined as total liabilities divided by total assets. The current ratio is defined as total current assets
divided by total current liabilities. New incorporations are firms that got incorporated between 2007 and 2011.
