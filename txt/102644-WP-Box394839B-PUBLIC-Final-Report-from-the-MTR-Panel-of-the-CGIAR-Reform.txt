A Chair and individual panel members were

CGIAR Fund Council based on their ability to
independently, and without bias, consider the
challenging and often controversial questions
which must be addressed. These issues
related to the progress of the CGIAR reform
process and its impact, and whether CGIAR is
well positioned to lead the international
agricultural research community in tackling
the interlinked, mega-challenges of food,
energy, and water security, climate change,
and degrading natural resources, biodiversity
and ecosystem services. The MTR Panel

Appendix 2. Submission from the 15 CGIAR Centers to the MTR Panel
(Received August 16, 2014)

Introduction
The reform of the CGIAR that was initiated in 2008 was, by design, ambitious in its objectives and
was carried out without a structured change management program; rather, the reform followed from
an initial design template and then was adaptively managed while it was underway, primarily through
consultative processes between the new governance and management entities and the CGIAR
Centers. Of course, the reform and its design elements were based on considerable diagnostic
evidence of the strengths and weaknesses of the CGIAR. Consequently, the adaptive processes that
followed were guided by at least three main intentions of the reform:
(a) making the whole CGIAR system greater than the sum of its parts -- the creation of CRPs as a key
instrument for achieving this,
(b) a more compelling global agenda for the CGIAR that ends the mandate creep of the Centers,
inspire confidence among investors and help mobilize increased financial investments –a key
element of this was the Strategic Results Framework (SRF) with four strategic objectives, and
(c) simplification of the CGIAR system which had become enormously complex –but for which no
road map was created as implementation of the reform started. The adaptive process of the reform
referred to above continues and brings together the lessons of the first five years of the reform.
This note is a brief assessment, from a Center perspectives, of where the CGIAR is currently in the
change process, and what has been learned --in short what has worked well and what has not
worked so well.

A. What has worked well
This starts with the overall objective of the reform, namely to transform the CGIAR from 15
autonomous international agricultural research centers into an integrated, highly responsive, and
learning system focused on major global challenges related to food and nutritional security, reducing
poverty and sustainable natural resource management. This overarching objective was intended to
make the whole CGIAR greater than the sum of its parts. There were two elements to this (a)
delivering greater synergy and impact from the combined research effort of the CGIAR and (b)
gaining greater efficiency and effectiveness organizationally from shared infrastructure and services
etc. The following are some examples of what has worked, identified by the Centers:

   1. The CRP mechanism: Development of CRPs was a key element of system architecture and
      contributed to both (a) and (b) above, and embodied four principal design elements, namely:

           a) The CRPs were the mechanism for achieving integration around a common research
              agenda defined at the CGIAR system level with the assumption that there would be
              progressive programmatic alignment within Centers themselves and supported by full
              W1/W2. However, there has a continuing reliance on an increasing share of bilateral
              funding.

           b) A framework for accountability for development impacts would be developed with a
              focus on monitoring outcomes rather than outputs and where effective partnerships
              were a necessary element in achieving these impacts.

           c) The CGIAR would continue to lead with high quality science but with the difficulty of
              balancing upstream research with the investment in innovation and delivery capacity
              needed to achieve downstream impact.


                                                                                                  43
            d) There would be an organizational separation of “funders” and “doers” but with an
               inherent tension in who lead resource prioritization, particularly given the continuing
               dependence on bilateral funding reflecting the preference of many of the "funders".
In many ways this central CRP plank of the reform has been an extremely positive achievement. For
example, the CGIAR system has consolidated new areas of work in all of the four strategic objectives
of the SRF. There has also been a tangible increase in scientific collaboration across Centers as
evidenced by increased joint planning, implementation and publications. There has also been
pooling of different strengths of participating Centers around the common research agenda of
individual CRPs. CRP development has been an ongoing learning process and some challenges
relating to governance and transactions costs remain. One area of future work is to define areas
where cross CRP collaboration will achieve even greater efficiencies. At the same time, the CRPs
have led to improved conceptualization of how the CGIAR approaches delivery and impact, often
through greatly improved geographic alignment, and significantly deepened CGIAR’s capacity and
approaches to gender equity. Ongoing and planned evaluations of CRPs will provide excellent
opportunities to refine and improve the governance and efficiency of CRPs, and thereby Centers; the
CRPs have already been shown to be highly responsive to various reviews.

     2. Creating the SRF: Although the first edition of the SRF was completed later than was
        desirable and with some inadequacies, it has served to advance the second intention of the
        reform --a more compelling global agenda for the CGIAR that reduces the mandate creep of
        the Centers, inspires confidence among investors and helps mobilize increased financial
        investments. Here too, much has been achieved:

            a) The mandate creep: Mandate creep that plagued the CGIAR prior to the reform by
               dissipating efforts and violating principles of subsidiarity with partners has largely
               been arrested. The vast majority of CGIAR research efforts fit within the SRF and,
               more importantly, drive the current portfolio of CRP.

            b) Increased funding: Funding to the CGIAR has doubled since the reform started,
               although there is continuing debate about attribution. This relates to whether the
               increase in funding came about as a result of the reform, and/or by the global food
               price crisis which struck the same year (2008), with continuing ripples since then.
               Whatever the cause, the CGIAR with a new SRF and portfolio of CRPs, was well
               positioned to address the attending anxiety about how the world will sustainably feed
               itself to the time of population stabilization in the 2050s, while also addressing
               poverty and climate change on a planet that some argue is reaching its ecological
               limits. The appropriate positioning of the CGIAR at that time was undoubtedly the
               result of the reform process.

            c) The Windows: Importantly, the significant growth rate in the CGIAR’s aggregate
               budget since 2008 has provided more opportunity for achieving impact. The
               combined and complementary funding model (W1/W2 and W3/Bilateral) is
               fundamentally sound and provides for CRP stability, growth, evolution and innovation.
               W1/W2 donors get effective leverage as W3/bilateral funds are mobilized to
               enhance delivery of CRPs. Conversely, given the (theoretical) stability of W1/W2
               funding to CRPs, Centers are in a good position to mobilize additional and
               complementary funding for the CRPs. There is thus a mutually reinforcing
               relationship between W1/W2 and W3/bilateral funding. Although there has been
               some tension among the various parts of the system on the matter of W3/bilateral
44
                funding, Centers are firmly of the view that resource mobilization from that source for
                the CRPs, and the SRF more broadly, should be encouraged. However, Centers are
                also of the view that W1/W2 funding should represent a higher amount and
                proportion (growing to over 60%) of total funding, than is the case now, if system
                integrity is to be maintained into the future.

    3. Partnership and gender higher up the agenda: The CGIAR has always been noted for
       extensive up and down stream partnerships, particularly with NARES in the developing
       countries. The advent of the CRP and the enhanced funding base have facilitated significant
       strengthening of these partnerships and the creation of new ones, for example, with
       specialized development organizations that will facilitate scaling and greater impact. These
       conditions have also facilitated stronger efforts to mainstream gender and advance this area
       of work where it belongs -higher up the agenda of the CGIAR and partners.

    4. Prospect of more collective action: Although not yet paying many dividends to the reform,
       plans are being developed to capture organizational benefits in such areas as (a) shared
       services, (b) deliberate movement towards co-locating of staff across countries/regions, (c)
       managing security and related risks and building stronger communities of practice in
       capacity development, communications and knowledge management, among others. Of
       course, collective action of this sort is not new to the CGIAR; the Centers previously created
       CGNet and AIARC, among others, which have endured and served the CGIAR well. That track
       record has emboldened the Centers and created a commitment to doing more in this area in
       the future.

B. What did not work so well
The above benefits of the CGIAR reform, however, have come with some costs associated with
differing interpretation of the Consortium Constitution and inadequate articulation of how the
expanded number of organizational parts should work. These in turn are manifested in governance
and operational difficulties and ever rising transactions costs. Some examples of these challenges
follow:
     1. The conceptual divide: There are differing interpretations of the Consortium’s Constitution
         which defines the relationship between the Consortium Board (CB)/Consortium Office (CO)
         and the Centers and guides operations. Centers believe that what they had signed up to was
         a sort of a ‘joint venture’ in which they were an integral part of the Consortium. However,
         legal opinion given to the CO provides an interpretation that the Consortium is a separate
         and independent entity and does not include the members Centers (see attached). In this
         context then, the CGIAR Consortium of Agricultural Research Centers is a misnomer.
         Interestingly, however, the word consortium is derived from Latin and means “those with a
         shared fate”. Under the interpretation above, while the Consortium consults its members
         and generally represents their views and interests, it need not do so as it has the liberty to
         act in its own right and to take positions that do not necessarily reflect that of the members.

        In operational terms this interpretation, adhered to by the CB-CO, has at least two important
        implications:
            a) The ambiguity about whether the Centers are part of the Consortium or not and the
                uncertainty concerning the obligations in both directions have severely impeded the
                building of trust and cohesion between the Centers and the CB/CO.


                                                                                                      45
             b) It was envisaged that the CO would be a convener, facilitator, and advocate,
                providing intellectual support in areas such as the quality of CRP submissions.
                However, as a result of (a) above, different expectations have emerged between the
                Centers and the CO over its role as facilitator or regulator.

     2.    The governance challenge: The reformed CGIAR consists of an enlarged number of system
          entities, namely the Fund Council (FC) and Fund office (FO), the Consortium CB and CO, the
          ISPC the IEA and the 15 Centers each with their own respective Boards. Inadequate
          articulation of guidelines on interoperability and operating procedures that clearly defined
          the roles and responsibilities of each of the entities, led to adaptive management that was
          described in the introductory section of this paper. Furthermore, lack of definition of what
          success actually looks like, with baselines and metrics of reform progress, have led to
          divergent views. This has also led to less than seamless relationships between the CB and
          the FC, the FO and the CO and between the CO and the Centers. But perhaps the greatest
          tension has been between the CO and Centers, especially in the area of governance and
          management of the CRPs. Some of the implications of this atmosphere are:

             a) While lead Centers have been designated to lead the various CRPs, this role and
                particularly the lead Center Board governance responsibility, in relation to the CRP
                Advisory Committee/Panel/Board, is still uncertain terrain even after the
                dispensation of the recently concluded CRP Governance and Management review.

             b) Leading or not, if the Centers are not part of the Consortium, then the Centers
                relationship with the CRPs may be regarded as just contractees of the Consortium
                rather than the joint owners of the programs they perceive themselves to be. This
                characterization seems fair given that all but fiduciary responsibility lies outside the
                Centers.

             c) While the creation of the CRP mechanism must be regarded as a resounding success
                as explained at A.1 above, their operationalization, given the current architecture,
                has imposed very high transactions costs in both financial and senior scientist time.
                For example, each CRP has a program management committee with an average size
                of roughly 10 members thus engaging 150 people (15 CRP X 10 members) at the
                management level with statutory meeting roughly four times per year. In addition,
                each CRP has an advisory committee/panel/board of roughly 10 people each, thus
                engaging about another 150 people at the advisory/governance level, meeting on
                average twice per year. Furthermore, numerous science planning and coordination
                meetings at theme/flagship level are required within each CRP. This of course, is in
                addition to existing Center level boards and CO/CB processes in which Centers, CRP
                Directors and other science leaders are involved. While these operational modalities
                were required in the past, the question is, can we obtain similar benefits of an
                expanded research and development agenda, strengthened partnerships among
                Centers, expanded research and development partnerships beyond the CGIAR, etc. at
                a lower transaction cost?

             d) Simplification of the CGIAR system: As indicated in the introduction of this paper,
                simplification of the CGIAR system was a key objective of the reform. Leading up to
                the reform, it was realized that the system had become inordinately complex and

46
               difficult to navigate by both those inside and outside the system. This of course
               militated against building research and development partnerships beyond the CGIAR,
               particularly the private sector, and bewildered potential new non-traditional donors.
               Most players in and outside the CGIAR will unfortunately agree that the system is
               every bit as complex, and perhaps even more so, than before the reform.

   3. Science management: The CGIAR is about science for development and that is the basis on
      which its reputation was built. The reform then, included the search for more effective
      science leadership. In this regard the reformed CGIAR system faces a number of science
      challenges. Only three will be listed here. First is how to match the science aspirations of the
      CGIAR, namely being a leader in global agricultural and related research, with the evolving
      and complicated structure of CRPs and Centers management and governance within a
      geographically distributed system. There is an inherent rigidity to scientific research, given
      the human and infrastructural capacities needed in specific scientific areas and thus,
      evolving new science agendas require foresight tied to investment strategies, where such
      investments are often financially constrained under the budgetary systems put in place after
      the reform. Second, is how to balance the need for science and innovation addressing long
      term challenges with those that addressed immediate or short term development needs.
      The reform has resulted in a greatly expanded research agenda for the CGIAR and how to
      balance more upstream aspirations with more downstream relevance is an ongoing issue
      within a complex system. Third, and related to the previous point, is how to organize and
      manage science within an accountability framework focused on broad development
      objectives. Does this shift scientific incentives and priorities and how does the CGIAR
      manage the scope of research together with the necessary partnerships needed to respond
      under such an accountability framework?

       Given the science challenges above, are the various CGIAR organs for science review
       providing the scientific leadership required, as well as direction on the institutional
       arrangements needed for innovative partnerships? The foresight studies, exploratory
       initiatives, novel discoveries are not now being sufficiently addressed. Science oversight is
       essentially focused on the CRPs; and yet science quality, new research capacities, and
       design of research programs are essentially managed by the Centers. Centers are of the
       view that some of the current modalities of executing the CGIAR’s agenda erode their
       capacity for global scientific leadership.

C. Way Forward
Centers believe that this is an opportune time to consolidate the gains of the CGIAR as indicated
above, particularly by developing an even more compelling SRF that exploits our comparative
advantage to address the most compelling global agricultural and related challenges of our time,
and to leverage expanded research and development partnerships, including with the CGIAR. To do
so the Centers perceive the following:


       a. Revision of the Consortium Constitution to reflect the centers as an integral part of the
          CGIAR Consortium; and development of operational modalities that create congruence
          and closer proximity among the various system entities. The modalities to this are not yet
          fully explored, but options suggested by various Centers include integration of the FC and
          CB and the FC and CO; full representation of Centers on the CB as opposed to observer
          status should entertained.



                                                                                                   47
       b. Integrate the functions of CB and FC and the FC and CO to avoid duplication and
          confusion and to ensure clear accountability and inclusiveness. The integration should
          include Center representation in addition to that of donors, NARS, etc. The integrated
          entity(s) should support resource mobilization at much increased levels and consistent
          with the level of effort that is required for the CGIAR to make the global difference that is
          required. In the absence of this integration, systematic performance reviews should not
          only focus on the CRPs and Centers but on all system entities, including the CO and FO
          and the FC and CB.

       c. Greater awareness and recognition by all actors that the reform is not about CRP versus
          Centers but rather the complementarity of the two. CRPs capitalize on the scientific
          expertise, infrastructure and global modalities of the Centers. We contend that the
          debate about CRPs versus Centers is injurious to the mission of the CGIAR.

       d. Create modalities for the Centers to assert global scientific leadership to address the SRF
          through development and execution of a compelling portfolio of CRPs and related
          activities, with enough room for risk taking and high-end scientific discoveries.

       e. Revise modalities for executing the CRPs that facilitate greater efficiencies and
          effectiveness with lower transactions costs.

       f.   Enable the balancing of the short and long-term research for development portfolio and
            up and down stream engagement, based on the comparative advantage of the CGIAR
            and subsidiary principles that define the requisite partnerships.

       g. Ensure long-term multiyear commitment of funding to the system, both to the Centers
          and the CRPs. This is consistent with RBM, which assumes that methodology is designed
          to achieve short, medium and long-term objectives. We would like to emphasize the fact
          that Centers have funding requirements to cover very critical business needs, including
          capital development, and requirements for equipment and infrastructure. Centers also
          feel the pressing need for adequate financial reserves to cover uncertainty and risk,
          including security risks that attend many of the locations in which Centers are located or
          CRPs are implemented.

Appendix 3.    CGIAR Consortium Submission to the MTR Panel (August 28, 2014)

Introduction
The Consortium submitted a briefing note to the MTR Panel at its meeting in January. The
Consortium Board Chair, Board members, CEO and a number of Consortium staff members have
subsequently also engaged in conversations with the Panel Chair, some of its members and
particularly the Member-Secretary – most recently around the Panel’s meeting in London in July.
Now that the Panel has shared its draft initial conclusions, and the 15 Centers have shared their
views, the Consortium would like to submit this additional note for the Panel’s consideration.

What has worked well and not so well?
The Consortium agrees with the Panel that the challenge of food security and nutrition, exacerbated
by climate change, requires a rapid scale-up of carefully targeted agricultural research that can be
effectively translated into development – and that the reform has placed the CGIAR well to lead and
coordinate scaled-up efforts, but not alone. The Consortium agrees with the Centers that the CRPs
have been a very positive achievement that have led to much improved collaboration among the
centers, stronger partnerships, and consolidated work in transversal and essential areas of work
such as climate change and nutrition. While many of the CRPs were initially still collections of legacy
activities, ongoing change within the CRPs is resulting in much improved coherence within the CRPs,
improved collaboration among them, improved theories of change and impact pathways at program
level, and a much improved sense of the intermediate development outcomes the CGIAR can deliver.

The Consortium agrees with the Centers that the first SRF was successful to help focus the 15
centers on a more compelling shared agenda – even though it also agrees with funders that a more
quantitative results framework and targets that enable priority setting, resource allocation and
results based management were lacking and are needed. The Consortium is confident that the
ongoing work to produce a new SRF, with strong engagement of the investors as well as the centers
and a consultation of partners and stakeholders, will indeed position the CGIAR well for the next
round of investments.
While there are strong partners that share responsibility for some CRPs, the Consortium agrees with
the Panel that stronger partnerships with the private sector present opportunities for the CGIAR that
are still largely untapped (with some very positive exceptions). Partnership with national research
and development organizations could be improved as well.

The increased funding for the CGIAR is clearly a key achievement, due in part to the increased
priority among investors for food security, but also because the reform positioned the CGIAR well.
Further growth in funding, required if research is to be scaled up rapidly, will not be easy in the
current climate and will require a strong and concerted resource mobilization effort from all
stakeholders, centers, the Consortium and the Fund. The Consortium agrees with the Centers that
the current combined and complementary funding model (the Windows 1, 2 and 3) is basically
sound and that combined W1-2 funding should indeed grow to a higher percentage of the total. The
Consortium has supported a target of 50-60% W1-2 funding and notes that the Centers also support
a proportion of W1-2 growing to over 60%. The Consortium believes that a new, revitalized SRF and a
new round of strong, coherent CRP investments that jointly form a high-performing, value-for-money
portfolio are critical to the further growth of the W1-2 share of CGIAR funding.

The Consortium notes, and shares, the Panel’s concern that the CRP portfolio will need to meet two
– potentially competing – challenges, that is: (1) there will need to be sufficient investment in
upstream, transformative, discovery type research; while on the other hand (2) ensuring that there is
sufficient investment into integrated delivery of innovations proven to work, at a scale of millions of
farmers and consumers.

Governance
The Consortium noted in its January briefing note to the MTR Panel that governance and
management of the CRPs was a key concern for the Consortium. In our opinion the IEA External
Review of CRP Governance and Management has provided an excellent analysis of the issues and a
helpful set of recommendations to address them. We are pleased that the Centers and the
Consortium agreed on a management response to the IEA review that has provided a solid basis for
adjusting the governance and management of the CRPs; it will provide greater authority for CRP
directors to manage for results; a stronger position of partners in the steering committees; and
reduce transaction costs by reducing the number of governance and management committees.

With respect to the system-level governance structure the Consortium agrees with the Panel that the
reform has led to ambiguities between and among the CB/CO, FC/FO and Centers. The Consortium
believes that to some considerable extent the resulting conflicts and tensions are a normal –even
unavoidable – consequence of a major reorganization of a 40-year old system. Resistance to change
is part of every major change process. The CGIAR could certainly have done better in managing the
change process in a more structured manner, and can still learn from this experience going forward.
The Consortium also agrees that the design of the reform placed the Consortium in a difficult and
ambiguous position. It has, on the one hand, clear programmatic oversight over the CRPs as a whole
and fiduciary responsibility for W1-2 funds. It has to approve the CRP proposals of the centers, to
monitor CRP performance, and allocate funding to the CRPs within the CRP contracts approved by
the investors. The primary accountability of the Consortium for the CRPs is to the Fund Council, not
to the Centers. That establishes the “regulator” role, which the Consortium has been given in the
CGIAR reform, for good reasons, and that the Centers do not always appreciate. On the other hand
the Consortium also has a role supporting and facilitating Centers’ collective actions, the
development of joint policies and guidelines, and the implementation of some crosscutting actions,
for which the Consortium accountability is wholly, or at least partly, to its members, the CGIAR
Centers. This dual role, both as regulator and as facilitator, is indeed causing ambiguities – and
leads to levels of tension, and lack of trust that is unproductive and should be addressed.

The MTR Panel has indicated it supports a single Board, in place of the current dual structure with a
Fund Council and Consortium Board, and the Centers have indicated their support for such a
solution in their submission to the panel as well. The Consortium is definitely interested to explore
how the Fund Council and Consortium could work together more productively, but is concerned that
the Panel’s recommendation would have huge transaction costs. It has taken considerable time and
effort to establish the Consortium as an international organization and a do-over at this stage could
derail the critical business of putting in place a strong SRF and second phase of the CRP portfolio.

One question the Consortium has for the Panel is how it proposes to resolve the inherent conflict of
interest of the members of the proposed single board. The idea that donors will share decision
making on the CGIAR funding to CRPS with the Centers (recipients of those funds), industry (which
may or not contribute funding), NARS (that would be partners contributing in kind in most cases),
and scientists (which do not fund anything) is not realistic. The practical challenges associated with
such a single board should receive more attention. Maybe, in the longer term one can develop a
single Board, but then the decision making on funding would likely shift to a finance committee with
donor members of one form or another.
The current design, where the Consortium does not implement research, and has an arm’s length
relationship with the Centers, allows the Consortium Board to take decisions regarding the CRP
portfolio and individual CRPs without a conflict of interest. This degree of independence of the
Consortium from the Centers is a key feature of the new CGIAR – built into its design deliberately -
that is causing the dissatisfaction noted by the Centers’ Directors General in their submission to the
MTR Panel. It also enables the Consortium to be impartial and have its allegiance first and foremost
to the SRF.

50
The Consortium represents the interests of the CGIAR system as a whole and has its primary
allegiance to the implementation of the SRF and the health and performance of the entire CRP
portfolio; not the interests of individual centers or CRPs. This is a critical difference in the way the
Consortium addresses its work and determines its positions. The Centers will need to clarify what
they really mean when they ask for a change in the Constitution to become part of the Consortium.
While the Centers clearly already are a component of the Consortium – as was stated in the updated
legal opinion* – the fact that they cannot currently dictate what decisions they would like the
Consortium Board to take is indeed a critical feature of the current design and should not change
without endangering the impartial role of the Consortium in the new CGIAR. It is clear that this is a
significant difference with many other membership-type organizations where the members do indeed
determine the positions.

Functioning of the Consortium
While the Consortium is ready to engage in discussions that may lead to a reform of the system-wide
governance structure over time, it also believes there are some issues in the current structure that
should be resolved at short notice. These emerged in 2013 out of discussions between the FC and
CB and were addressed in part in the PwC review of CGIAR governance, specifically:
    The FC decision in April 2013 that the Consortium can only be funded through W1 of the
        Fund, and that its budget is capped, are in direct contradiction to the Joint Agreement and
        Constitution of the Consortium. The FC is not a board for the Consortium, and it does not
        consider the funding requirements required to fulfill the Consortium mission. The Consortium
        accepts that the FC is not obliged to make available more than the subsidy it is willing to
        allocate the Consortium, but then the Consortium Board should be free – indeed has the
        fiduciary responsibility - to raise the resources it deems necessary fulfill the Consortium’s
        mission to the best of its abilities.
    The Consortium Office is an entity of the Consortium, reporting to the Consortium Board (not
        a system entity reporting to the FC). It is the Consortium, not the Consortium Office, which is
        accountable to the Fund Council and reports to the Fund Council.

Opportunities for collective action and for increased efficiency and effectiveness
The Consortium agrees with the Centers that another of the things that have worked well in the
reform is the prospect of more collective action. The Consortium believes there are opportunities to
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the system, and reduce its transaction costs, if the
system is able to think like a Billion $ organization (while maintaining the advantages of a
decentralized networked “consortium”, not a single centralized organization). It has indeed taken
quite a long time for 9 Centers and the Consortium to implement a single ERP, the Once Corporate
System (OCS), and there are clearly lessons to be learned on how this could have been done more
effectively. The Consortium agrees, though, with the two reviews of CGIAR governance carried out in
2013 that a shared ERP such as OCS is a key enabler of more collective action, as well as a
requirement for better and faster CRP management – and reporting and information across centers.
The Consortium and a group of center corporate service directors are developing a business plan for
increased collective action along at least three main axes, i.e. shared systems and services, shared
country offices, and shared management of security risks and stronger communities of practice. We
note the Centers commit to do more in this area in the future in their submission to the MTR.


*The version of the note “What is the CGIAR Consortium” appended to the Centers’ submission to the MTR
Panel was an old version, revised after consultation with the centers and re-issued in June. It recognizes the
Centers as one of the three components of the Consortium, members of, but separate from, the Consortium.




                                                                                                             51
In addition, the Consortium believes that continued action (as already taken by some Centers) to
reduce the very large number of small grants in the system would reduce transaction costs
significantly, and make the overall portfolio more strategic. This was a key objective of the reform,
that is, reducing the over 3,500 bilateral grants on Center books pre-reform, to a small portfolio of
large coherent programs. While it is recognized that some small grants may well have a strategic
nature, generally speaking, a small number of larger bilateral grants (e.g., reducing the number to
500 larger bilateral grants, plus some small grants, from over 2,000), complementing a system of
CRPs with a solid share (50-60%) of pooled W1-2 funding and single reporting was a core idea
behind the reform that still has to be fully realized.

Jointly, the opportunity for large-scale efficiencies in the system from increased collective action,
shared country offices and a reduced number of small grants has the potential to increase
efficiencies and reduce transaction costs very significantly more than reducing the number of board
members, merging centers or reducing center overheads would. Realizing this potential will require
investments first, however.

The way forward
The Consortium agrees with the Centers that there are many things that have gone well in the reform
and that this is a time to capitalize on the investments made in the reform over the last five years,
particularly by developing a strong, compelling SRF and implementing an excellent process for the
CRP 2nd Call that delivers a compelling investment portfolio, enables much improved joint resource
mobilization and has clear development outcomes.

The Consortium also agrees that it is wise to develop operational modalities that create congruence
and closer proximity among the various system entities. While this may over time lead to a single
Board, the Consortium Board is not, at this time, convinced that a system with a single large Board
would be practical or solve the issues the system currently experiences. Any new system of
governance should help decrease the ambiguities and simplify the overall system, but would have to
maintain a separation of tasks and responsibilities that maintains investor confidence that funds are
managed without conflicts of interest. In general, the Consortium would like to see the MTR
recommendations further developed, to help our ongoing work in the context of current realities. The
Consortium would appreciate orientation on how to adjust current work, with more guidance on what
ought to be done how, when and by whom.

In the shorter term, the Consortium Board thinks that a number of actions could be taken as follows:
     1. Confirm, resource and ensure a firm focus on the core business of the CGIAR through
        development and approval of a new SRF and commissioning of a new portfolio of CRPs by
        December 31, 2016.
     2. Change the funding model of the Consortium to a levy (fixed % of CSP for a number of years)
        set by the FC on the proposal of the Consortium Board, as a contribution to its operating
        costs – with full responsibility of the Consortium Board for revenue and expenditure to meet
        its mission, as well as accountability for spending this levy to the FC.
     3. FC support in 2015 for the development of a business case to scale up collective action and
        shared services across the CGIAR system, in order to achieve large scale efficiencies across
        the system, through a W1 allocation of about $1 million to the Consortium.
     4. Ensure longer-term multi-year stable financing for CRPs through innovative financing that,
        among others, helps to turn multi-year commitments from CGIAR investors into upfront cash
        and could enable the CGIAR system to access soft loans (e.g. for scaling out or delivery).
     5. Develop and implement a CGIAR-wide strategy to engage and partner more effectively with
        the private sector to scale up and out strategic public-private partnerships with key seed

52
   companies, food companies, and large retailers, as well as the small to medium enterprises
   such as Asian and African seed companies over the next 3-5 years.
6. Intensify the partnership with key NARES in medium income countries (including but not
   limited to EMBRAPA, CAAS and ICAR) to take advantage of their sizeable national
   investments in agricultural research that have the potential to be leveraged to a much
   greater extent internationally.
7. Support a crosscutting program (or platform) for investments in gene banks (e.g. cryo-
   preservation), common tools, such as related to bio-informatics and “big data”, high thru-put
   phenotyping sites and state of the art infrastructure, managed on a system-wide basis.

Appendix 4.      Summary of Responses to Panel TOR Questions
Research
 Does the research commissioning process and incentives comply with best practices globally?

We are not aware of “best practices.” There are a number of different guidelines used by research
organizations. CGIAR appears to be using guidance developed in 2007, criteria which are consistent
with the guidelines used by others. Based on a review of the first round of CRPs, it appears that the
current process leads to reasonably well-defined research priorities at the CRP level. Selection
criteria are appropriate. The pre-proposal and proposal quality is highly variable, and the ISPC has
done a good job in reviewing the proposals. However, that does not necessarily impact decision-
making by the Fund Council. There is no performance index which makes clear deliverables and
accountabilities, and the reporting is highly variable.

    What should CGIAR be doing to improve the way research is managed and integrated across its
     Centers?

The lack of a suitable SRF makes it difficult to define program boundaries, potential synergies, and
the need for cross-cutting support and research linkages. Without a suitable results framework it is
not clear how the Consortium Board can manage the system towards greater coherence, efficiency
and effectiveness. Currently the responsibility for linking activities to pathways is pushed down to the
CRP level. It appears that there should be opportunities to build on clusters of expertise in Centers to
facilitate synergy and collective impact. For example, would it be sensible for breeders or those
working on big data across all of the Centers to engage more frequently and deeply to share lessons
and knowledge? If yes, then a structural arrangement would be required to facilitate this.

    Is CGIAR effectively building diversity, including gender, into its research programs?

There have been a number of reviews of this issue (e.g., ISPC in 2011, SPIA in 2011, and
Consortium reports in 2012 and 2014, including a Diversity and Inclusion Strategy). There is greater
inclusion of gender issues in CRPs. Recognition of gender as a cross-cutting issue in the new SRF
should further strengthen this. However, the data show a lack of gender balance across the CGIAR.
The issue is certainly being given the attention it is due at the strategic level. The question that
remains is the extent to which action and progress will be monitored and acted upon.

    Does CGIAR have the appropriate balance of research for development, and a focus on delivery
     for end-users?

The focus on delivery through the CRPs has reportedly improved in several of the CRP extension
proposals. The next round of CRP proposals needs to clarify how the proposals will serve end-users’
needs and the impact pathways necessary to deliver results. Finding the right balance is a matter of
understanding the research required to enable the impact.

    How can CGIAR better deliver its research to the field and what model(s) should it employ to do
     so?

The 2014 Dalberg report provides a number of recommendations regarding “delivery.” The Panel
recognizes that there have been mixed views on the accuracy of this report and is not in a position to
judge one way or the other. The Panel considers that the important question which should be
addressed in each CRP, after impact pathways are well understood, is the extent to which delivery is
embedded in a CRP, as opposed to simply providing mechanisms to facilitate delivery by another
entity. This does not mean that CGIAR is the delivery agent, but that a roadmap is designed at the

54
outset, and redesigned as necessary, to ensure that the research is readily translated into action at a
scale required to achieve the desired impact.

Partners
 Does CGIAR engage with the appropriate partners to deliver high-quality research and impact?

A major benefit of the reform and the resulting CGIAR Research Programs is increased collaboration
among Centers and with other partners. The Elsevier studies, the IEA’s review of CRPs, and other
evaluations confirm this progress. Some Centers have substantial partnerships with the private
sector (in both developed and developing countries). Stakeholder surveys by GlobeScan and by some
Panel members show mixed views on accessibility to partner with Centers. The question that should
be asked is whether current partnerships adequately tap key players to scale-up and accelerate
research and roll-out appropriately targeted and budgeted research to address 2030 issues. There is
clearly room to grow in this area.

   What CGIAR incentives weaken or strengthen partnerships?

It was reported, but not verified by the Panel, that almost all W1/W2 funding goes to Centers, not to
external CRP partners. If this is the case, then some potential partners may be reluctant to join a
CRP. There is also the issue of high transaction costs, as reported by the Centers and CRP directors.
But overall, it appears the incentives far outweigh the disincentives (which should nonetheless be
addressed). The main incentive is the opportunity to join a CRP or other research programs
undertaken by Centers. As evidenced by progress-to-date, the CGIAR Centers have the capacity to
scale-up partnerships where and when it makes sense.

   How can CGIAR enhance its accessibility to and collaboration with partners?

Guidance for partnering should be established and monitored across the CGIAR. The use of
GlobeScan-type surveys should be continued to solicit feedback from existing and potential partners.
A special effort should be undertaken to reach out to the international food and beverage industry,
and similar industries, to engage in a dialogue on collaborative partnerships.

   How can CGIAR best engage with national agricultural research systems?

Several of the respondents to the GlobeScan survey (including the responses to the Panel)
expressed the need for CGIAR to more effectively work with and build the capacity of the NARs.
Others expressed that this is not the role of CGIAR; it should focus on producing international public
goods. In discussions with Center and CRP staff, the general view, supported by the Panel, was that
CGIAR should work with and build the capacity of the NARs as and when needed to successfully carry
out the work of the CRPs and to set the stage for delivery of research results to achieve impact on
the ground. The Panel considers that a concerted effort by bilateral and multilateral development
agencies is required to elevate the recognition by recipient country governments of the need to
invest in building strong NARs. The Panel also considers that aid programs should support capacity
development by establishing strong linkages to CGIAR and other international research programs.

Funding
 Is the structure of CGIAR’s entire funding system appropriate for the purpose, or does it create
   perverse incentives for free-riding or other sub-optimal practices?

Overall investment in CGIAR has doubled in five years to $1 billion in 2013, with $342 million in
Windows 1 and 2; $140 million in Window 3; and $524 million in other bilateral contributions and
Center earnings. Window 3 and other bilateral funding, which represents about 65% of total CGIAR


                                                                                                     55
funding, comes from approximately 3,000 grants that are restricted and often support very small
projects. The expected shift of funding to Windows 1 and 2 has not met expectations. Some reviews
have suggested that the focus should be on making W1/2 attractive and not worrying about W3. A
review of the last two Fund Council meetings shows no discussion on innovative financing. A major
concern of many Centers is that current funding does not cover core costs, such as Center
infrastructure needs.

     What are the implications of misalignment among all funding sources (i.e., contributions to the
      Fund and other support to CGIAR) for the governance and management of the system?

At the present time, following a period of rapid growth in funding, the misalignment does not seem to
have had an adverse impact. The flexibility shown up to now in allowing Window 3 contributions to be
assigned to CRPs has probably been a factor in funding growth, but at the same time has
contributed to the misalignment.

     Is the concept of fully pooled funding a realizable goal, or will Window 3 and bilateral funding
      increasingly dominate?

It does not appear to be a realizable goal.

     What mechanisms can enhance donor participation in pooled funding?

Efforts should be made to strengthen donors’ confidence that W1/W2 contributions will achieve
greater value for money.

     Does CGIAR have a clear understanding of the total funding needed to meet its goals?

No, it is unlikely that anyone does. The report of the Commission on the Economy and the Climate
(2014) recommends that funding for agricultural research be doubled by 2030.

Structure and governance
 Has the separation between funders and researchers led to a more efficient and effective
    CGIAR?
No.

     Are the roles of the various CGIAR entities (e.g., the Fund Council, IEA, ISPC, and the Consortium)
      distinct, clear, and well aligned to ensure accountability?
No.

     Are the current governance arrangements consistent with best practices?

We are reluctant to assess best practices. The current arrangements are inconsistent with the
governance structures adopted by most international partnership organizations over the last several
years.

     Have the reforms increased overall costs and, if so, is that increase justified by better, more
      relevant research resulting in greater impact?

The actual increase in costs is unclear, and the impact of such investments on the outcome of
research is even less clear.

Appendix 5.      Governance Structure: Review of Global Partnerships

In considering possible means of addressing CGIAR governance ambiguities, the MTR Panel
considered responses by other organizations and funds that have faced similar challenges. It is
worth noting that CGIAR was one of the first global partnerships designed to take collective action to
help developing countries reduce poverty and grow their economies. Since CGIAR was established
more than 40 years ago, many multi-stakeholder partnerships and multi-donor funds have emerged
to address challenges and issues, such as climate finance, vaccinations, major infectious diseases,
and education. Bezanson and Isenman (2012)27 attribute the growth in targeted, multi-partner funds
to (i) recognition of the size and complexity of challenges for which single actors are not adequately
equipped, (ii) the decline in confidence of existing aid structures and business models, (iii) the rapid
spread of new technologies, (iv) successful advocacy of NGOs, and (v) their political appeal in donor
countries. Many of the newer partnerships have been instrumental in developing and testing a new
kind of governance that is based on the concept of stakeholder constituencies as opposed to
shareholders.

For the purpose of MTR Panel deliberations, the governance structures of several partnership
organizations were reviewed. The results are summarized in the table below. All of the partnership
organizations or funds reviewed are governed by single boards that have varying structures, but all
include both donors and recipients. Several boards include stakeholders other than donors and
recipients as active members or observers. Some of these stakeholders also have active voting
rights. In contrast, the current CGIAR governance structure is rather unique in its two-pillared
structure, comprised of the Fund Council and Consortium Board, each supported by an
administrative office.28

The PwC report on CGIAR governance suggested that CGIAR should consider a single board. The
report suggested that a “leaner governance structure” could (i) reduce duplication, (ii) achieve greater
efficiency, and (iii) improve accountability. The PwC report also noted that “other organizations with
prior dual structures have often opted for a single board, which comprises representatives of key
stakeholders and partners balanced with independent individuals who are appointed on the basis of
their skills and networks. A single secretariat with a strong CEO oversees program and performance
management, providing internal and external visibility for the organization, while innovative and
effective partnerships are seen as key ingredients for success.”

In discussing the challenges of governance for organizations and partnerships, Bezanson and
Isenman note that there is no agreed definition of “good” governance. However, they do outline
the main (generic) strategic and fiduciary responsibilities for governing boards.29 These include
the following.

Structure and Composition: Ensuring that Board size is conducive to efficient and effective
decision-making and that its membership reflects the mix of skills, abilities, experiences and
competencies required to meet the needs of the organization.

Strategy and Plan: Ensuring that the organization has a clear direction, knows where it is trying
to go, has set reasonable goals, objectives and targets and has aligned these to the

27 K.A. Bezanson and P. Isenman. “Governance of New Global Partnerships: Challenges, Weakness, and
Lessons.” Center for Global Development Policy Paper 014. 2012.
28 The fact that the Center partners have their own Boards adds to the complexity, but is not considered by the

Panel to be unique. Most major partnerships comprising legal entities have a similar situation in that each
partner is directly governed by a Board or similar entity accountable for that entity’s strategic and fiduciary
performance.

appropriate means for their attainment, including the required human and financial resources
and the internal incentive system.

Roles and Responsibilities: Ensuring that the principal roles and responsibilities of directors are
stipulated and communicated, including the effective delegation of authorities and clear
differentiation of the respective roles of management and board members.

Performance Oversight and Assessment: Ensuring that the organization has in place information
systems that track performance against established objectives and that timely reviews are
conducted and adjustments/adaptations made as required.

Financial Oversight and Management: Ensuring that the organization is well managed
financially, that its accounting systems are designed and applied with professionalism and that
there is independent audit and certification of accounts.

Risks and Opportunities Oversight: Ensuring that corporate and other risk assessments are
regularly conducted and that risks are monitored and opportunities for risk mitigation are
pursued.

Communications: Ensuring that the organization and its management have in place the means
to communicate effectively the organization’s key messages and that this is applied with
consistency.

Succession Planning: Ensuring that there are succession plans for board membership and for
the Chief Executive.

Legal and Ethical Conduct: Ensuring that there are written conflict of interest and code of ethics
policies and codified governance guidelines for boards and their committees.

Even though it has existed for many more years than most similar partnerships, CGIAR can learn
from the governance lessons of some of the newer partnerships. For example, the governance
experience of the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), initially established in 2002 as the
Fast Track Initiative (FTI), is worth reviewing. The FTI governance went through a series of
reforms made necessary because the partnership was launched before its structures, functions,
lines of accountability, and basic objectives had been fully worked out. Following reviews in
2005 and 2008, the FTI consolidated its various governing committees into a Board of
Directors. The constituency-based Board currently has 19 members, senior-level
representatives of various constituencies, and a full-time independent chair. Initially, the
chairing arrangement was for Board members to select two co-chairs on a rotating basis. A
comprehensive review in 2010 noted considerable improvements in the GPE governance
following the reforms, but found the co-chairing arrangements to be sub-optimal. The GPE has
since replaced the rotating co-chair arrangement with a full-time, independent and non-voting
chair.30

Appendix 6: Outline of Possible Transitional Arrangements

A number of comments received prior to the Consultation Draft and subsequent to it have raised
concerns about the change process in transitioning from a two-pillar to a single board governance
structure. There is concern about potential disruptions to ongoing work and the time it might take to
make the transition and the risk that the next round of CRPs might be delayed. It is the view of the
Panel that the finalization of the SRF, the initial guidelines and the call for proposals for the next
round of CRPs, and planning required to strengthen ISPC can all be achieved in parallel with the
transition planning process, and that the new Board should be able to be in place in time for the CRP
approval process. In order to demonstrate how this might be achieved, we have outlined below
possible transitional arrangements, not as a definitive piece, but simply to illustrate the sort of
timetable that could be adopted.

November 2014 – December 2015 – Action Plan Implementation
By the end of November, the FC Chair appoints a Transition Team Leader (TTL), who would manage a
transition team and be the focal point for engagement with stakeholders for consultation on the
various elements of the shift from the two-pillar to a single board governance structure.

By the end of December, (i) the TTL with support from the Fund Office (FO), identifies expertise
requirements for TT, detailed TOR for each, and candidates to be recruited, and (ii) the Fund Council,
Consortium Board, and Centers designate a cross-CGIAR advisory team, with four members from
each of the three.

January 2015 – April 2015
By January 15, 2015, the TT is in place, with an office at the FO. This is likely to be two senior
experts, in addition to the TTL, all capable of interacting one-on-one with stakeholders and
representatives of “peer agencies,” such as GAVI, GPE, etc., plus three more junior professionals to
assist in research and drafting. In addition, the World Bank would be requested to second an
individual from the Trustee’s Office and another from the Legal department on a part-time basis to
support the work of the Transition Team.

By mid-February 2015, circulate a detailed TOR for Board Chair and process for his/her recruitment,
for eventual approval by the Fund Council on a no-objections basis by the end of February.

By mid-March 2015, the consultation draft options paper on Board size, membership, constituency
breakdown, and self-selection process discussed at a workshop with the cross-CGIAR advisory team.
Other interested parties and potential key stakeholder group representatives could also be invited).

By mid-April 2015, professional head hunters establish a short-list of candidates for the Board Chair.

Late April 2015 – Fund Council Meeting
TT proposes for approval (i) a short-list of candidates for the Board Chair, along with proposed
selection process, (ii) Board structure, constituencies and process for self-selecting representatives
to the Board, and (iii) the procedure and selection criteria for locating the Administrative Unit.

TT also submits for information progress on the (i) design of the Administrative Unit functions,
accountabilities and composition, (ii) delineation of joint responsibilities of Centers (i.e., the selected
functions of the Consortium Office that would transferred to Centers for joint responsibility), and (iii)
a detailed work plan up to the November FC meeting.




                                                                                                        63
May - September 2015
By the end of May 2015, TT recommendations revised in accordance with guidance from FC.
Detailed options on Board roles and responsibilities and accountabilities, as well as the
Administrative Unit’s design, functions, and responsibilities, prepared and discussed in a second
workshop with the cross-CGIAR advisory team.

TT assists/facilitates constituencies as required to agree on initial Board membership.

By mid- September 2015, circulate for virtual discussion, the change management plan; initial
policies and procedures necessary to hold the first Board meeting; assessment of proposals for
location of the Administrative Unit; and proposed compensation, rights, and privileges, etc. for Board
members and Administrative Unit staff.

By the end of September, the change management plan etc. (see above) discussed at third cross-
CGIAR Advisory Team workshop. External stakeholders likely to be on Board would be invited.

October 2015
Circulate for the November Fund Council meeting the (i) selection of Board Chair, (ii) Board
composition, (iii) first Board meeting agenda, and (iv) draft agreement on the establishment of
the Administrative Unit.

November 2015 Fund Council Meeting
The Fund Council would approve the appointment of the Chair, and the establishment of the Board
and the Administrative Unit, and would dissolve itself.

The new Board Chair would convene the first Board meeting and consider for approval the proposed
Board responsibilities, rules, and procedures; the Board’s and Administrative Unit’s workplans and
budgets; and policies and procedures required to maintain operational momentum on preparation of
the second round of CRP proposals.

November 2015 – December 2016 – Initial Board Priorities
November 2015 and April 2016: First two Board meetings would appoint the Chair; adopt the basic
policy framework, including changes in ISPC, etc.; agree on Board operating guidelines; establish
Donor Council; establish priority Board committees, such as an Audit Committee, etc.; approve
Administrative Unit structure, staffing and initial budget and appoint the head of the Unit; receive
reviews of current CRPs; and confirm endorsement of the new SRF and new CRP selection criteria.

November 2016: Third Board meeting would, among other business, review and approve the second
round of CRPs.

findings/recommendations which possibly could be considered by the Fund Council in Brussels.

APAARI considers that MTR Panel has undertaken a thorough exercise relating to ongoing CGIAR
reform process. It has addressed well the existing challenges, and has made a number of relevant
recommendations for required future direction and impetus to reform process. Indeed, it is both
timely and a useful contribution, although much will now depend on the effective implementation of
these recommendations subject to their endorsement by Fund Council.

The nine recommendations in the Panel Report (and the associated conclusions) form good overall
basis for pursuing the reforms and correcting the existing anomalies identified by the stakeholders,
centres and the donors during the consultation process. APAARI as a regional forum would like to
offer following suggestions for consideration:

   The need for greater clarity in the CGIAR Vision and Mission is fully supported, but it is not clear
    as to how a more elaborate mission statement as suggested in the report will link to the new
    Strategic Results Framework (SRF) to avoid duplication or potential confusion. The SRF and CRPs
    should be the key vehicles for elaborating and delivering the Vision and Mission statements.
    Unfortunately, so far there is no clarity on SRF and the process has invariably taken long time.
    Hence, urgency for putting in place SRF must be highlighted with a defined time frame and the
    process should be transparent and consultative, involving the developing NARS and all
    stakeholders.

    A CGIAR Task Force to identify priorities and least cost options on a systematic basis is useful
    recognising that the links and timing of such a prioritisation process will likely have a strong
    bearing on the development of the new SRF and its implementation. This needs further
    explanation in our view, given that the new SRF is still being developed. The open data facilities
    are required and such a network will need to be developed in consort with existing regional and
    global research data networks to be effective and to avoid wasteful duplication.

   We fully agree that the preparation of the SRF must have sufficient stakeholder participation to
    ensure ownership of the final product. With regards to the NARS and regional forums the two way
    interaction will need proactive action by all parties. To date many NARS feel somewhat sidelined
    in the deliberative mechanisms. APAARI and other regional forums can be important focal points
    for progressing this process further, especially through effective stakeholder involvement. The



                                                                                                     65
     GCARD Road Map had been an outcome of this process and hence we must take advantage of
     such initiatives while finalising SRF and needed CRPs

    The proposed single CGIAR Board to replace the Fund Council and Consortium Board is indeed
     the most radical proposition, which should be taken up as a priority. In doing so the current
     ambiguities and confusions for the overlapping roles and responsibilities should be resolved,
     since the lack of clarity on roles has potential implications for cost and managerial efficiency. A
     unified and more streamlined governance structure would improve the system's efficiency,
     coordination and convergence. Further, a suggestion to form a donor council (like the Finance
     Committee chaired by World Bank in the past) to advise the CGIAR Board is most appropriate. In
     addition, it is our considered view that there could also be an Independent Advisory Committee
     (IAC) for the single Board having representation of eminent persons representing different
     NARS /regional organisations to provide matured advice on national/regional perspectives and
     developments. The role of regional forums and NARS in greater adoption of research results and
     their role in capacity building can be substantially enhanced to out scale innovations for greater
     impact on small holder farmers.

    The CGIAR partnerships will require much more serious efforts in strengthening to avoid slippage
     and to ensure greater partnerships in future. This is the considered view of regional forums
     based on feedback of various NARS members and stakeholders. Stronger partnership will help
     immensely in scaling up research, adoption and improved financing for the future. We also
     support the important role of both public and private partnerships, as emphasised by the review
     panel. APAARI stands ready to be an active regional contributor to these endeavours. It has
     suitable networks involving emerging Asian economies to make a positive contribution in
     meeting the CGIAR Goal and Mission.

    Similarly, APAARI and other regional forums can be active partners with the CGIAR and its
     constituent centers in research policy advocacy, including political level representations and
     deliberations, knowledge sharing, capacity building and research partnerships. Suitable
     mechanisms for making such partnerships feasible in practice require further consideration.

    The proposed extension and elaboration of the ISPC role and leadership in providing guidance,
     analyses and quality assurance (like the role of TEC in the past) is fully supported. Its role and
     authority for partnerships requires further clarity and action since in our view this has remained a
     weak link despite existing reforms.

    An additional comment relates to GCARD. The regional forums consider this an important event
     to bring all stakeholders on a common platform to deliberate periodically the research
     outcomes/outputs of CGIAR system, and to provide periodic strategy for their faster adoption
     through greater involvement of stakeholders. We consider this to be an important requirement
     for which allocation of resources will be more productive in the long run. Interface among
     stakeholders at frequent intervals is considered to be a useful investment. No doubt, required
     reforms for the GCARD process will be put in place alongside the implementation of the MTR
     Panel Review report.

Further, while resource mobilisation has been considered in the review findings and
recommendations, the role of window 3/bilateral funding sources has not been fully addressed.
Given the ongoing importance of these funding options in the overall financial position of the CGIAR,
it is considered that member centers of the CGIAR should be able to raise contributions from the
donors though these channels and other sources in the future without any restriction. Also the
importance of window 1 and 2 funds and also the importance of autonomy of each of the institutions
should also be emphasised.

We do hope that above APAARI comments will be helpful and be considered as a constructive
contribution towards the on-going reform process. APAARI being very supportive of the Panel report,
looks forward in participating actively towards implementation of its recommendations once
approved by the Fund Council.


                            Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)

As representatives of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation on the Fund Council, we strongly support
all nine MTR recommendations and want to publicly acknowledge the tremendous contribution of
the MTR panel. Recommendations that we want to call out as high priority for the future success of
the CGIAR reform include: governance (one board), innovative financing, and taking time to develop
a strong SRF to frame the next round of CRPs. All three of these issues are interrelated.

We are quite aware that implementation of these recommendations will require grappling with as-yet
unanswered questions, especially the governance structure and the wording of new governance
documents. Outcomes of the proposed changes should include:
    simplified governance structure, including advisory bodies
    appropriate allocation of responsibility and risk among a unified board and the Center
       Boards
    clearly defined roles and responsibilities of all parties of the CGIAR (CGIAR Board, CGIAR
       Board Chair, advisory bodies, Center Board Chairs, Center DGs, CRP Directors, etc.) – this is
       one of the key issues that has adversely impacted the CGIAR reform implementation during
       the past four years and the recommended changes create an opportunity to institute clear
       responsibility and accountability for all parties of the CGIAR.

A few additional comments that may help shape the conversation at FC12 include:

(1) Transition – the CGIAR is at a fragile point in the change management process (too many have
been at this for too long). We should be thoughtful of how to implement the MTR recommendations
to achieve the original goals of increased efficiency and effectiveness of the CGIAR. But at the same
time we should put ourselves on an assertive time line – so that this process does not drag out.

(2) Center Boards – a particular attention is warranted in deciding the scope of authority of the new
CGIAR Board with respect to the Centers’ individual governance. As in any consortium or group
governance, there is real value in the individual organizations’ Boards to manage their institutional
risks. The CGIAR Board of Governors does not want to be managing a Mexican labor dispute,
approving a land deal in Nigeria, or negotiating with a local host government of a Center. If they are
run well, the Center Boards play critical governing roles, because they have their feet on the ground,
so to speak. Weakening the Center Boards would actually weaken the practical accountability overall
of the system. Instead, there should be progress made to delineate roles and responsibilities that
are clearly articulated in a new constitution as well as mechanisms to govern, such as voting for
approval by the CGIAR Board, Centers, and decisions that are straight out delegated (with



                                                                                                   67
concomitant accountability) to the Center Boards. The current constitution does not offer the
required clarity to cover practical guidance of the division of responsibilities.

(3) Accountability for CRPs – this should be the central responsibility of the new CGIAR Board.
Governance at the level of the CRPs and Center programs needs to be clarified to reduce duplication
and inefficiencies that supports collaboration cross-centers and partnerships. Accountability follows
the flow of funding from donors under suitable performance agreements. Currently, CRP Lead
Centers (and Center Boards) are accountable. However, this is separated from the most
management decisions of each CRP Director. Here too we need greater clarity on governance
structure, roles and responsibilities of all parties. Under the one board model, does the Lead Center
Board take on direct governance accountability, given that sub-grants to partners are managed by
the Lead Center? We need to drive towards simplicity, clarity and accountability as governance
structures are designed and learn from the experience of the past four years.


                                               Canada

Canada appreciates the work of the Mid-Term Review Panel and welcomes its findings gathered from
consultations across stakeholders. We are particularly supportive of the recommendations to
develop a focused and outcome-oriented Strategy and Results Framework that is at once allied to a
clear compelling vision of the mission of the CGIAR, and that identifies opportunities for innovative
finance, optimizes developmental impact, and improves thought leadership by the CGIAR with a
stronger role for the Independent Science and Partnership Council.

In Canada’s view, the CGIAR needs to push forward three priorities in order to reinforce its value-
proposition to donors:

       Strategy: First, the CGIAR’s Strategy and Results Framework (SRF) needs to clearly articulate
       expected development outcomes in the long term. The SRF also needs to describe how
       outcomes from the CGIAR’s research programmes (irrespective from which of the three
       Windows they receive funding) will be tracked in the short to medium term. Donors need to
       be able to gauge performance more easily.

       Effectiveness: CGIAR should continue to improve the effectiveness of its collaborative
       research programs, including more systematic implementation of its commitments on gender
       equality and engagement with a broader array of partners, including the private sector.

       Efficiency: While reform efforts to date have reduced multiple costs to donors involved in
       oversight of 15 CGIAR Centers, there is scope for more ambition. Further improvements in
       system-wide coherence, be it policy, operational or governance-related, would spur the CGIAR
       towards greater efficiency, as well as reassure donors that the CGIAR system is focused on
       reaping the maximum dividend from each dollar it receives.

Following are our preliminary comments and questions respecting the consultation draft of the MTR
report:

Prioritization of Research: The priority areas defined in the report are important to for global food
security research. Further dialogue through the process of consultation and development of the
Strategy and Results Framework in 2014-2015 would provide a constructive mechanism for further
consideration. In particular:



68
       Canada strongly supports a focus on nutrition integrated into agricultural research moving
        forward, and appreciates the focus on stunting, however we recognize that nutrition research
        may have broader impact that could integrate other measures to demonstrate progress.
       Recognizing the role of agriculture in the context of both climate change adaptation and
        mitigation, accelerating progress on climate-smart agriculture is welcome.
       The focus on degraded arable lands should consider research on marginal lands rather than
        solely degraded lands, reflecting agricultural research on marginal areas that may, for
        example, be naturally less fertile, subject to desertification, or highly saline.
       Disparities remain among CRPs and Centers in their dedicated capacity for integrating
        gender in research agendas. This is reflected in the limited progress by some research
        programs on these commitments; while others have more fully embraced gender equality as
        a central component of their research. In parallel with the need for improved performance
        management systems, gender should be more fully integrated into results and accountability
        frameworks.

Scaling-Up Partnerships:
The ‘science of delivery’ challenge remains undefined at the system level in so far that the CGIAR
has not articulated its approach to engaging various external partners. Canada supports the
recommendation to further define how CGIAR can more effectively engage partners outside the
system, and how it makes decisions about linking with various types of delivery agents to achieve
development outcomes.

Scaling Up Finance:
Canada supports the recommendations to pursue opportunities to scale up finance for the CGIAR
system with new and existing donors in the context of a changing funding landscape. CGIAR can
seize opportunities to improve messaging based on a shared vision and strategy, coordinate
communications, engage partners and leadership, and the explore innovative finance mechanisms.

Governance Structure:
Canada recognized the opportunities for simplifying the governance structure and improving the
effectiveness of decision-making and accountability within the CGIAR system. A stronger role for the
Independent Science and Partnership Council is a welcome recommendation to improve the rigour of
decision-making.

In principle, we support the merger of the Fund Council and Consortium Board subject to additional
clarity on the issue of representation and management support functions to be put in place to
advance decision-making by the single Board. The establishment of a single Board should be
contingent upon:
     adequate donor representation, reflecting the role of funders in supporting the CGIAR
         system;
     a clear conflict of interest policy to maintain the integrity of funding and strategic decisions,
         with due consideration to the range of stakeholders proposed for membership including the
         private sector and management of CGIAR research;
     maintaining the continued role of the World Bank as Trustee of the CGIAR Fund, providing
         essential technical and administrative capacities to support the Fund.

The final decision regarding the governance structure should be contingent upon further clarification
of a number of considerations:


                                                                                                     69
        definition of the key roles, authorities, and accountabilities of Board membership, with a
         focus on enhanced accountability and strategic decision-making;
        the proposed role of the private sector on the Board;
        the role of the proposed Donor’s Council and CGIAR Centre Advisory Committee, including
         the relationships with the Board;
        the proposed mechanism for establishing the Board’s membership and constituencies;
        the legal and administrative implications of moving the Fund Council and Fund Office from
         the World Bank to an independent Board with a support secretariat possibly housed in
         another country; and
        equally, the legal and administrative implications of moving the Consortium Board and
         Consortium Office from its current status in France.

objectives, and provide adequately detailed expectations of
results. The Panel recommends that the vision for CGIAR
be oriented towards agricultural research required to meet
immediate and long-term nutrition needs and achieve
equitable food security by 2030. Likewise, the Panel
recommends that the CGIAR mission should include how it
will achieve these short and long term societal challenges
through its mission statement – through its strengths as a
global network; a network that harnesses other relevant
capabilities from organizations.

considerable room for expanding existing and establishing       management needs to be for both

and key organizations engaged in research with global
reach (e.g. EMBRAPA, CSIRO, and private sector

establishing, managing and reviewing partnerships. The
guidelines should be clearly tailored to meet the strategic
objectives and results delineated in the SRF.

programs and those of other leading institutions and
companies are sufficient to address priority food security
and nutrition challenges, with a view to identifying major
gaps that require new global partnerships, special-
purpose, internationally-coordinated, and long-term mega-
programs designed to solve the problems, rather than put
dents in them. CGIAR is likely to play a key role in
identifying what future partnerships are needed to tackle
the world’s food security mega-challenges and propose a
commensurate framework for action.

CGIAR Centers and other potential partner organizations
need to be adaptive in how they work with partners so as to
assure their long-term relevance as coalition partners. They
will need to engage in both leadership and non-leadership
(or supporting) roles, taking on responsibilities that are
best suited to CGIAR’s strengths and comparative
advantages. CGIAR can play a leadership role by bringing
top-level global leaders together to tackle challenges
(beyond the reach of individual partners) in a collaborative
manner.

ISPC or its replacement should be prepared immediately by
a task force established by the Fund Council.


                                                China

China values very much the MTR Panel’s work on conducting such a productive Final Report
(Consultation Draft). The report findings well summarized the achievements CGIAR have made since
its reform as well as the challenges CGIAR is facing at the current stage.

China agrees that the conception of SRF and CRPs are the most important outcomes from the
reforms and have largely improved the consistency and coordination of overall research work across
different centers.

As a Fund Council member, China also expects to see further improvement in operational and
administrative efficiency of the system, especially for the new SRF formulation and CRPs
implementation.

China believes that most recommendations put forward by the Final Report are appropriate and
pertinent aiming at promoting CGIAR long-term development, in particular, the finalization of SRF,
the research priorities and the partnership optimization are the most concerns from China.

However, China thinks it’s still need to be carefully considered and discussed regarding the
suggestion to change the governance structure, e. g. to establish a single Board replacing Fund
Council and Consortium. The current structure is resulted from a common decision made by the
majority of all related stakeholders at the beginning of CGIAR reform, and the centers and donors
have adapted gradually to this system. To establish a new governing body will not only involve the
cost of energy, human resources and expenses to form new rules, but also will probably bring
confusions to the on-going research work, which is not helpful for efficiency improvement. We believe


                                                                                                     73
that strengthening the coordination and communication between Fund Council and Consortium
should be ideal way to improve the governance of CGIAR in spite of the fact that .it’s not always easy
to do it perfectly.

In addition, we have some other suggestions in terms of recommendations:

1) For the research prioritization, we think technology transfer and delivery should also be included
since the aim of the research and its outputs should be efficiently delivered to the end users. This
also aligns in large part with existing AR4D frameworks.

2) We think it’s also important to enhance awareness and visibility of CGIAR initiatives as well as
publicize and highlight its achievements. Indeed CGIAR has circulated every year a large number of
very detailed documentations, including annual reports; however partners at different levels
(governments, research institutions, farmers) would expect more clear, concise and attention-
drawing messages for better understanding and time saving. Such kind of publication and
communication methods should help strengthen impacts to larger audiences.

3) China is willing and prepared to get more involved in large-scale research cooperation such as
CRPs and expect to make more contributions to improve global food security with CGIAR. We
welcome the idea to scale up the partnerships and upgrade the cooperation with strategic partners
with great potential in order to address global agriculture challenges.


                                                  Fiji

Hon. Minister for Agriculture, Rural and Maritime Development and National Disaster Management,
Hon. Mr. Inia B. Seruiratu and myself have gone through the Final Report from the Mid-Term Review
(MTR) Panel of the CGIAR Reform, Consultation Draft dated October 8, 2014. We find the report
comprehensive and focused. We have very few observations, which are as follows:

Pages: 7, 13, 24, 27, 28, 33, 45, 49: "Innovative Financing Options/ Approaches for Agricultural
Research." This is an important area and we feel that more discussions are needed on the various
mechanisms needed for fund generation, what are the opportunities, and how to identify them. This
is of special interest to us as we are also looking at ways to generate funds to implement the "Fiji
2020 Agriculture Sector Policy Agenda" that was launched by the Hon. Prime Minister of Fiji in
August this year to modernize Fiji's Agriculture Sector.

Pages: 6, 7, 17, 20, 29, 30, 44, 49, 50: "Governance Structure." We agree to the suggestion of the
Panel that a single CGIAR Board (CB) and Administration Unit be established replacing the Fund
Council (FC) and Consortium Board (CB), to reduce duplication, improve efficiency and accountability.
The panel has proposed number of representatives from various constituencies and to break down
constituencies into sub-constituencies, representing the CGIAR Board. The 3 NARS representatives
from geographic areas: Africa, Asia and Latin America are mentioned. We feel at least one NARS
representative should be included/added from the Pacific Islands Countries and Territories (PICTs).
This is because there are unique and wide range of challenges and opportunities in the PICTs.

Pages: 5 (Executive Summary), 10 & Page:6: "To Create a World Free of Hunger." & "Specific focus
on reducing stunting." No mention is made for Pacific Islands Countries and Territories, where
hidden hunger (nutritional hunger) and Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) are of serious concern.
In PICTs populations, we should look at other more sensitive and measurable indicators of nutritional
hunger rather just than stunting alone.


74
General Comments on the CGIAR/IARCs: We are of the opinion that there should be one exclusive
dedicated IARC under the CGIAR umbrella that would address the food security, poverty reduction,
sustainable management of natural resources, and improve human health and nutrition in Pacific
Islands Countries and Territories (PICTs). This would also address cross-cutting issues: gender
issues, strengthen the R&D capacity of the NARSs, and integrate climate change, biodiversity, etc.
We propose it as "International Institute of Island Agriculture" for your kind consideration.

Introduction
      FAO thanks the Panel for the report it provided, acknowledging the extensive interviews and
       the collective wisdom of the review panel, which is composed of a well-balanced,
       distinguished group of leading experts.
      FAO agrees in general with the panel’s assessment on the achievements and the key
       problems of the 2009 CGIAR reform. We are in concurrence with the Panel, the Center
       Directors-General, and the Consortium on the key areas that have worked well, and those
       areas that have not.
      FAO considers that the MTR proposes a substantial modification on the existing governance
       structure, but fails to provide a strong analysis of potential operational difficulties and
       political consequences of such a proposal. We therefore feel that the recommended “new
       wave of reform” especially on the governance needs further assessment and discussion.
      Furthermore, FAO finds that some key recommendations of the panel report, such as the
       five new areas of research priorities, the principles and the possible composition for the new
       governance mechanism, the partnerships, and the restructured ISPC, lack a robust
       evidence-based analyses, more empirical than analytical, and hence are not sufficiently
       convincing.

FAO’s specific comments:

1. What has worked well and not worked so well:
    We agree with the Panel’s assessment of the important achievements, e.g. the formulation of
     a results oriented Strategy and Results Framework, the progress of the CRPs, significantly
     increased funding, much increased collaboration of the Centers, a strong programmatic
     alignment and the shared services.
    We also agree strongly with the Panel’s conclusion on the problems of the reform so far,
     especially those associated with the ambiguities between the FC and CB, the FO and CO,
     reflected perhaps in the cumbersome relationship between the Centers and the Consortium.
     The high transactions costs of the system as a whole is another area of discontent from the
     Centers and some stakeholders.
    The inability of the Consortium and the Fund Council to enact necessary operational
     guidelines and a code of conduct recognized by all partners as a “must have” for
     operationalizing a dual structure was a key problem.

2. SRF and research priorities:
    FAO agrees that the current SRF, together with the SRF Action Plan, served its purpose at the
      time. FAO also agrees with the Review panel that a renewed SRF needs to be developed
      before the second call for CRPs.
    FAO appreciates the intention of the Review Panel in pointing out five potential areas of new
      research priorities. However, we are of the view that the research priorities will need to be set
      under the framework of the renewed SRF. The SRF should be formulated based on a solid

                                                                                                     75
         analysis of the challenges that agricultural research will face, the comparative advantage of
         the CGIAR Centers, and the documented needs of the stakeholders.
        FAO would urge that research priorities are not defined in isolation from the international
         policy framework and the sustainable development agenda. The priority setting on food and
         agriculture as it takes place in appropriate fora, such as FAO and IFAD, should be carefully
         considered in any research prioritization exercise.

3. Governance:
    FAO is in concurrence with the Review Panel on the problems in the current governance
      structure, and agrees that the problem needs to be addressed in order to improve the
      efficiency and effectiveness of the system. We would like to advise that in deliberating on a
      “new” governance mechanism and structure, it should not be underestimated the processes,
      the cost and the legal implications associated with drastically changing the Consortium which
      is legally established as an International Organization under international law.
    In the meantime, FAO does not find the Panel’s specific recommendation about the
      governance sufficiently convincing at this stage, without a thorough and evidence-based
      analysis of the potential gains and risks of the recommended new structure. We are
      nonetheless open to further discussions about the optimal solutions to the problems
      identified by the MTR Panel.
    In particular, FAO would like to emphasize the importance of involving the multilateral system
      (such as FAO, the World Bank, IFAD) mandated on food security and rural poverty reduction
      in the CGIAR governance. The presence of UN specialized agencies establishes a vital linkage
      and consistency between CGIAR and the international policy and normative framework on
      food and agriculture.
    FAO believes that the leadership role of the World Bank, perhaps one of the most important
      global development institutions that has provided the CGIAR with consistent and pivotal
      support since its inception, in the new CGIAR governance is crucial, especially at this juncture
      of CGIAR transition.
    It is not clear the expected role of the “Chief Scientist” in the new board as recommended in
      the MTR report. What would be the role and responsibility of the Chief Scientist in the Board
      vis-à-vis that of the Science Council?

4. Partnerships:
    FAO finds the Panel’s analyses and the recommendations on partnerships weak and
       disappointing.
    The importance of novel and effective partnerships is indisputable. One of the key elements
       of the 2009 CGIAR reform was to remove the CGIAR annual meeting and established the
       GCARD. A close engagement of multilateral development partners such as FAO and IFAD in
       the CGIAR system is expected to contribute to bridging research with extension, policy and
       application by farmers so as to scaling up impact. FAO finds it odd that neither FAO, GFAR nor
       GCARD are mentioned in the Panel report.
    FAO believes that CGIAR needs the full participation of Development Agencies and non-
       funders represented by GFAR into the Fund Council. This implies that its governance needs
       to be inclusive, not exclusive, and to provide accountability vis-a-vis both the Funders and the
       partners/beneficiaries. This was the rationale for merging the former Annual Meeting of the
       CGIAR and GFAR triennial Assembly into a single new process leading to a conference, the
       GCARD, while providing accountability to the CGIAR with all sectors,
       research/extension/education/Private sector and other stakeholders. It is disappointing that
       the MTR report does not present an analyses nor recommendation on this critically important
       aspect of the CGIAR reform.



76
5.    Scaling up funding:
      FAO would like echo the reminder in the Consortium’s submission to the Panel that further
         scaling up funding will likely be challenging. The idea of a “bond” is interesting, but lacks
         support by thorough analysis of the financing market, investors’ expectations, the suitability
         of the CGIAR core business with such financial tools, and the potential political risks and
         transaction costs of CGIAR pursuing such directions.

6. Role and future direction of the ISPC:
    Not clear about the new direction and roles of the ISPC as recommended by the Panel.
    Recall the 2008 CGIAR system review report that recommended changing the role of the
       Science Council from “policing” to advising and helping on the research direction and
       science quality.

Conclusions/recommendations:
FAO feels that it may be too early to draw conclusive decisions on the CGIAR reform especially on its
governance, since some of the key reform elements are still being put in place. FAO believes that
caution may be appropriate at this stage before embarking on a new, all-encompassing reform.
However, challenges of governance should be addressed based on a careful analysis to increase the
efficiency and functioning of the CGIAR system.


                        The Global Forum on Agricultural Research (GFAR)

Review Process
These comments are framed by the comments of GFAR Steering Committee members provided in an
open dialogue with the CGIAR Consortium Office during the GFAR SC meeting in April 2014. The full
Minutes of this meeting are publicly available at:
http://www.egfar.org/sites/default/files/draft_minutes_29th_gfar_steering_committee_montpellier.
pdf and these form part of the Global Forum’s formal response to the MTR Review report, together
with the notes below.

We are concerned that insufficient time was allowed for real consultation on this document with
GFAR stakeholders and that it was unclear whether this was a public consultation or restricted
circulation. The views of partners who were unable previously to provide direct comments will be
captured in the GFAR Chair’s inputs to the Brussels Fund Council meeting. GFAR is also broadly
aligned with the comments made by FAO in their separate report.

The Panel’s emphasis
While unquestionably eminent, the Panel’s composition was still primarily that of leading scientists
rather than other stakeholders – farmers, women, civil society organizations etc. and did not draw on
many existing stakeholder networks for inputs. The criteria for evaluation discussed still rest heavily
on traditional scientific measures such as peer reviewed publications. There is a clear message in
the review that prime partners are considered by the review to be mainly other research
organizations, including universities and large national agricultural research institutions. The report
therefore places the emphasis more on research than development, with a rather linear perspective
in its approach, which does not serve well the complex realities of development and putting research
into use for development impacts.

The 9 recommendations of the Panel
The recommendations are many but it is not clear how general recommendations focusing on clear
vision, partnerships and innovative financing can alone achieve impact on the ground. These three
axes have long been part of the CGIAR’s approach to research, but have not been well linked to

                                                                                                      77
effective decision making choices toward greater impact. The panel has not reviewed or suggested
measures to develop impact pathways or to measure progress towards impact, which are crucial at
this stage of the CGIAR’s work. The report actually pays little attention to the importance of pathways
to impact, i.e. the key institutional relations that need to take place for outcomes of the CGIAR to
become knowledge that is used and valued in the landscapes which farmers inhabit - and which
becomes taken up into impacts. Stakeholders in the report are mentioned as “a survey of associated
stakeholders (e.g. donors, research partners, industry)” reinforcing that downstream partnerships
are not in the mindset of the panelists. Similarly the report does not describe farmers as key clients
and partners, but views them only as recipients of technologies – something that the GCARD process
actively challenges.

The members of the panel still use the concept of ‘NARS’ (without defining what they refer to by this
acronym, that can itself mean several things), rather than national and local innovation systems,
reinforcing the issue that the focus is research alone and not research for development and impact.

The CGIAR sits in a very complex system where there are many innovators, including farmers who do
not get a mention as such here, and in a world of very diverse agricultural systems where achieving
big-scale wins is dependent as much on improving farmers social circumstances as the value of the
technology. It is surprising that the recommendations refer only to food and nutrition security as
targets. What of development reducing (largely rural) poverty? Poverty and nutrition/food security are
directly linked.

The fundamental divides inherent in the CGIAR come through strongly in the document. Is its
purpose to sustain leading edge research institutions through investments in science and using a
value system of science alone, or to contribute to development impacts by adding value to national
systems? If the latter, then capacity development must be seen as an integral development outcome
and necessary channel to achieve adoption and impact on the ground. The Panel recommendations
seem to take us back to a pre-reform stage where the focus was on research only. The vision put
forward by the Panel of orienting research towards food and nutrition security alone is surpassed in
scope and vision by the current vision of the reformed CGIAR.

Priority setting
Optimizing impact is of course essential, but a note of caution is that this also depends on the
metrics and purpose desired. Productivity measures are relatively easy, but skew the focus of work
compared with other areas. Similarly with the foresight projections cited, no differentiation is made
on the form of food consumed, which is a poor omission when considering the future of food.

The GFAR Steering Committee has made very explicit that GFAR, as the multi-stakeholder global
mechanism, is particularly well placed to advocate and bring these issues to the forefront at global
level. The Forum has the global reach to support processes of prioritization, mobilize support through
international mechanisms such as the G8 and G20, and connect to heads of government and other
decision makers through initiatives such as the African Agricultural Science Agenda and the
European agenda on agriculture. It was noted that these processes reap substantial benefit in public
awareness, resource allocation and establishing policy

The claim that the GCARD process provides weak representation of partners is totally unfounded.
Over 2,000 participants from around the world and from all sectors took part in the regional and
global dialogues of GCARD 1 and the GCARD2 directly engaged over 200 relevant partnership
programmes and held major sessions on foresight – actions through the Global Foresight Hub that
are also supported by the G20 Chief Scientists. This also requires finding ways to reach and engage
the poorest farmers, which is itself challenging. The GCARD2 - foresight exercise gave strong
emphasis on farmer voices and local level actions and this should be built upon through planned

78
grassroots foresight exercises and focus on multi-stakeholder actions, with provisions of funding for
further farmer involvement in such dialogues.

GCARD1 was ground-breaking in taking innovation systems on board, a real shift from the previous
CGIAR AGM, at which there was felt to be little attention paid to partners. GCARD1 empowered
partnerships beyond research, while GCARD2 explored links between the newly established CRPs
and other stakeholder networks and partnerships for action. GCARD3 will explore demands from
focus countries and regions for collective AR4D actions in the next phase of CRPs.

Governance structure
GFAR supports the representation of the global and multilateral ARD system (e.g. The World Bank,
FAO and IFAD) in the Fund Council or whatever new structure could be decided, and expects GFAR
stakeholders to be reflected in any new governance system. It is surprising that the report
recommends a return to a number of flawed structures that gave rise to the reform in the first
instance.

The real problem is how to ensure genuine leadership to the overall system. This point had been
identified during the preparation of the Reform and discussed by the Working Groups on Governance
and Partnerships, which came up with the common sense view that the SRF has to be jointly owned
by the Consortium and the Fund and that the Chair of the Fund Council and the Consortium Chair
should be clearly on the same page when it comes to strategic decisions, representation of the
CGIAR, as well as the Fund Office and Consortium Board in constant interaction and coming to clear
consensus or expressing joint decisions.

The above considerations, the reform principles and the recent GFAR-CGIAR discussions imply that
governance needs to be accountable, transparent and open, yet the measures provide seem to run
counter to these principles and could create what seems to be an exclusive Board, without reference
or accountability to any wider constituencies. Perhaps more than ever, the CGIAR needs the full
participation of Development Agencies and non-funders represented by GFAR into the Fund Council
to link with the Post 2015 Agenda and SDGs, and be responsive to needs of the ultimate
stakeholders of IAR4D – the farmers, who are not mentioned once as partners in the review.

The report makes very little back-reference to the rationale and strong demand for the original
reform. Nowhere is it mentioned that a major driver for the reform was the conflict of interest
perceived by funders in being asked to also directly govern programme implementation. GFAR
agrees with the Price Waterhouse Coopers report that it is not the best moment to engage the CGIAR
into a further new Reform of this magnitude. The recommendation for this major further reform
comes without in-depth analysis of the problems that have to be corrected which are partly of
institutional nature (Operational rules and definition of responsibilities between the Fund and the
Consortium, as decided in the Constitution signed by the Centers and the Consortium with the Fund)
and partly those of behaviour (code of conduct). For example, despite the clear attribution of
responsibility for the Fund Raising strategy to joint initiatives by the Consortium and the Fund
Council, the centers –and also the CRPs continue to pursue funding for individual direct investments
and projects…..However, here the funders themselves are part of the governance issue by not
adopting coordinated positions and providing consolidated funding through Window 1 & 2 to better
align their own individual strategies and investments in a collaborative way. The implication should
have been the eventual phasing out of Window 3, but the opposite has happened in practice. Nor, in
practice, has the transaction cost for individual scientists in making individual grant applications
been reduced.

There are a number of operational difficulties and political consequences that would emerge from
the adoption of the single Board proposal - the CGIAR cannot come back to such a single governance
overnight without considering the legal and political implications of eliminating the Consortium,

                                                                                                   79
which is now a fully-fledged International Institution established by international agreement.
Governance comparators based on other organizations are notably flawed in that they do not reflect
a basis derived from required function of the institution concerned. There is a risk of bringing the
flaws of other bodies into the system unless form follows function.

The suggestion that the TAC should be revived is surprising, given that the Canters clearly did not see
a role for a strengthened expert scientific body at the time of the reform.

Optimizing the strengths of Partners
GFAR does not accept the statement under 5.3 that “Other key stakeholders, such as NARs and
private sector partners, are not adequately represented, except through weak voice in the biennial
GCARD process”. There is no evidence basis offered for this statement. To the contrary, the Global
Forum routinely solicits perspectives from a very wide range of stakeholders on key documents and
programmes and makes these known to the Fund Office and in full public transparency. Whether the
system entities choose to listen and respond to their partners is a different question.

GFAR now directly engages large scale networks across all sectors of the AR4D continuum to impact,
including the private sector as the input sector, SMEs and food industries, advisory services, youth
and the world’s agricultural universities. It is a pity that the Panel did not refer to the Partnerships
Working Group report from the initial reform, the regional priority setting processes of GCARD1, the
Global analysis undertaken by Uma Lele, Eugene Terry, Eduardo Trigo and Jules Pretty, nor the
GCARD Roadmap for change which was accepted in full by all stakeholder networks in GFAR,
including the Consortium Board. Over 80% of stakeholders consulted in an external survey at the
end of 2013 considered that participation in collective actions were enhanced by being involved in
GFAR and 88% considered that the AR4D system needs to be transformed and strengthened.
Through these processes and the discussions between the CO and GFAR Steering Committee this
year, GFAR has been consolidated as a dynamic and permanent forum with direct commitment from
the CGIAR as the main tool to consult and publicly validate strategic processes such as the SRF,
CRPs, etc.

As the review did not include GFAR in its governance comparators, we inform the Panel here that
GFAR’s governance comprises representatives directly identified by the following sectoral networks,
fora and international institutions themselves. GFAR has evolved over recent years to be truly
inclusive, with an innovation systems approach and outcome-based thinking and the Forum’s
governance is to be still further strengthened in the months ahead.

        FAO and IFAD (the facilitating UN organizations for GFAR)
        CGIAR Consortium and AIRCA – all the international agricultural research centers
        International and regional Farmers Organizations: 285 linked, >200 M farmers
        Regional Fora of National agricultural research and extension systems from nearly all
         countries of the world: AARINENA, APAARI, CACAARI, EFARD, FARA, FORAGRO
        Private sector: SAI Platform of 55 international food companies; PanAAC - SME networks in
         35 countries
        CSOs/NGOs: CSO-GARD >200 member institutions
        Advanced research: G20 MACS & BRICS now directly linked: 70% of global ARD investment
        Advisory Services – GFRAS, regional networks of advisory service providers around the world
        Higher Education – GCHERA, >600 agricultural universities, >1 million students p.a.
        Youth - YPARD >8,000 youth members

Financing
The Centers clearly still see the new system as one of a number of avenues they have to meet their
individual goals. There is a governance failure in relation to the reform intention, whereby most of
the center’s budgets are still W3 and bilateral. Resources (management, physical and human) are
still allocated to initiatives that are not strictly related to the new system (CRP embedded or directly
related) and there are no penalties for this behavior. There is a Window 4 (bilateral not entering
through the Fund) that may itself run counter to the reform intention. Funders are by nature of the
issue deeply involved in continuing this divide.

It is noted also that while there has been a very welcome increases in the scale of CGIAR funds and
of the total funding going to partner institutions within this, the intention of the reform in bringing
shared responsibility for outcomes has not been reflected in a greater proportion of these funds
going to partners:


                        Year                 % of CGIAR funds to partners

                        2004                 14

                        2005                 16

                        2006                 14

                        2007                 15

                        2008                 16
                        2011                 16

                        2012                 17

The first CGIAR SRF (based on IFPRI models) considered that a tripling of national investments was
required by 2025 alongside the increased investment in the CGIAR, if development impacts were to
be realized. Donor funding behavior and national commitments to investment in their own
capabilities have so far fallen well short of this need. The EIARD report showed that in Sub-Saharan
Africa, CGIAR funding amounts to 12% of the total ARD public investment, but receives 2/3 of all
donor support to AR4D. Overall funding to partners through the CGIAR has greatly increased due to
the reform and this is to be welcomed. 5-25% of the total CGIAR investment now goes to partners,
yet for the Challenge programs 35% went to partners in 2007 & 2008.

Enabling environment for the reform
Change brings many challenges and it is natural that a few years into such a major change many
questions will be asked as new relationships become apparent. To some extent the system has been
left to find its way through the complexities involved. Irrespective of the future governance
structures, to support the changes underway there would be value in further capacity development
to address the required changes at many levels, inside and outside the system. Individual capacity
development would help enable research and non-research staff to adapt to the systems approach,
innovation platforms, theories of change and impact pathways and approaches entailed.
Organizational and institutional development will better enable CGIAR to successfully manage and
implement the reform and required strategic planning, review of organizational structures, levels of
authorities and work flow, aligning governance arrangements with the goals of the reform,


                                                                                                       81
       developing performance incentives and M & E approaches, use of ICT in documentation and
       communication, establishing partnership and resource mobilization mechanisms, and measuring
       impact on the ground.

       National capacity development is mentioned, but without clear recommendations on the long term
       vision of the CGIAR and its purpose in relation to national systems, nor on the need for the CGIAR to
       clearly add value to national actors. Externally, partners and beneficiaries of CGIAR reform would
       benefit from individual and organizational capacity development to be able to take part in the
       formulation and implementation of reform plans, technology development and adoption, and
       realizing and measuring impact on the ground. CGIAR, Centers and CRPs’ capacity development
       strategies and action plans need to be developed to reflect the above.


                             Independent Science and Partnership Council (ISPC)

The ISPC has reviewed the consultation draft of the final report from the Mid Term review (MTR)
    Panel of the CGIAR reform dated October 8, 2014. In general, the ISPC welcomes the proposals
    for discussion but believes that decision making will have to wait further elaboration of the
    Panel’s thinking and intent in some areas. The ISPC appreciates the early, clear emphasis on
    international/global public goods as fundamental to the C G I A R mission. (Since there is
    confusion about meaning of that/those terms, it would be good if the final report could include a
    definition of what the MTR mean by using the term.)

Subsequent comments follow the headings of the recommendations outlined in the Executive
    Summary of the MTR, followed by more specific consideration on the role and relationships of
    the ISPC, and, finally some clarifications on aspects of the text.

  1.     Vision and mission are appropriate.

  2.     Priorities. The CGIAR has had many attempts at priority setting. ISPC published a White Paper
         reviewing these in 2012. It quoted the Science Council of 2004 as concluding that “setting
         research priorities for as vast and complex an institution as the CGIAR is a daunting task. No
         approach, however complex and multidimensional, can be fully satisfactory.” From discussion
         with Centers, in 2012 the ISPC found that: ‘many saw the lack of high quality data as a
         bottleneck to priority setting in general, and particularly for economic assessments and
         modeling’. The ISPC agrees. It is tempting to think that prioritization is feasible and worthwhile
         but a Task Force would not have time to report before the 2nd call for CRPs will have had to be
         published. Further thinking on processes for prioritisation at different levels within the system
         might, however, be useful. The report acknowledges that the list of research challenges given (p
         27) is not definitive and while accepting that food waste is a priority, the ISPC is not convinced
         that the CGIAR has a research advantage in that area. A focus on Big Data and informatics within
         the CGIAR is, on the other hand important for the CGIAR, but it is a research approach and not an
         outcome. In addition it is not clear whether it is the Panel’s intent to steer the CGIAR away from
         poverty alleviation as a practical target and towards resilience since the rationale for this set
         of priorities is not given. Thus apart from encouraging the CGIAR to make choices and focus
         on the solution of big issues, it is not very clear what the MTR is trying to convey in this section.

  3.     SRF. The ISPC concurs with the Panel that the SRF should be adequately developed to meet
         the needs of the CGIAR and that criteria should be set as to what this entails. The MTR does not
         stress impact, but importantly, the investors in the CGIAR System do want development
         impact, which means that they need to fund both upstream and downstream research and
         funding should be allocated on the basis of the strength of the proposal in terms of both
       82
      science quality and relevance. The SRF therefore needs to give clear guidance on what is
      expected of systems research at one end of the continuum and of, for example, genomics
      research at the other and of the expectations as to how the potential impact from all research
      will be delivered.

4.a. Governance structure. While the consolidation of the CO and FO to a single “CGIAR
     board/administrative unit” has some superficial attraction, the various implications of this are
     only superficially discussed in the report. The System has recently undergone major
     governance reforms (e.g. the creation of the Consortium Office) and the establishment of the
     CRPs has also taken considerable time away from research. Large sums of money have also
     been invested in the research to date, and if investors are to see returns on their money (some
     of the research is still at an early stage), then the CRPs which are judged to be on the road to
     delivery need to be given time and a supportive environment to enable them to deliver.
     Justification for further disruption would, therefore, need to be robust. It is surprising, given the
     attention to “governance ambiguities” starting on p. 20, that the MTR has so little to say (and
     no recommendations) about the number of Centers, the governance of Centers, and the
     relationships between Centers and Center Boards to the CO and FO. Whilst the document
     raises a number of issues concerning governance structure - e.g., “the authority of the
     Consortium CEO vis-a-vis the Center DGs is not clear” - the report is not bold enough to say
     where the Panel thinks authority should reside? Similarly it points to the outcomes of the
     CGIAR governance report in relation to responsibility for CRP direction, but does not discuss this.
     Establishing clarity of this sort might help eliminate the tension and power struggles that
     currently exist.

4.b. Governance composition. The suggestions (paragraph, top p7) regarding composition of the
     proposed “CGIAR board” are (to the ISPC at least) confusing and the remit of the Board is not
     clear. For the ISPC, what is needed is improvement in governance and decision- making.
     But if that is the case, how could representatives of a limited number of CGIAR Centers
     acting as Board members provide disinterested decision-making over programs on which they
     are dependent for funding? Who would decide on future calls for CRP proposals? How do we
     avoid the advocacy of the doers with a mix of decision making? Secondly, who do the ‘Chief
     Scientists’ represent, since the recommendation is that the new CGIAR Board can call on ad-
     hoc scientific advice and a strengthened ISPC? And if “private sector representatives” are
     included (which ISPC would support), then why is civil society (the voices of environmental
     organizations and social justice advocates) not represented? Yet the proposed size of the Board
     is already rather large for effective decision-making. Moreover, in the second single-sentence
     paragraph (p7), what does it mean that the chair of this board would “represent the mission
     of the CGIAR” and not a constituency?

4.c. Governance: proliferation of advisory bodies. The report (third paragraph, p7) makes the
     recommendation that “The CGIAR Centers should establish an advisory committee to advise
     the Board on new advances in research.” Again, this does not seem to be adequately thought
     out as a recommendation in the Executive Summary, nor does the ISPC find arguments
     supporting this idea in the body of the draft report. We would suggest that further explanation
     will be required from the Panel to illustrate and justify the intent.

5 and 6 Partnerships: it is appropriate that the CGIAR and its programs consider the best forms of
    partnership to maximize their global investment programs and to provide influence in agriculture-
    related policy fora. However, the formulation of “guidelines” would seem to be a fairly modest
    response to this requirement. In general the report is almost silent on 'impact'. Delivery of impact
    is very important to the donors and hence is a major issue for the CGIAR and has a strong bearing
    on how partners should be selected.


                                                                                                         83
     Importantly, under 6, why would the CGIAR endorse its own programs and only then seek to form
     mega-consortium partnership for other globally-important aspects to which it might
     contribute? Surely a genuine SRF would advocate for the areas in which the CGIAR could play
     to its comparative advantage amongst global actors and the programs should be designed to help
     formulate solutions to the major challenges, not leaving this as an add-on.

7.   “Scale up financing” The jargon is not evident to all readers – e.g. what do a “capital
     formation investment fund” or “the Green Bond concept” mean in this context? Nor is it clear
     how these ideas would address the fundamental challenge of funding science in the broad
     (global or international) public interest. It is harder to translate these concepts into some
     practical implications for CGIAR research. Who would provide the expertise to explore this
     recommendation and how would it be vetted?

8.   Optimize political support. This recommendation may address some concerns ISPC raised
     with respect to the Extension proposals, recently reviewed, such as CRPs moving too far into
     global “policy space”. But similarly it raises the question of staffing and budgets for some
     central body (CO or CGIAR board) to take this on. Why not see this as part of the CGIAR’s
     collaboration with the multilateral agencies or specialized advocacy organizations and focus
     CGIAR effort (collectively or at the CRP level, as we have suggested) on providing credible, policy-
     relevant research for evidence-based decision making by the global agricultural sector? A
     clear principle for the CGIAR should be to adopt the role of honest broker between science
     and decision-making communities, including the provision of objective scientific evidence.

9.   Optimize knowledge impact. We interpret the Panel’s remarks on the role of the ISPC positively.
     The ISPC also interprets calls for “strategic guidance” and “foresight” as including more “ex ante”
     impact assessment – but it is not yet clear whether that capacity (and those budgets) should
     reside in some executive unit (CO or CGIAR Board/unified administrative unit), within a specific
     Center or program, or within ISPC as an ex ante complement to the suite of ex post activities
     carried out by SPIA (the Standing Panel on Impact Assessment) for the system. Also as the MTR
     report seems to be describing a potentially revised role for ISPC in strategic guidance and
     foresight analysis, at the same time the CGIAR Board is also given a role in the development of
     ad hoc scientific advice. It would be helpful if the Panel’s intent here could be clarified.
     (Additional comments on the ISPC role and relationships are expanded below.)

References to the role and relationships of the ISPC (text section 6.9, p33):

The first sentence of the section says that the ISPC should be enabled “to be proactive in terms of
    providing strategic guidance, foresight analysis, and assessing and reporting on quality of
    research results across the system.” The ISPC already is proactive with respect to the first two
    of these issues, working with components of foresight and not as a commissioned body on
    behalf of the Consortium or the funders. Both the proposed 'Advisory Committee' and the ISPC
    would appear to have foresight roles. The former seems to be internal and the ISPC is
    independent, but what are the delivery points for (potentially differing) advice? Who would the
    ISPC report to? At present the ISPC reports to the FC. Further clarification on the Panel’s vision
    here would be helpful.

The remainder of the sentence talks about assessing and reporting on quality of research results.
    This is an interesting brief. SPIA (Standing Panel on Impact Assessment) covers impact, but
    the ISPC does not evaluate the quality of the science within programs once programs are
    initiated nor does it evaluate the research results. This change could be interpreted to mean that
    the ISPC would be assessing the quality of research well upstream of where SPIA takes up the
    challenge.
   84
The paragraph also talks about the need for “high-quality research review and advice.” The ISPC is at
    present quite distantly removed from the details of the science being done in the CGIAR (design,
    methods and analysis) and operates more at a strategic level, rather than carrying out
    detailed scientific review. A question for the panel is whether the IEA currently evaluates the
    science? If so, then this function might more naturally fall under the IEA.

If the ISPC is meant to provide this kind of scientific review, then it probably does make sense to
     have “independent research panels comprising world-class research leaders,” because the
     ISPC is too small to provide this kind of detailed expertise across the range of CGIAR research
     activities, but who should they report to ensure objectivity?

The ISPC is concerned that scientific quality across the CGIAR is uneven and in need of
   enhancement, but currently these concerns are probably secondary to the challenges of research
   prioritization, direction, and management. Scientific review will not easily address this latter
   category of challenges. And it would seem that the logical place to situate the evaluation of
   science would be in the IEA’s periodic assessments of the CRPs. Whether the IEA should be
   under the aegis of the ISPC is a different question which is not addressed. In sum, the current
   proposals leave the ISPC unclear on how this suggested realignment of the ISPC would really
   improve the overall effectiveness of the system.

Specific comments on the text:

Under 4.2.4 Effective oversight, it is not clear what the panel is referring to in its equivocal
    statement on the oversight of system-wide performance.

4.3.2 Governance ambiguities, the Panel’s report expresses stakeholders views on the effects that
    the reform has had on Centers with rather less information on the effects on the developing CRPs
    other than noting the recent CGIAR governance report. The Panel’s view on programs, program
    ambition and program quality are not clear and the respective role of Centers and CRPs is not
    seriously addressed in the Panel’s report.

Under 5.1, the text (p24) raises a number of questions, such as the CGIAR’s ability to articulate
    a clear value proposition, prioritise the use of limited funds, avoiding Centers self- interest…. but
    the report does not propose how these faults will be improved.

Similarly, the items under 5.3 Systems architecture and governance are descriptors of the current
     situation which are not adequately resolved (at least as described) by the adoption of a single
     Board. The Panel’s report is insufficient on CRP governance to see the way ahead.

Under 5.5 “the Panel considers that the current approach leads to incremental and essentially
    marginal impacts in consideration of the complexity of food security and nutrition challenges” but
    presents no analysis to support this view.

Recommendation 6.4 on Governance structure, (p30): The ISPC concurs with the need for an
    improvement in the setting of strategic direction and decision-making over financial resources to
    back up priorities. However, the draft recommendation for a single Board throws up a
    number of queries: details such as who would appoint the Board Chair? And, if there is a
    donor Council as well as a Board (which seems an amplification of bodies rather than a
    simplification) is there still a 'Funders' Forum'? The only significant change appears to be the
    transfer of decision-making power to a Board with an independent Chair? As noted above, it is
    not clear in the proposed formulation of a new Board how CGIAR Centers will make
    disinterested decisions over programs as part of a multi-constituency board.

                                                                                                         85
The report refers to Chief Scientists from time to time (e.g. p32, a Task Force to be chaired by the Chief
     Scientist) and, in particular, to 'a Chief Scientist' on the Board - what constituency does this post
     refer to?


                         International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)

    22 October 2014

    Dear Ms Kyte,

    On behalf of the President, I would like to thank you for giving the International Fund for Agricultural
    Development (IFAD) the opportunity to comment on the Consultation Draft of the CGIAR Mid-term
    Review, led by Professor John Beddington and a panel of distinguished international experts. We
    appreciate the hard work that has gone into the Review and we are encouraged by the Review's
    willingness to confront many of the difficult issues for the future of the international agricultural
    system. We believe that the Panel's findings can, with suitable modification, be used to strengthen
    the governance and performance of the global system.

    Our initial comments focus on three issues raised in the Review: (a) the recommendation that the
    governance structure of the system be changed, as indicated at the breakfast meeting on Saturday
    11 October 2014, by merging the Fund Council and the Consortium Board and by creating a single
    Administrative Unit in place of the current separate Fund Office and Consortium Office; (b) the
    problem of sustainable financing for the system, especially given the uncertainties about future
    funding from the World Bank; and (c) the Review's treatment of climate finance.

    A.      Governance Structure

    With respect to the recommendation about the governance structure the Review states:

    "The Panel strongly recommends that a single CGIAR Board be established to replace the Fund
    Council and the Consortium Board and be supported by one Administrative Unit, replacing the Fund
    Office and Consortium Office... "

    IFAD supports the recommendation to establish a single CGIAR Board with one Administrative Unit.
    We believe this change will make the system more efficient and will allow greater operational focus
    by the single Administrative Unit. In our comments on the Review (attached as Annex 1) we outline
    an IFAD proposal for a single Board and a single Administrative Unit.

    We fully understand that the submissions of the Center Directors and the Consortium Office differ
    sharply about the Single Board and the single Administrative Unit. We nonetheless agree with the
    Center Directors that the strategic vision of the system will develop best with a Single Board and that
    the development results focus of the system, in its many components, will be sharpened with one
    Administrative Unit. We hope that this important recommendation can be agreed and implemented
    quickly, given its importance to system performance.

    B.      Sustainable financing

    We are delighted that the Review raises a sense of urgency about the future of the CGIAR funding
    because IFAD, as do many respondents to the Panel's TOR questions, does not believe that the
    current model is sustainable or innovative enough to meet the challenges of the near future.

    86
IFAD therefore endorses the Review's plea for a special meeting to be convened by the Fund Council:

"The Fund Council should organize a special session in early 2015 to discuss innovative financing
options, recognizing the difficulty of securing long-term, predictable commitments to fund CGIAR
Research Programs, and the uncertainties around maintaining, let alone significantly increasing,
funding ."

With respect to the interaction between the governance structure of the system and the needed
growth of sustainable financing, we agree with the Panel's view that the current management
structure of the CGIAR does not promote innovative or sustainable financing:

"It is the Panel's view that CGIAR has the potential to play this global leadership role {in finding
innovate mechanisms to double funding for agricultural research}, but not as it is currently
structured and managed."

We agree fully with the Panel's conclusion that "there are opportunities for financial innovation that
could significantly leverage the current grant financing provided to CGIAR."

Therefore, we strongly urge the Fund Council to accept the Panel's recommendation to organize a
special session, as soon as possible in 2015, to discuss new CGIAR financing options. Those options
should be presented in detail by qualified individuals with experience in development financing and
should be reviewed thoroughly by donors and other partners.

On the basis of those reviews, the Fund council should urgently consider how to apply new funding
mechanisms - such as the use of IDA Credits, other concessional loans, venture capital options, and
the issuance of international bonds - in the second half of 2015.

C.      Climate Finance is Development Finance

IFAD appreciates the Panel's deep understanding of climate change, of how it affects agricultural
productivity in the tropics and of the need for the international agricultural research system to
respond to the challenge of climate change in innovative ways. Yet we believe that the Panel's report
misses a vita l issue. This issue is that finance to mitigate or to adapt to climate change is not
distinct from development finance. At IFAD, we believe that climate finance is development finance.
The problems of agricultural development, and more broadly economic growth, in the tropics can
only be resolved by a concentrated development effort, with appropriate scaling, on the core
problems of agricultural productivity, better nutrition, the empowerment of women and marginalized
groups, access to land and productive inputs, and access to markets and other opportunities for
greater welfare of the world's poor rural people. We therefore strongly urge that the Fund Council, in
its organization of a special funding session, directly link the problems of research funding,
development finance and climate finance.

We thank you again for requesting IFAD's comments on the Panel's Report. The Report has made a
good start in defining the next phase of the reform of the CGIAR. It will nonetheless be vita l for the
success of the reform, and for the impact of international agricultural 'research system on the
welfare of poor farmers, for the reform to be more forceful and creative in addressing the issues of
institutional efficiency, sustainable financing and the necessary mainstreaming of climate finance as
development finance.

IFAD, Investing in Rural People: Annex 1

 IFAD Comments on the Consultation Draft of the Mid-Term Review of the CGIAR

 1. IFAD staff and management have reviewed the MTR Report and have the
    following comments.

 General comments

 2.   The Report of the Panel has made a good beginning. The next version should
      be more specific about:
 •    a clearer and factual inventory of the successes and failures of the CGIAR reform;
 •    accountability for successes or failures of the reform;
 •    Specific recommendations and a calendar of implementation about the
      five research areas - nutrition, degraded lands, food waste, resilience, big
      data - advocated in the Report;
 •    the development of innovative funding mechanisms;
 •    the links between climate finance and development finance;
 •    the implications of a single governance structure and administrative
      unit for the system; and
 •    potential sources of financial efficiencies in the system.

Specific comments
Did the MTR meet its objectives?

System structure and governance.

 The Report arrives at a useful recommendation about system structure and
 governance - a single Board and a single Administrative Unit -- though it should
 have been edited more closely to avoid ambiguity in this recommendation.

 3.   The Report successfully highlights the risks to the sustainable financing of the
      CGIAR and stresses the need for innovative thinking about finance. The call for
      a special financing session, to be convened early in 2015 by the FC, is
      particularly welcome

 4.   The Report is very superficial on system priorities, as we discuss below in
      our comments on the Report's individual recommendations.

Recommendation # 1 - Vision

 5.   The CGIAR surely needs a vision but the Panel ought to be more specific
      about what new vision is needed to meet today's challenges.

Recommendation # 2 - Priorities

 6.   The problem with the Panel's broad recommendations is that it implies that
      all - nutrition, degraded lands, food waste, resilience, big data - should be a
      priority in each Centre program. This is neither possible nor desirable. We
      understand that the Report does not quantify its recommendations, or even
      rank them, but it is not enough for a paper of this importance to simply state its
      preferences without explaining the rationale or the implications of its
      recommendations.
88
7.   Nutrition focus is important, of course, but including a nutrition focus in all
     CGIAR research projects will cause higher transactions costs (i.e., repeated
     evaluations of the nutrition content of each proposal). The nutrition focus of _the
     CGIAR program can only be defined as a function of other efforts, mainly those
     in the countries where malnutrition is still acute. The system response to the
     MTR should therefore be to survey the nutrition content of the Center programs
     including the CRPs, and to propose changes in the existing nutrition work, not to
     follow a blanket recommendation.

8.   The utility of the degraded lands recommendation can only be evaluated with
     respect to the opportunity costs of research on other themes. Should Centers
     working on high yielding crops in good areas switch to work on low payoff themes
     in bad areas?

9.   Food waste is not an appropriate CGIAR research theme because it is nothing
     like a global public good. If the international community wants more work on
     food waste, it should invest in FAO and in national extension programs. It is not
     really a CGIAR issue and we would be interested what the Panel proposes that
     the CGIAR could do that is not already done by partner international
     organizations and by the national programs.

10. Resilience is another major topic where the Panel ought to have stated its
    views more specifically on what the Centers could do to improve resiliency that
    they are not already doing. For example, plant improvement programs universally
    seek higher yields and usually seek lower variability - how would a greater
    system focus on resilience change these facts or add to what the Centers are now
    doing?

Recommendation #3 - SRF

11. The MTR correctly concludes that "... the lack of a high-quality Strategy and
     Results Framework (SRF) - focused on outcomes - is a key reason for many of
     the challenges facing the CGIAR partnership." It recommends that the system
     should improve the SRF, but says nothing about how this will be done. It
     further says nothing about the lengthy delays in developing an SRF despite major
     efforts among Center and CO staff to prepare an SRF, and the associated
     quantitative indicators, over the past 5 years.

12. The MTR evidently understands the weakness of the current quality review
     processes but makes no recommendations about them.

Recommendation #4 - Governance structure

13. The MTR correctly notes: "The two-pillar model leads to much duplication,
     inefficiency and unease, between the Consortium Board and Fund Council and
     their respective secretariats (Consortium Office and Fund Office)." It then
     recommends that the creation of a single Board by the merger of the Consortium
     Board and the Fund Council. IFAD strongly supports this recommendation. We
     outline below what a new governance structure would be.

Recommendation #5 - Optimize strengths of partners
Recommendation #6 - Scale up partnerships

14. The Panel makes somewhat vague recommendations about partnerships. It


                                                                                           89
     concludes that, "in addition to the current effort to improve the strategic focus and
     results of the CGIAR system, new partnership models will be required, designed to
     optimize the capabilities and strengths of a broader range of partners."

 15. Most observers understand that new partnership models were necessary long ago,
     but the Panel ought to have surveyed the hundreds of existing partnerships to
     assess their performance and to have made recommendations based on such a
     survey.

 Recommendation #7 - Scale up financing

 16. The Review raises a sense of urgency about the future of the CGIAR funding.
     IFAD, along with many respondents to the Panel's TOR questions, does not believe
     that the current model is sustainable. We therefore endorse the Review's plea for a
     special meeting to be convened by the Fund Council.

 17. A second issue related to this Recommendation is the interaction between the
     governance structure of the system and the needed growth of sustainable financing,
     we agree with the Panel's view that the current management structure of the CGIAR
     does not promote innovative or sustainable financing.

 18. We agree fully with the Panel's conclusion that "there are opportunities for
     financial innovation that could significantly leverage the current grant financing
     provided to CGIAR."

 19. Therefore, we strongly urge the Fund Council to accept the Panel's recommendation
     to organize a special session, as soon as possible in 2015, to discuss new CGIAR
     financing options. Those options should be presented in detail by qualified
     individuals with experience in development financing and should be reviewed
     thoroughly by donors and other partners. On the basis of those reviews, the Fund
     council should urgently consider how to apply new funding mechanisms - such as
     the use of IDA Credits, other concessional loans, venture capital options, and the
     issuance of international bonds - in the second half of 2015.

 Recommendation #8 - Optimize political impact

 20. . We agree that the system could and should have greater political impact. This
     could be achieved by creating a dual structure - one pillar for policy impact and one
     for scientific impact - in the single CO. For example, the CO could appoint a Chief
     Policy Economist, would be charged with synthesizing Centre knowledge on global
     advocacy issues (climate change, food security, nutrition, degraded lands,
     agricultural trade, the use of GMOs). At the same time, the Chief Science Officer
     of the Consortium Office would focus on the quality of science in the Centers, in
     close collaboration with theISPC.

Impact of the reform

Has the reform developed an SRF ?

The MTR concludes that there is no "suitable SRF" (page 47). I t i s impossible to
disagree with this and this must be seen as a major failure of the reform.


90
 Has the reform reduced transactions costs?

 21. Clearly, the reform has not reduced transactions costs. The Panel cites evidence
     showing that transactions costs have actually increased.

 22. With respect to new ways of recuing transactions costs, the CO contends:
     "Jointly, the opportunity for large-scale efficiencies in the system from increased
     collective action, shared country offices and a reduced number of small grants
     has the potential to increase efficiencies and reduce transaction costs very
     significantly more than reducing the number of board members, merging Centers
     or reducing Center overheads would. Realizing this potential will require
     investments first, however." (page 45) The MTR presents no evidence in support of
     these claims from the CO, however.

 23. IFAD suggests that the small grant problem can be solved, partly, by having the
     donors agree not to make grants less than US$0.5 million and by having Centers
     agree not to bid on grants less than US$0.5 million.

 24. IFAD has a query about the One Corporate System (OCS). The co submission
     states that the OCS is working at 9 Centers and in the CO, when it appears
     that the OCS is not yet working in the 10 system entities cited. The next version
     of the Panel's Report might discuss this at greater length.

 Has the reform consolidated sources of funding to the Centers?

 25. It has not. In its submission to the Panel, the Consortium states that:

 "... continued action (as already taken by some Centers) to reduce the very large number
of small grants in the system would reduce transaction costs significantly, and make the
overall portfolio more strategic. This was a key objective of the reform, that is, reducing
the over 3,500 bilateral grants on Center books pre-reform, to a small portfolio of large
coherent programs. While it is recognized that some small grants may well have a strategic
nature, generally speaking, a small number of larger bilateral grants (e.g., reducing the
number to 500 larger bilateral grants, plus some small grants, from over 2,000),
complementing a system of CRPs with a solid share (50-60%) of pooled W1-2 funding and
single reporting was a core idea behind the reform that still has to be fully realized."
(page 45).

 Appropriateness of the CGIAR's goals

 26. The first recommendation, by focussing on some low priorities for international
     research (notably food waste), shows that the MTR might consider strengthening
     its advocacy of the five new goals in light of the comparative advantage of the
     CGIAR.

 CGIAR effectiveness and efficiency

 27. The Panel does not make enough effort to evaluate effectiveness. I t correctly
     says that: "One of the objectives of the reform process was to reduce transaction
     costs and improve effectiveness and efficiency by simplifying the overall
     governance. This has not happened."

 28. . The MTR concludes: "The current system-wide reporting on the results of

                                                                                              91
     CGIAR research - from Centres and from the CRP partnerships - does not
     provide a clear answer as to whether CGIAR is capable of taking such a
     leadership role." The next version of the Report ought to suggest how the CGIAR
     could take this leadership role.

 29. The MTR notes that "Many stakeholders consider that the burden of the
     bureaucracy, efficiency and transactions costs have considerably worsened since the
     reforms." The MTR continues to say "The reforms were expected to improve
     efficiency but by all counts there has been uneven progress on efficiency." It would
     be valuable for the next version of the MTR to cite examples of improvements in
     efficiency to give external stakeholders greater confidence in the reform process.

 Panel findings on accelerating agricultural research

30. This Chapter repeats familiar material and we have no comment.

Panel findings on gender commitments

31. The MTR concludes that: "Discussion with senior HR staff of one Centre revealed data
    that gender balance remains a critical challenge in terms of Centre employment." It is
    true that "gender balance remains a critical challenge" across Centres, but quoting one
    person from one Centre is a small sample and the MTR ought to have made more of
    an effort to substantiate this point. Moreover, the report's focus on gender balance
    among Centre staff is to sharp and ought to have been stronger on gender equality
    and empowerment of rural women with respect of the impact of CGIAR research outputs
    on its users and beneficiaries.

IFAD proposed outline for a revised   governance system for further discussion

32. IFAD supports the Panel's recommendation for a revised governance system and
    structure for the CGIAR. As a basis for discussion, we suggest that the outline of such
    a system might be as follows.

     • A CG Assembly would be the governing body composed of representatives of all
     member countries and institutions.

     • There would be one Board, called the Fund Board (FB). That FB should have 6
     "permanent" members (WB, DFID, and BMGF, for example plus 3 next largest donors)
     each serving 6 years. The 6 permanent members should be reviewed after 6 years
     to verify that they have maintained their shares of system contributions and any not
     having maintained their shares would be relegated to associate status or dropped.
     (Major changes in shares from any permanent member during a six year term
     could lead to a change in their permanent status).

     • There should be 13 "associate" members each serving 3 years; the 13
     associates would be changed after 3 years, so there would be two sets of
     associates for each 6 year term of the permanent members. The 13 associates would
     represent large national programs (Brazil, China, and India); two private sector
     members (one from Part 1and one from Part 2); 2 Center Directors (each to serve
     not more than one 3 year term); 2 Center Board chairs; and 4 significant donors
     beyond the five permanents (each to serve not more than one 3 year term).

     • The Fund Board would have a small Secretariat, whose role would not overlap
92
      with that of the single Administrative unit.

      • FB meetings would be webcast live in the interests of transparency to all members
      of the CG Assembly and other global stakeholders.

      • The FB would appoint the CO to one six-year term, not renewable. The CO
      would report to the Fund Board. The CO would prepare a six year staffing plan
      and the FB would approve the staffing plan, including resources for consultancies
      to be commissioned by the CO as required beyond core staff of the CO.

      • The CB and the FO would disappear.

      • The system entities- the single Board and the single Administrative Unit -- would
      be funded by a 2% levy on W 1 and W2 contributions. A t a real steady state
      budget of US$1 billion, and a target W1/W2 share of 50 percent, the system
      entities would have a budget of US$10 million. This is roughly equivalent to 40 FTE
      staff members.

      • The costs of the participation of FB members would be borne by their
      employers, as would the costs of the CG Assembly. The sources and
      applications of system funds would be published monthly on the SAU and FB
      websites.


                                               Japan

1.   To clarify the role of each governing body is quite important, and the recommendation from the
     Panel to establish a single Board is noted. To establish an effective governance structure, legal
     authority, TOR, member constitution, relation for each organization (structure) etc. should be
     discussed with various stakeholders including Japan.

2.   We think donor constituencies (exemplified as 6 constituencies) should be considered the
     geographic representation and cumulative contribution including that before the CGIAR reform,
     etc. to broaden its global partnership and to provide important leadership, securing the
     coherence and continuity of the activities of the CGIAR.

3.   To maintain ear-marked funding for the CGIAR projects is needed to secure the accountability to
     our contribution to the CGIAR. CRP is one of the most important improvements in the CGIAR to
     avoid research duplication, and each project are evaluated in an equal manner as far as
     possible regardless of the source of funding through the Windows 1, 2, 3 or bilateral.

4.   To promote the collaboration and partnership with related organizations, such as JICA, private
     sector and other development partners. In order to disseminate and scale up the important
     achievement of the CGIAR projects, enhancing the collaboration with other partners, and
     pursuing synergy is indispensable, which would contribute to establishing the food value chain,
     and public private partnership.

5.   The management of genetic resources and gene banks is obviously an important item of the
     MTR. Japan committed to the construction of various gene banks in CGIAR research centers
     before the CGIAR reform process started. In this context, Japan notes that Consortium board
     also thinks that the investments in gene banks is important, as described in appendix 3(pp.46),
     and would like to note the discussion between FC and CB about the new SRF(pp.29) because
     we have a strong stake in the future direction of the management of genetic resources.

                                                                                                   93

Summary Comments:
The Panel has achieved its overall objective of examining the progress of the CGIAR reforms, and the
resulting appropriateness, effectiveness, and efficiency of the overall system. The Consultation Draft
of the Final Report (8 October 2014) is of a high standard. It is clearly written, concise in its
deliberations and with statements and recommendations for course correction and improvements
that are supported by evidence. In spite of the short time frame, and with limited face-to-face
meeting time, the Panel has delivered what it was asked to and should be congratulated on the
quality of the process and report. We (Pacific Donors) are largely comfortable both with the
observations and the recommendations made by the Panel. There were several issues that were well
articulated in the report that did not seem to be addressed (fully) in the recommendations. Existing
recommendations could be expanded to accommodate these issues, which include: ensuring quality
research (expanded role of ISPC in internal research review); mainstreaming gender; and
communicating with one voice.

Comments by Focus Area:
The Panel has addressed well the six Focus Areas of the review. Brief comments on each are
provided below. The comments are initial reactions, not informed by deep reflection. More fully-
developed responses will be presented at FC12.

1. The appropriateness of the current CGIAR’s goals and strategies in supporting the fundamental
   purpose of agricultural research to deliver development solutions needed to create a world free
   of hunger.

     We concur with the Panel’s observations about the deficiencies – including broadness – of the
     CGIAR’s vision, mission and associated strategies and results. The Panel recommends that a
     taskforce be established to propose a CGIAR Vision. Given the stature and diverse but
94
   complementary expertise of the Panel members, it would be particularly instructive for the Panel
   to propose such a vision, as a starting point for the taskforce, if constituted.

   The Panel has identified five ‘big challenges’ for the CGIAR and proposed five major research
   challenges with potential for greatest impact and payback. While these priorities may not be
   definitive, they are helpful for sharpening the focus of the CGIAR system. We support the
   recommendation for a systematic process of prioritisation but observe that what’s easy in theory
   can be devilishly difficult in practice.

   The Panel proposes that development of the new Strategy and Results Framework ‘should take
   as much time as is required to get it right’. This should not be interpreted literally, or in absence
   of consideration of the consequences – the system does not have a particularly good track
   record of delivering in the absence of a deadline.

2. CGIAR’s effectiveness in generating and delivering solutions for reducing rural poverty,
   improving food security and advancing the livelihoods of users of its research.

   The Panel acknowledged the difficulties in finding a common truth among the variety of
   stakeholders interviewed (“where you stand often depends on where you sit”) and have been
   realistic in what they conclude. However, only a fairly ‘light’ treatment was given to the
   assessment of whether the reforms had helped or hindered the generation and delivery of
   solutions.

   The Report usefully distilled the complex range of issues and characteristics surrounding the
   CGIAR system, including the four pre-reform principles (donor sovereignty, independent scientific
   advice, center autonomy and consensus decision-making) that have been retained and the three
   new principles introduced through the reform (separating the funders from the doers,
   harmonisation and managing for results).

3. The efficiency and effectiveness of CGIAR’s architecture/structure, operations, and mechanisms
   for managing and funding research programs and building capacity, including its internal
   systems, risk management, governance and accountability.

   The Panel has made insightful observations about the CGIAR architecture and structure, and
   particularly the associated ambiguities. We welcome the Panel’s bold recommendation in
   relation to a single CGIAR Board. We do harbour some doubts about the ability of the system to
   implement the recommendation, if accepted, ahead of the second CRP round.

   While a single CGIAR Board, if adopted, can be expected to reduce ambiguities between the
   ‘funders’ and the ‘doers’, it is unlikely in and of itself to remove all ambiguities, including those
   between the new Board and the Centre Boards. More critical thinking will be required. In
   addition, CRP leadership and management considerations will need far greater clarity.

   The Report’s consideration of capacity building and risk management are relatively limited and
   could be usefully strengthened.



                                                                                                       95
4. The extent and quality of partnerships within the CGIAR network and with external collaborators
   and stakeholders.

     We support the Panel findings that the increase in collaboration among the Centers (mostly as a
     result of the cross-cutting CRPs) with a sharper focus on delivering development impact, and
     increased donor funding have been among the major successes resulting from the reform. On
     the flip side (and highlighting the complexity of these issues) factors associated with
     collaboration, such as knowledge exchange and greater efficiencies, have not achieved their full
     potential.

     While the Panel made a range of observations about CGIAR partnerships, the Panel’s key (and
     rather underwhelming) recommendation in this respect appears to be to develop guidelines.
     Further elaboration, and more incisive guidance, would be welcomed.

5. The structure of the Fund, the challenges of increasing the proportion of commitments to pooled
   funding (Windows 1 and 2), the prospects for firm multi-year pledges, and the roles of Window 3
   and bilateral funding.

     The review appears to take as a self-evident truth that pooled (Window 1 and 2) funding is the
     ideal, without adequately exploring the pros and cons of Window 3 and bilateral funding.

     FC10 Agenda Item 13 notes that, ‘it was also decided that the review of Window 3 be made part
     of the MTR’. While resource mobilisation was featured in the review findings and
     recommendations, it was a shame that the use, value and future of Window 3/bilateral funding
     wasn’t pursued in greater detail, with perhaps a recommendation provided. We would have liked
     to have seen further emphasis on this aspect to resolve the W3 uncertainty.

6. Measures needed for the CGIAR to continue playing its critical role in global public goods
   research and national capacity building, and maintain its relevance in a rapidly changing global
   environment of ODA, more complex and crowded global research architecture, changing roles of
   public and private research investment, and ever competing demands on donor funding.

     The document sets an ambitious yet optimistic tone in relation to tackling the global mega-
     challenges; with a clear aim to not only make a contribution but to solve the challenges. This
     approach engenders donor confidence, especially when the document calls for rigorous and
     accurate budgets to be developed for delivering the final SRF.

Concluding comments:
In some respects, key determinations (vision, prioritisation, etc.) have been deferred, and referred to
a (proposed) taskforce, while the complexity of the design of the Board is acknowledged, but no path
forward is proposed (notwithstanding the transitional secretariat, which would provide a support
function). These are points amongst several points of vulnerability in the execution of the
recommendations. The system needs to be able to make tough choices and hard decisions; its
record to date in this respect is rather patchy.




96
                                                Russia

Firstly, we’d like to thank the team for the work done. We appreciate the intentions to help the CGIAR
to develop and move forward. In this summary we’d like to share with you our views and thoughts
that we find important and useful for further discussions.

Vision and Mission. We fully support the idea of establishing a focused vision for CGIAR to be
oriented towards agricultural research required to meet immediate and long-term nutrition needs
and achieve equitable food security by 2030. It will also be very useful to advise ongoing work on the
SRF so that it reflects this priority.

Prioritization. The prioritized research areas are critical and we have no objections on the selected
areas at this point. However, particularly concerning Big Data issues, existing experience and efforts
already taken by international organizations, such as FAO and AMIS should also be considered and
not to be duplicated. At the same time we need to ensure systematic process of prioritization should
be streamlined and take into account Post-2015 development agenda.

Strategy and Results Framework. We see it’s important to establish criteria by which it can be
determined whether the SRF meets the needs of the Fund. According to the recommendations the
research targets and indicators in the SRF should guide the individual CRPs. Taking into account that
CRPs are implemented by CGIAR Centers how does the Framework incorporate goals for the
Centers? Also we need to guarantee mechanism for encouraging Centers to follow that Framework.

Governance structure. The transition process and composition of a new board implies significant
changes that will need to be worked out, including terms of operation. We consider proceeding with
the proposed suggestion but at the same time we need to have more clarity on the following issues.
The expected size of the proposed CGIAR Board is 20 individuals including donor representatives,
CGIAR Center representatives, NARs representatives, private sector and country representatives and
a scientist. Thus we’d like to have more clarifications about the voting power. We need to ensure the
decisions will be made by consensus and the donor’s opinion will be considered. Also we believe
there should be a rotation system and an opportunity to act as an observer.

Optimizing the strengths of partners. Panel’s proposal of using existing mechanisms of the
international society is crucial. The proposed recommendation for the Fund Council to seek
assistance of the donors and organizations to assist CGIAR establish guidelines to review potential
partnerships is, in our opinion, very promising and inspiring. Introducing new organizations and
centers in the partnership could provide various benefits, regional and global. It will also be effective
to note various organizations including regional centers, e.g. European Center for Food Security
already cooperating with ICARDA and IFPRI.
Scaling up financing. We believe that approaches to innovative financing should be defined in a
conservative manner basing on existing experience of international institutions and organizations.
Such as:
     sustain financial strength over time by accessing financial resources over and above core
        contributions, without substituting for them
     mobilizing additional resources cost-effectively, and seek compatibility with prevailing and
        planned administrative and financial risk management capabilities.
     need to access predictable levels of funds
     ensure that additional resources are mobilized in a way that contributes to long-term
        financial sustainability, and that associated risks are effectively managed.




                                                                                                      97
        create incentives for engagement with official, public- and private-sector development
         partners and contributors, improve coordination in the delivery of assistance to borrowing
         Member States.
        financial implications for the long-term sustainability must be carefully assessed, as
         assumptions and conditions vary
        take a cautious, gradual approach towards borrowing to ensure that all necessary risk
         management safeguards are in place and to secure a harmonized financial and operational
         approach.

Furthermore, focusing on governmental issues, the study doesn’t appeal to the programmatic ones.
In our opinion, the question of funds allocation between Windows should be presented.

Optimizing political impact. We fully support the recommendation to involve CGIAR in global political
negotiations and actions. Taking part in regional forums and conferences aiming to coordinate
closely in achieving development goals and food security issues will ensure to raise both financing
and science research opportunities and advice. E.g., Russia’s presidency in G20 gave incentive and
basis for expanding themes of the Social Nutrition Knowledge Platform by including nutrition-
sensitive issues in the agenda.

Optimizing knowledge impact. We strongly believe that the establishment of independent research
panels to advise on particular issues should be effective only in case of providing support and
expertise on a constant basis. Also it would be helpful to have a clarified position of the Panel on
future potential role of ISPC.


                                                 Sweden

Swedish (preliminary) comments on the Final Report from the Mid Term Review (MTR) panel of the
CGIAR reform.

Firstly we congratulate the panel on an excellent report and some very sound recommendations
resulting from an analysis of the state of the post-reform CGIAR.

We consider that the recommendation for a single board has merit, although we would have liked a
more in-depth analysis of where exactly the current two board model has failed. We also have some
concerns regarding the suggested composition of the single board. For example, the Panel suggests
at least 4 centre representatives (including at least one DG) on the single board. Whilst we are
sympathetic to the need for greater Centre involvement in governance (ref. the submission to the
Panel by the 15 centres), our concerns are that these representatives would all too often find
themselves in positions of conflict of interest e.g. in matters regarding acceptance of CRP proposals
and/or financing of these, or indeed other centre related questions such as infrastructure
replenishment. The panel suggested a ‘Donor Council’ that feeds into the single Board via (6) donor
representatives which we find quite acceptable. Would not an equivalent ‘Centre Council’ (viz.
‘advisory committee’) feeding to a single DG (?) representative on the new board suffice?

We completely agree with the Panel on the necessity of a ‘well thought-through’ SRF, and that
sufficient time is given in order to achieve this. This is essential in order to prioritise research areas
for the 2Gen CRP’s. However, we would not like to see this process drag on too long and would
expect a complete and robust SRF by, at latest, the first FC of 2015 i.e. c. May 2015.

One of our major concerns is the absence of any comment on the future roll of the World Bank (the
term ‘World Bank’ only appears three times in the main text). The Bank has been the back bone of
the CGIAR for at least the last 20 years, not only in the quantity and quality of its un-restricted core
funding, but also in its role as ‘honest broker’ i.e. Chair of the FC, Trustee of the Fund etc.. Should
this omission in the report be interpreted as the Panel has acquiesced to the Banks’ CGIAR funding
exit strategy? The Banks’ presence and its role in the system gave us the confidence to make a
multi-year commitment to Window 1 of the Fund; this fact should not be underestimated. We
therefore feel that some comment from the Panel in this regard is essential.

The above are just a few preliminary comments to the report. In conclusion, we broadly endorse the
recommendations although we have some serious concerns, particularly about some of those
regarding governance. Given the paucity of time from receipt of the report to the 20th October
deadline we reserve the right to discuss the recommendations further within suitable donor fora (e.g.
EIARD, FF and FC) and return with further comments.

This statement is written in response to the request for comments by the Fund Office earlier this
month. We thank the Panel for its thoughtful contribution and welcome the opportunity to reflect on
the way forward for the CGIAR. We care about international agricultural research and spend 20
percent of our investment budget on projects with the CGIAR. In the interest of readability we shall
keep our comments short, limiting ourselves to just a few points.

Progress on reform

There is evidence of progress in increased collaboration between centers – at a high transaction cost
and potential for ambiguity and duplication between the numerous new management structures. In
the absence of metrics, there are questions as to whether this has led to an enhanced focus on
development impact in a material sense, improved conceptualization of how to approach delivery
and the intermediation of results, and broadened partnerships that would be fundamentally different
from pre-reform days.

The hard issues relating to the role of the CGIAR in a rapidly changing world with increased local
capacity and private sector interest in developing countries, along with the need to prioritize the
tasks, systems and technologies to work on, remain to be tackled. The declared priorities continue to
be general and broad, reflecting unrealistically wide-ranging goals and the pressures to
accommodate the system as it stands. The governance challenges identified by the Panel are part of
this picture and should be addressed.

Looking to the future

We would like to both caution against dragging the CGIAR away from its core competencies and
suggest the need for partnership models that permit wider benefit sharing and access to the in-trust
germplasm held by the centers, consistent with the mission and international obligations of the
CGIAR.

We do not think outsized mission statements, mandate creep (which is still there) and the addition of
new areas of work serve the world’s interest or the CGIAR’s. Challenges such as yield growth fatigue
and climate change call for a focus on core strengths, which in the case of the centers with crop
mandates derive from their gene banks and breeding. There is huge opportunity and scope to
leverage this value proposition with the help of new business models, the right enabling frameworks
and strategic partnerships that we suggest should be charted out and discussed.

                                                                                                       99
On the second point, partnerships are the tool for delivery, and the focus on international public
goods research is incomplete and unable to lead to results on the ground without them. New
partnerships can be envisaged that would involve shared innovation platforms in plant and livestock
breeding with both public and private contributors. Downstream technology dissemination alliances
could involve social enterprises or commercial aggregators who can promote the delivery of CGIAR
technology to farmers by linking it with say access to credit, extension and insurance, as well as off-
take agreements on the output side. The CGIAR’s research agenda would become responsive to real
market and farmer demand in the process, setting the stage for what one is looking for – scalable
impact pathways and widespread adoption.

Perspective

We believe in the continuing need and an important role for the CGIAR going forward. Governed and
managed well, with the right priorities and delivery models grounded in partnership and cooperation,
the system will rise to the challenge of making the contributions only it can make toward a world with
sustainable food security for all.

Over all, it is quite good.

Only two points seem to be very important:
    1. The establishment of the Single Board. I agree with the idea, but the composition of the new
       Board will be very crucial, it should not exclude the functions and roles of the Fund Council.
    2. The ambiguity of the governance. Yes, there are some uncertainities, thus it should be very
       carefully desined.

The panel has done an excellent job in reviewing the performance of the CGIAR. We concur with the
broad direction of the recommendations, the analysis is sound and the conclusions that the MTR
panel have drawn are consistent with this.

Governance: The overall model of governance is not functioning well, this is the inescapable
conclusion of the review and it is consistent with the analysis of the earlier PWC Governance review.
We agree that in order to deliver more effective and efficient use of resources across the system,
governance needs to be reformed to increase accountability, simplify decision-making and reduce
transaction costs. However in considering the current governance weaknesses and what changes
could be made, form should follow function. There are examples of organisations which have a single
Board but which do not operate effectively and do not deliver efficient decision-making or
accountability. Simply restructuring the Consortium and Fund Council structure will not in of itself
deliver improved decision-making.

We agree that current system is inefficient and to some extent this is a feature of the two pillar
structure. However before making recommending wholesale change there is scope for deeper
analysis. We suggest that greater consideration should be given to the functions of a single Board,
how it would make decisions more effectively, who it would be accountable to and how would it be
held to account, and how in particular it would address the weaknesses in the current structure. The

100
risk is that we restructure only to find we are facing the same problems. Recommending, as the
report does, a Board made up of representatives of broader groups of stakeholders, each of whom is
primarily accountable back to that group, is a model which does not always guarantee effective
decision making.

The report recommends that the restructuring takes place over the next few months. We can see the
appeal of pushing ahead with change and of ensuring ownership of the SRF and CRPs by the new
Board – if that is what is decided. However it’s worth reflecting that the previous round of reform
took several years to complete and tied up considerable resources. There are a large number of
changes underway – the development of the SRF, the next round of CRPs commissioning, the
development of the resource mobilisation strategy, which are stretching the capacity of the system to
the limit. Rapid governance change risks overwhelming the system and delivering further only
partially successful restructuring. In proposing these changes, careful consideration to the timing
and the sequencing of this and other changes underway. Pace is good, but not at the expense of the
quality of the outcome.

Science Oversight: We concur that overall science oversight should be strengthened across the
system. Only by identifying and commissioning the best research can the CGIAR deliver on its
mandate, and this requires the best scientific expertise. However the recommendations in the
report, which would set up an new CGIAR Board advisory committee, restructure or replace the ISPC
and set up independent research panels to advise on specific issues, seems complex and confusing.
Different bodies would be advising on different issues at differing times. We were not entirely clear
what “empowering” the ISPC means in this context, since it already able to operate independently.

Prioritisation: The SRF is the basis for the prioritisation of research and we agree with the emphasis
placed in the report on getting the priorities right. Enough time should be made available to ensure
that a high quality results framework is in place to guide the prioritisation of research. Aligning the
delivery of CGIAR with a set of global priorities identified by a task force has some merit, but how
does this fit with the work currently underway to complete the results framework? The report
mentions “sharpened focus and impact”, but it was not clear how the high level priorities established
by the task force and the on-going donor led development of the results framework are linked. How
do these priorities relate to the “mega-challenges”?

Competition is, in our view, the best way to drive up research standards. The report addresses what
the priorities are, but is more or less silent on the process by which research will be commissioned,
with high quality research being supported and less high quality research not being funded. We think
this is a significant gap in the report. It’s unrealistic to assume that all the research undertaken
across the CGIAR will be of the same excellent quality.

Niche and Partnerships: We agree with the elements of the report which stress the importance of
global partnerships, defining the niche of the CGIAR in terms of global research capability in the
public and private sector. As part of this we welcome the proposals to establish guidelines for
working more closely with the private sector.

Innovative Finance: We fully support the recommendation to develop a new approach to finance
which looks at a range of innovate approaches. Grant financing will continue to be important to the
CGIAR, but these new approaches have the potential to deliver greater results by linking finance to
outcomes or impact. As such we agree that they have the potential to tap into new sources of
financing.

We greatly appreciate the work of the Mid-Term Review panel and welcome their insights intended to
help the CGIAR move forward. As we consider the recommendations and our eventual pathway
ahead, we would like to start with a few considerations that are important to the effective functioning
of the system’s researchers and the constituent centers.

Time-limited: The last reform process was arduous and absorbed enormous amounts of time and
caused substantial disruption to the work of research leaders and researchers across the system;
any changes we make must be done within a limited time frame (we would suggest no more than
one year). USAID legal counsel notes, however, that based on recent experience with similar
changes for global organizations in Annex 5, the proposed governance modifications could
reasonably take two to three years to complete from the date of a decision to proceed, and changes
from the only recently settled reform structures could be difficult. We are concerned that the review
may have underestimated the policy, management and legal work involved in restructuring the
reforms. Thus we believe that we should explore efficiency through management changes that more
directly and quickly achieve the desired outcome of the reforms before the next set of CRPs are in
place.

Decision-making: It is not clear that a single, constituency-based board would result in enhanced
ability to make difficult decisions. One of the rationales for the reform was that ExCo (stakeholder-
based) was not able to make difficult decisions. The key in our view rests in the recommendation of
the MTR that the Science Council be greatly strengthened. Independent science advice, not linked
to either program implementation or program funding remains a critical need for the CGIAR. Going
forward, the Science Council needs to be empowered to make recommendations around priorities
and strategies for CGIAR programs. Independent science advice and analysis, set out in a clear and
executable strategy, should underpin the relationship between the “funders and the doers.”

Modify: Recognizing that there may be no perfect structure, but that substantial negotiation was
required to come to the current structure, we encourage the Panel to consider how to shape the
current system to achieve the goals of the Reform without a shift back to pre-reform structures that
were also imperfect. The current FC has functioned well (e.g., open, frank exchanges, effective
chairing) and contains key elements of the proposed governance structure, especially if the SRF/CRP
structure were to be carried forward more effectively.

Furthermore, the creation of the Consortium and Consortium Office provides a structure for
attributing standardized accountability for execution of the CRPs, and core management, fiduciary
and other requirements for the Centers. If a decision is made to move towards a single board, it
should build on this solid base. In addition, the current Fund Council composition allows for every
fund donor to either have a seat or be represented by another donor and thus addresses the issue of
donor sovereignty. Further, for some donors, the current structure governing the CGIAR Fund (the
Fund Council) may be a legal or policy requirement for contribution.

World Bank role: The recommendations in the document leave many questions about the future role
of the World Bank in the CGIAR if they are implemented. We strongly believe that the World Bank is
uniquely positioned to continue as chair of the CGIAR. No other relevant organization has the
convening power of the World Bank, in which most of the major funders are shareholders. Moreover,
the Bank has provided exemplary, dispassionate chairing in ways that strongly connect the CGIAR to
the larger international development agenda. Any diminution of the World Bank’s role would send a
strong negative signal across the development community. Further, the Bank’s continued funding of
the system is an important signal as well. We agree with the report that new innovative sources of
funding should be pursued, but not as a substitute for traditional grant funding, and not before these

102
ideas have been developed beyond mere ideas. Traditional funding has provided the flexibility in
the system to pursue long-term objectives that could not have otherwise been achieved.

Programmatic vs Governance Emphasis: While the MTR seems to have focused on governance
solutions, we feel the review offered little on programmatic reforms – specifically in response to the
questions in the terms of reference related to CGIAR effectiveness and efficiency. For example, the
relationship between Windows 1/2 and Window 3/Bilateral is a critical and fundamental
programmatic tension that requires attention. As we looked to the Reform to more effectively and
efficiently deliver programmatic outputs from the System, greater attention to these programmatic
questions is critical in the lead-up to commissioning the 2nd call for proposals.

Clarified roles for Consortium, Centers and CRPs: Our sense is that the MTR judges that some of the
challenges facing the reform will be addressed by a new, single board. However, it is clear that there
are major tensions between the Consortium and the centers. If the Fund Council were to form the
foundation of a single board, could centers similarly develop closer ties to and greater ownership of
the Consortium Office? Or would these tensions then simply move into a unitary Board?

Research Priorities: We agree with the Panel’s attention to prioritization as a critical step in ensuring
the CG strategically contributes to research needed to achieve global food security. However, using a
lens of maximum impact for least cost doesn’t seem appropriate for a research portfolio where the
scale of eventual impact is more compelling (while we realize for our development interventions, it is
a common and useful approach). We are concerned that it could lead to a focus on “low hanging
fruit,” and not more transformational objectives.

In addition, there seems to be a gap between these recommendations and the factors noted in the
body of the document as drivers of food insecurity (issues around productivity, water, climate
change, for example). We hope that the executive summary can be revised to include these
compelling issues as major factors supporting investment in CGIAR research.

We agree that the SRF should be agreed upon before the 2nd call for CRPs is released. However,
given the reality of the timing for each step in this process, we feel strongly that the current RF
(Results Framework) development process should be supported and accelerated to ensure that the
2nd Call will be timely and respond to the RF.

CGIAR as Research Organization: We feel that the comparative advantage of the CGIAR is the
scientific knowledge it generates. Maintaining this level of excellence – while shaping the research
agenda more effectively, taking into account the diverse funders’ and Centers’ objectives -- will give
the CGIAR a respected role in shaping world opinion on issues of food security, nutrition and
environment. It is important that the system maintains that as a base of its legitimacy in order to
convene decision makers around complex topics.
