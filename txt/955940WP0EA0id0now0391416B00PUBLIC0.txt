                          Vice President, East Asia and Pacific Region
                          The World Bank

Just as a picture is worth a thousand words, a “voice” can be worth a hundred statistics. In the
pages that follow you will see the pictures and hear the voices of our partners in development:
a mother cradling her little boy who is alive because of a new health facility in Cambodia; a
school principal in Beijing who talks with passion about how her school is part of the solar
energy wave; a cocoa farmer in Papua New Guinea who happily works with youth to help them
build a sustainable crop and a sustainable future; a village chief in Lao PDR who lovingly holds
his grandson and talks about the better life he now knows the boy can have; and a student in
Vietnam whose life changed when she received a scholarship.

Together they present powerful stories of how projects can affect and transform lives, and offer
us a memorable glimpse behind the numbers. Stories like these motivate me both personally
and professionally. At the end of the day the work we do in development is not about numbers;
it’s about supporting people to change their own lives for the better, to build a future for their
children and, with a little help, to pull themselves out of poverty.

Of course, numbers and statistics are important. They help us understand the bigger picture—
the pivotal role governments play in ensuring economic growth and a livable future for their
people, and the catalytic role the private sector and development institutions like the World
Bank Group can play in helping to achieve the results we see. As a global growth driver, the
East Asia and Pacific region accounts for over 25 percent of world gross domestic product.
Extreme poverty has fallen faster than in any other region. Over the last 10 years more than
400 million people were lifted out of poverty—people that were living on less than $2 a day.
This is good progress, but much work remains: 142 million people do not have access to power
and 600 million people lack access to adequate sanitation.

You may not remember the numbers, but I hope you remember the people you will meet in
the pages of this book. They put a human face on development statistics. They are testimony
to the power of seemingly small things that gave them an opportunity to build a better life for
themselves, their families, their communities. As Glenda, Siv Mao and others tell their stories,
they give us a sense of how they are succeeding, with courage and determination, to change
their own lives and the world around them. They represent millions of other men and women
who are transforming their communities and countries into more prosperous societies. We are
privileged to support their efforts in creating a better world for themselves and their children.

Introduction
In Indonesia it was $50, in Vanuatu a cell phone, in Cambodia a
night in the hospital, in Vietnam just $90—small by any measure
but immeasurable in the outcome—that saved a life, created a
future, allowed people to dream and empowered women.



Meet Siti Robe’ah in Indonesia who has built her snack food business with a $50 grant; Kelson in
Vanuatu who can grow a tourism business because he now has a cell phone; Siv Mao in Cambodia
who can hug her baby because a new provincial hospital saved his life; Pham Quoc Bao in Vietnam
who has turned his idea to build a rice paper factory into a thriving business because he was able to
purchase land quickly.

They are some of the faces of development in the East Asia and Pacific region, which is home to
more than two billion people. They live in more than 20 different countries; they speak more than
3,000 languages; they are farmers and fishermen, business men and women, students, workers,
nomadic herders—all showing that a little can go a long way.

      They are improving their own lives with a little help from the World Bank Group, their own country and
      other development partners in the form of investments in the basics of daily life like water, electricity
      and health care; a small grant, a community-driven development program; business initiatives that cut
      bureaucratic red tape; scholarships that enable disadvantaged students to skill up for the future; and
      initiatives to protect the environment and tackle climate change.

      This dynamic region has experienced remarkable growth and prosperity, with extreme poverty falling
      faster than in any other region. The rate of extreme poverty—people living on $1.25 a day—fell from
      26.5 percent in 2002 to about 5.1 percent in 2014. As encouraging as that is, much more remains to
      be done to end extreme poverty and build shared prosperity. And this has to happen as the world
      is confronting the very real threat that a changing climate could unravel decades of development
      progress.

      Today, there are still more than 340 million people across the region living on just $2 a day. Siti,
      Kelson, Siv Mao, Pham Quoc Bao and the others you will get to know in the pages of this book
      are helping to change that statistic. They are the real partners of the World Bank Group. They are
      persevering, making a better life for themselves, their families and their communities. They will tell
      you, in their own words, about their failures and successes, what changed their lives, how they are
      overcoming challenges, their hopes for the future, and what they dream for their children.

It’s something most of us take for granted—with the flick of

he Story of Hard Yeun Village
T
Like many of the villages of Lao PDR, most of the residents of Hard Yeun are engaged in slash-and-
burn cultivation, growing vegetables and rice.

Their houses are simple straw and wood, built on stilts, like any other Lao village, except for the
power lines running from house to house—and that has made all the difference.




um Kedleusy

A weaving machine sat unused in 27-year-old Tum Kedleusy’s house until the village got electricity.
Married with a two and a half year old son, Tum now earns money selling her weaving in the capital,
Vientiane.


“With the arrival of electricity we now have the         “I am weaving tinh sinh (the bottom of the Lao skirt). I

Other women in the village are also seeing the improvements that electricity can bring to their
businesses. Phim Siphavong, 49, lives with her husband and two children in Hard Yeun village.
For the last 20 years she has sold snacks and daily-use items from her house. But now there is a
difference.

Hard Yeun. It has helped them imagine a different kind of future for their children and grandchildren.

Water, water everywhere

Almost 85 percent of Solomon Islanders live in rural areas cut off from basic services
like health and schools. The huge distances make service delivery very costly for the
government. The Solomon Islands Rural Development Program (RDP) funded by the
World Bank, Australia, the European Union (EU) and the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD), is helping to address service delivery gaps in rural areas. RDP has
helped transform the lives of people in rural areas with water supply systems, health clinics,
classrooms and other essentials. In 2012, Glenda Vaha’s life was changed when 25 water
pipes were installed in her village of Nagholau.

Sarangerel, 38, and her husband Batzaya, 40, are herders from Lun Soum, Tuv Aimag in Mongolia.
Together with their three children, they live a nomadic life on the Mongolian steppes in a ger (a
portable dwelling). During the transition from a centralized economy to an open market society,
many of their friends and neighbors moved to cities because they no longer wanted to herd cattle.
But Batzaya and Sarangerel stayed. Batzaya says it was a good decision. They have a comfortable life
with about 2,000 head of livestock. Their children study in the city.

                                              system was destroyed—hospital buildings,

                                              the medical system in tatters, many people,
                                              especially in remote areas, turned to traditional
                                              healers that were all they knew.

In the 1980s, Vietnamese soldiers in Cambodia built a makeshift hospital (see above) in the
province of Preah Vihear. Even though the roof leaked and the earthen floors became mud
when it rained, people still flocked to the old wooden building for medical treatment until it
closed in 2007.

A new hospital facility in Preah Vihear is a symbol of the incredible change over the
last 20 years in Cambodia’s health care system. The once ill-equipped hospital had
a major upgrade and officially opened in 2013. Patients living in rural areas can now
get the modern medicine they need without traveling far or trying to come up with
money they don’t have.

Today, 16 Makara is the largest hospital in Preah Vihear. It has modern equipment
and is staffed with doctors and medical specialists including hospital director Dr.
Koung Lo. Two of the patients were Chet Doc and Siv Mao.

Siv Mao ’s Story
In a tiny village in northern Cambodia, a young woman can thank her quick-thinking mother-in-law
and the new provincial hospital for her and her baby’s survival. Thanks to improvements in health
care, maternal mortality in Cambodia has fallen approximately two-thirds since 1990. Siv Mao puts a
human face on that statistic.

A year ago, 26-year-old Siv Mao had a cesarean section at 16 Makara Hospital after a traditional
midwife could not help deliver her baby at home. Mao and her husband Ra Reth, 27, and their son
live with her mother-in-law in Char Village, Preah Vihear province, about 400 kilometers from Phnom
Penh.

the end of my pregnancy I saw that I was
bleeding. I was very afraid. I worried about my
life and my baby. I was at home alone—my
mom and my husband had gone to farm. Then
I called them to come back.

“Some patients use Khmer traditional healers,
but some go to a health center. If we don’t have
money, we borrow from relatives. I was sent
to the health center. When we arrived at the
health center, they started an intravenous drip,
but the bleeding didn’t stop. They told me they
could not treat me and sent me to the provincial
hospital. It was there that the doctors operated
on me to deliver my son. He is now one year
old. His name is Rith Samnang ‘Lucky’. We are
all very lucky. He is in good health.”

to save her—even if I had to sell my house or my land—because I

Chet Doc ’s Story
The Health Equity Fund was introduced at 16 Makara Hospital to subsidize treatment costs, food for
the patients and their care givers, and transportation for the impoverished. This encourages the poor
in remote areas to seek professional health services. In 2014, 1.5 million treatment services were
provided free for people in Cambodia through the Health Equity Fund—supported by the World
Bank and other donors—covering 78 percent of the nation’s poor. Chet Doc’s treatment was one of
those 1.5 million cases.

Chet Doc, 66, who lives in North Kulen Village, Preah Vihear, was treated at the hospital. Doc‘s
husband, 65-year-old En Tel, was blinded in a land mine explosion during the civil war in 1989.

What does $90 buy?



                                133,000
THEN: In 1987, there
were just 133,000
students in higher
education in Vietnam.




Education has played an important role in making Vietnam a development
success story over the last 20 years. Vietnam’s rapid economic growth in
the 1990s was driven by increases in productivity that came in the wake of
a rapid shift of employment out of low-productivity agriculture into higher-
productivity non-farm jobs.

As Vietnam’s economy began to industrialize and modernize, poverty fell
dramatically. Advancements in education followed. Between 1999 and 2013,
the total number of higher education enrollments increased by 143 percent
(from 893,000 to almost 2.2 million).


38   I’D LIKE YOU TO KNOW
                               2.2 million
NOW: By 2013, almost
2.2 million students
were enrolled in higher
education facilities in
Vietnam.




Not all students can be accommodated in public high schools in
Vietnam. Some are able to turn to private schools, but because of high
tuition fees, that’s not an option for the poor. A World Bank-supported
project is providing grants to students in 12 of the poorest provinces of
Vietnam so they can continue their studies at private high schools and
vocational schools.

From 2010 to 2013, with a total budget of $3 million, the project has
enabled 8,000 students to change the course of their lives. Cao Thi
Phuong Huyen—Huyen to her friends—is one of those students. Like the
others, $90 a year is buying her a better future.

After finishing secondary school, I didn’t pass the exam to enter
public high school. I thought about getting a job, because I thought I
couldn’t go to private school. It was partly because I felt discouraged,

For Huyen, getting accepted to college has taken her one step closer to her dream of becoming
a teacher. Now in her freshman year at Hung Vuong University in Phu Tho Province (about 80
kilometers from Hanoi), Huyen is majoring in teaching English as a second language. But her dream
would not have come true if she had dropped out of school three years earlier, when school became
unaffordable for her and her family. Her parents divorced when she was six and she has lived with her
mother since. Her mother, Nguyen Thi Trang, 52, is a worker in the Thuy Van Industrial Zone located
seven kilometers away from their house. She earns VND 2 million ($100) per month. For Huyen, the
grant of $90 dollars a year was more than just a much-needed financial lifeline.

From memorizers to problem-solvers

Giving students access to a good education is just one step in the skilling-up process that Vietnam
is taking to keep its workforce competitive in the global arena. It’s not just what you learn, but how
you learn that’s important. As part of Vietnam’s efforts to strengthen education, the government is
promoting a different approach to learning instead of the traditional approaches that lean heavily on
memorization and copying.

Building a skilled workforce entails revising school curriculum and teaching Vietnamese students to
become more effective problem-solvers, critical thinkers, better communicators and team players.
Work on a new curriculum is already underway, and Vietnam has adapted a promising model from
Colombia called Escuela Nueva. This approach features more group-learning and problem-solving
than the memorization and copying often seen in Vietnamese school classrooms today. A pilot
underway in 1,500 primary schools across Vietnam is already showing success and holds lessons for
broader reforms.

economy stagnated. People faced severe shortages of food and goods, soaring inflation and
deteriorating living standards.

Vietnam in those years was an agricultural society—80 percent of the population and 70
percent of the labor force were dependent on agriculture or related sectors. However,
annual agricultural production was not enough to feed the people. The country suffered
from constant famine and the government was forced to import thousands of tons of food
annually. By the early 1980s, Vietnam’s debt equaled its annual national income.

                           in Vietnam.


In 1986, Vietnam began its gradual transition from a command to a market economy.

In the 1990s, the economy began to bustle with small entrepreneurs, creating an important
foundation of capital and skills.

Since 2006, the IFC has been supporting the government of Vietnam in its efforts to reform
key business licensing procedures. Simplifications have been made in business registration
in transportation, mining, banking, customs and advertising.

Entrepreneurs like Pham Quoc Bao have felt the difference. Thanks to streamlined
administrative procedures, Bao was able to start building his rice paper3 factory much earlier
than anticipated. And thanks to the opening of the rice paper factory, Nguyen Thi Dieu has
been able to find a good job close to home.

To ensure that increased revenues benefit all Papua New Guineans equitably, the
government of PNG has taken on much-needed public sector reforms and capacity building
of the civil service through a national education plan to introduce free primary education, as
well as a health plan aimed at tackling the country’s high infant and maternal mortality rates.

Despite the glowing economic report, PNG is facing some difficult social challenges.
Poverty and social inequality are persistent, the rates of malnutrition and sexually
transmitted infections are high, gender equality is low, and most shocking, gender-based
violence afflicts about two-thirds of women—twice the worldwide percentage cited in a
recent UN study.

Lady Winifred Kamit ’s Story
Violence against women and its impacts are stalling women’s progress on the business and
economic front in PNG, and are a barrier to integrating and promoting women in the workplace.
According to statistics from the PNG National Department of Health, almost 70 percent of women in
the country have been victims of physical or sexual violence.

Sixty companies, through the Business Coalition for Women, are working to change that paradigm
for PNG women. The Coalition, supported by the Australian government and the World Bank
Group’s IFC, is focusing on four key areas: addressing violence against women; promoting
women into leadership roles; developing gender-smart workplace policies and best practices; and
expanding opportunities in the supply chain for women-owned businesses. One powerful voice for
the Coalition is its patron, Lady Winifred Kamit.




You can’t sit there and tolerate one person subjecting another one to the awful
physical and mental torture that women in Papua New Guinea experience. For
us to even start talking about development and start talking about women’s issues,
this particular issue has got to be dealt with.

could produce only two kilograms per day, or 50 packs. We sold the packs to
small shops for Rp 500 (5 cents) each. We had to wait until our snacks sold
before we could buy food for the family. Sometimes, our products didn’t sell.
But I never gave up. I never stopped trying until I could make better snacks.

Myanmar:
New beginnings
Myanmar is currently in a triple transition—from an authoritarian military system to democratic
governance, from a centrally directed economy to a market-oriented one, and from 60 years of
conflict to peace in its border areas.

Since 2011, the government has embarked on an ambitious agenda of reforms to promote economic
development, reduce poverty and improve the lives of its people. It is also seeing the initial results
of the community-driven development project, the first World Bank-supported project in Myanmar in
25 years.

The CDD project takes a people-centered approach and enables poor rural communities to benefit
from improved access to basic infrastructure and services. Almost 200 rural communities in 15
townships are identifying and implementing the investments they need most—from roads and bridges
to irrigations systems, schools, health clinics and rural markets. The project encourages participation of
women, vulnerable groups and ethnic minorities.

Over the next few years the project will address community needs and reduce poverty in more than
3,000 villages, home to more than two million people. One of those villages is Pan Zin Village.

The Philippines:
Rising from the ruins of Yolanda

The Philippines is among the most vulnerable countries in the world to weather-related extreme
events, earthquakes and sea-level rise, and is already feeling the consequences of climate change.
On November 8, 2013, one of the most intense storms in recorded history made landfall in the
country. Packing winds of up to 312 kilometers per hour and storm surges as high as seven meters
(21 feet), Typhoon Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Yolanda, was the deadliest Philippine
typhoon on record, killing at least 6,300 people. Economic losses reached $12.9 billion.

No one knows that better than the 13,000 residents of the coastal town of Balangiga, one of the
poorest of Eastern Samar located in central Philippines. For decades, life in the municipality came to
a standstill when vicious storms and monsoon rains brought floods and sickness.




80   I’D LIKE YOU TO KNOW
But in the early 2000s, residents made floodwater control and the construction of a seawall a
priority through a CDD program called KALAHI-CIDSS, which in English means ‘linking arms against
poverty.’ With support from the World Bank, KALAHI-CIDSS has financed 6,000 projects worth $265
million, benefiting over 1.6 million families in the poorest areas of the Philippines.

In Balangiga, KALAHI-CIDSS trained residents in project planning, technical design, financial
management and procurement. It also provided townspeople with opportunities to access
information, express their opinion and influence local governance. It set up a community
organization with volunteers operating at every level.

For almost a decade the town withstood the impact of the most intense typhoons—until Yolanda.
But on the heels of Yolanda, the spirit of the CDD program came to the rescue. The mayor of
Balangiga, Viscuso de Lira, describes what happened and James Padil, a fisherman, also talks about
the aftermath of Yolanda.

Back in the 1980s, Vanuatu was an island nation as unconnected as you can get. By 1994,
only four percent of Vanuatu’s population used a mobile phone. Most people in those years
made a living from coconuts or subsistence farming. But in the mid-1980s Kelson Hosea and
his father had another idea. They wanted to invite the world to their island home. They were
pioneers of eco-tourism on the remote volcanic island of Tanna, Vanuatu. In those early days
the lack of communications was a tremendous challenge for these new entrepreneurs.

Kelson ’s Story
More than 30 years ago, in a country that only knew coconuts and copra (the dried meat of
coconuts), a young man dreamed of bringing tourists to his island home. It seemed like a far-fetched
idea. How would he get the word out to the world that he was open for business? Even if you
wanted to get news to someone on another island, you had to jump in a boat and travel there. If
you wanted to make a phone call, you had to walk kilometers to the nearest town to one of the few
public phones at the time. But even that didn’t deter Kelson Hosea.




In the beginning, I faced a lot of difficulties with my tourism
business. I used to walk four kilometers to town and back in order to
make phone calls for bookings. With no phones I faced hard times in
my business.
“My name is Kelson and I was born on Tanna. I am              “Now, we just stay in our rooms, or outside, or even in

Once we had this technology, I felt like I had a new baby, born to
my family. I was happy. T     he phone is like my friend. It changes a
lot. I can take bookings right from my phone—from Germany, from
France, from Australia.

better life. Even with the phones we now have an easier life. Now
everyone here, people who haven’t got a job, someone who is a
gardener in the bush, everyone has phones!

Descendants of Earth’s
earliest farmers count
on cocoa


                                            22,000
THEN: Cocoa production in
Bougainville totaled 22,000 tons in
2008. This declined sharply after
the pest cocoa pod borer (CPB)
caused farmers in the province to
lose up to 90% of their crops.


In the rich soil of the island nation of Papua New Guinea (PNG) lies evidence of the earliest
agriculture on the planet—dating back almost 10,000 years—some 3,000 years earlier than
anywhere else. At Kuk Swamp in PNG’s Wahgi Valley, scientists have discovered ancient
irrigation systems and evidence of cultivation of taro (a root vegetable), finding plant residues
in the soil and on ancient stone tools.

Fast forward some 10,000 years and you find the same rich agricultural traditions supporting
rural livelihoods and providing a big chunk of PNG’s export market.

Over 85 percent of PNG’s 7.3 million people live in rural areas and most depend on small-
scale agriculture for their food and livelihoods. After coffee, cocoa is PNG’s second most
important agricultural export crop. Together the two crops provide critical income for more
than half a million households.

               NOW: The government of Papua
               New Guinea has set an ambitious annual
               cocoa production target of 310,000
               tons to be reached by 2030. As of May
               2014, nearly a million cocoa trees have
               been rehabilitated or planted.




The decimation of the cocoa crop in the late 2000s by the cocoa borer disease left many
farmers without income.

Since 2011, the Productive Partnerships in Agriculture Project (PPAP) has been financing
community-led projects in East New Britain and Bougainville to help thousands of small
farmers control the outbreak and restore their livelihoods. The $51 million project is
supported by the government of Papua New Guinea, with help from multiple donors
including the World Bank, the European Union, the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD) and the private sector.

The aim of PPAP is to double coffee and cocoa yields and increase farmers’ incomes by 50
percent. Five cocoa partnerships have been established under the first round of the project,
helping to provide seedlings of more CPB-tolerant cocoa varieties and insect-resistant clones.

One area of focus is the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, which became part of
independent PNG in 1975. Over the next five years, the project will help 60,000 coffee and
cocoa farmers, 40 percent of them women, regain their livelihoods.

A ton of potential in

GDP in 2007.




The Pacific fisheries have been feeding the world’s tuna appetite for decades. This includes
one of the planet’s last healthy tuna stocks—supplying over a third of the world’s tuna,
worth over $4 billion per year at first sale, with prices steadily rising. If managed well, the
tuna could be a natural living resource that just keeps on giving. To mix a metaphor, the
tuna is the goose that is laying the golden egg. But that golden egg is threatened. Many of
these stocks have reached their limits as catch volumes have steadily climbed over the past
decades. Future returns will have to come by earning more on a fixed volume of fish, rather
than increasing it.

For example, the skipjack tuna is a migratory species that swims through the waters of a
number of Pacific countries, each one taking a piece of the fishery action. It is a classic
example of the ‘tragedy of the commons’—everyone exploiting the bounty, but few wanting
to protect the resource or make it sustainable.

                                    $180 million.




Out of necessity and with a lot of forward thinking, the story is changing. Nowhere is that
more evident than in Solomon Islands.

Solomon Islands tuna accounts for around seven percent of the total Western and Central
Pacific Ocean catch—more than 150,000 tons—with an estimated value of $180 million.
However, the bulk of the catch is taken by foreign fishing vessels under licensing agreements
and processed elsewhere. Access fees paid to Solomon Islands represent only about five
percent of the landed (not retail) value of the catch.

The SolTuna canning facility is looking to change those numbers. The idea is to get the full
value out of the tuna by processing the fish rather than selling the whole fish offshore. The
company, based in Noro, Western Province, is the only tuna loining and canning processor
in Solomon Islands. SolTuna is the largest employer in Noro, with about 1,800 staff—65
percent of them women.

SolTuna is the first of the IFC’s investments in Pacific fisheries and its first wild catch
investment in more than 15 years. The IFC’s $10 million loan is part of a $27 million upgrade
and expansion project, which is expected to increase the company’s processing capacity
from 90 tons a day to 150 tons a day. Perhaps no one sees the future potential of the tuna
stock better than Adrian Wickham, SolTuna’s managing director.

“I became managing director of SolTuna in January of

It’s quite an achievement. But we’d still like to take that

THEN: In addition to
destructive fishing practices
that were destroying Indonesia’s
reefs, 16% of the world’s reefs
died as a result of warmer water
temperatures from El Niño in 1998.



About two-thirds of Indonesia’s coastline is bordered by coral reefs, which
play vital roles in coastal fisheries, marine tourism and protection against
wave erosion. They also provide habitat for numerous marine organisms
and fish. Healthy reefs are an important source of food and economic
opportunity for some 67,000 coastal villages.

Almost 70 percent of Indonesia’s coral reefs are considered threatened by
overfishing. Half of the problem is caused by destructive fishing practices
like dynamiting the reefs to stun and catch fish.

For the past 16 years, the coral reef ecosystem has been protected and
rehabilitated to achieve sustainable use through a multi-donor biodiversity
initiative—Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Project (COREMAP).
Through COREMAP, communities receive incentives, training and resources
to protect the coral reefs. The result has been a sea change in attitude and
practices.

In Waha Village in Wakatobi, marine tourism operator Sudirman and food

wind installations in China totaled
about five gigawatts (GW).




A dubious title has passed from the developed to the developing world.
Where once western countries were acknowledged as the biggest culprits
for greenhouse gas emissions that are heating the world and threatening
humanity’s future, China is now the largest contributor to global greenhouse
gas emissions by volume. For the past 15 years, China has accounted for
about 60 percent of the growth of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide.
Its per capita emissions have risen to 7.2 metric tons of carbon dioxide,
comparable with countries of the European Union.

The good news is the Chinese government is addressing the challenge on an equally
massive scale. Even before its recent agreement with the United States, it had pledged
to reduce its carbon intensity by 40-45 percent by 2020 compared to 2005 levels, and
committed to increase its non-fossil fuel-based energy consumption to 15 percent by 2020.
China now leads the world in small hydropower development and in wind power capacity.
Its renewable energy consumption between 1990 and 2010 was as high as all European
countries combined.

China is beginning to look at every aspect of daily life to reduce carbon emissions—from
using biogas in rural areas to solar schools and energy efficiency in its major cities. For
example, China and the World Bank Group are working together to transform Shanghai into
a low-carbon city by improving energy efficiency in buildings.

Here are stories of three people, from all walks of life in China, who are doing their part to
help secure a livable future for the next generation.

Reducing emissions with biogas
The biogas units set up through this project will displace
about 1.55 million tons of greenhouse gases.
In 2004, there were about 15.4 million household biogas digesters in China. They take organic
waste products and turn them into usable methane gas. The number of household biogas digesters
in China nearly doubled by 2008 to 30.5 million. The World Bank has worked with the government
of China to install biogas digesters for more than 400,000 households. The Chinese government
provided the bulk of the $440 million funding; the World Bank contributed $120 million and farmers
also contributed through their labor.

On average, a biogas digester prevents 2.83 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. The
benefits the project provides to the environment don’t stop there. Biogas replacing firewood helps
prevent deforestation, and residue slurry from the digesters is good fertilizer, which could reduce
farmers’ use of chemical fertilizers and help maintain soil quality.

Ou Yuqun is a Yao ethnic farmer who lives in the Guangxi Autonomous Region, in China’s southwest.
In 2012 she had a biogas system installed. She is now cooking with gas; some of the lights in the
house use the gas; the toilet waste goes to the digester; and the residue slurry from the digester is
good fertilizer for the vegetables and peanuts she plants.

Two million students and teachers in schools across Beijing will have access to green electricity
through a renewable energy program supported by the local and central governments.

As the nation’s capital and a pilot city for low-carbon growth, Beijing—with a metropolitan
population of about 20 million—is striving to become a model for other Chinese cities. With support
from the World Bank, Beijing is implementing a project to install 100 megawatts of rooftop solar
photovoltaic systems in about 1,000 primary and middle schools—the largest of such initiatives in
the country so far.

The ‘Sunshine Schools’ program will generate clean energy for schools to meet their electricity
needs, provide clearer skies and healthier air for Beijing residents and serve as a tool to raise
environmental awareness among young students. The program is contributing to the country’s efforts
to expand renewable energy use and address climate change. Chen Suqin is the principal of one of
Beijing’s ‘sunshine schools.’

T
he new direction—energy efficiency
T
From 1980 to 2011, China’s energy intensity per unit of
GDP declined by about 70 percent.
More than 80 percent of China’s greenhouse gas emissions come from the energy sector.
Transforming China’s energy sector towards a low-carbon path could be the most important climate
change mitigation action.

The government of China has embarked on one of the most aggressive energy conservation
campaigns in the world, to fulfill its pledge to reduce its carbon intensity by 40-45 percent by 2020
compared to 2005 levels.

To help the government achieve its ambitious energy conservation and emission reduction targets,
the World Bank Group has played a significant role in introducing market-based approaches to
improving energy efficiency in China. Cai Yuchi is the chairman of one of the earliest of these
companies, Shanghai Zhongji Energy Co. Ltd. Cai is working to increase energy efficiency by utilizing
waste heat. It has become his mission in life.

factory, the design would have to be 20-30 percent more
than its actual operation. For example, take a building
in which the actual electricity consumption might be 30
kilowatts. But it is overdesigned to 50 kilowatts. So 20
percent of the energy is wasted. My goal is to put that
wasted energy to use.

waste heat has several benefits for the Shanxi company—
it solves the environmental problem; it increases
economic benefits; it saves a lot of energy, equivalent to
over 20,000 tons of coal; and it reduces emissions of more
than 60,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.




China has huge space for energy efficiency and environmental improvement.
There is much room for energy efficiency revamping. Even by my rough
calculation, it would be a market of a few trillion yuan.

No matter where we are in the world, Washington or
Wakatobi, Tokyo or Tanna, Seoul or Suva, Sydney or Sipalay—
people everywhere have hopes and dreams, and all of us want
to make a better life for ourselves and our children.

As this book was going to press, the devastating Category 5
‘Super Cyclone’ Pam slammed into Vanuatu and struck
Kiribati, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu.

The small island of Tanna took a direct hit. It’s home to 26,000
of Vanuatu’s 260,000 people, including Kelson whom you met
in chapter seven. The hopes and dreams of the people of
Tanna and the progress they’ve made have unraveled.

“It’s a setback for the government and for the people of
Vanuatu,” said Vanuatu’s President Baldwin Lonsdale, who laid
the blame for the intense storm on a changing climate. “After
all the development that has taken place, all this development
has been wiped out.”

Super storms like Pam are part of a terrible trend. As the
climate changes, there are more intense typhoons and
cyclones. From Yolanda, one of the deadliest storms ever to
strike the Philippines, to Pam in Vanuatu, we are reminded that
decades of development can be destroyed in an instant.

Ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity
means putting action on climate change at the top of the
development agenda.
