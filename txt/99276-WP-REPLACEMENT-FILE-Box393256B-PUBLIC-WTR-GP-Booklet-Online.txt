WORKING TOWARD SUSTAINABLE WATER
SUPPLY AND SANITATION SERVICES FOR ALL

THE CHALLENGES
  Access to sanitation lags behind water. At the aggregate level, the world
surpassed the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) to halve the proportion of
people without access to improved water supplies by 2015, but failed to meet the
equivalent for sanitation, and strong country and regional disparities in access remain,
with Africa and Asia falling behind the rest of the world.

  Quality of service is poor and service providers lack financial resources.
Intermittent supplies, continuing environmental degradation, and financially weak
service providers who rely on subsidies to cover their operating and capital costs
contribute to this challenge.

  Access to a connection is not enough. The Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aim to build on the global achievements made since 1990. Access continues to
be important, but SDG 6 proposes a broader agenda, as set out in the draft definition:

      By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all.

      By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open
      defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.

  These new goals reflects the growing importance of water and sanitation as a human
right. Additional targets that go beyond access are also being considered, such as improving
water quality by reducing pollution, and substantially increasing water-use efficiency.
The scale of the challenge is large and becoming more complex. The challenges
described translate to 663 million people without access to safe water, and 2.4 billion
people without access to improved sanitation, of which 1 billion defecate in the open.

A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL
                                                                                                                 8
    Two-thirds of people in developing countries use onsite sanitation, but only 22 percent
    of fecal sludge is managed, whereas up to 90 percent of sewerage flows in developing
    countries are discharged untreated into water bodies. Moreover, the combined impacts
    of urbanization and climate change will converge to compound this challenge.

      Future water availability is not guaranteed. Uncertainty about the future
    availability of water resources will have its most profound effects on poor populations,
    which are often concentrated in disaster-prone areas such as overcrowded settlements
    and low-lying deltas. Water variability, whether too much or too little, will strongly
    impact the ability of providers to maintain adequate quality and quantity of water
    supply and sanitation services.

      Failure to address these issues is expensive. The World Health Organization (WHO)
    estimated the economic cost of poor sanitation at US$260 billion per year, which,
    depending on the country, can range from 1 to 6 percent of the national GDP.
    There is no universal solution, but experience suggests the challenge may fall
    under three broad areas:
        »» Governance, the state, and citizen engagement: The framework of
           behavior change, institutions, policies, and incentives that support or undermine
           achievement of SDG 6.
        »» Finance and pricing: The ability of service providers to fully cover their
           operations and maintenance costs, and access investment funds as needed to
           expand and improve services and leverage markets.
        »» Capacity: The skills needed by managers and staff to deliver services
           efficiently and effectively.




                                WATER FOR DEVELOPMENT: RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES
9
RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES
  Strengthen sector governance, citizen participation, and utilities to
improve service delivery. Effective service delivery depends not only on the
governance and finance of service providers, but also on the relationship of the sector with
the state. Increasingly, water and sanitation services are delivered in the context of a
multitiered state—federal or decentralized—and aligning the water sector in terms
of roles and responsibilities to the different tiers of government is fundamental to
creating the right accountability and incentive for making services work, especially
for poor people.

  In this context, strengthening local governments and their relationship to citizens can
form an important platform for ensuring universal access to services. The formation
of effective service providers—whether rural or urban providers, public or private,
or community-based systems—requires a framework that enables each tier of the
state to have formal mechanisms for citizen engagement in service provision.
Furthermore, the linkage of the water sector to the fiscal, financial, and regulatory
framework of a multitiered state will also define and set the context for leveraging
markets and for the private sector to support the delivery of services.

  Similarly, local governments can play a critical role in developing incentives
for household-level behavior change, which is especially important in the case of
sanitation. Finally, the linkage between the water sector and the state is critical for scaling
up service delivery and innovation and delivering on the promise of universal access.




A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL
                                                                                                  10
       In terms of the governance of service providers, previous World Bank studies have
     shown that well-run utilities demonstrate four key characteristics:

         »»   They are managerially and financially autonomous.
         »»   They are accountable to their stakeholders.
         »»   They are efficient.
         »»   They are customer-oriented.

        Rarely do utilities in developing countries meet these characteristics, even though many
     best practices are known and replicable throughout the world. Greater separation of
     roles and responsibilities of sector actors is important, especially through ring fencing
     and better management of the service provider. There is a need to seek mechanisms
     for separating policymaking from service delivery and regulation—distinguishing
     “judge from the jury.” Interestingly, studies have shown that separation of roles and
     responsibilities of sector actors is often facilitated and triggered by the separation of
     roles and responsibilities between different tiers of government, suggesting that water
     sector governance reforms are intimately linked to the decentralization of the state. In the case
     of small towns, the need to consolidate into larger, more viable entities may become
     important. But more than anything, strong political leadership, which sees the benefits
     of universal and sustainable service delivery, is critical. It is only with this support
     that better incentives can be introduced, that utilities can be held accountable for the
     services they deliver, that opposition from vested interests can be withstood,
     and that customers can expect, and be asked to pay for, a service that meets their needs.




                                   WATER FOR DEVELOPMENT: RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES
11
  Secure a reliable revenue stream sufficient to cover operation and
maintenance costs. Maintaining revenue remains a day-to-day challenge for many
utility managers. Data from the International Benchmarking Network for Water
and Sanitation Utilities (IBNET) shows that only 64 percent of the 4,500 utilities in
the database cover more than their operation and management (O&M) costs from
user fees. User fees are, in most cases, the most reliable source of revenue given
that government transfers can be unreliable, or may come with political patronage
requirements. Increasing reliance on user fees also means that managers and staff will
focus more of their attention on meeting customer needs, rather than trying to satisfy
politicians on a day-to-day basis. This requires attention to commercial operations
(billing and collections), price setting (cost recover tariffs), and the design of tariff
structures that achieve cost recovery while considering affordability.

  Pricing. Revenue and affordability, however, raises the issue of pricing water.
Today, in the context of climate change, the world is seeking to put a price on carbon
but there is uncertainty as to how to value water. Yet, in the context of water security,
pricing and valuation of water has become essential. Pricing will need to play the role
of supporting water efficiency and reducing waste; facilitating the allocation of water
between competing needs such as energy, agriculture, and municipal sectors; creating
accountability in service delivery; meeting environmental needs; and securing universal
access and affordability. A single price cannot meet these differing objectives, but no
pricing or underpricing has the same impact—inefficiency, inequity, and misgovernance.
Indeed, the most expensive water, especially for the poor, is free water. Time and
again studies have shown that water subsidies are often captured by the better-off
households, and poor revenue streams for providers undermine their accountability
and ability to universalize service delivery, leaving poor households outside the ambit


A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL
                                                                                            12
     of formal service delivery. The Gordian knot of water pricing can only be cut in the
     context of institutional reform, sector governance, and assurance that the linkage with
     the state can allow distributional goals to be addressed through effective safety nets
     financed separately and securely.

       Improve operational efficiency to ensure that each revenue unit
     delivers the maximum service possible. The two largest areas of inefficiency
     are typically energy consumption and leakage. In both cases, greater use of
     performance-based contracting provides service providers with opportunities to
     leverage their public-sector skills with the technical capacity and incentives of the
     private sector to reduce costs and improve quality of service.

       Increase and improve access to investment capital. To achieve universal and
     quality services, investment capital must extend beyond what has historically been available
     from government grants, subsidies, and loans. The next period must see a move toward
     mobilization of more domestic capital, whether from banks, capital markets, or other
     sources such as pensions and insurance companies. Given the limited use of such sources in
     the past, there is a lot of ground to be made up. Often borrowers and lenders have limited
     understanding of each other’s needs and constraints. They simply don’t know how to talk
     to each other, and there may even be legal constraints that block potential lending to water
     companies. As a result, extensive capacity building will be needed to create that market—
     to build credit-worthy utilities, educate lenders about the sector’s opportunities, and
     remove legal or policy obstacles to mobilizing those funds. In the meantime, governments
     and donors should focus on building infrastructure by providing more results-based
     financing that creates a mindset around outcomes and institutions. Using government-
     backed financial institutions to supply finance and compensate for credit worthiness does
     not have a track record of triggering or sustaining effective service delivery.

                                  WATER FOR DEVELOPMENT: RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES
13
  Increase capacity building of utility staff and managers to
professionalize the sector. Capacity is often perceived through the lens of
training, and that too, through a prism of supply-driven, top-down training
methodologies. Capacity building in reality is much more and, importantly, intimately
linked to the institutional setup of the service provider. A local government or a
service provider that has operational flexibility with its own revenue sources and is
held accountable for service delivery will constantly seek to invest in its own capacity
through organizational changes, contracting of systems and skills, and, yes, training.
Capacity building in such a setting becomes more demand driven and related to
operational needs.

  In this broader institutional context for the water sector, national governments can
offer resources and incentives for individual utility and service providers to invest in
capacity building at their level. Both private and public institutions have a role to play,
and there should be an effort to build upon past successes and develop new partnership
modalities. For the private sector, there is potential to move from delegated or service
contracts to larger-scale efforts, such as capacity building at scale for multiple utilities.
Likewise, public-to-public twinning partnerships can be expanded in both depth and
scale, as long as they remain founded on key success factors such as shared interests,
geographic proximity, and cultural and linguistic considerations.

  The World Bank will continue to provide infrastructure financing to support
clients in their drive to meet the SDGs. This will be balanced by an increasing use of
the Bank’s international knowledge and experience to improve service providers by
linking governance, financing, and capacity building, helping our clients move toward
universal, quality water and sanitation services in a sustainable manner.


A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL
                                                                                                14
CLIMATE RESILIENT CITIES AND WATER

THE CHALLENGES
  Water stress is growing. Population and economic growth are bumping up
against a finite—and increasingly degraded—water resources, and this is particularly
evident in urban areas. Although the extent and nature of this stress varies from
area to area and from city to city, many parts of the world will need to manage their
water resources much more effectively to sustain their growth, and in some cases,
prevent a major regression in water-derived welfare. Furthermore, with higher rates of
urbanization, competition between agricultural, industrial, and municipal water uses
will increase, putting stress on existing water sources, and this will disproportionately
impact the poor.

  An increasing number of people live in urban areas. Currently, 54 percent
of the world’s population (i.e., 3.9 billion people) resides in urban areas; by 2050, 66
percent of the world’s population is projected to be living in urban areas, with nearly
90 percent of this increase concentrated in Asia and Africa. Growing cities will
need to provide services to 70 million more people each year over the next 20 years,
further increasing the already massive challenge of providing universal access to water
supply and sanitation (WSS) services by 2030. In this context, growing demand for
WSS services, accompanied by unplanned land use in urban areas, will likely lead to
unchecked contamination of surface and groundwater sources. This poses a threat
to the security of water supplies, increases flood risk, and affects the quality of life of
urban residents. In particular, small and medium-sized towns and cities experiencing
high population growth in developing countries will face increasing challenges to
provide basic urban services as they prepare to become the larger cities of tomorrow.



A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL
                                                                                              16
       Urban water management systems are inefficient. Current approaches to
     urban water management remain sector-specific, lacking scope to address cross-cutting
     water-related challenges. Watershed approaches to urban water management, where they
     exist, are rarely well coordinated with urban planning or with the provision of other urban
     services. Local authorities may also lack information about and experience with available
     technical options. Thus, approaches to urban water management remain fragmented. As a
     consequence, variations in the quantity and quality of water available to cities for drinking
     water, agriculture, energy, industry, and the environment lead to growing water insecurity.

        Climate change affects water resource availability. In addition, urban
     water management must consider the increased variability in water resource availability
     stemming from the effects of climate change, including rising temperatures, changes
     in precipitation patterns, and climate variability. An estimated 150 million people
     currently live in cities with perennial water shortage; population growth and climate
     variability may increase this number to 1 billion by 2050. Furthermore, most of the key
     climate risks are concentrated in urban areas, as high urbanization and rapid growth
     of large cities are accompanied by an increase in highly vulnerable urban communities
     living in informal settlements, many of which are on coastal land at high risk from
     sea-level rise, extreme weather, and climate events.

       The poor are the most vulnerable. The level of vulnerability to the effects
     of increasing water insecurity and climate change differs across and within cities,
     and differences in adaptive capacity are to a great extent determined by poverty and
     inequality, as well as by access to infrastructure, institutions, and information. The urban
     poor are most vulnerable to these challenges, because they have less access to resources
     to cope with extreme weather events and are often marginalized from decision making,
     particularly in the informal settlements of growing urban areas in developing countries.

                                                           CLIMATE RESILIENT CITIES AND WATER
17
RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES
  Addressing these increasingly urgent challenges requires an array of interventions
and services at the city level to build resilience not only in physical infrastructure
but also in cities’ social architecture, governance structures, financial systems, and
ecosystems. Increasing uncertainties coupled with sudden shocks or accumulating
stresses could lead to infrastructure failure, economic decline, or social breakdown.
A resilient city can adapt to a variety of changing conditions and withstand shocks
while still providing essential services to its residents. Such a city will have a series of
systems in place capable of absorbing the stresses imposed by climate change as well as
those resulting from nonclimate risks.

  The World Bank is supporting its client countries in building resilient cities through
different sectors and approaches. The Water Global Practice of the World Bank is
contributing to this effort by focusing on three major responses.

   Promote water security by integrating the wider resource perspective.
This integration is achieved by identifying solutions that take into account resource
constraints and extreme weather events. It entails broadening the scope of analysis to
include a basin-wide understanding of the availability of water resources, both surface
and groundwater, the quantity and quality available, and the existing competing uses.
It also includes helping clients to navigate the risks and uncertainties from climatic
and nonclimatic risks, incorporate robustness in system design and operations, and
strengthen utilities. For example, in Bogota, Colombia, and Buenos Aires, Argentina,
the Bank is supporting the government through lending instruments to build resilient
cities through comprehensive upstream watershed management coupled with urban
water management and flood control.

                                                                                               18
       Promote the principles of integrated urban water management.
     IUWM offers a framework that can complement traditional approaches to resolving
     the challenges that affect the provision of services in urban areas. It is underpinned
     by the idea that cities are fundamentally dependent on, and have an impact on, the
     wider watershed and must account for all elements of the urban water cycle. Under an
     IUWM approach, planning for the water sector is integrated with other urban sectors,
     such as land use, housing, energy, and transportation, to overcome urban planning
     fragmentation with the aim of improving system-wide performance. Within an IUWM
     framework, it is also important to promote activities that close the water cycle and
     improve infrastructure design and operation through the incorporation of hard and
     green solutions (e.g., drainage systems, green roofs, and room for the river).

       In Teresina, Brazil, for example, the World Bank has been providing financing for
     soft and hard investments to integrate drainage infrastructure with water supply and
     sanitation, create green areas to mitigate the effects of urban flooding, and regenerate
     urban areas to promote economic development. Most recently, the World Bank
     provided support to Uruguay to develop a roadmap for an IUWM national strategy for
     sustainable urban development and strengthening of local capacities.

        Promote mainstream water in broader city resilience exercises.
     Several global initiatives on building resilient cities focus on a large number of sectors
     and services—e.g., the Rockefeller Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities, work by the
     C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), ICLEI, and the United Nations Human
     Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat). In addition, the World Bank is implementing
     its City Strength Program. This program facilitates dialogue with city stakeholders
     about risk, opportunity, and the performance of urban systems, and provides a tool
     for identifying priority actions and investments to enhance resilience in city systems

                                                          CLIMATE RESILIENT CITIES AND WATER
19
as a whole. The Water Global Practice collaborates with these broader initiatives
to ensure that resilience is built into water systems, thus providing proper service
provision and protection of the most vulnerable.

  Promote decentralized cities. In the context of today’s urbanization process
and the growing economic importance of urban systems, the governance framework of
cities will determine the impact cities will have on the welfare of nations. At the heart
of the governance story is the extent to which cities have devolved political, fiscal,
and regulatory powers. South Asia’s megacities (e.g., Dhaka, Mumbai, and Karachi)
are relatively centralized, with limited fiscal and policy powers. In contrast, cities in
Southern Africa and Latin America have more decentralized powers. Importantly, the level
of decentralization is a critical determinant of how accountable city policymakers
are to urban citizens. Policies to build resilient cities will therefore be sharply
influenced by the governance structure of cities and their level of decentralization
in an intergovernmental system. However, building resilience is equally a national
responsibility. Therefore, the fiscal and policy relationships between upper tier
governments and city governments become equally important in the governance of
cities and supporting programs that strengthen resilience.

  Building resilient cities requires various sectors to work together to ensure integrated
city-wide planning, including effective water resource management. It also requires
a careful understanding of the governance system of cities and their place in the
intergovernmental system. The World Bank will continue to work across sectors
and with diverse institutions and stakeholders to help cities become resilient for the
challenges ahead while ensuring decreased vulnerability of the poor and strengthened
urban governance and accountability.


A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL

TRANSBOUNDARY COOPERATION
HELPS BUILD CLIMATE RESILIENCE

THE CHALLENGES
  The growing development in transboundary river basins increases
water-related risks. Around 60 percent of the world’s freshwater flows are in
transboundary rivers and 40 percent of the world’s population lives in their river basins.
Globally, there are approximately 276 transboundary river basins; Africa alone has
63 transboundary basins where the five largest rivers are shared by eight or more
countries. Managing water-related hazards and risks in transboundary basins will be
a central challenge in strengthening global resilience to climate change. As demand
grows, these rivers will become increasingly developed, and pressure on the resource
base will further complicate the challenges they face on political, institutional,
economic, and financial fronts.

  Climate change and growing hydrological variability and uncertainty
in these basins will affect billions of people, particularly the poor.
Increased uncertainty and shifting crop water requirements will threaten poor rain-fed
farmers in particular. Moreover, the increasing intensity of droughts, floods, typhoons,
and monsoons, along with uncertainties around waterborne disease, glacier melt, glacier
lake outburst floods, and sea-level rise pose the highest risk to poorer communities that are
least able to cope. For example, in the Niger Basin, the predominantly rural population
relies on rain-fed agriculture, pastoralism, or other natural-resource-based livelihoods.
Food security and social well-being depend on unpredictable rainfall patterns that
are projected to become more extreme as the climate changes. Subsistence economies
that rely on the environmental services provided by the river are the most vulnerable
to climate risk. Sound water management, which is key to adaptation, is weakest in the
poorest countries in the basin, thereby magnifying their climate vulnerability.

A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL
                                                                                                22
       The transboundary nature of most major rivers, lakes, and aquifers adds
     complexity to planning and implementing these crucial adaptation and mitigation
     interventions and may introduce the risk of maladaptation. Countries face
     technical, financial, political, and logistical challenges when they seek to
     manage or develop their transboundary waters—challenges that spill over and
     complicate efforts to build climate resilience and adapt to change. Examples of the
     complexities of transboundary waters include:

         »» Hydrological and meteorological boundaries seldom coincide with political
            boundaries, so national data sets only provide a subset of information needed to
            characterize available water and project water-related climate vulnerabilities.
         »» Political relationships can dominate the extent to which data is shared and
            investments are explored collaboratively.
         »» Competing national priorities for common water resources have different
            payoffs for different riparians; national-level interventions that do not consider
            riparian interests risk having maladaptive consequences.
         »» Having multiple borrowers and/or multiple beneficiaries adds complexity to
            institutional and financing arrangements for infrastructure.
         »» Coordinating among multiple countries adds time and expense to any process;
            riparians may become frustrated with the pace of multilateral development and
            see international cooperation as a hindrance rather than a solution.




                                 WATER FOR DEVELOPMENT: RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES
23
RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES
  Despite its complexities, transboundary cooperation on information, infrastructure,
and institutions presents countries with an important opportunity to effectively and
efficiently build climate resilience. The World Bank is supporting its client countries in
building climate resilience through transboundary cooperation by focusing on three
major responses.

  Promote cooperation in information and data sharing to reduce uncertainty,
manage climate risks, and strengthen livelihoods in the face of a changing climate.
Information needed for resilience-building interventions exceeds geopolitical and
sectoral boundaries, and transboundary cooperation allows:

    »» expansion of the information and knowledge base to improve understanding of
       weather and climate phenomena and increase predictive accuracy.
    »» use of available information by countries to collaborate and coordinate in
       making strategic regional and national decisions in the face of extreme climate
       variability and unpredictable long-term climate change.
    »» effective and efficient dissemination of processed information to populations
       vulnerable to climate disaster.

  For example, in Central Asia, the World Bank is supporting efforts to strengthen
national and regional hydrological and meteorological information systems that
will improve accessibility, reliability, and analytical capacity to use water resource
information for improved water resource planning, monitoring, and management.
These systems will help countries reduce uncertainty as they plan for and operate
hydropower, irrigation, and municipal water supply investments.

A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL
                                                                                             24
       Promote basin-wide planning and development of strategic natural and
     man-made infrastructure to mitigate impacts of climate variability and
     reduce risks of long-term change. Transboundary cooperation allows countries
     to strategically, in the context of their hydrogeologic landscape, advance sound and
     sustainable regional and national infrastructure that will equip people to better
     store, regulate, and exploit their water resources. As a result, these countries will be
     able to advance their development objectives and reduce their climate-disaster and
     environmental vulnerability in the face of increasing climate variability and shifting
     long-term water availability trends. For example, in the Niger Basin, the World Bank
     contributes to the funding of the Kandadji Program, which involves construction
     of the Kandadji dam and investments to increase power-generation capacity, boost
     agribusiness, increase irrigation, and support community development. These investments
     will help the people of Niger and the basin to overcome their vulnerability to water-
     related shocks and take steps toward meeting their development objectives.

       Strengthen the range of institutions needed to implement effective
     cooperative adaptation. Transboundary cooperation allows countries to develop a
     strong foundational institutional framework, which includes formal legal frameworks;
     informal, accepted norms; and organizations such as river basin organizations and regional
     economic commissions. This framework enables effective sharing of information and
     collaboration on sustainable infrastructure critical to reducing climate disaster risk and
     mitigating environmental vulnerability. For example, in the Zambezi Basin, the World
     Bank, through the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa (CIWA) program, is
     supporting the Zambezi Watercourse Commission (ZAMCOM) in its effort to develop a
     basin-wide master plan, a basin-level information platform, and a flood-forecasting and early
     warning system. A strong ZAMCOM will be an important tool for countries as they work
     together under an uncertain future to equitably develop the basin’s shrinking resources.
                                  WATER FOR DEVELOPMENT: RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES
25
WATER AND GENDER

THE CHALLENGES
  Women lack voice and representation in water management. Since the
Beijing Platform of Action for the Advancement of Women was defined 20 years ago,
international policy declarations have stressed the importance of addressing gender
differences in water needs and have emphasized the central role women play in water
management to achieve sector goals. Although sector policy and strategies at country
and institutional levels have registered modest success in consistently channeling
women’s contributions, women continue to be disproportionately underrepresented in
sector decision making at many levels.

  Domestic water collection leads to time poverty for women and girls.
In spite of the progress realized in the global Millennial Development Goals 2015
milestone for water, in 70 percent of households in 45 developing countries, domestic
water collection is done by women and girls, disadvantaging other spheres of life.
In India, for example, women and girls spend an estimated 150 million work days
fetching water per year; in Tanzania, school attendance levels are 12 percent lower for
girls in homes more than an hour away from safe water supply than for girls within a
distance of 15 minutes.

   Women have unequal economic opportunities. The water sector continues
to reflect unequal economic opportunities in spite of growth. For example, in
patriarchal societies, the membership requirement for water user associations
is often tied to land ownership, which reduces women’s chances to participate
in decisions on water resource management. Men benefit disproportionally
from economic opportunities generated by the capital-intensive nature of water
development and management.
A WATER-SECURE WORLD FOR ALL
                                                                                          26
       Women and girls have specific sanitation needs. Globally, 52 percent of
     the female population is of reproductive age. Managing menstruation requires several
     essential elements, including clean materials to absorb or collect menstrual blood,
     a private place to change these materials as often as necessary, soap and water for
     washing, and access to safe and convenient facilities to dispose of used materials.
     Taboos around menstruation have rendered these needs invisible, but without such
     facilities or with unisex facilities with no privacy, girls have been known to lose school
     days or even drop out of school at puberty. Moreover, walking to communal toilets in
     urban informal settlements or humanitarian camps, or, in the absence of facilities,
     to secluded areas for open defecation, has been associated with gender-based violence.

     RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES
       For water in its multidimensional role in economic development and poverty
     reduction, addressing gender is essential to achieving quality results. Substantial
     evidence shows that a gender-inclusive approach increases sustainability. Data from
     a 2001 World Bank study of 15 countries shows that water supply projects that used
     gender and demand-responsive approaches, such as separate meetings for women and
     men, capacity building, and quotas for women’s participation, sustained their results
     better and used the services more effectively to promote better health outcomes.

       To respond to the challenges, gender-inclusive water programs need to reflect
     the integral roles of women and girls as providers, users, and managers of water.
     In addition, more analysis of qualitative and quantitative data is required.
     Finally, synergies with other sectors such as health and education as well as
     stakeholder engagement need to be promoted.


                                 WATER FOR DEVELOPMENT: RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES
27
  The World Bank is supporting its client countries in reducing gender inequities
through different sectors and approaches. The Water Global Practice of the World
Bank is contributing to this by focusing on three major responses.

  Increase the institutional space for gender. Sector actors can address
gender inequality when sector objectives, strategies, institutional arrangements,
and resources are in alignment with international and national gender goals and
commitments. To explore the barriers that prevent, as well as the positive factors
that lead to, effective implementation, the Water Global Practice is undertaking
a global study to determine if countries have gender-informed water policies and
strategies, and to what extent they are being implemented. The findings will be used
to support the development of gender action plans in water for selected countries,
and at a global level to promote knowledge on creating the institutional space to
address gender gaps as part of regular water sector development.

  Recently, the government of Papua, New Guinea, with the partnership of the
World Bank, developed and adopted a gender-informed national water, sanitation,
and hygiene (WASH) policy that addresses gender dimensions of access, voice, and
gender-based violence. Built on broad stakeholder engagement with civil society,
academia, and government, the policy was enacted in January 2015. In this past year,
the Water Global Practice reviewed the portfolio for trends and good practices in
addressing gender in the 2000–2014 period. The findings are being used to increase
support of gender in all aspects of water, with increased attention to water resource
management. Building on the review, the Practice is also preparing new tools and
checklists to guide staff, clients, and partners in addressing gender as part of sector
reform and project design.

                                                                                          28
       Promote equal economic opportunities in the water sector.
     Analysis, monitoring and evaluation, and special interventions are required to ensure
     that women benefit from the economic opportunities that water generates. Peru’s Sierra
     Irrigation Project found that 75 percent of the water managers were men, land titles
     were almost exclusively in men’s names, participation in the Water User Organization
     (WUO) was linked to land ownership, and meetings were held at times women were
     unavailable and conducted in Spanish rather than the local language most women knew.
     Overcoming the challenges required removing the land title requirement for WUO
     membership and irrigation access, setting aside a portion of irrigated land for women,
     and, through exposure and training to men and women, raising awareness of women’s
     role in irrigation management. By the end of the project, all of the WUOs had at least
     one woman leader and participation in WUO meetings registered at least 30 percent
     women. Vietnam’s Red River Delta Water and Sanitation Project incorporated training
     for women on financial literacy, management, and business development, and provided
     access to credit through rotating funds and credit cooperatives. The intervention enabled
     women to make increased decisions on and investments in sanitation.

       Increase the capacity of the state and service providers to address
     gender and water. Kenya’s Water and Sanitation Service Improvement Project
     (WASSIP) built capacity within government water boards and 24 urban water utilities to
     address gender in sector policy and operations. Results included new gender action plans
     implemented with the institutions’ own resources; reform of access policies such as social
     connections and adoption of alternatives to land title requirements for water and sewer
     connections; increase in women’s opportunities for paid work; and enhanced women’s
     visibility in utility management. A compilation/toolkit of lessons learned is now being
     used to guide utilities beyond the project investment area in Kenya.


                                 WATER FOR DEVELOPMENT: RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES
29
  A compilation/toolkit of lessons learned is now being used to guide utilities beyond
the project investment area in Kenya. At a regional level, platforms like the Africa
Minister’s Council on Water (AMCOW), which adopted the “AMCOW Policy and
Strategy for Mainstreaming Gender in Africa’s Water Sector” in 2011, provide an
entry point for countries to learn from one another. Similarly, the Nile Equatorial
Lakes Subsidiary Action Program established a gender action plan, guidelines, and
built capacity of riparian government staff for joint monitoring using gender-sensitive
indicators for transboundary water management.

  Finally, the decentralization of the state and formation of local governments offer a
space to increase the capacity of the state to address the linkage between gender and
water. As India has shown, ensuring that local councils have a dedicated portion of
seats for women councilors has enabled women to leverage their voice into service
delivery decisions. States such as Kerala and West Bengal have seen this voice reflected
in greater demand for water services. In Bangladesh, this has translated into greater
demand for sanitation services. At the same time, water service delivery innovations
can strengthen the voice of women in state management. The linkage of service
delivery with the system of the state and mechanisms of voice that make a state
inclusive are therefore critical to ensuring that the state is able to address the policy

ATTRACTING COMMERCIAL FINANCING
INTO THE WATER AND SANITATION SECTOR

THE CHALLENGES
   Risky and uncertain revenues impede the water and sanitation
sector from accessing commercial financing. Delivering good quality
water and sanitation services requires that service providers be accountable to
their customers and have financial and managerial autonomy to maintain assets
and expand investments. Long-term commercial financing is required to support
infrastructure development while short- and medium-term commercial financing
is needed to support short- and medium-term rehabilitation, operating expenses,
and bridge financing. Although both sources of financing are crucial, access to long-
term financing is particularly difficult in developing countries where risks are high
and future revenue streams more uncertain. Service providers in many developing
countries confront the additional risk of foreign exchange rate volatility, which
increases the cost of borrowing from foreign sources. For them, tapping into long-
term domestic sources such as pension funds and insurance companies is critical to
better match revenues and debt services and thus minimize the foreign exchange risk.

  Weak enabling environment discourages investment and results in
low quality of service. Effective resource mobilization essentially implies that
governments need to bring to market projects that are of interest to commercial
financiers and create regulatory certainty. This requires interventions across several
fronts—lowering risks, creating deeper local financial markets, and mobilizing
international capital markets and institutional investors. That said, financing for
projects will be hard to come by if governments do not have a facilitating regulatory
and institutional framework in place. This means ensuring a service provider’s
financial and managerial autonomy to limit day-to-day political interference.

                                                                                         32
        It also means accountability to stakeholders, including lenders, who focus on
     efficient service delivery. Many utilities in developing countries do not yet meet these
     thresholds, and this poor governance is reflected in poor operational performance with
     high levels of leakage, endemic inefficiency, and low quality of service. As a result,
     it is critical to look at sector governance as well as the enabling environment for private
     financing, both of which tend to be very weak in the water sector.

       Significantly less private capital has been committed to water and
     sanitation than to other infrastructure sectors. In 2013, private-sector
     participation in the water and sanitation sector totaled $3.4 billion, or just 7 percent of
     the money that flowed into energy and information and communications technology
     (ICT). Perhaps the single biggest constraint relates to the sources of income to
     support water projects. There are only two revenue streams to support infrastructure
     investments: consumers and government. However, unlike ICT and energy, where
     market forces tend to determine these revenue streams, there is often a public
     perception that water costs to consumers must be kept to a minimum. As a result,
     water and sanitation services are often underpriced, thus undermining opportunities to
     develop and maintain infrastructure as well as mobilize commercial finance.

RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES
  As focus shifts to the SDGs and achieving universal access to water and sanitation,
there will be a need to mobilize private capital to finance the infrastructure.
To scale up (“billions to trillions”), it will be necessary to reconsider the systems and
incentives needed to attract and sustain such capital flows. Over the past five years, the
Global Water Practice at the World Bank has been working with key public and private-
sector partners in numerous countries to explore innovative financing arrangements.
There is no “one size fits all” and the solutions vary from models of contracting out
specific services, to full-scale public-private partnerships (PPPs), to mobilizing domestic
credit. Although much remains to be done, significant achievements have been realized
in such diverse countries as Bangladesh, Benin, Cambodia, Kenya, and Indonesia.

  The World Bank’s approach is to tailor solutions to the financing,
development, and delivery challenges of each country and city.
Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam offers a good example. The World Bank supported the
water utility in outsourcing its leakage operations in part of the city. This project used
an innovative performance contract where payments to the contractor were contingent
upon water leakage savings. The saved water could then be used to expand services
and increase revenues, thus improving both the quality of service and the financial
performance of the company. Cairo is a booming and vast metropolis where the
Bank has supported the local private and public sectors in gaining expertise in new
technologies by partnering with foreign operators with obligations to maintain
assets. In Senegal and Benin, there has been successful use of private operators
in rural water with small schemes that are grouped to attract finance and achieve
economies of scale.

       A number of instruments and tools exist to facilitate or “crowd-in”
     commercial financing. Many of these have been used successfully in other
     infrastructure sectors and, in the right enabling environment and with viable
     projects, can be used to significantly increase private financing. A host of tools
     have been used to attract investors to the infrastructure markets. For instance,
     financial guarantees are used to reduce the risks for private investors and increase
     the pool of capital. Partial credit guarantees have been structured in multiple
     ways to share risk and can be tailored to meet specific mitigation needs. They are
     best used when the capital risk is clear and the guarantee is targeted to overcome
     the specific risk. Another popular tool is insurance, which can be used to mitigate
     investor risk and, like guarantees, may be structured to share risk or tailored to
     address specific issues.

       For example, insurance has been used to mitigate concerns about such diverse
     challenges as the political economy, and catastrophic circumstances such as
     natural disasters. Subsidies, when structured correctly, reduce the overall
     financing costs, target benefits to specific segments of the population, and extend
     service coverage areas. Equity grants, or blended finance, is another form of subsidy
     that replaces equity capital with no or low return finance. Other examples include
     tenure extensions, pooled finance, and project preparation funds. In sum, there are
     tools to suit particular country circumstances and call for targeted responses.

  Innovative financing can transform marginal projects into
financially viable transactions. However, no amount of innovation can
make nonviable projects bankable or overcome lender’s concerns about sector
governance, utility performance, and revenue predictability. How public finance and
public institutions of service delivery are structured will determine the ability of the
water sector to leverage private finance. Poorly structured public systems will not
attract private finance or will do so at the risk of creating moral hazard and placing
commercial risk implicitly on public resources. Without a concerted push to address
these issues, the chances of achieving the SDGs could be threatened.
