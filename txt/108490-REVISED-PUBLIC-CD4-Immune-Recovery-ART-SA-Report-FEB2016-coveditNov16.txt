EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Background
South Africa has the largest HIV epidemic in the world. About three million people were
receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) as of March 2015. ART is expected to suppress viral
replication and allow immunological recovery. However, a significant proportion of adults who
initiate ART fail to achieve immunological recovery. Sub-optimal immune recovery is associated
with increased morbidity and mortality from HIV-associated opportunistic infections and illness.
Linking patient-level CD4 and viral load test result data from the South African national health
laboratory system and data from the health information system enabled a new analysis of
immune recovery. This report describes the proportions of individuals 15 years or older who
initiated ART between 2010 and 2014 and achieved CD4 count recovery to 200, 350 and 500
cells/µl, their time to CD4 count recovery, and extent of recovery in the first 12 months of follow
up.


Methods
Routinely collected CD4 count and viral load laboratory data
were linked to unique individuals using a probabilistic                Linking patient-level
matching algorithm; a cohort of individuals who met eligibility
criteria was identified and included in the analysis. In order to   CD4 and viral load test
be eligible for inclusion individuals had to: i) be 15 years or         result data from the
older, ii) have two or more CD4 count results and at least one
viral load in the corporate data warehouse database, iii) have      South African national
an estimated date of ART initiation between 1st January 2010               health laboratory
and 31st December 2014. Individuals entered the cohort at
ART initiation and exited on the date of CD4 count recovery or        system and data from
on the date of the latest viral load or CD4 count test if there     the health information
was no CD4 count recovery. The proportions of individuals
who achieved CD4 count recovery to different thresholds               system enabled a new
were determined, and modified Poisson regression used to                 analysis of immune
identify factors independently associated with CD4 count
recovery. Survival analysis was used to determine the time to                           recovery.
CD4 count recovery. The Kaplan-Meier log-rank test was used
to assess the association between time to recovery and factors including age, gender, year of
starting ART, and CD4 count at the start of ART. Random effects panel regression was used to
estimate the extent of recovery during the first 12 months of ART.


Findings
A total of 1,070,900 individuals were included in the analysis. Of these 30.3% were male. The
median CD4 count at ART initiation was 213 cells/µl (interquartile range (IQR) 117–324
cells/µl), median of duration of follow up was 24 months (IQR 12.2–36.9 months) ; and 85.9%
achieved viral suppression by the end of follow up. Of the 46.6% of individuals who initiated ART
with a CD4 count less than 200 cells/µl, 79.7% achieved CD4 count recovery to 200 cells/µl in a
median of 9.5 months. Among those who were virally suppressed by the end of follow up, the


                                                |1
proportions who recovered to CD4 count thresholds of 200, 350 and 500 cells/µl were 85.3%,
68.3% and 44.4% in a median time to recovery of 9.4, 12.4 and 17.3 months respectively. The
proportion who achieved CD4 count recovery beyond the specified thresholds was lower among
older individuals, males, those with low CD4 counts, and those with a shorter duration of follow
up. The extent of CD4 count recovery during the first 12 months of follow up was greatest
among those who were virally suppressed by the end of follow up and those with the lowest CD4
counts at ART initiation.

Discussion and conclusion
Close to half of ART patients included in the cohort had CD4 counts < 200 cells/µl at treatment
initiation despite increases in the CD4 count eligibility thresholds for ART to 350 cells/µl in 2009
and 500 cells/µl in 2015. Among the factors assessed, virological suppression during follow up
and the CD4 count at ART initiation were the strongest predictors of the likelihood and extent of
CD4 count recovery. There is need to strengthen interventions to improve early HIV testing and
linkage to HIV care and treatment at higher CD4 counts. Despite trends towards reduced
frequency of CD4 count monitoring, continued monitoring may be warranted for individuals
with sub-optimal CD4 count recovery and population groups with lower capacity for immune
reconstitution such as older ART patients in order to guide care including prophylactic
treatments. Analysis of large sets of routine data and novel approaches in record linkage
(sometimes referred to as big data) can contribute to better targeting and more efficient
implementation of the South African ART programme.

2 Determinants of CD4 immune recovery among individuals on antiretroviral therapy in South Africa
BACKGROUND

South Africa has the largest HIV epidemic in the world. In 2013, an estimated 6.3 million people
were living with HIV and 2.5 million had initiated ART.(1) Routine programme monitoring data
highlight rapid programme expansion with 3.09 million people on ART in March 2015.(2)
Initiation of ART by people living with HIV is usually followed by decreases in HIV viral load
(VL), increases in CD4 count and reduced morbidity and mortality from HIV-associated
opportunistic infections and illnesses. Over the years the country has increased the CD4 count
threshold for ART initiation from <200 cells/µl in 2009 to <500 cells/µl in 2015.(3) After
landmark studies showed that ART initiation at CD4 counts >500 cells/µl was associated with
lower morbidity, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued new guidance recommending
that all HIV positive individuals be initiated on ART regardless of CD4 count. (4) South Africa will
likely amend its ART initiation guidelines to incorporate this “test and treat” strategy in line with
the WHO recommendation.(4)

Despite the increases in the CD4 count threshold for ART eligibility over the years and the gradual
increase in the median CD4 count among those starting ART, a
significant proportion of individuals diagnosed with HIV continue
                                                                                     South Africa has the
to initiate ART late with CD4 counts <200 cells/µl.(5–9) Optimal
adherence to ART is required in order to achieve virological                     largest HIV epidemic in
suppression and immune recovery.(10) Currently there is no
                                                                                   the world. In 2013, an
universally agreed definition of immunological recovery or lack
thereof. Some definitions of failure to achieve immune recovery                     estimated 6.3 million
have included: failure to attain an increase in CD4 cell count of
                                                                                 people were living with
>30% above the baseline during the first six to 12 months after
ART initiation, failure to attain an absolute CD4 cell count >200               HIV and 2.5 million had
cells/ µl during the first six to 12 months on ART, a CD4 count
                                                                                              initiated ART.
increase <50 cells/µl after 12 months on ART, and failure to
increase CD4 count to above 500 cells/µl (considered normal
immunological function) after four to seven years of ART. (11–13) About 20–30% of individuals living
with HIV and initiated on ART fail to restore CD4 counts despite achieving virological suppression.(13,
14) Late presentation to care associated with low nadir and baseline CD4 counts (15, 16) has been

associated with sub-optimal immunological recovery despite achieving virological suppression.(17, 18)
Studies from sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere have shown that sub-optimal immune recovery is
also associated with older age (>50 years) at ART initiation,(19–22) being male,(23) having a longer
duration of HIV infection before initiating ART, sub-optimal adherence to ART, (10) co-infection with
tuberculosis (TB) and other infections, and on-going immune activation.(11) The late presenters, the
immunological non-responders, and the delayed immunological responders continue to be at risk of
increased morbidity and mortality from HIV-related illnesses including TB as well as non-AIDS-
defining illnesses.(9, 13, 14, 24–27) In addition, the burden of illness in these groups continues to be a
significant cost to the health care system largely due to costs of hospitalisations, additional
investigations, and treatments.(28)

As part of a broader evaluation of adherence and retention in HIV care within the South African
National ART programme, this report describes the determinants of CD4 immune recovery among
individuals on antiretroviral therapy in South Africa. Specifically we report on the proportion of
people achieving CD4 recovery, the average time to recovery, and the extent of CD4 count recovery in
the first 12 months of follow up among individuals initiated on ART in the South African National ART

programme between 1st January 2010 and 31st December 2014. We analyse these outcomes by age,
sex, CD4 count at ART initiation, and VL suppression. We also analyse outcomes by province and
district. We define CD4 immune recovery as an increase in CD4 cell count beyond a specific threshold:
i) achieving a CD4 count >200 cells/µl if initiating at a CD4 count <200 cells/µl; ii) achieving a CD4
count >350 cells/µl if initiating at a CD4 count <350 cells/µl; iii) achieving a CD4 count >500 cells/µl if
initiating at a CD4 count <500 cells/µl.


Objectives
The objectives of the study were:

    To estimate the proportion of individuals 15 years or older who initiated ART during the period
     2010 to 2014 and achieved CD4 recovery to different CD4 count thresholds, by province, district,
     age, gender, and year of starting ART;
    To estimate the time to CD4 recovery beyond the specified CD4 count thresholds among eligible
     individuals by province, district, age, gender, and year of starting ART;
    To estimate the extent of immune recovery in the first 12 months of ART by age, gender, and CD4
     count at initiation.


Methods
Setting
The South African government has been providing ART at public health facilities through the
comprehensive care, management and treatment (CCMT) programme since 2004. The
programme adopted a public health approach to scaling up ART. This approach uses simplified
and standardised treatment regimens and treatment monitoring strategies. Over the years, the
country has changed both the CD4 count thresholds at which ART is initiated and treatment
monitoring strategies, in line with global recommendations and evidence. Table 1 below shows
the evolution of the guidelines on ART initiation and treatment monitoring approaches since the
programme began in 2004.

In addition to changes in the treatment initiation and monitoring guidelines, the South African
CCMT programme expanded rapidly from a few facilities mostly managed by non-governmental
organisations (NGOs) to over 3,775 facilities including primary health care centres providing
ART in 2015. The National Health Laboratory Services (NHLS) provides CD4 count and viral load
testing services for these facilities through a network of 60 CD4 count and 17 viral load testing
laboratories. Specimen data from the laboratory management information system are archived

of routinely collected laboratory data was conducted in the context of a broader evaluation of
adherence to ART and retention in HIV care within the CCMT programme

The purpose of the broad evaluation was to (a) categorise facilities providing ART by the
proportion of ART clients that are virally suppressed; (b) understand whether there is spatial
clustering of facilities where lower proportions of ART clients are virally suppressed; (c) help
classify ART clients for the purpose of targeted adherence interventions, by determining broad
demographic characteristics of ART clients (location, age and gender) who are most likely not to

be virally suppressed (indicative of low drug adherence); and (d) better understand patterns of
CD4 recovery rates and the overall HIV care cascade. The analysis presented in this report
focused on absolute CD4 count recovery rates, the time to CD4 recovery, and the extent of CD4
count recovery in the first 12 months of follow up.

Study design and procedures
This was an analysis of routinely collected laboratory data. Because the CCMT programme lacks
a unique identifier for individuals enrolled, and laboratory tests can be from the same individual
having multiple tests over time and across sites, data were linked using a probabilistic matching
algorithm, in order to determine the records that relate to each individual. In the probabilistic
record linkage, personal identifiers were used together to determine how likely it was that a pair
of records referred to the same individual. Variables incorporated into the algorithm included
name, surname, initials, date of birth, and sex. The performance of the algorithm was tested
against a gold standard dataset and found to have a type 2 error (over-matching) rate of 15%
and a type 1 error (under matching) rate of 11%. The details of this linking algorithm are
described in a separate report. (33)

Population, inclusion and exclusion criteria
From an initial dataset containing unique individuals with at least one viral load and one CD4
count test result, individuals who met the following criteria were identified and included in the
analysis of CD4 recovery:

    Had at least one viral load test result in the CDW database.
    Had at least two CD4 count results in the database
    Had a CD4 count in the database that was done three to 12 months prior to the first viral load test.
     This criterion was used to determine the estimated ART start date for individuals who were likely
     to have started ART during this time (2010–14). Prior to 2010, national ART guidelines
     recommended a baseline VL. The 2010 ART guidelines formally adopted the recommendation in
     the 2009 update to the earlier guidelines to stop baseline VL testing.
    Aged 15 years or older
Data on eligible individuals were used to set up a cohort. Person-time was counted from ART
initiation until the earliest of: (1) the date of CD4 recovery if there was CD4 recovery according
to the specified threshold; or (2) the date of the last CD4 count or viral load test (whichever came
last) if there was no CD4 recovery. Figure 1 illustrates how the cohort was set up for analysis of
the proportion of eligible individuals with CD4 count recovery and time to CD4 count recovery.

Variables and definitions
Key variables in the analysis were defined as follows:

    Date of ART start―this was the date of the baseline CD4 count. The date of the baseline CD4 count
     was taken to be the date of the CD4 count done three to 12 months before the first viral load date.
     Where multiple CD4 count test dates and results were available for this time period, the earliest
     date was used.
    CD4 count at ART start―the result of the baseline CD4 count
    Follow up CD4 counts―results from the CD4 count tests done at any point after the ART start date
    Duration of follow up―the time interval between the date of ART initiation and the date of the
     latest CD4 count or viral load test result in the database
    Virally suppressed―having a viral load result of <400 copies/ml at any point during follow up
    Age―the individual’s age recorded at the date of ART initiation
    Sex―the sex recorded at the date of ART start

    Year―the year of ART initiation
    Evidence of prior HIV care–having had CD4 count tests done prior to the date of ART start

Outcomes
Three outcome variables were measured:

1. The proportion of the cohort who achieved CD4 immune recovery to: i) 200 cells/µl, ii) 350
     cells/µl, and iii) 500 cells/µl. This was calculated as the number of individuals whose CD4
     count at ART initiation was below the specified threshold and who in subsequent follow up
     had one or more CD4 count results greater than the specified threshold, as a proportion of
     all individuals whose CD4 count at initiation was below the specified threshold.

2. The time to CD4 count recovery in months. This was calculated using Kaplan-Meir survival
     analysis techniques. Individuals exited on achieving recovery. Those who did not achieve
     recovery were right censored (the last follow-up date was either the date of the last CD4
     count test or of the last viral load test result, whichever came later).

3. The extent of CD4 count recovery in the first 12 months of ART. This was measured by
     estimating the slope (coefficient) of CD4 count recovery using random effects panel
     regression and was restricted to the first 12 months of follow up. This was because the
     extent of CD4 count recovery typically is greater in the first 12 months on ART than in
     subsequent periods.

Data Analysis
Once the data were linked to unique individuals, it was exported to Stata version 12 (Stata Corp.,
College Station, Texas, USA) for analysis. The characteristics of individuals at cohort entry were
described using medians and interquartile ranges for continuous variables and as proportions
for categorical data.

    Estimating the proportion of individuals who ever achieved CD4 recovery to different
     thresholds
     The number of individuals who had CD4 recovery to a specific threshold was divided by the
     total number of individuals who initiated ART below that threshold. The chi-squared test
     was used to test the significance of any differences in the proportions achieving immune
     recovery across provinces, age categories, gender, year of ART initiation, and CD4 count
     categories at ART initiation. Modified-Poisson regression models with robust error variance
     were used to estimate the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the
     association between the different factors and the probability of CD4 count recovery to the
     different thresholds. Likelihood ratio tests were used to determine which factors were
     independently associated with CD4 recovery to the given thresholds. We carried out
     sensitivity analyses of the proportions who achieved CD4 count recovery to 200 cells/µl for
     those who were virally suppressed and for a group of participants whose names, gender
     and dates of births were exact matches for all CD4 count and viral load tests (in order to test
     the sensitivity of the results to the possibility of over-linking by the probabilistic linking
     algorithm).

    Estimating time to CD4 recovery
     The time to CD4 count recovery was determined using survival analysis techniques, as the
     time in months between the date of ART initiation and the date of exit from the cohort.
     Individuals exited the cohort at the date of the first CD4 count higher than the specified
     threshold or at the date of the latest CD4 count or viral load if there was no CD4 count
     recovery to the specified threshold. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted and the log-
     rank test used to compare differences in the time to CD4 count recovery across different
     sub-groups by age, gender, year of ART initiation, CD4 count category at ART initiation, and

                                                                                         Background   |7
     province. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine factors associated
     with time to recovery.

    Estimating the extent of immune recovery during follow up
     Random effects panel data regression was used to estimate the coefficients (slope)
     associated with CD4 count changes in the first 12 months (+/- three months) of ART. These
     coefficients estimated the extent of CD4 recovery per day of follow up using a random
     effects model. The extent of CD4 count recovery in the first 12 months was determined by
     sex, age, CD4 count at ART initiation, and the presence of viral suppression by the end of
     follow up.

8 Determinants of CD4 immune recovery among individuals on antiretroviral therapy in South Africa
FINDINGS

Description of the Population
From 3,977,761 unique individuals who had at least one viral load test and one CD4 count test
captured in the CDW database between January 2000 and March 2015, 1,070,900 (26.9%)
individuals met the criteria for inclusion in the cohort. Figure 2 shows the numbers of
individuals who were excluded from the analysis and the reasons for the exclusions. Compared
to individuals included in the cohort, the individuals excluded from the cohort were more likely
to be male (33.3% vs. 30.1%), older (median 46 years [IQR 38–55 years] vs. 44 years [IQR 37–52
years]), have a higher median nadir (lowest ever) CD4 count (200 cells/µl vs. 167 cells/µl) and
less likely to be from KwaZulu-Natal Province (22% vs. 31.9%).

The individuals included in the cohort were from all nine
provinces in the country. The 1871 (0.17%) individuals for
whom a province could not be assigned were included in the
                                                                               Of the individuals

The number of individuals by province ranged from 17,451
(1.6%) for the Northern Cape (NC) to 341,180 (31.9%) for
                                                                        919,649 (85.9%) were
KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). The median duration of follow up was            virally suppressed by the
24 months (IQR 12.2–36.9 months) for the full cohort and
ranged from 20.9 months in Limpopo (LP) to 25.3 months in
                                                                                 end of follow up.
the Western Cape (WC). Almost a quarter of the population
(24.7%) had duration of follow up of less than 12 months. The median number of CD4 count
measurements post ART initiation (including the one at ART initiation) was 3 (IQR 2–4). Table 2
shows the distribution of demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals included in the
analysis by province.

The estimated median CD4 count at ART initiation was 213 cells/µl (IQR 117–324 cells/µl), and
ranged from a median of 187 cells/µl in Gauteng (GP) to 234 cells/µl in KZN (Table 3). Overall,
the proportion of individuals who started ART with CD4 counts <200 cells/µl was highest in GP
at 53.8% and lowest in KZN at 41.9%; and decreased over time from 58% in 2010 to 36% in
2014. The estimated median CD4 count at ART start was higher among females than males (231
cells/µl vs. 175 cells/µl), and among those who had one or more CD4 counts done prior to the
estimated date of ART start―suggesting pre-ART monitoring or prior ART use―than among
those without prior CD4 counts (243 cells/µl vs. 185 cells/µl). Consistent with the increased
coverage of HIV counselling and testing from HIV Counselling and Testing (HCT) campaigns, the
median CD4 count at initiation increased with calendar year―from 177 cells/µl in 2010 to 271
cells/µl in 2014. Table 3 also shows that CD4 count at ART initiation decreased with increasing
age of the patient from a median of 249 cells/µl among youth aged 15–24 years to 199 cells/µl
among individuals 50 years or older.

Of the individuals included in the analysis, 919,649 (85.9%) were virally suppressed by the end
of follow up. Individuals who were virally suppressed by the end of follow up were less likely to
be male (29.6 % vs. 32.8%), more likely to be older than 40 years (68% vs. 60%), more likely to
have initiated ART in 2012 or earlier (70.4% vs. 56.5%) and more likely to have initiated ART

with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/µl (46.9% vs. 44.9%). Virally suppressed individuals were
also less likely to have evidence of prior HIV care (49.2% vs. 54.7%) when compared to those
who were not virally suppressed by the end of follow up.

Among the individuals included in the cohort, 740 468 (69%) were eligible for inclusion in the
exact match dataset (the dataset of individuals whose names, dates of birth and gender were
exact matches across CD4 count and viral load results). The individuals in the exact match
dataset were similar to those not included in the complete dataset with respect to demographic
characteristics and CD4 count at ART initiation. However, the individuals in the exact match
dataset differed from those included in the complete dataset as a result of the linking algorithm
by being more likely to be from KZN (45.6% vs. 1.1%); to be virally suppressed (88.5% vs. 80%)
and to have longer duration of follow up (median 25.5 months vs. 19.8 months). However, they
were less likely to have evidence of prior HIV care (47.1% vs. 56.2%).


CD4 Count Recovery to 200 cells/µl
Absolute CD4 count recovery to 200 cells/ µl
From the 1,070,900 individuals included in the cohort,
498,785 (46.6%) had a CD4 <200 cells/µl at ART initiation
and were therefore eligible for inclusion in the analysis of
                                                                     Overall, 80% of those who

at ART initiation in this group was 110 cells/µl (IQR 57–
157 cells/µl). Of the 498,785 individuals, 397,475 (79.7%)
                                                                           <200 cells/µl achieved

at ART initiation, and year of ART initiation. Generally the
proportion with CD4 count recovery to 200 cells/µl was lowest in LP, among males, among those
≥50 years, among those who started ART in the latter years―2013 and 2014 (due to shorter
duration of follow up), and among those with CD4 counts <50 cells/µl at ART initiation. The
proportion of males ≥50 years with CD4 counts <50 cells/µl at ART initiation from LP (n=1503,
0.3 %) who had CD4 count recovery beyond 200 cells/µl was 50.3 % compared to the national
average of 79.7%. In a multivariable Poisson model adjusting for the effect of age, sex, CD4 count
category at ART initiation, year of ART initiation, duration of follow up, viral suppression by the
end of follow up, and province, all variables were independently associated with CD4 recovery to
200 cells/µl (Table 5). Compared to those aged 25–34 years, the relative risk of CD4 recovery to
200 cells/µl was 3–7% lower among older age groups (p<0.001) but 5% higher among those
aged 15–24 years. The risk of CD4 recovery to 200 cells/µl was 7% lower among males than
females, 0–3 % lower in other provinces compared to KZN, 7–30% lower among those who had
CD4 counts <150 cells/µl at ART initiation compared to those with >=150 cells/µl. Risk of
recovery to 200 cells/µl was 1% higher among those initiating ART in the years 2011–2013 than
in 2010, 29–53% higher among those with more than 12 months of follow up than those with 12
months or less and 69% higher among those who achieved viral suppression at any point during
follow up.

In the district level analysis, the proportion of individuals with CD4 count recovery to 200
cells/µl ranged from 65.7% in Central Karoo District, WC to 86.5% in Umkhanyakude DM, KZN

(Table 6). Of the 52 districts, 33 (63.4%) had CD4 recovery rates which were lower than the
national average of 79.7%.

In an analysis restricted to individuals who were virally suppressed by the end of follow up
(430,837/498,785), the overall proportion of participants who recovered to 200 cells/µl was
85.3% (367,575/ 430,837). Table 7 shows the distribution of CD4 count recovery beyond 200
cells/µl among those who had viral suppression by the end of follow-up. The proportion of
individuals who recovered to 200 cells/µl was higher among females than males, decreased with
increasing age and year of starting ART (because of reduced duration of follow up), and
increased with increasing CD4 count at ART initiation. In a multivariable Poisson regression
model adjusting for the effects of sex, age, CD4 count at ART initiation, year of starting ART, and
duration of follow up (Table 8), the relative risk of CD4 count recovery was 6% lower among
males than females, 2–6% lower among those aged 35 years or older compared to those aged
25–34 years, 5–25% lower among those with CD4 counts less than 150 cells/µl at ART initiation
compared to those with CD4 counts of 150–199 cells/µl at ART initiation (which may be due
partly to the fact they are closer to the ‘threshold of recovery’) , 1–7% lower among those who
initiated ART in the years 2011–2014 compared to 2015, and 1–4% lower among those from
other provinces compared to KZN. The relative risk for CD4 recovery to 200 cells/µl increased
with increasing duration on ART. In the district level analysis (see Table 6) of CD4 recovery
among those who were virally suppressed, the proportions who had CD4 count recovery to 200
cells/µl ranged from 74.6% in Central Karoo District, WC to 90.4% in Umkhanyakude DM, KZN;
24 districts had recovery rates below the national average of 85.3%.

The proportion of eligible individuals in the exact match dataset
(350,808/ 498,785, 70.3%) who had CD4 count recovery to 200

Time to recovery was generally longer in males (p<0.001),
increased with age (p<0.001), and increased by calendar year
(p<0.001) with the exception of 2014, likely reflecting the limited duration of follow up among
those who initiated ART in 2014. The time to recovery decreased with increasing CD4 count at
ART initiation from a median of 12.6 months among those with CD4 counts <50 cells/µl to 8.2
months among those with CD4 counts of 150–199 cells/µl. Time to recovery was longer among
those who were not virally suppressed by the end of follow up compared to those who were
(10.3 months [IQR 7.0–17.2 months] vs. 9.4 months [IQR 6.4–14.5 months], p<0.001). Figures 3
and 4 show the Kaplan-Meir curves of time to recovery by sex, age, year of ART initiation, and
CD4 count at ART initiation for all individuals eligible for CD4 count recovery to 200 cells/µl and
among those who were virally suppressed by the end of follow up. The curves show that the
time to recovery varied more with CD4 count at ART initiation and virological suppression, than
the other variables. Table 9 also shows the times to CD4 recovery beyond 200 cells/µl by
province, sex, age category, year of ART initiation, and CD4 count at ART initiation for all those
eligible. Table 10 shows the hazard ratios associated with the risk of recovery to CD4 count of
200 cells among all those eligible. The analyses highlight the lower likelihood of CD4 count
recovery to 200 cells/µl with decreasing CD4 count at ART initiation, increasing age, and among

males; and the higher likelihood with viral suppression and ART initiation in the more recent
calendar years, even after adjusting for length of follow up. Tables 11 and 12 present the
corresponding data for the sub-group who were virally suppressed. Across all the sub-groups
(age, sex, CD4 count at ART initiation, and year of ART initiation), time to recovery was generally
shorter among those virally suppressed. Among the virally suppressed, the likelihood of CD4
count recovery to 200 cells/µl was lower with decreasing CD4 count at ART initiation, with
increasing age, and among males, but increased across calendar years after 2010.

At the district level, the median time to CD4 count recovery beyond 200 cells/µl among all
eligible individuals ranged from a median of 8.4 months in Zululand District, KZN to 11.5 months
in Sedibeng District, GP. Twenty-five of the 52 districts (48%) had median times to recovery
longer than the national average. Among those who were virally suppressed, the median time to
recovery ranged from 8.2 months in Uthukela District, KZN to 11.5 months in Sedibeng District,
GP (see Table 6).


CD4 Count Recovery to 350 Cells/µl
Absolute CD4 count recovery to 350 cells/ µl
Because virological suppression was so strongly correlated with likelihood of CD4 count
recovery to 200 cells/ µl, the analysis of CD4 count recovery to 350 cells/µl was restricted to
individuals with evidence of virological suppression during follow up. There were 752,742
individuals (81.9 %) who had a CD4 count <350 cells/µl at ART initiation and achieved viral
suppression by the end of follow up. Their median CD4 count at ART initiation was 179 cells/µl
(IQR 100– 258 cells/µl). Of this group, 514,333 (68.3 %) had absolute CD4 recovery to 350
cells/µl (Table 13). The proportion with CD4 count recovery to 350 cells/µl was highest in KZN
(71.7%) and lowest in GP (64.9%), (X2 p-value <0.001). The overall proportion with recovery to
350 cells/µl was lower among males than females (56.4% vs. 74.0%, X2 p-value <0.001),
increased with increasing CD4 count at ART initiation (from 39.1% among those with CD4
counts <50 cells/µl to 85.2% among those with CD4 counts
200–349 cells/µl (p<0.001), and decreased with increasing
age (79.6% and 80.3% in the 15–24 and 25–35 years groups                        68% of those who
compared to 69% and 61.2% among the 35–49 year olds and              initiated ART with a CD4
50 years or older group, X2 p-value <0.001), and decreased
with year of ART initiation after 2010 (from 76.5% for 2010 to         count <350 cells/µl and
47.1% in 2014). The proportion of males older than 50 years                      who were virally
from GP who had CD4 counts <50 cells/µl at ART initiation
(n=4525, 0.6%) whose CD4 count recovered to 350 cells/µl                   suppressed achieved
was 23.7% (compared to the national average of 68.3%).                 recovery to 350 cells/µl

adjusted relative risks of CD4 recovery to 350 cells/µl were:

provinces compared to KZN, 1–4% lower among those who initiated ART in 2011, 2013 or2014
compared to 2010, 7–15% lower among those aged 35 years or older compared to those aged
25–34 years, 26–54% lower among those with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/µl at initiation
compared to CD4 counts 200–349 cells/µl at ART initiation, and 37–97% higher among those
with durations of follow up greater than 12 months compared to 12 months or less. The
proportion of individuals with CD4 recovery to 350 cells/µl at district level ranged from 61.5%
in the City of Johannesburg district to 78.2% in Umkhanyakude DM in KZN (see Table 6). Of the
52 districts, 25 (48%) had recovery rates lower than the national average of 68.3%.

12 Determinants of CD4 immune recovery among individuals on antiretroviral therapy in South Africa
Time to CD4 count recovery to 350 cells/ µl
The median time to CD4 count recovery beyond 350 cells/µl was 12.4 months (IQR 7.9–22.9
months) nationally (Table 15). The median time to recovery beyond 350 cells/µl in the provinces
ranged from 11.6 months in NW to 13.5 months in WC. Time to recovery beyond 350 cells/µl
was longer in males than females (13.7 months vs. 11.9 months, p<0.001), increased with age
(from 10.3 months among those aged <25–34 years to 13.4 months among those ≥50 years,
p<0.001) and decreased over calendar year of ART initiation (from 16.9 months for 2010 to 7.4
months for 2014, p<0.001) and with CD4 count at ART initiation (from a median of 19.8 months
among those with CD4 count <50 cells/µl to 10.0 months among those with CD4 count 200–349
cells/µl) (see Figure 5). The median time of recovery to CD4 count >350 cells/µl varied from 10.9
months in Vhembe District, LP to 14.7 months in Central Karoo District, WC, with 23 (44.2%)
districts having median recovery times longer than the national average of 12.4 months (Table
6). Table 16 shows the hazard ratios associated with different factors. The risk of CD4 count
recovery was lower with decreasing CD4 counts at ART initiation, with increasing age, among
males, and better for more recent calendar years of initiation compared to 2010(likely reflecting
the increased CD4 count at ART initiation).


CD4 Count Recovery to 500 Cells/ µl
Absolute CD4 count recovery to 500 cells/µl
As was the case with the analysis of CD4 count recovery to 350 cells/µl, the analysis of absolute
CD4 count recovery to 500 cells/µl was also restricted to individuals who had viral suppression
by the end of follow up. Of 844,699 individuals (78.9%) who had a CD4 count <500 cells/µl at
ART initiation and were virally suppressed by the end of follow up (median CD4 count 196
cells/µl [IQR 111–290 cells/µl]), 374,874 (44.4%) achieved a CD4 count >500 cells/µl in follow
up. The proportion with CD4 count recovery to 500 cells/µl was highest in KZN (48.8%) and
lowest in GP (40.1 %) (X2 p-value <0.001). As seen with absolute recovery to 200 cells/µl and
350 cells/µl, the overall proportions with recovery to 500 cells/µl were lower among males than
females (31.1% compared 50.4%), decreased with increasing age (59.1% in 25–34 year olds to
37.1% in those 50 years or older) and more recent year of initiation (from 53.5% in 2010 to
27.6% in 2014), and increased with higher CD4 count at ART
initiation (from 19.6% among those with CD4 counts <50
cells/µl to 69.9% among those with CD4 counts 350–499                          44% of those who

recovered to 500 cells/µl was 9.4% among males ≥ 50 years
with CD4 count <50 cells/µl from GP (n=4525 [0.5%])                    count <500 cells/µl and
compared to 44.4% nationally. Table 18 shows the relative                        who were virally

age, sex, year of ART initiation, CD4 count at ART initiation,              suppressed achieved
duration of follow up, and province. The adjusted relative risk        recovery to 500 cells/µl
of recovery was 26% lower among males than females, 15–
26% lower among those aged ≥35 years compared to those                       in a median of 17.3
aged 25–34 years, 19–71% lower among those with CD4                                          months.
counts <350 cells/µl at initiation compared to 350–499
cells/µl at initiation, and 2–10% lower among those from
other provinces compared to KZN. The relative risks of recovery were 4–7% higher among those
who initiated ART in the years 2012–14 compared to 2010, 6% higher among individuals aged
15–24 years compared to those aged 25–34 years, and 55–300% higher among those with a
duration of follow up greater than 12 months compared to 12 months or less. At the district level
the proportion of individuals who had CD4 recovery to 500 cells/µl varied from 36.6% in the
City of Johannesburg, GP to 59.2% in Umkhanyakude DM, KZN. Of the 52 districts, 28 (53.8%)
had recovery rates below the national average of 44.4% (Table 6).



                                                                                     Findings   | 13
In an analysis restricted to 53 485 women aged 15–49 years who initiated ART with CD4 counts
>=350 cells/µl―likely to be PMTCT candidates who would have started ART at higher CD4
counts (6.3% of the full sample), 73.7% recovered their CD4 counts to more than 500 cells/µl
compared to 42.4% for the rest of the study population.

Time to CD4 count recovery to 500 cells/ µl
The median time to CD4 count recovery beyond 500 cells/µl was 17.3 months (IQR 10.0–29.6
months). This varied from 15.6 months in Limpopo Province to 19.3 months in the Western Cape
Province (Table 19). Time to recovery was longer in males (19.0 months vs. 16.6 months,
p<0.001), increased with age (from 13.5 months in 15–24 years to 19.2 months in those aged
≥50 years, p<0.001) and decreased with more recent year of ART initiation from 31.3 months
among those who started in 2010 to 7.7 months among those who started in 2014 (p<0.001),
likely reflecting the increase in the CD4 count at ART initiation by calendar year (from 178
cells/µl in 2010 to 260 cells/µl in 2014) and despite the limited duration of follow up among the
individuals who started in the latter years (Figure 6). Table 20 shows the hazard ratios for CD4
count recovery to 500 cells/µl associated with age, sex, year of ART initiation, CD4 count at ART
initiation, and province. The risk of CD4 count recovery to 500 cells/µl was also lower among
males, decreased with increasing age above 35 years and with decreasing CD4 count at ART
initiation and increased with more recent calendar year reflecting increased CD4 counts at ART
initiation. The median time to CD4 count recovery beyond 500 cells/µl ranged from 13.4 months
in Harry Gwala District to 22.6 months in West Coast District in WC (Table 6). Twenty eight
(53.8%) districts had median recovery times longer than the national average of 17.3 months.

14 Determinants of CD4 immune recovery among individuals on antiretroviral therapy in South Africa
DISCUSSION

General discussion
This report describes the proportions of eligible individuals in a study cohort using laboratory
test data who attained absolute CD4 count recovery to 200 cells/µl, 350 cells/µl and 500 cells/µl,
the median time to reach these thresholds of CD4 recovery across the provinces, age categories,
sex, and calendar year of ART initiation, as well as the extent of CD4 recovery in the first twelve
months following ART initiation. Of the 498 785 individuals with CD4 counts less than to 200
cells/µl at ART initiation, 79.7% attained CD4 recovery to 200 cells/µl in a median time of 9.5
months. The proportions of eligible individuals with CD4 count recovery to 200, 350 and 500
cells/µl were higher among those who had viral suppression during follow up, with 85.3%,
68.3% and 44.4% achieving recovery in a median of 9.4, 12.4 and 17.3 months respectively. The
proportions with CD4 count recovery varied with CD4 count at ART initiation, age, sex, and year
of ART initiation. Across all CD4 count thresholds, CD4 recovery was lower among males and
decreased with increasing age. The time to recovery was longer among males and increased with
increasing age. The extent of recovery in the first year on treatment was less among older
people and males and greater among those with lower CD4 counts at ART initiation.

Our findings on the factors associated with immune recovery among those who have attained
virological suppression were consistent with results reported in other studies from sub-Saharan
Africa and elsewhere. Studies have shown that lack of virological suppression is associated with
poor immunological recovery, while poor immune recovery in the presence of virological
suppression is associated with low nadir CD4 counts and low CD4 counts at ART initiation, (15, 16)
with older age, and with being male. (19–22) Almost 50% of our study cohort had a CD4 count <
200 cells/µl at ART initiation, in an era when the threshold for initiating ART was higher. The
data show that despite the increase in CD4 count thresholds for eligibility, a significant
proportion of people living with HIV still initiate ART late. More needs to be done to ensure that
more people living with HIV, especially men, are tested for HIV early in the course of infection
and are successfully linked and maintained in care.

A few studies from South Africa have looked at the extent of immune recovery during the first
year on treatment. Greater extent of CD4 count recovery has been found among those with
lower CD4 counts at ART initiation, in adolescents compared to older adults, and among adult
females compared to adult males.(21–23) Lawn et al. reported a CD4 recovery of 25
cells/µl/month (equivalent to 300 cells/µl during the first 12 months) among adults with a
median CD4 count of 97 cells/µl at ART initiation (25), while Hoffmann et al. found a rate of 1.4
cells/µl/week in the first 4–48 weeks of treatment (equivalent to 73 cells/µl over 12 months) in
a cohort with a median CD4 count of 112 cells/µl.(34) Our estimated extent of CD4 count
recovery of 15 cells/µl/month or 3.5 cells/µl/week (183 cells/µl over 12 months for CD4 counts
50–200 cells/µl at ART initiation) were somewhat comparable to those reported in these
studies. Estimating the extent of CD4 recovery is important as slow CD4 recovery early in the
course of ART has been shown to predict later delayed immunological response or non-response
(35), which are in turn associated with increased morbidity and mortality on ART.

A better understanding of the factors associated with sub-optimal immune recovery in the
context of the South African National ART programme will assist with identifying patients who
need additional interventions to support and improve immune recovery. Older males and those
with low CD4 counts (< 200 cells/µl) could be prioritised for screening for co-infections and
initiation of appropriate prophylactic treatment, initiation of ART, and continued CD4 count
monitoring. In addition, interventions to ensure that individuals initiated on ART adhere to
treatment need to be strengthened and targeted to those most at risk of sub-optimal recovery–
older males and those with low CD4 counts at ART initiation. As a low CD4 count at ART
initiation was a strong predictor of immunological recovery during the first year among those
virally suppressed, interventions could also be targeted to districts whose unique socio-
economic circumstances may be associated with sub-optimal linkage to care (as measured by
higher proportions of individuals initiating ART at CD4 counts <200 cells/µl) and retention in
care.

Recently, there have been suggestions that continued CD4
count monitoring among virologically suppressed                  A significant proportion of
individuals may not be necessary in an era of increasing
availability of viral load monitoring, and that reducing the     individuals did not achieve
frequency of or doing away with CD4 count monitoring for        CD4 count recovery during
stable ART patients may free up resources to put more
people on ART.(36, 37) However, a CD4 count measurement               follow up. Such persons

individuals with low CD4 counts who require prophylactic
treatments and also to monitor the effectiveness of HIV            CD4 count monitoring to
testing and linkage to care interventions. The significant                   guide decisions on

recovery in our cohort (for instance, 14.7% of those with                            prophylaxis.

who will continue to require prophylaxis for opportunistic infections until immunological
recovery occurs as they are at greater risk for AIDS-related morbidity. Continued CD4 count
monitoring allows these individuals to be identified and managed accordingly and may reduce
excess morbidity and mortality, making CD4 count monitoring more cost effective than viral load
monitoring alone. (38) Also, persistently low median CD4 counts at ART initiation may suggest
lack of timely testing and linkage to care and can be used to identify areas and groups where
efforts to increase timely linkage to care are needed.


Limitations
This analysis used laboratory data linked to unique individuals through the use of a probabilistic
matching algorithm to create a cohort and determine CD4 recovery outcomes. There are some
limitations to this kind of analysis. First, the accuracy of the cohort data depends on the
performance of the algorithm used to link CD4 count and viral load data to unique individuals,
and on the completeness of data in the database. The algorithm used to construct the cohort had
a sensitivity of 89% and a positive predictive value of 85%, which means it matched correctly for
the majority of individuals in the cohort. The proportion of individuals with CD4 count recovery
to 200 cells/µl in a group of individuals whose CD4 count and viral load data were exact matches
was similar to that obtained in the analysis of the full cohort (81% compared to 79.7%). It is
unlikely that the performance of the matching algorithm affected our findings, although there
may be residual bias from under-matching in the exact match dataset. Second, strict eligibility
criteria were applied. The resultant cohort included only 27% of all unique individuals in the
initial database. This may have resulted in selection bias and may limit the extent to which these
findings can be generalised to all individuals enrolled in the CCMT programme in South Africa.
The comparison of demographic and clinical characteristics of those excluded to those included

suggests that those excluded would likely have lower and slower recovery rates as they were
more likely to be male and older, although they had higher nadir CD4 counts. Third, guidance on
the frequency of CD4 count monitoring changed between 2010 and 2014. From 2010–2011, CD4
count measurements were taken at ART initiation, at 6 months, 12 months, and annually
thereafter; whereas from 2012 onwards, CD4 count measurements were taken at ART initiation
then at 12 months and annually or as indicated thereafter. This meant that fewer individuals in
the later years had a baseline CD4 count and at least one other CD4 count. Also, individuals who
initiated ART in the latter years were less likely to be included as they had limited follow up time.
In addition, the assumptions in the analysis are sensitive to guideline adherence by clinicians.
Differences in the extent to which facilities adhered to the guidelines on CD4 count and viral load
monitoring could cause variability across provinces and districts with respect to eligibility to
enter the cohort and in the number of CD4 counts in follow up. It is known that the proportions
of individuals on ART who have viral loads done at 6 months or 12 months varies substantially
across districts, sub-districts and facilities. (33) Fourth, the actual ART start dates for the cohort
were not known but were inferred from the dates of the baseline CD4 counts which were in turn
estimated from the date of the first viral load test. We may have overestimated the values of the
CD4 count at the start of ART by including people who were already on ART as newly initiated on
ART. Fifth, because the data used all came from laboratories, there were no data on deaths or
retention in care. The individuals included in this cohort were therefore those who survived and
were retained in care long enough to have CD4 count tests done. The absence of data on people
who died or had no test results during the study period limits the extent to which the data on
CD4 recovery can be used to assess performance across districts or provinces. Longer time to
recovery may be a positive sign in some cases as it means patients are surviving and included in
laboratory monitoring (especially relevant for very late ART initiations). Last, there was wide
variation in the numbers of eligible individuals included at provinces, district and sub-districts,
with very small numbers from some provinces and districts. This may in part account for the
wide variations in rates of recovery and time to recovery.

Despite these limitations, the construction and use of a laboratory data-based cohort is a novel
approach which allows HIV programmes with limited use of electronic medical records but good
laboratory information systems to use existing data to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of
their programmes. This analysis, which to our knowledge is the first to look at immunological
recovery at the national level, provides insight into the extent of CD4 count recovery within the
CCMT programme in South Africa and may be useful in informing proposed changes to ART
treatment monitoring guidelines. The findings from this laboratory data cohort analysis could be
validated through sentinel surveillance for HIV care and
treatment or through the analysis of programme data once the
set up and introduction of an electronic medical record with a

of any future analyses of CD4 count recovery using the CDW             need to be strengthened

monitoring. Currently, the guideline recommends CD4 count

Conclusions
This report describes the proportions of eligible individuals who achieved CD4 count recovery to
200 cells/µl and of virally suppressed individuals who achieved absolute CD4 count recovery

beyond 200, 350 and 500 cells/µl, the median times to recovery beyond these thresholds, and
the extent of recovery during the first twelve months of treatment. Over the five year period
included in the study, almost half of the cohort initiated ART at CD4 counts <200 cells/µl. The
proportions that had absolute CD4 recovery were lower among older males, those with lower
CD4 count at ART initiation, and those with no virological suppression by the end of follow up.
There is a need to identify HIV-positive individuals earlier, initiate ART earlier, improve
adherence to ART and retention in care in order to improve CD4 recovery on ART. Secondary
analysis of large sets of routine data and novel approaches in record linkage (sometimes referred
to as big data) can contribute to better targeting and more efficient implementation of the South
African ART programme.
