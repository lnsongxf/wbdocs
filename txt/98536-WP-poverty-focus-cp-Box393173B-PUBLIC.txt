Overview
Highlights
The World Bank Group in 2013 made the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030 a
central institutional focus and purpose. This evaluation examines how, and how
well, the Bank Group has focused its support on poverty reduction over the past
decade, and what lessons to draw from this moving forward. The lessons aim to
strengthen the Bank’s country diagnostics, improve the design of country
strategies, and build greater learning opportunities from program experience.
Using country case studies, surveys, focus group meetings, systematic reviews of
Bank products, and other instruments, the evaluation examines the consistency of
poverty focus in each of four links in a causal chain: data, diagnostics, strategy
formulation, and strategy implementation through lending and nonlending
instruments. It reviews the adequacy of the information base and usefulness of the
analytical underpinnings that support country strategy formulation and
implementation. It also evaluates the consistency of the poverty focus throughout
the evaluation chain and the strength and weakness of feedback loops.
The evaluation finds that the Bank’s work on data and diagnostics was generally
robust, but with significant gaps in coverage and timeliness. Areas that require
attention include improving country coverage and data capacity, reflecting the
findings of the diagnostics in country strategy formulation, enhancing the
consistency of the poverty focus in strategy implementation, and strengthening
monitoring and feedback loops. Three main findings emerge.
 Creating knowledge. The World Bank provides an important public good in
  supporting and reporting global poverty data, and producing high-quality
  poverty diagnostics. The Bank can better perform this role by investing more
  in sustainable data collection and by adopting data reporting standards as a
  part of its mission. On diagnostics, it should strengthen analysis of institutional
  issues and sociopolitical constraints, and improve the actionability of policy
  recommendations.
 Understanding context. The Bank operates in a complex environment, and the
  choice of portfolio is conditioned by the strategic focus of a government client
  as well as the Bank’s comparative advantage. The government commitment to
  poverty reduction is a key factor in the fidelity between implementation and
  the formulated country strategy. When a country is not fully committed to
  poverty reduction, the Bank often faces a tough choice between disengaging
  from significant lending or engagement in areas that may be only tangentially
  related to poverty reduction. High-quality and timely diagnostics, policy

      dialogue, and technical assistance should help identify entry points and lay the
      groundwork for greater impact.
  Leveraging resources. Given the small size of Bank resources relative to the
   economies it seeks to influence, the effectiveness of Bank interventions in
   helping clients reduce poverty will increasingly depend on how it uses
   instruments as pilots and as catalysts to leverage resources from development
   partners and other stakeholders. Strengthening the complementarity among
   diagnostic work, technical assistance, and lending instruments, and among
   policy and investment lending instruments, can help to scale up efforts and
   achieve more sustainable, long-term impact.

OVERVIEW


 Box 1. Defining Poverty Focus of Bank Interventions
 Poverty is the result of economic, political, and social processes that interact and frequently
 reinforce each other in ways that exacerbate the deprivation in which poor people live (World
 Bank 2010e). It is well recognized that poverty eradication depends on both stimulating growth
 and providing basic social services to the poor (World Bank 1990). Many of the Bank’s
 interventions can be considered relevant to poverty in some way. However, defining the
 poverty focus and the degree to which development support contributes to poverty outcomes
 is not straightforward. Some interventions, such as for safety nets, may contribute directly and
 immediately to reducing income poverty; others, such as support for education, may do so
 with a long lag; and still others, such as improvements to the investment climate, may
 contribute indirectly or only in the presence of other policies or dynamics in the economy.
 It is beyond the scope of this evaluation to examine the impact of Bank-supported
 interventions on poverty reduction through all channels. Instead, the evaluation groups the
 Bank’s interventions into two broad categories—directly or indirectly focused on poverty
 reduction. Direct poverty focus is broadly defined as the activities that are designed and
 implemented to target or provide a disproportionate first-round benefit to the poorer segment
 of the population. This rough measure is indicative of strategic emphasis but no normative
 conclusion should be drawn from the relative weights.
 The evaluation recognizes that the links between Bank interventions and poverty reduction are
 complex and country-specific, and the Bank faces trade-offs in selecting projects with direct
 linkages (such as social safety nets) or indirect linkages (such as financial reforms) with poverty
 reduction. It does not judge whether the interventions with direct poverty focus have stronger
 impact on poverty reduction than those with indirect poverty focus. The report does not make
 a normative statement of whether there should be a larger or smaller share of interventions
 directly or indirectly focusing on poverty reduction as the binding constraints vary across
 countries. Instead, it assesses the extent to which lending operations, technical assistance,
 capacity building, analytical work, and policy dialogue were focused on the direct type of
 poverty interventions as identified in the poverty diagnostics. Obviously the proper mix of
 direct and indirect interventions that maximizes their joint impact on poverty reduction is
 highly country specific.

Management Response
The World Bank commends the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) for this
evaluation of lessons and experience with the poverty focus of country programs.
This evaluation is timely. The new country engagement model, including the
Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) and the Country Partnership Framework
(CPF), aims to enhance the focus on the goals of eliminating extreme poverty and
promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable way, and should address various
findings and recommendations of the report. A strong SCD requires high-quality
data and greater use of evidence to guide policy dialogue and interventions.
Improving the poverty focus of World Bank Group programs thus remains an
ambitious task, but one that is well worth pursuing.

Management looks at the report as an opportunity to reflect on a number of
questions: (1) Why are data lacking in some countries but not in others? (2) Why has
diagnostic work influenced policy changes in some contexts but not in others? (3) How
important is the quality and relevance of analysis to the degree of success achieved? (4) How
important has client engagement been; and what is the role of Country Management Units
in this process? A better understanding of these issues would help strengthen the
Bank’s country diagnostics, improve the design of country strategies, ensure a more
evidence-based approach to the Bank’s programs and interventions, and increase
learning.


Specific Comments
Main findings of the IEG report. Management concurs with the main findings
related to (i) creating knowledge, (ii) understanding context, and (iii) leveraging
resources, and offers specific comments on these topics:

    •   Data collection and reporting. The Bank can improve its performance by
        investing in sustainable data collection and by adopting data reporting
        standards as a part of its mission.

    •   Poverty diagnostics. The Bank should strengthen analysis of institutional
        issues and sociopolitical constraints, and improve the actionability of policy
        recommendations.

    •   Strategy formulation. High-quality and timely diagnostics, policy dialogue,
        and technical assistance should help identify entry points and lay the
        groundwork for greater impact.


xxiii
   •   Strategy implementation. Strengthening complementarity among diagnostic
       work, technical assistance, and lending instruments, can help to scale up
       efforts and achieve more sustainable, long-term impact.

DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING
Criteria for selecting country case studies. The report would have benefited from
clearer criteria for selecting countries for case studies. The small sample of countries
is not representative. Management flagged this issue to the team at the Approach
Paper stage. Interpretation of the findings from such a small sample requires
caution.

Uneven progress across countries. Management acknowledges that data are often
scarce where challenges of poverty are most severe. For instance, this is the case in
many low-income countries and economies affected by fragility, conflict, and
violence.

Data accessibility. Management appreciates the report’s recognition of the need for
effective collaboration with partners to strengthen data quality and availability. The
report also notes the need to improve access to good-quality and timely data on
poverty to support an informed policy dialogue. The analysis of the current state of
data quality and availability is useful. The report mentions the Demographic and
Health Survey as significantly improving the international stock of high-quality,
comparable demographic, and health data. Similar improvements are necessary to
improve the quality of household income or consumption data. The report could
have explored how support for such efforts differs among development partners.
The IEG report is silent, for example, on the Bank’s approach to supporting the
collection of household survey data and how to balance international comparability
with national data needs.

Measuring the effectiveness of Bank interventions. As noted in the report, good data
are essential not only to identify the poor and their characteristics, but also to
measure progress. The report suggests “improving the actionability of policy
recommendations for poverty reduction and strengthening the linkages between
recommended actions and the expected impact on poverty.” This calls for more
disaggregated analytical work on the poor across spatial and other characteristics. In
spite of the positive assessment of the quality of diagnostics, and recent progress on
this front, the report also notes the variation in the quality of analysis and, at times, a
lack of actionable guidance. The report also notes issues with outcome measurement
and data limitations when trying to attribute poverty reduction outcomes to Bank-
supported interventions. Management broadly agrees with this analysis. The SCD
has been developed to address these issues, i.e., improving the quality of


xxiv
diagnostics, identifying data gaps as well as priority areas to achieve the Bank
Group’s goals, and creating demand for better data quality and poverty-focused
Bank interventions through the CPF process. The CPF will determine Bank Group
support based on the priorities identified through the SCD and client demand,
taking into account the Bank Group’s comparative advantage and complementarity
with other partners.

POVERTY DIAGNOSTICS
Addressing social and political factors. Management appreciates IEG’s recognition
that Bank poverty diagnostics are of high technical quality. Management agrees
there is significant room for improvement in analytical work to address social and
political constraints to poverty reduction. The Poverty and Social Impact Analysis is
one mechanism for doing this systematically. It is particularly useful for assessing
the impact of policy reforms. The SCD process also requires addressing social and
political impediments to poverty reduction and greater inclusion.

Alignment with policy cycle. The insufficient alignment between the timing of
analytic work with the policy cycle has been identified as a factor limiting strategic
impact on policy making. Management concurs with the recommendation to
improve programmatic planning to better align timing and dissemination of analytic
work to increase public awareness, transparency, and impact on policymaking.

STRATEGY FORMULATION
Political commitment to poverty. Management appreciates the assessment that the
Bank’s country strategies have addressed the overall objective of poverty reduction.
The report also notes that poverty-focused strategies have been more successful in
countries that have the requisite political commitment. The report highlights the
difficulty of pursuing a “poverty-focused” approach when there is a weak
government commitment to poverty reduction or a disagreement on priorities
between the Bank and government. Such differences limit the Bank’s options. It can
either disengage from major lending or limit engagement to politically feasible entry
points with the hope that a future government will be more committed to this
agenda. The report calls for more strategic use of lending and nonlending work or
more pilot work that can be scaled up under more favorable circumstances.
However, the dilemma the Bank often faces is not one necessarily based on
engagement with countries on poverty issues, but rather on the Bank’s added value
to the agenda. If a government chooses to emphasize approaches that aim at broader
“development” with mostly indirect (but perhaps large) impacts on poverty, the
report seems to suggest that this is a “lack of commitment” to the poverty agenda,




                                                                                  xxv
equivalent to a government where an elite directs investments to serve its own
interests. Management feels that these are fundamentally different situations.

Inclusive growth. Management recognizes the need to strengthen its focus on
inclusive growth by complementing the government’s own development strategy
and by paying greater attention to the challenges related to extreme poverty. This
need has been articulated in the Bank’s commitment to the goals through a more
selective and creative engagement with clients. The report puts considerable
emphasis on inequality and exclusion as challenges to development strategies.
Inclusiveness of the development process and the underlying institutional or
economic factors need more attention.

New engagement model. The report misses an important opportunity to discuss how
its recommendations relate to the Bank’s new, country engagement model. Overall,
the reference to the new context is minimal, despite its stated intention to “provide
analysis to improve the ways that SCDs can inform the CPFs to achieve the twin
goals.” Prioritizing country program interventions based on diagnostics is critical in
ensuring the poverty focus of country programs. The IEG recommendations could
have been better tuned to the new context, taking into consideration a more in-depth
analysis of past experience with poverty diagnostics underpinning country
programs.

STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION
Prioritization of poverty reduction by clients. Management welcomes the report’s
positive remarks regarding implementation of the Bank’s country strategies, which
reflect the poverty reduction and development priorities of client countries.
Management also agrees that there is room for better aligning strategy and
implementation. Management agrees that stronger analytic and advisory activities
may play an important role in shifting attention to poverty objectives and
identifying critical areas of engagement.

Balanced approach. The report says that in cases when growth is weak or uneven,
the Bank needs to balance its approach to broad-based and inclusive growth with its
approach to addressing poverty. The report recommends the Bank enhance the
coherence of country strategies by identifying an appropriate mix of interventions to
reduce poverty, including the sequencing of interventions to promote inclusive
growth and reach excluded communities. This recommendation is too general and
too broad. It is not clear how such recommendations can be implemented. The
report is not clear on its recommendations related to analytical tools for prioritizing
interventions.



xxvi
Catalytic interventions. Management welcomes the report’s emphasis on leveraging
the World Bank’s interventions, including using development policy lending to
influence the allocation of critical resources or crowding-in resources from the
public and private sectors.

Strengthening capacity. Management very much welcomes the report’s
recommendation to improve the capabilities of national statistics’ agencies. This is
critical for sustainable improvements in data quality.

Project-level monitoring and evaluation (M&E). Management agrees with IEG on
the importance of strengthening M&E at the project level. The report seems to
suggest, however, stronger links between project-level outcomes and poverty
reduction. While much needs to be done to sharpen the alignment of project
monitoring indicators to reflect intended outcomes at the right level of the results
chain, “poverty reduction” is usually a much higher level outcome than one project
can or should aim to attain.


Recommendations
The recommendations made in the report specify several constraints. Management
concurs with the challenge of improving data quality and availability and the need
to strengthen client capacity in this area. It also agrees with addressing the missing
links in the results chain—from data to solutions—in the Bank’s work with clients.
The report’s emphasis on the importance of political will and commitment within
client countries is welcome as are the insights on specific areas for improvement.
However, some of the recommendations provide guidance that is too generic and,
therefore, difficult to measure. The following Management Action Record matrix
contains the Management response to specific IEG findings and recommendations.

Chairperson’s Summary: Committee on
Development Effectiveness
The Committee on Development Effectiveness (CODE) met to discuss the
Independent Evaluation Group’s (IEG’s) evaluation on The Poverty Focus of Country
Programs and Draft Management Response. The Committee welcomed discussion of
the evaluation, which drew lessons aimed at strengthening the Bank’s country
diagnostics, improving the design of country strategies, and building greater
learning opportunities from program experience. Members emphasized that country
dialogue needs to be at the core of the World Bank Group’s work in the new country
engagement model, as previously noted in CODE and other fora. They underscored
the importance of listening to clients and ensuring the institution has the tools to be
adaptive, to ensure constructive country-focused dialogues, and to implement
selective country approaches. Members agreed with the necessity of high quality,
accessible, and timely data, particularly at the beginning of the results chain; of
addressing existing knowledge gaps; and of strong analytics and diagnostics. They
noted that evidence-based decision making is at the core of the institution’s goal to
be a solutions bank. Members supported the call for more effective collaboration
with partners to strengthen data quality and availability. Further, they emphasized
that the Bank Group needs to do more to build sustained capacity vis-à-vis
data/diagnostics in client countries, particularly in the International Development
Association’s context. Some commented that the Board needs more engagements
with Management on the data agenda. Members also agreed that early attention to
project evaluability should strengthen monitoring and evaluation planning and
execution. It was recognized that the Bank Group is still at an early stage in
implementing the country engagement model and, in many ways, the institution is
learning by doing, and the tools underpinning the Systematic Country Diagnostic
(SCD) and Country Partnership Framework (CPF) are being continually updated.

Members welcomed Management’s concurrence with the main findings. They
recognized that the new country engagement model, centered on the SCD and CPF,
addresses some of the issues covered by the recommendations. Members asked
Management to work with IEG in developing an action plan to address areas where
it may be difficult to implement the recommendations.

Several speakers also commented on the importance of enhancing the Bank Group’s
poverty focus. They noted the multidimensional nature of poverty, the differences in
poverty in low-income countries and middle-income countries, and accordingly the

1. Assessing the World Bank’s Poverty Focus
Reducing poverty has been a strategic objective of the World Bank Group since the
1970s, when President Robert S. McNamara first made it a priority. At the turn of
the millennium, President James D. Wolfensohn again stressed the importance of
this mandate. In 2013 President Jim Yong Kim extended this objective, setting two
goals (the “twin goals”) to reduce extreme poverty to 3 percent of the world
population by 2030 and, for the first time, including a distributional goal, to “share
prosperity” by promoting the income growth of the poorest 40 percent.

Over the past quarter century, and particularly since the advent of the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) in 2001, the world’s rapid economic growth
significantly reduced rates of extreme poverty and improved social indicators in
many developing countries. A major milestone was accomplishing the first MDG—
to halve the 1990 level of extreme poverty by 2015—five years early, lifting some 700
million people out of poverty. Globally, the proportion of people living in extreme
poverty fell from 43 percent in 1990 to 19 percent in 2010, and further to 17 percent
in 2011 (figure 1.1).

Despite this progress, about 1 billion people still live in extreme poverty, and
progress has been extremely uneven across Regions, countries, and localities (figure
1.1). The number of extreme poor fell during 1990–2011 in all Regions except Sub-
Saharan Africa, where the number grew by more than 125 million, even as poverty
incidence fell from 57 percent to 47 percent. All Regions except Sub-Saharan Africa
are now expected to halve extreme poverty by 2015. Largely because of rapid
population growth, the Sub-Saharan share of the world’s poor swelled from 15
percent in 1990 to 42 percent in 2011.

Continuing success in reducing extreme poverty will become more difficult. Poverty
is becoming more concentrated geographically: as of 2011, 1 billion people still lived
in extreme poverty, with 415 million in Sub-Saharan Africa, 399 million in South
Asia, 158 million in East Asia and the Pacific, and the remaining 2 percent scattered
across the other Regions. About 17 percent of the world’s poor live in 36 fragile and
conflict-affected states (FCSs) (World Bank 2014a). 1 An additional 1.7 billion people
(or about 30 percent of the population in developing countries) are considered
vulnerable to falling into extreme poverty because they live on $1.25 to $2.50 a day.

Global poverty projections are highly sensitive to the underlying assumptions about
growth and changes in income distribution. According to Bank research, if
developing countries grow at the same annual average rate as they have during the
past 20 years, global poverty will remain at around 6.8 percent of the world
population in 2030 (World Bank 2014a). This implies that 202 million people (or 19
percent) in Africa, and a disproportionately high share of people in FCSs, will
continue to be trapped in poverty. And there is strong evidence that poverty
reduction becomes more difficult when the poverty rate is lower, because remote or
intractable populations are more costly to reach.

Achieving the Bank’s twin goals will require concerted action by developing
countries, the Bank, and other members of the development community. Under
plausible assumptions, growth alone will be insufficient to reach the targets, so new
solutions will be needed that go beyond stimulating growth. Distributional changes
will almost certainly be necessary to achieve the shared prosperity goal, 2 and
sustainable elimination of extreme poverty will need to address the distribution of
assets and asset returns. Meanwhile, the financial influence of the Bank Group and
other development partners has steadily decreased, dwarfed by much larger
international capital flows, mainly from the private sector. Official development
assistance (ODA) as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) is small and has

declined over time, particularly in International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) countries. Bank lending as a share of government spending is
also small, particularly in IBRD countries, and is further diminishing in most
developing countries.

Given their reduced financial influence and in the absence of major new
recapitalization of the multilateral development banks (MDBs), the World Bank and
other development finance institutions can scale up their efforts to reduce poverty
only by better leveraging their resources with government clients, global private
funds, and other capital flows to developing countries. The comparative advantages
of the Bank include its reputation for strong analytics, and its role as a “knowledge
bank” to provide intellectual leadership and use its analytical work to influence
policymaking.

But the Bank works with governments that vary in their political commitment to
poverty reduction and their base of domestic support. For this evaluation, political
economy concerns consist mainly of the government’s commitment to poverty
reduction, and its political will to measure and understand the nature of poverty
and to identify and address key obstacles. Consideration of the specific country
context and its political economy issues is critical to increasing the traction for
poverty-reduction reforms: where there is strong commitment and capacity, the
process of supporting poverty reduction is much more straightforward. But without
strong government commitment, even the best-designed poverty-reduction
strategies are bound to fail to achieve the desired results.

This evaluation draws on the lessons from the poverty focus of recent country
programs to show how Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCDs) can inform Country
Partnership Frameworks (CPFs) to achieve the twin goals. Each CPF, which will
define the Bank Group’s country engagements, will draw upon an SCD, which is
designed to be a rigorous and independent exercise that Bank country teams
conduct in consultation with national authorities and other stakeholders. The SCD
will then become a reference point for client consultations on the priorities for Bank
Group country engagements. The design and implementation of the SCD will
identify the challenges and opportunities in each country.


Evaluation Objective and Scope

reduction, and in 2011 it published the first Corporate Scorecard and World Bank for

Bank 2011a, 2011b). The Global Monitoring Report, published annually since 2004 by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, has provided additional
information on progress in the MDGs (World Bank and IMF 2004). Despite this
work, there has not been a comprehensive, independent evaluation of how the Bank
has operationalized its poverty mission (World Bank 2005a). 3

This evaluation seeks to fill this gap. It assesses how the Bank’s programs have been
designed and positioned to support partner country efforts to reduce poverty. The
emphasis is on poverty, but also recognizing the importance of distribution,
particularly in the context of the twin goals. 4 The evaluation for all International
Development Association (IDA) and IBRD countries, as well as “blend” countries
that get assistance from both, covers FY2004–2012. 5

The evaluation also identifies obstacles the Bank encounters when moving from
data, to diagnostics, to strategy development and implementation. The findings aim
to sharpen the effectiveness of country programs as the Bank starts to implement the
post-2015 agenda, which will likely call for more ambitious action on poverty
reduction. The emphasis of the evaluation is on the process by which the Bank has
engaged with country governments to support poverty reduction. It assesses the
Bank’s engagement with countries to generate and share data, prepare poverty
diagnostics, use those diagnostics to formulate and implement strategy, and to
monitor and evaluate feedback loops to inform future strategies. It does not assess
the impact of the Bank’s intervention on poverty or how much poverty outcomes
can be attributed to the Bank. Instead, it assesses how Bank programs have been
designed and positioned to support country client efforts to reduce poverty.

The evaluation examines both income and non-income dimensions of poverty (Box
1.1). This is important to the extent that the degree of poverty and its improvement
over time may differ using different indicators, as the progress of some dimensions
may lag others. This evaluation uses the income (or consumption) poverty lines to
define the poor and examines the non-income dimensions of the challenges that the
poor face. For ease of comparison across countries, the evaluation uses the extreme
poverty line of $1.25 a day (at purchasing power parity 2005) for the income
dimension and information from the World Development Indicators (WDI) database
for the non-income dimensions, such as health, education, and access to basic
services. For country studies, the evaluation uses the national poverty line as the
primary threshold for income-based poverty. 6 To keep the analysis tractable and
focused, this evaluation will exclude several important aspects of poverty, such as
intrahousehold dynamics or distributional consequences within the household, and
intertemporal tradeoffs related to climate change and environmental poverty.

 Box 1.1. Measures of Poverty
 The evaluation examines both income and non-income dimensions of poverty. There is
 widespread consensus that poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon—besides low
 levels of income and consumption, poor people often suffer from fear, humiliation, and ill
 health. They may experience multiple forms of hardship simultaneously. However, there
 is much less consensus on whether it is useful to aggregate across different dimensions to
 construct a multidimensional measure of welfare and, if so, how to do so in a way that is
 conceptually sound and readily interpretable. Using income (or consumption) poverty
 lines and the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) could result in divergent results in
 several countries. The hot debates about the MPI—including the opportunity of zooming
 in to see the different dimensions in which a person is deprived and then “adding up”
 that person’s deprivations; and the challenges of justification of the choice of sub
 indicators and weights—illustrate the pros and cons of using this composite indicator to
 measure poverty.

All development assistance eventually has some relevance to poverty reduction, so
the evaluation excludes some aspects of development to keep the analysis tractable
and focused. It does not consider intrahousehold dynamics (such as distributional
consequences within the household)7 or intertemporal trade-offs (such as climate
change and environmental poverty). It also avoids the traditional portfolio review,
because the entire portfolio of Bank interventions is aimed to either directly or
indirectly be relevant to poverty. Further, it is concerned more with the poverty
focus of Bank-supported interventions at the country level than with the
achievement of specific project objectives. To support poverty reduction, the Bank
needs a range of interventions supporting growth and equitable distribution, from
improving basic services delivery to the poor to broad-based growth and
competitiveness. The appropriate mix depends on the country context (box 1.2).

Since the Bank Group had no comprehensive strategy for reducing poverty at the
outset of the period reviewed, the evaluation does not examine the effectiveness of
the Bank’s corporate strategy.8 The Bank’s technical support to regional and global
agencies or to international forums on poverty is also excluded.


 Box 1.2. Defining the Poverty Focus of Bank Interventions
 Poverty is the result of economic, political, and social processes that interact and
 frequently reinforce each other in ways that exacerbate the deprivation in which poor
 people live (World Bank 2010a). It is well recognized that poverty eradication depends on
 both stimulating growth and providing basic social services to the poor (World Bank



                                                                                                      5

ASSESSING THE WORLD BANK’S POVERTY FOCUS

    1990). Many of the Bank’s interventions can be considered relevant to poverty in some
    way. However, defining the poverty focus and the degree to which development support
    contributes to poverty outcomes is not straightforward. Some interventions, such as for
    safety nets, may contribute directly and immediately to reducing income poverty; others,
    such as support for education, may do so with a long lag; and still others, such as
    improvements to the investment climate, may contribute indirectly or only in the
    presence of other policies or dynamics in the economy.
    It is beyond the scope of the evaluation to examine the impact of Bank-supported
    interventions on poverty reduction in the short term and long term. Instead, the
    evaluation groups the Bank’s interventions into two broad categories—directly or
    indirectly focused on poverty reduction. Direct poverty focus is broadly defined as the
    activities that are designed and implemented to provide a disproportionate first-round
    benefit to the poorer segment of the population.
    The evaluation recognizes that the links between Bank interventions and poverty
    reduction are complex and country-specific, and the Bank faces trade-offs in selecting
    projects with direct linkages (such as social safety nets) or indirect linkages (such as
    financial reforms) with poverty reduction. It does not judge whether the interventions
    with direct poverty focus have a stronger impact on poverty reduction than those with
    indirect poverty focus. The report does not judge whether there should be a larger or
    smaller share of interventions directly or indirectly focusing on poverty reduction as the
    binding constraints vary across countries. Instead, it assesses the extent to which lending
    operations, technical assistance, capacity building, convening power, analytical work, and
    dialogue were focused on poverty reduction and its key country-specific dimensions as
    identified in the poverty diagnostics. The proper mix of interventions with direct and
    indirect poverty focus depends on the specific country situation.


The development community increasingly recognizes the private sector’s crucial
role in reducing poverty by creating jobs and providing services and opportunities
for the poor. 9 The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Bank Group’s private
sector arm, is the largest development institution focused on the private sector. It
provides direct financing and technical assistance to private enterprises and shares
the Bank’s poverty-reduction mission. The poverty focus of IFC’s interventions are
not assessed in this report since the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) evaluation
Assessing IFC’s Poverty Focus and Results (IEG 2011a) examines this in depth. The
2011 evaluation concludes that there is not enough clarity about what poverty
means within the IFC strategic context. Although IFC’s interventions are designed to
contribute to growth, distributional aspects are often not integrated into project
designs. Most IFC investment projects generate satisfactory economic returns but do
not provide evidence of how its interventions reach and affect the poor. The
evaluation points toward a need for closer collaboration and greater synergies with
the World Bank to better address poverty and distributional issues, beyond
company-level impacts. Box 1.3 summarizes the key findings of the evaluation.

Box 1.3. IFC’s Poverty Focus and Results
A 2011 IEG evaluation assessed the relevance and effectiveness of the poverty focus in
IFC over fiscal years 2000 to 2010. In the context of IFC’s business model, the evaluation
assessed poverty focus in terms of how IFC’s strategies, projects, and results
measurement framework contribute to growth and to distributional patterns of growth
that create opportunities for the poor. The evaluation found that IFC’s strategic priorities
on frontier areas (areas with large concentrations of poverty) and sectors such as
infrastructure, agribusiness, health, education, and financial markets are consistent with
support to an inclusive growth pattern, but improvements are needed in three areas:
Strategic Level. IFC aims to end poverty through private sector development. Three of
IFC’s corporate strategic priorities—frontier markets, including International
Development Association (IDA) and frontier regions in middle-income countries (MICs);
targeted sectors with potential engagement of the poor; and certain types of financial
services, focusing on micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs)—have guided its
poverty focus since 2004. The evaluation found that IFC investments in IDA countries
have increased over the years; however, these investments were allocated in a few IDA
countries, such as India, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Vietnam. The investments need to be
allocated in more IDA countries. In MICs, IFC focuses on frontier regions with large
concentrations of poverty. However, IEG analysis showed that the largest density of poor
people was not in locations with the highest poverty rates. While the strategic sectors are
broadly defined in terms consistent with a pro-poor orientation, they need to be designed
and implemented in ways that actually enhance opportunities and the impact on poor
people. IFC’s strategic directions related to poverty have a special focus on support to
MSMEs, through financial intermediaries, which grew eightfold in the 2000s. The efficacy
and welfare impacts of these types of interventions are not known.
Operational Level. The majority of IFC projects are designed to contribute to growth, but
IFC found it challenging to incorporate distributional issues in its interventions. Fewer
than half of projects reviewed included evidence of poverty reduction and distributional
aspects in project objectives, targeting of interventions, characteristics of intended
beneficiaries, or tracking of impacts. Projects that paid attention to distribution issues
performed at least as well as other projects on development and investment outcomes;
this suggests that poverty focus need not come at the expense of financial success. The
relatively high proportion of projects that do not generate identifiable opportunities for
the poor suggests that they rely primarily on the pace of growth for poverty reduction, at
a time when IFC’s strategies point to more attention to the pattern of growth.
Impact through a Poverty Lens. IFC’s monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework did
not quantify benefits to the poor and there were no indicators for measuring a project’s
effect on poverty. Given the limited attention to distributional issues in the M&E
framework, IEG used a poverty index to characterize project benefits based on their
contribution to growth and inclusion of the poor. The analysis indicated that the majority
of investment projects generated economic returns but did not provide evidence of
identifiable benefits to the poor. This further suggests that IFC primarily relies on the pace
of growth for poverty reduction.

Results Chain, Evaluative Questions, and Instruments
The results chain through which the Bank supports economic development to
reduce poverty can be long and differs significantly from country to country
depending on initial endowments, social structures, quality of governance,
economic systems, and global circumstances. It is also widely recognized that
development outcomes are the result of the capacity and ownership of client
countries. The support of multiple partners and interventions across sectors and
time often complicates the attribution of results to a single partner or initiative. Still,
in practice the Bank uses its levers of support—analytical work, lending, convening
power, technical assistance, capacity building, and policy dialogue—to influence
national policies and programs, and to help translate growth, greater access to
opportunities, and poverty alleviation mechanisms (such as social safety nets) into
poverty reduction. Bank programs and projects are required to specify results that
are expected from the actions and policies they support, and most have a results
framework.

The overarching question for this evaluation is: “How, and how well, has the Bank
focused its programs on reducing poverty in partner countries?” Using country
programs as the primary unit of analysis, the evaluation reviews the Bank Group’s
Country Assistance Strategies (CASs) and Country Partnership Strategies (CPSs) to
determine the extent of their focus on poverty and the poor and assesses them based
on their consistency with analytical work on poverty for that country. The
evaluation is structured around five questions underlying this main line of inquiry:

       •   Did the Bank have the appropriate data to understand the nature of poverty
           and provide an information base for robust analytical work on poverty?
       •   With the given data, did the Bank’s analytic work adequately address poverty
           issues and identify policy priorities for poverty reduction?
       •   Did Bank country strategies adopt the findings of analytical work on poverty
           to help set priorities for and guide policy dialogue and lending?
       •   Did interventions—operations, technical assistance, and capacity building—
           reflect the strategic priorities for poverty reduction?
       •   Did the Bank collect and draw lessons from poverty-reduction interventions
           to strengthen feedback loops and improve the effectiveness of its country
           strategies and programs? If so, how did it do so?

                                                  ASSESSING THE WORLD BANK’S POVERTY FOCUS
The report is structured along the evaluative chain from data, to diagnostics, to
strategy formulation and implementation, and to the feedback loops (figure 1.2). The
evaluation fully assesses each of the components in the process of country program
work related to poverty reduction, tracing through data, diagnostics, country
strategy formulation and implementation, and feedback loops in the respective
chapters.

The analysis relies on 10 country case studies, an internal survey with Bank staff, an
external survey with client government officials and nongovernment stakeholders in
20 countries, a series of focus group meetings with Bank staff who work on poverty,
an assessment of the quality of Poverty Assessments (PAs) in 20 countries, a review of
the Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report Reviews (CPSCRRs) and
Country Assistance Evaluations (CAEs), and stocktaking exercises of PovcalNet data,
development policy operations, Investment Lending (IL), Public Expenditure Reviews
(PERs), and Poverty and Social Impact Analyses (PSIAs).

Country case studies. The 10 country case studies drew in-depth lessons from the
Bank’s support of government efforts to reduce poverty (appendix A). 10 The
countries were selected from a population of 144 countries comprising all IDA,
IBRD, and blend countries. 11 The selection is purposive and does not aim to fully
represent the various categories of countries. It tries to cover a range of countries at
different income levels to reflect the differing approaches and challenges to poverty
reduction in countries at different levels of development. The case study countries
were selected to roughly reflect regional balance. During the selection process,

countries were first grouped according to (i) regions; (ii) income level; and (iii)
whether or not they are classified as FCS. 12 An emphasis was placed on countries with
significant Bank engagement (lending and nonlending activities) 13. To provide
lessons that reflect a wide range of operational experience, the final selection of
countries also took into consideration variations in the number of poor and in poverty
rates, and potential lessons for learning in consultation with external experts and
senior Bank staff. The 10 countries selected for study are Arab Republic of Egypt,
Bangladesh, Guatemala, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Malawi,
Nigeria, Peru, the Philippines, Romania, and Senegal. Focusing on FY2004–2012,
each case study consisted of desk reviews, structured interviews with Bank staff,
and in-country consultations with stakeholders.

External stakeholder survey. This survey 14 collected views and feedback from
government officials, civil society, academia, the donor/international community,
and the private sector. The list of respondents was randomly generated for each
country from the list of respondents of the Bank’s stakeholders shared by the
respective Country Office teams (which in some cases were drawn from the list of
recent Bank’s country client surveys), IEG evaluation interview lists, and
complemented by research conducted by the independent survey firm. Heavier
weight in the respondent list was given to the government officials, since they are
the World Bank’s primary counterparts. The 20 countries surveyed covered all six
Regions and reflect a balance between types of countries by lending group (that is,
IBRD, IDA, and blend), accessibility of data, and FCS and non-FCS. 15 A 27 percent
response rate is on a par with similar stakeholder surveys administered by
international organizations. 16 (appendix B).

Internal staff survey. This survey sought insight into staff perspectives of the
constraints on data and the drivers of the difference in quality of poverty data and
diagnostic work. The survey focused on three areas: constraints to obtaining poverty
data; best practices and challenges to creating poverty diagnostic work; and
challenges of translating poverty diagnostic work into country strategies. The survey
was sent to all staff at grades GF and above who were working on poverty issues in
the Bank’s operations and research departments. 17 An analysis of the distribution of
survey respondents shows that it largely mirrors the distribution of the population
in terms staff technical mapping, grade levels, and location (headquarters vs.
country office). A response rate of 21 percent is on a par with similar surveys
administered within the Bank 18 (appendix C).

Focus group meetings. The six focus group meetings gathered in-depth information
about how the availability of poverty data affects the Bank’s poverty diagnostics,
and whether and how they translate into country strategies (appendix D). The

representatives at the meetings included three distinct groups: task team leaders or
co-leaders of Poverty Assessments/Poverty Updates, country economists of
countries that have not had a poverty assessment since 2009, and task team leaders
or co-leaders of CPSs. The 18 countries represented in the discussions were
purposively selected to cover all six Regions considering the balance between the
types of countries by lending group, accessibility of data, and FCS and non-FCS
countries. The selected countries were Afghanistan, Botswana, Cambodia, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Jordan, India, Indonesia, Kosovo, the Kyrgyz
Republic, Moldova, Pakistan, the Republic of Yemen, Russia, South Sudan, Sri
Lanka, and Papua New Guinea, along with West Bank, Gaza, and the member
countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States. 19

Assessment of the quality of Poverty Assessments/Poverty Updates. This
assessment sought to identify gaps in the quality of Bank poverty diagnostics across
Regions, across those countries with the greatest poverty-reduction challenges (in
absolute or relative terms), and countries with weak data 20 (appendix E). Twenty
countries were purposively selected for this assessment to provide equal coverage of
each of the Bank’s six Regions (four countries each for Sub-Saharan Africa and East
Asia and Pacific, and three countries each for the remaining four Regions); countries
with greater rates of poverty either as a proportion of the developing world’s poor,
or as a share of country population; and at least one country with weak data in each
Region.21

Review of CASCRRs/CPSCRRs and CAEs/CPEs. This review assessed the poverty
focus of country strategies and their M&E systems as reflected in the completion
report. The analysis was a systematic review of all of IEG’s CPSCRRs since FY2004.
The review draws on the comparison of the CPSCRRs from 66 countries, with two
CPSCRRs each in the past decade to examine the trends in the poverty focus of
country strategies and the 14 CAEs/CPEs relevant to the period of evaluation
(appendix F).

World Bank’s FCS list in 2014, this number is a crude estimate.

5 The   population includes 144 countries, listed as Bank borrowers as of October 2013.
6This was done, first, because the evaluation focuses on improving the Bank’s support at
the level of the country program. The basis of this dialogue is the national poverty lines of
the countries involved. The second reason is practical: much of the country-specific
analytical work and dialogue is based on the national poverty line, without reference to
international poverty lines. For countries that have adopted two poverty lines a nationally
defined standard poverty line and a nationally defined extreme poverty line, the evaluation
emphasizes the extreme poverty line, as defined by each country.
7A separate forthcoming evaluation on poverty and gender is examining intrahousehold
aspects of social safety nets.
8In practice, the Bank has favored a broad, multisector and multistakeholder approach to
achieving development results and poverty reduction. There are multiple development or
poverty strategies at the regional and sector levels across the Bank. In addition, the Bank has
not precisely committed to any particular component of the MDGs.
9“[P]rivate investment has become the dominant mode of capital transfer worldwide”
(World Bank 2014b).
“The private sector is the main engine of growth.” OECD 2007.
“[P]rivate sector is already central to the lives of the poor and has the power to make those
lives better” (UNDP 2004).
10Given the scope of work and resource constraints, the evaluation focused on 10 country
case studies to draw in-depth lessons. The countries are purposively selected and not
statistically representative. Every effort is made to ensure no bias is introduced in the
selection process.
11   The IBRD, IDA, and blend country classification is up to date as of October 2013.
12 Fragileand conflict-affected states have either: (a) a harmonized average CPIA country
rating of 3.2 or less, or (b) the presence of a UN and/or regional peace-keeping or peace-
building mission during the past three years. This list is up to date as of FY14 and includes
only IDA-eligible countries and nonmember or inactive territories and countries without
CPIA data. It excludes IBRD-only countries for which the CPIA scores are not currently
disclosed.
13Significant levels of Bank engagement are indicated by a minimum of 25 approved
projects between FY2004 and 2012, since 25 projects is the median number of projects for the
population of the 144 countries during this period.
14 To ensure confidentiality and anonymity of the responses as well as respondent bias, IEG
commissioned ICF International, an independent survey firm, to conduct a web-based
survey to gather opinions and perceptions of the World Bank’s poverty through a survey in
20 client countries. See appendix B for details.
15 Thecountries selected are China, Democratic Republic of Congo, the Dominican Republic,
Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jordan, Kosovo, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mexico,
Morocco, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, the Russian
Federation, and the Republic of Yemen.

16For example, the World Bank’s 2013 Access to Information Stakeholder Survey had a 27
percent response rate and the Client Feedback Survey of FY13 Analytical & Advisory
Activities had a 31 percent response rate.
17 Thesurvey was conducted from April 15 to May 13, 2014, and was sent to 4,150 Bank staff,
of which 866 responded (a rate of 21 percent). To focus on staff with close experience in
operations and country strategies, staff mapped to procurement, human resources,
information and technology, business solutions, World Bank Institute, and IEG were
exluded. The survey was confidential and anonymous. See appendix C for details.
18 Forexample, DEC’s research paper on the influence of World Bank Research fielded a
survey among all senior operations staff at grades GG and above and received a 19 percent
response rate (555 respondents out of 2,900) (see Research at Work: Assessing the Influence
of World Bank Research. Development Economics Unit. World Bank. 2012.) In addition, the
WHO Stakeholder Perception Surveys set the response rate for the internal staff survey at 20
percent as a good threshold (see
http://www.who.int/about/who_perception_survey_2012.pdf)
19 Although all of the participants from relevant focus group categories in each country were
invited to participate, the final list depended on the staff availability in June-August 2014.
The total number of focus group participants was 22 staff members.
20 Forreasons of comparison, this evaluation refers to data availability as the survey data
availability in the World Bank’s PovCalNet. Countries with weak data broadly refers to
countries that have, at most, one round of household surveys available in PovCalNet during
the period of 2000–2012.

2. Preparing the Ground: World Bank Support
for Poverty Data
 Highlights
  The availability of poverty survey data has steadily improved in recent decades, but progress
    has been highly uneven, and data quality remains weak in many developing countries.
  Partial coverage, lags in periodicity, and poor timeliness characterize countries with weak data
   capacity and constrain understanding of poverty profiles and trends.
  Consistency and comparability of poverty data across indicators remains a problem. Gaps
   between income and consumption data from household surveys and from national accounts are
   also a problem.
  The World Bank made poverty data more widely accessible by advocating for open data and
   developing tools to document, catalog, and disseminate micro data. But it would increase its
   effectiveness through a more coherent and systematic approach to data collection and reporting.
  The World Bank has made important contributions to improving statistical systems, and has
   provided technical assistance, often in collaboration with donors. However, sustainability of
   improvements when financing ends remains an issue.


Reliable and timely data are key to measuring poverty. Acquiring such data is the first
step in understanding the nature and magnitude of the challenges of poverty
reduction, which is essential for policy planning and design of targeted interventions
for poverty reduction. This chapter reviews the state of country-level poverty data. It
examines whether the Bank has sufficient information to produce robust diagnostic
work, and if the Bank has helped to expand and improve the collection,
dissemination, and use of poverty data. The chapter also discusses the challenges in
data beyond household surveys. The evidence is drawn primarily from the country
case studies, staff survey, external stakeholder survey, and focus group meetings,
which were all triangulated with information from the Bank’s micro data catalog and
other data sources.

State of Survey Data
Poor people are subject to many kinds of deprivation. This evaluation uses the
income (or consumption) measure to set the poverty line, and examines the causes
and consequences of poverty in multiple dimensions. It also considers a range of
other indicators that characterize and influence the welfare of individuals (box 2.1).

                                   PREPARING THE GROUND: WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR POVERTY DATA

 Box 2-1. What are Poverty Data?
 Many kinds of data are needed to assess the conditions of poor people and to design
 programs that improve their circumstances.
 Surveys and administrative sources provide many non-income measures of poverty, such
 as educational outcomes, health status, living conditions, labor force participation, and
 environmental conditions.
 Demographic data from censuses and civil registration and vital statistics systems are
 useful in constructing sampling frames and sample weights, and for normalizing data
 from administrative records.
 Data from consumer price surveys and income aggregates from national accounts are
 needed to extrapolate income and consumption data between survey rounds. Global price
 indexes based on purchasing power parities are needed to calculate international poverty
 lines.
 Well-functioning, complete national statistical systems should be able to produce all these
 statistics through national censuses, administrative records, and national and
 international survey programs. However, many developing countries need help to
 produce statistics that meet the standards required for international reporting. The
 Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) sponsored by UNICEF and Demographic and
 Health Survey (DHS) sponsored by the U.S. Agency for International Development have
 helped fill this gap.
 Labor force surveys also yield relevant information on employment status, occupation,
 and wages. The International Labor Organization provides standards and guidelines for
 labor force surveys and compiles results from national surveys. Efforts are also under
 way to create a harmonized global database of labor force surveys.
 Comprehensive surveys such as the Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) collect
 data on key non-income characteristics of households, household members, and their
 communities. These are used to construct poverty diagnostics. The LSMS questionnaire
 cannot accommodate all the items needed to reproduce the output of a DHS, MICS, or
 labor force survey, and surveys cannot replace all the data from administrative records.
 Coordinating statistical activities in a country is necessary to produce data to generate the
 statistics needed for a comprehensive view of poverty.


During the past three decades, the availability, quality, and accessibility of
Household Income and Expenditure Surveys (HIES) have improved for most
developing countries. The World Bank has supported capacity building for data
collection and management and poverty estimation in its country clients. In the
stakeholder survey for this evaluation, 86 percent of government and 90 percent of
nongovernment stakeholders believed that the Bank has helped to improve the
quality of poverty data.

CHAPTER 2
PREPARING THE GROUND: WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR POVERTY DATA
Without more frequent data collection, changes in poverty and income distribution
can be measured only indirectly. Data quality issues, particularly comparability
across survey rounds and the availability of panel data, remain serious constraints to
understanding poverty in many countries. 1 Data accessibility and transparency also
remain a problem, particularly for fragile and conflict-affected states (FCS) and in
countries where poverty is a politically sensitive and unwelcome topic. Although
there is little consensus on the best way to cost the requirements of the global
statistical system, an estimate by Demombynes and Sandefur (2014) asks for about
$300 million per year to close the financing gap for surveys for countries below
$2,000 gross domestic product per capita in purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars
(appendix H).

DATA AVAILABILITY

After publishing the World Development Report 2000/2001: Attacking Poverty, 2 the
World Bank highlighted the need to expand the coverage and improve the quality
and accessibility of household income surveys, calling for more detailed
questionnaires. The stock of household surveys, which capture the most common
sources of poverty statistics including income, consumption, and expenditure data,
greatly increased during the past three decades. 3 During the 2000s, some 40–50
surveys were conducted each year, up from the 20–30 surveys in the 1990s and less
than 10 per year through most of the 1980s. Surveys have also become more
sophisticated: LSMSs have incorporated new modules to collect information on non-
income correlates and subjective measures of poverty.

Multiple rounds of surveys allow for the assessment of poverty trends, whereas a
single round permits only static profiling. 4 But monitoring progress requires continual
data updates. After reaching a peak in 2002, the number of new income and
expenditure surveys added to the Bank’s PovcalNet database leveled off at about 50
per year, and the number of new surveys recorded within a five-year period peaked
at 229 in 2006. More surveys may exist, but long delays between the initiation of
surveys and the recording and processing of micro data caused a decline in the
number of surveys available in recent years. As a result, no data are available in
PovcalNet after 2012, and country coverage going back to 2008 is reduced (figure 2.1).

Despite the increase in survey coverage, 22 low-or middle-income countries do not
have income or consumption data in the past three decades (or since the 1980s) in
PovcalNet. Some 30 countries have not had household surveys and some 20 more
have had only one survey in the past decade (or since 2000). The lack of survey data
limits the ability of these countries to measure the profiles and trends of their
poverty.5 More than one-third of these countries are in Sub-Saharan Africa, and more

than four-fifths are small or FCS. Among the 30 to 50 new surveys added each year
since 2000, 80 percent were in middle-income countries. In Latin America and the
Caribbean, the average gap between two surveys is slightly more than two years, but
in Sub-Saharan Africa (where poverty is concentrated) the gap is almost nine years.
The staff survey confirms that wide data gaps are a big concern to development
practitioners in FCS.

DATA QUALITY

Producing high-quality data requires significant effort (box 2.2). Challenges in survey
data can range from design and implementation problems in a single survey round
(which prevent the identification of a comprehensive poverty profile) to the lack of
survey comparability over time (which hinders the examination of poverty trends),
and to problems in constructing panel data (which limit the possibility of tracking
poverty mobility and vulnerability). High-quality panel survey data are important for
policy relevant-analysis (such as chronic versus transient poverty and the
vulnerability of different types of households) and to trace the medium- or long- term
impact of interventions on well-being.

Obtaining accurate information on sources of income and on consumption
expenditures is a particular challenge. The reliability of consumption data is affected
by the timing of surveys and the recall period or the type of diaries used to record
expenditures. The consistency and comparability of data can also be improved by
adhering to international standards for classifying consumption components. 6

CHAPTER 2
PREPARING THE GROUND: WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR POVERTY DATA
The responsibility for data quality lies with national statistical offices (NSOs) and
the governments that authorize and fund them. Evidence points to the need to
improve their capacity and performance. The 2014 report by the UN Secretary-
General’s Independent Expert Advisory Group on the Data Revolution for
Sustainable Development recommends that “data quality should be protected and
improved by strengthening NSOs” (IEAG 2014: 23). It declares that “a robust
framework for quality assurance is required, particularly for official data. This
includes internal systems as well as periodic audits by professional and independent
third parties. Existing tools for improving the quality of statistical data should be
used and strengthened, and data should be classified using commonly agreed
criteria and quality benchmarks” (IEAG 2014: 22).

The World Bank has contributed to improving data quality in many countries. With
that assistance, overall household survey data quality has improved. In a majority of
case study countries, data comparability, disaggregation, and depth have improved.
For instance, during the past two decades, the improved quality of the Lao
Expenditure and Consumption Survey data provided a strong information basis for
poverty diagnostics in the 2000s. 7


 Box 2-2. Assessing Data Quality
 The quality of poverty estimates and the diagnostic indicators and policies based on them
 depend on the quality of the underlying data. The best assurance of data quality is
 knowledge of how they were produced. The International Monetary Fund developed a
 generic data quality assessment framework (DQAF) that can be applied to many of the
 outputs of an official statistical agency (IMF 2012). The prerequisite for data quality is a
 legal and institutional environment that authorizes the work of a statistical office and
 provides adequate resources. The DQAF then defines five dimensions of data quality:
    Assurance of integrity demonstrated by impartiality, transparency, and ethical
     behavior
    Methodological soundness, including the use of appropriate standards and
     classification systems
    Accuracy and reliability of source data and the processes used to compile statistics
    Serviceability, which looks at the periodicity, timeliness, and consistency of statistics
     within a dataset
    Accessibility of data and metadata to the final users.
 The lack of a DQAF or equivalent does not imply that quality has been neglected. Expert
 advice from World Bank teams and others has helped improve survey programs. The
 International Household Survey Network and its Accelerated Data Program have
 encouraged countries to provide robust information on the design and execution of
 surveys, using the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) standard (see website at




18
                                                                              CHAPTER 2
                              PREPARING THE GROUND: WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR POVERTY DATA
 http://www.ddialliance.org). Full compliance with the DDI provides evidence of the
 quality of micro data sets.


Progress on improving data quality is evident in some of the country cases, which is
making the development of rigorous analytics possible. Peru and Romania now
conduct high-quality, nationally representative household surveys annually. Also,
some low-income countries with capacity constraints produce high-quality poverty
data with high comparability over time. In Malawi, the last two rounds of household
surveys were fully comparable and representative at the national level and (three)
sub regional levels, as well as urban/rural zones. In Bangladesh, the Household
Income Expenditure Survey used a comparable set of questions and sample frames
in the last three rounds. This allowed detailed examination of the dynamics and
determinants of poverty incidence, supporting rigorous analysis. But the five-year
gap between surveys leaves analysts and policymakers uncertain about the impact
of new policies and programs.

In some other case study countries, data are much weaker and often not comparable
over time, presenting challenges to analysis. Senegal conducted three nationally,
regionally, and zonally (rural/urban) disaggregated household surveys between
2000 and 2012, but they are not fully comparable. 8 In the Philippines, inconsistencies
between the definitions of “rural” and “urban” in successive surveys complicated,
or even invalidated, the comparability of the data over time. In Nigeria, the
Harmonized Nigeria Living Standard Survey (HNLSS) 2009/10 data were
inadequate because of changes in the method for estimating expenditure and the
way the survey was carried out. Overall, therefore, progress on data quality appears
to have been uneven.

Bank staff view weak survey data as the main constraint to carrying out robust
poverty diagnostics. For instance, more than one-third of the staff survey
respondents indicated that the lack of sufficient data is an obstacle for creating
Poverty Assessments and Poverty and Social Impact Analyses (figure 2.2).




                                                                                      19

The challenges are even more daunting when considering the need to measure the
income growth rate of different segments of the population to monitor progress in
reducing extreme poverty and improving shared prosperity. As reported in the
Global Monitoring Report 2014/15: Ending Poverty and Sharing Prosperity, the Bank has
information about the growth rate of the bottom 40 percent during the period 2006–
2012 for only 86 countries. The missing information in the upper tail of the
distribution in the HIES (and in some countries also the lower tail, related to, for
example, informality) is an obstacle to measuring poverty and for measuring
changes in expenditure or income distribution over time.

DATA ACCESSIBILITY

Data accessibility has improved considerably in the past decade. With support from
other agencies and partner countries, the World Bank’s Open Data Initiative has
been influential, encouraging the release of a variety of statistical information.9 The
Accelerated Data Program has assisted partner countries in retrieving and
documenting surveys that had been lost or forgotten. Information about these
surveys is now available to the public through the International Household Survey
Network (IHSN) catalog and internally to Bank staff through the central Micro data
Catalog.

As countries have adopted open data polices, statistical offices have become more
willing to make their poverty data and documentation available through websites and
in other public venues. In Peru, for example, the statistical agency provides
unrestricted access to survey data, which is reported using multiple methodologies to


20
                                                                                 CHAPTER 2
                                 PREPARING THE GROUND: WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR POVERTY DATA
allow for comparability over time. Data from Malawi’s 2010 Integrated Household
Survey were made public within 12 months of completing fieldwork.

But the absence of the mandate to require the collection and dissemination of
standardized data on household income and poverty constrains the Bank’s ability to
achieve the twin goals (Box 2.3). Restrictions on data access often remain severe. In
Bangladesh, although the main results and documentation of the HIES are provided
on the website, micro data cannot be downloaded, thus restricting public access. 10 In
the Philippines, income and expenditure surveys are publicly available, but the
release of poverty estimates can take up to two years after survey completion. In
Senegal, even sector ministry and subnational government officials often lacked
access to the poverty data or did not know that the data existed. Development
partners in Senegal noted the lack of official access to poverty data and instead sought
to access it informally from Bank staff.


 Box 2-3. The Missing Mandate
 The IMF is the international financial institution charged with, among other things,
 collecting and reporting key international finance, public finance, and trade data from all
 of its member countries. Under the Articles of Agreements VIII General Obligations of
 Members, the IMF may require member countries to furnish information as it deems
 necessary, including national data such as total exports and imports of merchandise,
 international balance of payments, international investment position, national income,
 and price indices. This helps the IMF provide a critical public good, collecting and
 publishing information on monetary and financial issues, including financial risk and
 credit ratings, policy formulation during financial crises, periodic identification of policy
 priorities and financial health, assessment of basic research on macroeconomic stability,
 and basic research on international and public finance. The IMF also has taken several
 important steps to enhance transparency and openness, including setting voluntary
 standards for the dissemination of economic and financial data. Over 95 percent of the
 IMF's member countries participate in the General Data Dissemination System or Special
 Data Dissemination Standard. High quality, standardized, and comprehensive financial
 data support the IMF’s mission, and serve as the hallmark of its international contribution
 to knowledge on of the global economy.
 By contrast, the World Bank Group has no such requirement for collection and
 dissemination of standardized poverty data. While many countries collect such data, and
 the World Bank has become a global leader supporting poverty data development and
 analysis, there remain major gaps in country coverage, timeliness of data, and quality
 standards. These gaps seriously constrain the Bank’s ability to generate knowledge on
 poverty. The Bank’s capability of analyzing public policy issues, measuring the human
 dimensions of risk from global shocks, or conducting research and strengthening targeted
 poverty reduction strategies has been compromised. Adopting a clear mandate,
 establishing strong standards and monitoring mechanisms, putting in place a well-
 defined strategy and incentives to support the collection and reporting of high-quality

 poverty and boosting shared prosperity.”

Political will is an obstacle to making poverty data public. Where poverty is a
sensitive topic, the constraints are worse. In Egypt, the Bank has only partial access
to the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics data through selected
consultants identified by the government. Often, and particularly in FCS economies,
the release of poverty data hinges on whether the conclusions of the survey are
favorable to political constituencies. While the Bank managed to produce some
analytical work of high quality, data challenges limited their scope and possible
impact.

Even in countries without legal or political restrictions, the dissemination of micro
data can be inhibited by concerns that the data might breach the confidentiality of
respondents. New methods of making data anonymous prevent the identification of
individuals, and the World Bank is helping Senegal and other countries to
implement those methods.

World Bank Support for Data Capacity Building
The Bank is generally seen by its country clients and development partners as a
global leader and valued partner in building capacity to improve the availability,
quality, and accessibility of poverty data. World Bank staff and government officials
mention insufficient capacity and government budget as key obstacles to collecting
poverty data (figures 2.3 and 2.4). Client demand for support with data capacity
building is strong, and the Bank is well positioned to help meet that demand.

The Bank has been a major contributor to poverty data collection and to
methodology improvement through programs like the LSMS since the 1980s, and
more recently the LSMS-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture. To address deficiencies
in the documentation of survey data, the World Bank organized the IHSN in 2004, a
partnership of household survey sponsors. Secretariat responsibilities are shared
between the World Bank and the Partnership in Statistics for Development in the
21st Century. 11 A complementary program, the Accelerated Data Program (ADP),
was set up to provide technical assistance to countries adopting IHSN tools and
standards to better manage their household survey data. A recent evaluation shows
IHSN and ADP have built strong partnerships and an enthusiastic following
(Thomson, Eele, and Schmieding 2013).

In 1999 the World Bank established a Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building
(TFSCB) to strengthen the capacity of national statistical systems in developing
countries. Of the 107 countries with National Strategies for Development Statistics
(NSDS), 80 received grants (World Bank 2014c). A large share of TFSCB grants went
to countries developing and implementing the NSDS. Other projects have also
supported a wide range of activities for implementing the NSDS. Peru, for example,
received support for survey data collection on Afro-Peruvians, for improved
coverage, quality, and timeliness of vital statistics, and for implementing its open
data program. The Philippines received grants for capacity building in the rural
sector and for improving the quality of its national accounts.

TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR DATA CAPACITY BUILDING

To monitor and report on country capacity to provide economic and social statistics,
the World Bank maintains the Bulletin Board on Statistical Capacity. 12 A Statistical
Capacity Indicator (SCI) uses a weighted average of scores on 25 items, and rates
countries for their “statistical methodology,” “source data,” and “periodicity and
timeliness.” A higher score indicates a stronger statistical system and greater ability
to carry out the work needed to produce reliable statistics. Countries with higher
adjusted overall SCI scores have more surveys of sufficient quality (figure 2.5). 13 The
six countries with adjusted scores of 90 or above each had more than 10 surveys per
country in PovcalNet between 2000 and 2012; those with adjusted scores below 50
had slightly more than one each.

With support from other development partners, the World Bank provides technical
support to improve the availability, quality, and timely access of data, which is
evident in the country case studies. In Bangladesh, the Bank’s long-term
engagement with statistical agencies since the early 1990s strengthened local
statistical capacity. In Guatemala, the Bank’s capacity-building effort helped create a
critical mass of technical expertise in the National Statistics Institute and the
government’s planning secretariat, resulting in a vast improvement in the quality
and transparency of data. In Lao PDR, the Bank provided extensive technical and
financial support to improve the capacity of the statistical agency, improving the

for deeper and more multidimensional poverty diagnostic work.

 Note: SCI overall scores were adjusted to remove two indicators related to poverty surveys. The adjusted SCI overall
 scores were re-normed to a range of 0 to 100.

The monitoring program for the proposed Sustainable Development Goals is
expected to create greater demand for relevant statistics. New methods of data
collection—including remote sensing and “big data” derived from cellphone records
and social media—are expected along with new modes of international support and
coordination. 14 In this context, the World Bank’s poverty data work is part of a much
larger effort to support improvement of data sources for measuring poverty and
obtaining the evidence for effective policymaking.

The Bank also builds consensus among technical and political players to improve
survey design, implementation, and poverty estimation methodologies. In Peru,
several changes in methodologies for estimating the poverty line compromised the
credibility of poverty data in the early 2000s. A Bank team, in addition to providing
technical support, worked closely with Peruvian researchers and public servants to
set up an advisory committee in 2007 to help reach consensus on the best
methodological practices to produce comparable poverty estimates. As a result, the
Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática (INEI) issued comparable poverty
figures, and public trust was restored. Building sustainable institutional capacity
alongside technical capacity was key to INEI’s success.

CHAPTER 2
PREPARING THE GROUND: WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR POVERTY DATA

IMPORTANCE OF POLITICAL WILL

Political will is a major constraint to poverty data development in some countries.
Nearly 40 percent of Bank staff cited the lack of political will as an obstacle to
obtaining data for assessing poverty levels. 15 In Nigeria, official commitment was
lacking and the government failed to finance the HNLSS 2009/2010. Insisting on
cost sharing, the World Bank and U.K. Department for International Development
withdrew support and the survey was unsuccessful. In Egypt, poverty headcount
data (and inequality estimates) have been tied to the political discourse of successive
governments. 16 Data accessibility for the general public had been a major issue at
least until the late 2000s—assumptions of the low domestic labor mobility and the
accuracy of the poverty estimations in the major shantytowns and areas around
metropolitan areas were questionable. 17

These challenges also apply to census data. In Nigeria, there are inevitable tensions
regarding population figures, given their importance in determining the allocation
of petroleum revenues across regions and urban/rural zones. Political tensions are a
major factor, along with technical challenges, in having outdated population
weights, which affected the poverty figures.

SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES

The sustainability of poverty data efforts without the active presence of the Bank is
questionable in most low-income countries and in some middle-income countries
with low capacity, especially when success depends on key individuals in national
statistical offices. When Guatemala’s MECOVI (Programa para el Mejoramiento de las
Encuestas y la Medición de Condiciones de Vida) program ended in 2010 and external
funding lapsed, many skilled consultants were let go. Technical problems associated
with the 2011 ENCOVI (Encuesta Nacional de Condiciones de Vida) survey
compromised the comparability of poverty statistics. In view of the government’s
current fiscal constraints and the absence of external support for capacity building,
stakeholders are now concerned about the sustainability of Guatemala’s statistical
capacity. Similarly in Malawi, capacity remains thin because capacity-building
efforts have not sustained domestic capacity, with considerable staff turnover and
limited domestic skills.

Donor financing is not a panacea for capacity constraints. In some countries, it has
had unexpected negative consequences for clients, breeding a culture of donor
dependency. Some developing countries have low use, demand, and investment in
statistics, with donors (including the Bank) driving national surveys. The timing and

                                                                              CHAPTER 2
                              PREPARING THE GROUND: WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR POVERTY DATA
focus of surveys in such dependent situations is determined more by donor needs
than by country priorities.

Much of the Bank’s survey work has been trust-funded, even for the flagship LSMS
program, and donor interests have led the LSMS to focus on Africa and agriculture.
Reliance on trust-funded surveys has limited the Bank’s ability to scale up the
coverage and frequency of poverty monitoring. This will become increasingly
important, given the data needs for the World Bank Group to monitor progress
against the twin goals and to produce robust analytic work in the SCDs.

DONOR COORDINATION

Partnerships with bilateral and multilateral agencies have been integral to the Bank’s
support for statistical capacity building since the early 2000s (box 2.4). A 2011 IEG
evaluation of these global partnership programs found that they are generally
working well (IEG 2011b). Based on interviews with both recipient countries and
donor partners, the statistical capacity support generally meets user requests, is
consistent with recipient country priorities, and is responsive to changing
circumstances.

The Bank has played a convening role in some countries. In Guatemala starting in
the late 1990s, the government pushed hard to strengthen the public institutions in
charge of carrying out living standards surveys and generating poverty-related data.
Support for enhancing the National Statistics Institute’s capacity to map poverty and
proxy means tests contributed to the government’s targeting system for its
conditional cash transfer program, Mi Familia Progresa. 18 The support also
contributed to greater data transparency and helped achieve public consensus on
the measurement of poverty based on objective technical criteria. This facilitated the
production of poverty statistics and diagnostics.

CHAPTER 2
PREPARING THE GROUND: WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR POVERTY DATA

 Box 2-4. World Bank Participation in Partnerships for Building Statistical Capacity
 The most prominent statistics partnerships have been the Marrakech Action Plan for
 Statistics, Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century, Trust Fund for
 Statistical Capacity Building, Statistics for Results Facility, and International Household
 Survey Network (IHSN), as well as the Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) and
 LSMS-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture programs and the International Comparison
 Project. The major achievements of these partnerships include developing national
 strategies for statistics, easing access to data, coordinating definitions and protocols, and
 expanding census coverage to more countries. Collaboration with the United Nations and
 other partners has also grown. There has been somewhat less progress on implementing
 national strategies for statistics and ensuring the use of statistics for policy and planning.
 According to interviews with staff, the Bank’s leadership in open data since 2010 has been
 strengthened through partnerships within the Bank and with countries, other agencies,
 and the private sector. The partnership with Google has helped improve instant access to
 a number of datasets in the Bank’s open data website through Web searches.
 The Bank has many roles in partnerships to build statistical capacity—financial
 contributor, trustee, convener, chair of governing bodies, implementing agency, and a
 host of secretariats—and has made strong and relevant contributions over many years. In
 these partnerships, the Bank has drawn on such comparative advantages as strong
 technical skills, recognized technical leadership (including the long-running LSMS
 program), and connections to operations that sometimes financed statistics projects in
 client countries. Bank participation also enjoyed support from management and received
 funding from the Development Grant Facility, the corporate budget line for financing
 new partnerships.
 Partnership programs such as the IHSN can provide technical assistance to countries to
 improve their survey programs. Increasing the uptake and country ownership of statistics
 and surveys leads to the gradual transition out of donor dependency. Work with global
 and country partners can increase investments to improve the availability and quality of
 survey data (including income and non-income poverty data and related measures for
 shared prosperity) and nurture mechanisms such as administrative data and project-level
 data. One aim should be enhancing support for long-term data generation, particularly in
 low-income countries, by strengthening local capacity and demand for data and
 coordinating more with donor partners.

Challenges beyond Household Surveys
More than just household survey data are critical to public planning and supporting
allocative efficiency in budgets and service delivery. Data gaps extend to
international cross-country comparison initiatives as well—and the challenges are
greatest in countries where the information is needed most. In some instances, data
from different sources produce different numbers—World Bank and International


28
                                                                              CHAPTER 2
                              PREPARING THE GROUND: WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR POVERTY DATA
Monetary Fund data often differ, for example. Other data sources can also produce
confusion for policymakers and development partners. 19

The International Comparison Program (ICP) produces the estimates of purchasing
power parities (PPPs) used to monitor global poverty. Price levels for countries not
participating in the ICP are estimated by regression models. In 2005, 146 countries
participated (fewer participated in earlier years). 20 Country coverage in the 2011 ICP
data collection rose to 199 countries and territories, so comparable price data are
available for most countries. But changes between survey rounds and analytical
methods create uncertainty about comparability with earlier estimates and thus
about the time trends of extreme poverty. The lack of public access to the PPP data
means that alternative methodologies cannot be tested and independent calculations
of PPPs cannot be done.

Timely and accurate population data are essential for establishing the sample frame
for household survey data collection and for translating poverty rates into statistics
on the number of poor. If the population census is obsolete, particularly in a country
that is growing or otherwise demographically changing, it will produce an outdated
sampling frame and biased results that can undermine public service delivery and
planning systems. In Bangladesh, a country with a rapidly changing demographic
structure, the poverty estimate is 10 million (or 7 percent) lower using the latest 2011
population census than when using the population projection with the 2001 census
(World Bank 2015b). Similarly in the Philippines, analysis of changes in the
agricultural sector have been particularly troubled because the Census of
Agriculture is supposed to be conducted only once every 10 years, but the most
recent was conducted in 2002. The obsolete census weakened the accuracy of the
sample frame and biased the poverty estimates.

Administrative data from the operational records of the education and health
systems and other government programs are important for understanding the full
picture of poverty. 21 But many countries lack complete civil registration systems,
which are the principal source of vital statistics and intercensal demographic data.
Civil registration also provides birth records and marriage certificates that are
evidence of citizenship and legal rights. Although indicators from administrative
records cannot be used to measure correlations across characteristics at the
individual level, they provide valuable control totals for the aggregates derived
from surveys. When available at regular intervals, they are particularly useful for
measuring outcomes at higher frequencies than surveys can provide.

The most problematic discrepancy affecting income poverty statistics is the large
difference between the level and growth of per capita income and consumption in


                                                                                       29
CHAPTER 2
PREPARING THE GROUND: WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR POVERTY DATA
the national accounts and in income and expenditure surveys. Some differences are
definitional: consumption and income aggregates from the national accounts include
concepts that are not in household surveys, such as the value of bank intermediation
services. Others may arise from the difficulty in sampling very rich and very poor
people. Typically growth rates of consumption in surveys are one-third to one-half
those in the national accounts, which is troublesome because national account
growth rates are used to extrapolate surveys forward (World Bank 2015b). The Bank
could play a stronger role in improving the quality and consistency of data for all
dimensions of poverty through partnering with multiple agencies.


1 Considering the many challenges in poor countries, including conflict, violence, and all
sorts of deprivation, weak data can hinder the understanding of the poverty situation, even
if it might not be the immediate binding constraint to an effective poverty reduction
strategy.
2According to figures from PovcalNet, the number of surveys has declined since 2010.
Rather than implying a decline in surveys collected, this may be related to World Bank data
processing and reflective of the time it takes to clean data and make them available in the
PovcalNet platform. PovcalNet (database), World Bank, Washington, DC (accessed October
2014), http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/index.htm.
3In this report, unless otherwise specified, data availability refers to data available in the
Bank’s poverty data platform, PovcalNet. The increase in the number of surveys in
PovcalNet may be due either to more surveys being conducted or to improvements in
PovcalNet’s ability to collect information from countries. As of November 2014, the database
included 854 household surveys from 117 low- and middle-income countries, compared to
82 surveys from 79 countries at the end of the 1980s and 452 surveys from 123 countries at
the end of the 1990s.
4Many countries also had nationally, regionally, and zonally (rural/urban) representative
household surveys, with subnational information available at the state or district levels.
5Dating back to 1980, PovcalNet has data for 150 countries, of which 33 are now classified as
high-income economies, including some former “developing” or “transition” economies
such as Chile, Uruguay, Russia, and other eastern European countries, leaving 117 low- or
middle-income economies. The World Development Indicators lists 215 countries and
territories, of which 139 were classified as low- or middle-income in 2014.
6The international standard for the classification of consumption is the Classification of
Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP). See United Nations Statistics
Division, “Detailed structure and explanatory notes,” http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/
registry/regcst.asp?Cl=5 .
7In the past 20 years, Lao PDR has improved the implementation and analysis of its
household income and expenditure surveys, broadened the range of topics covered by the
surveys, and introduced additional methods to better capture cost differences between
urban and rural areas.

8 In Senegal, the household surveys were conducted at different times of the year and rural
sector well-being changes significantly after the annual harvest (October–December). The
first round of the survey (ESPS I) is particularly problematic as it was conducted following
the 2005 harvest, which likely resulted in an underestimation of the level of poverty. When
compared with information from the subsequent survey rounds, the data yields inaccurate
poverty trends.
9Countries have undertaken a variety of initiatives creating open access to government
information. See, for example, the recent Open Data Foundation review of 13 case studies
(Davies 2014).
International agencies have also adopted policies of free distribution of their databases. The
IMF, for example, has announced that as of January 1, 2015, its statistical databases will be
made available for free.
10   See the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics website, http://www.bbs.gov.bd.
11IHSN membership includes more than 20 organizations with a management group
consisting of representatives from World Bank, UNICEF, ILO, U.K. Department for
International Development, UNSD, PARIS21, UIS, FAO, and WHO.
12For more information on the Statistical Capacity Indicator, visit the Bulletin Board on
Statistical Capacity, http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/bulletin-board-on-statistical-
capacity.
13SCI overall scores were adjusted to remove two indicators related to poverty surveys. The
adjusted SCI overall scores were re-normed to a range of 0 to 100. The two items referred
specifically to production of poverty statistics―the availability of a recent HIES and the
timeliness of poverty estimates measured at the international poverty line.
14   See, for example, McKinsey Global Institute 2011.
15“Staff working on Blend countries were more likely (50 percent) to identify insufficient
political will within government as a main constraint as compared to staff working on IDA
(40 percent) and IBRD countries (34 percent).” See appendix C, paragraph 13.
16Matching the labor force surveys or Egypt Labor Market Panel Surveys with the HIES
could have provided additional information on poverty.
17There is limited information on whether the Egypt HIES captures the popoluation living
in informal areas. According to some estimates, the population living in the ancient
cemetery area near Cairo is on the order of 500,000 (see
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/29/city-of-the-dead-cairo_n_6044616.htm). On
people living in informal areas, see, for example, GTZ (2009), Cairo’s Informal Areas Between
Urban Challenges and Hidden Potentials: Facts. Voices. Visions.
18The program is sponsored by the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB), and the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean
(CEPAL), along with support from a number of other institutions and bilateral donors
(including UNDP, USAID, UNICEF, ILO, the Soros Foundation, Canada, Denmark,
Germany, Japan, Norway, and Sweden).

in the same year can be as high as 10 percentage points for some countries (such as Kenya
and Zambia) and trends of change can differ. While both numbers can be justified based on
the technical assumptions made, the gaps are nevertheless confusing for the broad
development community and policymakers attempting to understand the levels and trends
of changes in income/consumption distributions. See Ferreira and Lustig (forthcoming).
20Price levels for 21 out of 36 fragile states were based on a regression model (World Bank
2015a).
21Statistics based on administrative data often differ from those derived from surveys for
many reasons. The enrollment statistics in educational management information systems are
usually based on beginning-of-the-year enrollments. Survey data, such as those collected by
the DHS and MICS, record school attendance at an arbitrary mid-year date. Both may be
correct, they simply are measuring different events. Records of the health system record the
incidence of disease but only for those seeking care, leaving out the unserved.

3. Laying the Foundation: World Bank Support
for Poverty Diagnostics
 Highlights
  The Bank is considered a leader and valued partner in poverty diagnostics by governments and
    other stakeholders, providing an important global public good.
  The Bank’s Poverty Assessments (PAs) are generally of high technical quality and make good
   use of available data to derive poverty indicators, poverty profiles, and identify poverty drivers,
   but at times they inadequately synthesize knowledge on poverty in the country.
  The rigorousness of poverty diagnostics is often constrained by the quality and accessibility of
   data.
  Poverty Assessments could have had more impact if the diagnostics were better timed with
   political cycles and disseminated, and if their policy recommendations were more actionable or
   specific.


Poverty data provide the basis for identifying the poor and measuring poverty. But
understanding the constraints to reducing poverty requires solid analysis. Good
poverty diagnostics can not only pinpoint the symptoms of poverty but also identify
its causes and provide policy options. This chapter evaluates the technical quality of
the Bank’s poverty diagnostics, examines whether the diagnostics have provided the
needed guidance to country programs on poverty reduction, and identifies the
constraints. The evidence for this chapter is drawn primarily from a review of the
Bank’s Poverty Assessments (PAs) in 20 countries, supplemented by relevant
findings from country case studies, staff and stakeholder surveys, and focus group
meetings.


Technical Quality of Poverty Assessments
The Bank’s PAs are generally of high technical quality. Governments and other
stakeholders largely consider the Bank a global leader and valued partner in the
development of poverty diagnostics, acknowledging the Bank’s comparative
advantage in providing global knowledge products. 1 Three-quarters of government
and nongovernment stakeholders noted that PAs and Poverty and Social Impact
Analyses (PSIAs) provide well-grounded analysis and identify key constraints to
poverty reduction. 2 Bank staff expressed similar opinions about the quality of the
Bank’s poverty diagnostics. The views of both groups were corroborated by an in-
depth review of PAs in 20 countries and by the 10 country case studies.

The criteria to evaluate the quality of the 20 PAs are consistent with the World
Bank’s 2004 Guidance Note on Poverty Assessments by examining to what extent the
assessments:

     •     Provide background information on available poverty surveys and data
     •     Make good use of available survey and other data to provide a clear
           understanding of the extent and drivers of poverty
     •     Assess the adequacy of the countries’ poverty-reduction institutions,
           programs, and funding
     •     Evaluate poverty monitoring and evaluation arrangements
     •     Propose specific and actionable recommendations for reducing poverty
     •     Influence the countries’ poverty-reduction strategies and programs, help
           build in-country capacity, and support joint work and partnerships.

Although the 20 PAs varied considerably in their depth of analysis and coverage of
topics, the review consistently found three positive attributes. 3 Most of the PAs
reviewed make good use of the information available, produce clear poverty
profiles, and identify the main constraints to poverty reduction. Nearly all made use
of the available data and explored the obstacles to poverty reduction nationwide, in
the regions most affected, and across social groups. The review identified the
Ethiopia and Indonesia PAs as examples of good practice with strong poverty
diagnostics (box 3.1).


 Box 3-1. Good Practices for Poverty Assessments
 Well-Being and Poverty in Ethiopia: The Role of Agriculture and Agency (2005) and Making the
 New Indonesia Work for the Poor (2006) were particularly well suited to inform poverty-
 reduction policies and programs. Both assessments:
        Explicitly drew upon many data sources, provided full descriptions of the available
         information base, and concisely integrated other existing knowledge
        Made good use of all available surveys and other information through clear
         presentation of the extent and drivers of poverty, identification of excluded groups,
         detailed analysis of empowerment and governance, compelling assessments of
         remoteness and gender inequalities, and presentational features that showed how the
         poor experience poverty
        Integrated information about the governments’ key poverty-reduction institutions,
         strategies, funding, and programs (though neither assessment provided a discrete
         summary of those aspects)
        Included annexes with specific recommendations for capacity building and improving
         poverty-reduction monitoring and evaluation

Characteristics of the Poor and Drivers of Poverty Reduction

IDENTIFYING THE POOR

 The Bank’s diagnostic work typically describes a country’s poverty profile. When
survey data are of good quality and representative at disaggregated levels,
diagnostics usually estimate the national poverty headcount and, at least to some
extent, explore differences across geographic areas or zones (such as urban/rural,
valleys/hilltops). These diagnostics provide a picture of the characteristics of the
poor. Good-practice PAs (for example, Brazil, Egypt, India, Papua New Guinea, and
the Republic of Yemen) went further by undertaking or providing technical
assistance for detailed poverty mapping at the local level. Some diagnostics even
reported on vulnerability, seasonal poverty, transient and chronic poverty, and
inequality. The level of detail and focus on heterogeneity varies by country, but is
vital to targeted policy formulation to reduce poverty.


 Box 3-2. The Face of Poverty and Disadvantaged Groups
 Aggregate assessments of poverty can hide patterns of poverty incidence within a country.
 The social, economic, or political exclusion marginalized groups face can often intensify
 the severity of their deprivation. Good-practice PAs identify how multifaceted deprivation
 is related to the depth of poverty experienced by a certain group. For example:
 The 2010 Afghanistan PA found that the Kuchi (Pashtun nomads) “not only suffer from a
 higher prevalence of poverty, but the Kuchi poor are on average poorer compared to other
 groups” (World Bank, 2010b, 26)
 The 2011 India PA found that “scheduled tribes lag 20 years behind the general
 population” and “caste has been the predominant marker of deprivation and privilege in
 India” (World Bank 2011d, 227).
 The 2006 Lao PDR PA found that “ethnic minorities account for one-third of the
 population but make up more than half the poor” (World Bank 2006b, 129).
 The 2004 Moldova PA found that “many groups additionally face impediments imposed
 by social barriers and norms―their multiple levels of deprivation are compounded by
 social exclusion and discrimination within society” (World Bank 2004c, 11).




                                                                                               35
CHAPTER 3
LAYING THE FOUNDATION: WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR POVERTY DIAGNOSTICS
Several PAs (including Afghanistan, India, Lao PDR, Moldova, and the Republic of
Yemen) went beyond the typical analysis of poverty’s determinants. They examined
more deeply the well-being of marginalized ethnic minorities, indigenous peoples,
tribal groups, castes, and other excluded groups, using both income and non-income
indicators and reviews of sociological and anthropological literature, as described in
box 3.2. Such analytic work is essential for understanding what challenges the poor
and vulnerable face and how policies may affect marginalized populations.

DRIVERS OF POVERTY REDUCTION

The main drivers of poverty reduction identified and discussed in the majority of
country cases include growth, distribution, education, health, social protection, and
employment. Most poverty diagnostics examined the key drivers of income and
non-income poverty at the national, regional, and zonal (rural/urban) levels, and
across social groups. They considered determinants of the changes in poverty
incidence over time (such as growth and distributional changes) and explored the
obstacles to poverty reduction nationwide, in the regions and areas most affected,
and across social groups.

Intense research during the past decade highlighted the complex nature of the forces
behind poverty reduction (box 3.3). Although there is now greater agreement on the
types of deprivation that are bad for both poverty reduction and growth (for
example, child malnutrition), there remain unresolved analytical and empirical
issues on the exact nature of “inclusive growth,” and on the nature and magnitude
of various trade-offs between growth and distribution.

Many country case studies provide good examples of how growth and inequality play
a role in poverty reduction. Bangladesh showed negative or no effect of growth on
poverty reduction because of inequality in the 1990s and early 2000s, and then saw
redistribution facilitate poverty reduction in later years. Romania demonstrated both
the negative effects of a decline in growth on poverty in the 1990s and early 2000s
(though it was mitigated by improved income distribution) and the positive effects of
improved growth, leading to a decline in poverty (with a small contribution from
lower inequality). Guatemala experienced modest declines in poverty accompanied
by growth between 2000 and 2006, with modest reductions in inequality, but nearly
no change in extreme poverty levels. From 2006 to 2011, Guatemala had the same
growth rate as the preceding period, but an increase in poverty incidence and a
significant decrease in extreme poverty. 4 The Philippines diagnostics discuss the
growth paradox in which poverty rose despite growth, concluding that it may
partially be due to “limited dynamism” of growth coupled with high degrees of
inequality.

 Box 3-3. Literature on the Drivers of Poverty Reduction

 A large amount of research has examined the growth-inequality-poverty nexus and
 provided theoretical and empirical evidence for the broad drivers of, and impediments to,
 poverty reduction.
 One strand of the literature has tried to answer the question of how much the poor benefit
 from aggregate economic growth. Seminal cross-country studies found that growth in
 average income is highly correlated with poverty reduction (Ravallion and Chen 1997;
 Ravallion 2001). This strand of the literature argues that economic growth is of central
 importance for poverty reduction, and growth is a primary determinant of the variation
 in the decline (Kraay 2006; World Bank 2005b; Gasparini and others 2007; Dollar and
 others 2014).
 Another strand of the literature emphasizes the role of distribution and the
 interdependence among growth, inequality, and poverty reduction. It argues that the
 effect of growth on poverty reduction is greater in low-inequality countries because the
 growth elasticity of poverty reduction in low-inequality countries is several times larger
 than that observed in high-inequality countries (Ravallion 1997, 2007; Lustig and others
 2002; Bourguignon 2004; World Bank 2005b; Fosu 2010). The empirical finding shows that
 inequality not only has a negative impact on economic growth (Herzer and Vollmer 2012;
 Benjamin and others 2010; Knowles 2005; Voitchovsky 2005), but also on its sustainability
 over time (Berg and others 2012). Initial inequality levels, in particular, initial differences
 in human capital and social exclusion, could play an important role in determining how
 growth can influence poverty reduction (Ravallion 2001).
 Yet another strand of the literature highlights the role of growth composition in poverty
 reduction. It argues that growth in service sectors, which often absorb low-skilled
 workers, shows more poverty reduction power than that in agriculture or industry. Initial
 urbanization could enhance access to markets and infrastructure, thus positively
 influencing the poverty impact of nonagricultural growth (Ravallion and Datt 1996;
 Ferreira and others 2010).
 Some empirical studies show that growth in labor-intensive sectors contributes the most
 to poverty decline (Loayza and Raddatz 2006; Christiaensen and Demery 2007), and some
 recent decomposition exercises highlight the importance of labor income as the main
 factor behind poverty decline (Inchauste and others 2012). At the same time, other studies
 explored the heterogeneity of initial conditions in human capital accumulation and the
 role of growth in nonlabor-intensive sectors (Ravallion and Datt 2002).


Among the 20 PAs, some themes and drivers were more important in some Regions
than others. The three Europe and Central Asia countries highlighted the roles of
national and international migration, employment, labor markets, and social
protection systems and programs. For the three Middle East and North Africa
countries, social protection systems and programs were most important.



                                                                                               37
CHAPTER 3
LAYING THE FOUNDATION: WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR POVERTY DIAGNOSTICS
Growth is most often identified in poverty diagnostics as the key driver of poverty
reduction (in 7 of the 10 country cases). But the type of growth (or its inclusiveness)
is also crucial. The 2008 Bangladesh PA characterized poverty reduction as driven
by a social and economic transformation that was increasing returns to the assets of
the poor, primarily in higher wages, especially for nonfarm employment. Increasing
labor force participation of women and overall increases in education also
contributed to reducing poverty. Education and health were repeatedly identified
and analyzed as key drivers of poverty reduction in both the country cases and the
PAs. Almost all PAs explored the impact of access to education and health services
on poverty reduction, and additional sectoral work such as Public Expenditure
Reviews (PERs) delved further into the links between education, health, and poverty
reduction.

Linking growth to poverty reduction requires jobs, particularly productive jobs, 5
and the pattern of growth and job creation affects the responsiveness of poverty
reduction to that growth. The quality and depth of labor market analysis and
recommendations for generating more jobs has varied. In the Philippines, several
pieces of recent diagnostic work—particularly the 2013 Philippine Development
Report 6—explored the relationship between the pattern of growth and job creation.
Weak growth in productive jobs domestically was identified as a constraint to
inclusive growth and poverty reduction, and the linkages between migration,
remittances, and poverty incidence were highlighted. In Nigeria, the 2009 Nigeria
Employment and Growth Study was critical to the Bank’s dialogue on non-oil growth.
It asserted that jobs and poverty reduction were synonymous (when combined with
agricultural growth) and flagged employment as a major driver for poverty
reduction. But it did not make explicit links to household income poverty analysis,
unbundle recommendations, or distinguish among the nonpoor, the moderately
poor, and the poorest. The weak link between real wage growth and poverty
reduction was not explained.

A good practice for PAs is to identify the relationship between growth and poverty
reduction, calculate growth incidence curves, and project poverty outcomes using
the poverty-growth correlation (Bourguignon 2004). In Bangladesh, growth
incidence curves differentiated the patterns of poverty reduction and inequality
between the two halves of the 2000–2010 decade. In Malawi, drawing from panel
survey data, the PA showed crucial differences in changes in income among
different segments of the rural population: real incomes of the rural poor are falling,
and only the better-off households’ experience growth in real expenditures. But in
less convincing cases, such as Nigeria, PAs linked macroeconomics, growth, and
poverty reduction only at a high level of generality, without clearly identifying
channels for “trickling down.”

                         LAYING THE FOUNDATION: WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR POVERTY DIAGNOSTICS
Existing diagnostic work makes a convincing case that improvements in social
development contribute to poverty reduction. Social development is generally
understood to encompass equity and social justice, including social inclusion,
sustainable livelihoods, gender equity, and increased voice and participation. Social
exclusion hampers the ability of people from disadvantaged groups to participate in
social and economic life. It results from and represents structural inequities that lie
at the heart of much inequality. In many developing countries, although the better-
off enjoy a living standard similar to those in the developed world, the poorer
segment of the population faces severe challenges in many non-income dimensions,
including the persistence of child malnutrition, high maternal mortality, and low
(particularly girl) school enrollment.

The Bank’s diagnostic work on poverty at times offers useful information to guide
targeting interventions to address social development and exclusion. In Romania,
since re-engaging in the early 1990s, the Bank identified gaps in coverage, targeting,
and integration of social protection arrangements and provided actionable
recommendations to address issues in health service delivery. The primary aim was
to restructure services toward better hospitals—with more care provided by
ambulatory and primary care services—and to seek savings in such areas as
expensive, unnecessary medications. In Guatemala, the poverty diagnostics focused
on more direct interventions to reach the poor, such as conditional cash transfers
(CCTs), and on stronger efforts to equalize access to productive infrastructure and
social services. Extreme poverty seemed to respond well to CCTs introduced in the
latter 2000s, providing useful analytical underpinning for the interventions.

Social delivery systems determine the access to and quality of basic services for the
poor, often relying on subnational governments. Local institutional capacity,
particularly in the poorest municipalities, determines the effectiveness of additional
transfers from the center to the front lines of service delivery. This is the case in Peru
after a strong decentralization reform. In Nigeria, federalism and decentralization—
overlaid with sizable resources from oil revenue—complicated the formulation and
implementation of the Bank’s program. A lesson learned from the Nigeria case is
that greater emphasis on governance, stronger subnational engagement, a sharper
focus on results, and appropriate choices in the design and selection of lending
instruments can increase the impact of pro-poor social service delivery.

Timeliness and Dissemination
The time between data collection and assessment completion has improved, but many
assessments still work with outdated information. In the staff survey, 37 percent of
respondents identified the delay between the release of analytical work and the


                                                                                        39

drafting of country strategies as one of the most important constraints to developing
country strategies. 7 There were no significant variations across respondents mapped
to the Bank’s Regions. 8 Shorter and more regular poverty notes and updates were
seen as having greater potential for being used (both by the clients and the country
teams) than longer but less timely PAs. For example, a large PA right before the
Country Partnership Strategy process starts may have less impact than regular
poverty updates submitted to the country team. Thirteen of the 20 PAs were
completed within three years of a survey to estimate the poverty headcount (table
3.1).

Understanding the impact of public expenditure and revenue policies on the poor is
central to informing policymaking. But fewer than half of the country strategies in
FY2004–2013 were preceded by PERs in the previous three years (table 3.2). Two-
thirds of PERs discussed reorienting public spending to benefit the poor, and two-
fifths conducted (or referred to) incidence analysis and looked into the distributional
impacts of public policies. Of the 146 PSIAs since FY2004, roughly 40 percent were
explicitly referred to when designing budget lending policy operations.

Reaching a wide array of stakeholders can improve the impact of poverty
diagnostics on strategy formulation. The PAs would have benefitted from better
communication and wider dissemination.

The July 2004 Guidance Note on Poverty Assessments called for wide dissemination of
“the results of poverty work within the Bank and outside” to “ensure strong
linkages between PAs, the development of CASs, and the design of lending
operations and nonlending activities” (World Bank 2004a). There are several
examples of successful partnerships with the government that strengthened the
dissemination of poverty diagnostics. The report Poverty in Lao PDR 2008: Lao
Expenditure and Consumption Survey 1992/03–2007/08 benefitted from extensive
consultation and dissemination, such as a launch workshop, dissemination to
universities and provinces, and online access, including statistics and information in
Laotian. In the Philippines, the key findings of Bank analytical work are frequently
disseminated to both stakeholders and the public through events in the World Bank
Manila Office and in World Bank Knowledge for Development Centers throughout
the country. 9

In several instances, it appears the Bank did not adequately focus on communicating
with stakeholders, which limited the impact and effectiveness of the diagnostics. In
Nigeria, Bank outreach was quite limited. No one interviewed outside the Bank was
aware of any of the Bank’s three PAs produced since 2004. 10

Lack of time and budget, along with lack of support from the professional
communications team to create targeted messages were cited by focus group
participants as main constraints to effective dissemination of findings and
collaboration with government counterparts. The focus group participants also noted
that more institutional recognition is often given to large poverty assessments, and the
Bank does too little to disseminate the findings of its smaller poverty related work,
either internally or to its country clients.


Constraints to Poverty Diagnostics
Data remain a severe constraint to the depth and rigor of poverty diagnostics in some
countries. For example, of the 20 PAs reviewed, 10 had at most one round of
household surveys since 2000 and could not establish poverty trends. 11 The depth,
rigor, and usefulness of diagnostics vary considerably across countries, related to a


                                                                                                                       41

significant extent to the variation in the availability, quality, and accessibility of data.
Although some PA task teams tried to use other sources of information and draw on
their country knowledge, the reliability of results was tenuous. One-third of the
respondents to the Bank staff survey identified insufficient poverty data as the main
constraint to carrying out PAs and PSIAs. Not surprisingly, concerns about data were
stronger among staff working on fragile and conflict-affected states and countries
with limited data. In several instances, weak data limited the ability to draw
meaningful conclusions and make credible recommendations (box 3.4).


 Box 3-4. Weak Data Limit the Scope and Robustness of Poverty Diagnostics
 Nigeria accounts for about 7 percent of the world’s extreme poor, yet high-quality data on
 the poor are not consistently available. When Nigeria: Poverty and Vulnerability: A
 Preliminary Diagnostic (2004) was being prepared (it was never finalized), the most recent
 data were from a 1996 household consumption survey and a 2003 Core Welfare Indicator
 Questionnaire. The assessment provided only limited insights into Nigeria’s poverty
 profile and its drivers of poverty. Weak data also limited the scope of the most recent 2013
 PA. Methodological issues impaired the comparability of survey data between the 2004
 and 2010 surveys, which limited the Bank’s ability to take more effective measures to
 reduce poverty.
 Limited access to the full data sets made it difficult to assess the quality of Egypt’s
 poverty data, at least until the 2010 revolution. Compounded by the challenges in using
 the administrative price and the concentration of households at relatively low levels of
 consumption, poverty estimates are highly sensitive to the choice of poverty lines. Using
 estimates from the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics, some poverty
 diagnostics may have missed the increasing vulnerability of migrant workers in the
 informal sector in urban areas, even though the diagnostics correctly identified poor
 households in Upper Egypt. This may have failed to provide a robust signal to
 policymaking.

PAs could have had more impact if the analysis of institutional aspects of poverty had
been stronger; if the policy advice had been more specific and actionable; and if the
analysis had gone beyond economic considerations to fully take into account the
social—and particularly the political—framework for removing obstacles to poverty
reduction. The majority of PAs reviewed paid inadequate attention to the political
context of the economy, such as government institutions, strategies, and funding for
poverty reduction. The inadequate coverage of institutional dimensions and the
deeply rooted political economy likely limited the impact of the diagnostics. None of
the 20 PAs provided a comprehensive discussion of the key actors and funding
resources for poverty reduction, and none positioned these actors and resources in the
context of government poverty-reduction strategies and programs.

                        LAYING THE FOUNDATION: WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR POVERTY DIAGNOSTICS
For Bangladesh, the three PAs produced during 2004–2012 treated public
expenditure and administration primarily as a technocratic issue and did not
broaden the analysis to consider the underlying political economy. Much of the
institutional, policy, and program context for poverty reduction was instead
contained in poverty-related sector work (especially in education, health, and social
protection), although the PAs concentrated on the drivers of poverty. For Senegal,
the analysis did not explicitly discuss the social and political constraints to
implementing policy.

Synthesizing knowledge inside or outside the Bank is often beyond the coverage of a
PA. The 2004 Guidance Note on Poverty Assessments requires “an analytical synthesis of
the existing body of knowledge on (i) assessments of the poverty situation, (ii)
analyses of the impact of growth and public actions on poverty, and (iii) appraisals of
poverty monitoring and evaluation systems. Despite these requirements, none of the
PAs included an analytical synthesis of knowledge (that is, in-country knowledge of
poverty, relevant sectoral issues, or on donor programs). Only five of the 20 PAs
reviewed, including the two good-practice PAs of Ethiopia and Indonesia,
summarized the governments’ overall poverty-reduction strategies or explained how
the PAs would contribute to the development of those strategies. This deficiency left
Bank staff in a weak position to mobilize and use knowledge on poverty more
comprehensively, and to know which government actors to engage in dialogue.

Better engagement of beneficiaries and using existing (or commissioning new)
participatory or qualitative analyses would enrich poverty profiles and inform
poverty diagnostics. Of the 20 PAs, at least 15 referred to participatory analysis and
qualitative information. But only five were well informed by and directly included
participatory analysis and qualitative information (Democratic Republic of Congo,
Indonesia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mozambique, and Papua New Guinea). These five
set standards for good practice. For example, in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s
PA, the description of who the poor were, how they experienced poverty, and what
their priorities were for overcoming poverty was heavily influenced by participatory
analysis and a 2004 opinion survey.

Good Practices and Lessons
Robust poverty diagnostics in some countries have identified the challenges faced
by the poor and the corresponding policy interventions. In Malawi, the Bank’s
diagnostic work focused on ways to reverse stunting 12 and helped to inform the
Nutrition and HIV/AIDs project that has worked to promote sustained
improvements in child nutrition. But when robust and timely diagnostics are absent,
the recommended policy interventions suffer. In Liberia, the Bank’s estimate of


                                                                                      43
CHAPTER 3
LAYING THE FOUNDATION: WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR POVERTY DIAGNOSTICS
timber output and revenue collection were too optimistic. The unbalanced support
favored commercial goals at the expense of community forest management and
conservation.13 The resumption of large-scale commercial logging (which did little
to enhance local livelihoods) did not yield the expected benefits in terms of growth
or poverty reduction.

Well-executed Bank diagnostics make a real policy difference by improving
information transparency and putting poverty into the national discourse with a
technical perspective. In Guatemala, poverty maps and means testing became part of
the government’s public programs and strategic planning. 14 In the Philippines, the
World Bank’s poverty diagnostics helped set the agenda and policy discourse (IEG
2007). The Lao PDR PA identified the concentration of extreme poverty in the
Priority Districts and helped target Bank support for basic infrastructure, education,
health, and other social services in these areas, which disproportionately benefitted
the extreme poor, ethnic minorities, and other disadvantaged groups.

In some PAs, a focus on the non-income dimensions of poverty helped address key
constraints to poverty reduction. In Romania, the PA supported the production of
poverty and exclusion maps, using data from the census and household surveys
such as information on deprivation (nutrition, durables, housing), education, health,
and employment, and (from a specially designed survey) on social capital of the
different segments of the population. In Cambodia, a policy and program impact
assessment underpinned the Education Sector Support Project (Filmer and Schady
2006). In Georgia, the Bank sponsored work to improve the efficacy and efficiency of
social protection programs and the targeting of poverty alleviation funds.

Special attention to the demand side of service delivery in some countries tailored
interventions to meet the needs of the poor. In Peru, pockets of extreme poverty are
concentrated in rural indigenous groups, so their demand for and use of social
services depends on how the services are aligned to their cultural practices. The 2005
Peru Poverty Assessment used an integrated (general equilibrium) approach to
examine not only the supply side of growth and sustainability issues, but also the
demand side, including social services used by the poor. The programmatic
analytical and advisory assistance program RECURSO (derived from the Spanish
acronym for Rendimiento de Cuentas para los Resultados Sociales, meaning
Accountability for Social Responsibility) identified the needed actions to improve
incentives on the supply side to provide adaptive services to the poorest segments of
the population (for example, ethnic minorities and the disadvantaged).

Poverty diagnostics can and have been tailored to country specifics and provided
concrete recommendations. In Lao PDR, the PAs provided a good understanding of

extreme poverty and of the special concerns of poor women and upland ethnic
minority groups. They also set priorities for poverty reduction measures, and
provided a credible framework and menu of options that contributed to effective
dialogue with the government, international development partners, and other
parties. In Malawi, the Bank’s diagnostic work provided concrete recommendations
to address obstacles to reducing poverty, considering the Malawian context and
drawing on a broader body of analysis beyond that of the Bank.15 In Romania, a joint
Bank-UNICEF report conducted a rapid assessment of the impact of the 2009 crisis.
The Bank also used 2011 census data to update Romania’s poverty map, and
supported development of poverty and inclusion indicators at the subnational level
by including data on marginalized communities in a recently published report.
These efforts responded to an increased focus on inclusion.

Few diagnostic works have realized their full potential for deepening the analysis of
the social and political dimensions of poverty—they miss an opportunity to deepen
analysis of social inclusion and strengthen policy impact to advance the Bank’s
overarching goal for greater inclusion. Social exclusion hinders the ability of people
from disadvantaged groups to participate in social and economic life. It is often the
reason why gains in health, education, employment, and prosperity systematically
bypass people from disadvantaged groups. No single institutional arrangement for
ensuring such inclusion will be optimal for all societies. How a society provides
opportunities for inclusion is context- and time-dependent, linked to the political
economy and power-sharing arrangements and whether the poor have a voice in
determining national economic policies.


1The Bank produces many poverty-related diagnostics, including Poverty and Social Impact
Analyses, Public Expenditure Reviews, and Country Economic Memoranda. But the
evidence for this chapter is drawn primarily from a review of the Bank’s Poverty
Assessments in 20 countries, supplemented by findings from the case studies, staff and
stakeholder surveys, and focus group meetings.
2 The overall positive assessment of the quality of the PAs is broadly consistent with the key
findings of the previous analysis presented in OED’s 2004 Annual Review of Development
Effectiveness: The World Bank’s Contributions to Poverty Reduction and the 2003 Quality
Assuarance Group Assessment Quality of ESW in FY02.
3The 20 PA countries were purposively selected to (a) provide equal coverage of each of the
Bank’s six regions (four countries each for Africa and East Asia and the Pacific, and three
countries each for the other four regions), (b) include countries with greater rates of poverty
either as a proportion of the developing world’s poor, or as a share of country population,
and (c) cover at least one weak-data country in each region.

4The increase in poverty is thought to be linked to a global decline in remittance flows. The
decline in extreme poverty is thought to be linked to public sector efforts to expand and
better target social safety nets, and to ramp up social spending. The decline is also linked to
a significant decline in inequality between 2006 and 2011, most notably in rural areas where
most of the extreme poor are concentrated.
5A job not only produces income to support consumption and to provide resources for the
future (such as providing education, health care, and assets for family members), it also
contributes to self-esteem, a sense of personal security, and even social cohesion.

Growth (2010); 2011 Philippines Development Report: Generating Inclusive Growth to Uplift the

7The release of the analytical work may have been timed to inform government decision
making and not the CAS timing.
8But 46 percent of staff working on FCS countries believed these delays to be a constraint,
compared with 36 percent for non-FCS countries.
9There are 12 centers throughout the country in seven different universities as well as an
inside of an array of research centers, such as the Congressional Policy and Budget Research
Department of the House of Representatives.
10Part of the reason for the weak dissemination was the political environment, particularly
given the sensitivity of the poverty numbers in the country. While outside the scope of the
IEG study period, the IEG mission observed the importance the Bank team is giving to the
communication of the next 2014 Nigeria Economic Report whose special topic is Poverty.
11The selection of the PAs in countries with weak data in the review is to reflect the
challenges of conducting PAs with limited information. This does not reflect the share of
PAs with weak data to the total of the PAs.
12In Malawi, the Bank partnered with USAID to produce a report on barriers and facilitators
to infant and young child feeding. The report drew on multiple sources of information,
including an anthropological study on feeding practices, covering three regions in Malawi.
See: IYCN Project 2011.
13The advice from the World Bank Group led the government to believe that forest products
would yield $108 million in revenues for the period 2007–11 on a timber volume of 3.3
million cubic meters. In reality, only 5 percent of forest concessions reached the production
stage, while revenue collection was roughly $10 million—less than one-tenth of projections.
(cited from IEG 2012b).
14These instruments either did not exist in Guatemala, or existed only in very rudimentary
form, until the 2003 PA was prepared. Before then, this topic was considered too sensitive to
discuss in view of the country’s historical and political circumstances.
15In Malawi, the diagnostics had breadth of coverage with a strong team leader facilitating
collaboration among a cross-sectoral team, although inevitably some parts of the country
team engaged more than others.

4. Framing the Structure: Formulating Country
Strategies
 Highlights
  The Bank’s country strategies have been broadly consistent with its poverty diagnostics and
    oriented toward poverty reduction.
  Poverty diagnostics often provided strong technical analysis, but the lack of actionable guidance
   limited their direct relevance for strategy and policy design.
  When serious poverty challenges combine with weak government commitment to poverty
   reduction, the Bank often faces a dilemma: to disengage or engage in areas tangential to
   poverty priorities. Political factors and uncertain opportunity then complicate the country
   assistance strategy.
  When the Bank is relatively small financially, coordination with development partners and
   selectivity should help focus the Bank’s role toward areas of comparative advantage.


Poverty diagnostics play a key role in identifying characteristics of the poor and the
constraints they face. This chapter examines the factors that condition the poverty
focus of the Bank’s country strategies. It explores the extent to which country
strategies and planned operational portfolios, as indicated in the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) and Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) documents, are consistent
with the poverty diagnostics discussed in chapter 3, and discusses the role of
coordination and collaboration. The evidence is drawn primarily from the country
case studies and a review of Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report Reviews
(CASCRRs) and Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report Reviews
(CPSCRRs), 1 triangulated by findings from the staff survey, stakeholder survey, and
focus group meetings.

Factors that Condition the Poverty Focus of Country Strategies
ACTIONABLE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS OF POVERTY DIAGNOSTICS
Poverty diagnostics better inform the formulation of poverty-focused country
strategies when they provide actionable policy recommendations. The Lao PDR 2010
PA, for example, was of high technical quality and was closely tailored to country
conditions. It produced a consolidated list of poverty-reduction measures that were
mapped to, and consistent with, the government’s National Socioeconomic
Development Plan. Based on the analysis, the PA recommended construction of
complete primary schools and emphasized raising schooling completion and
continuation rates, expanding education access to disadvantaged groups, and

CHAPTER 4
FRAMING THE STRUCTURE: FORMULATING COUNTRY STRATEGIES
increasing funding for recurrent expenditures. These suggestions were addressed in
the CAS through the 2010 Education for All ―Fast Track Initiative, which focused on
primary education for “the most educationally disadvantaged students.” Similarly,
the PA’s recommendation to target Priority Districts (despite their lower
populations) was addressed by the 2011 Poverty Reduction Fund 2 project, which
focused on 38 districts (many or most of them Priority Districts).

However, few PAs reviewed provided policymakers with adequate information
about the costs and benefits of particular recommendations. For example, the
Guatemala PAs (2003 and 2009), despite providing specific, prioritized, and time-
bound recommendations, lacked a clear results chain and quantitative links between
recommended measures and reduced poverty. In much of the diagnostic work, it
was possible to predict the impact of certain interventions on particular outcomes
(such as increased spending on education or health). But the results chain linking
Bank operations to social indicators and then to poverty had a large element of
uncertainty. There is clearly a need to better prepare consolidated and prioritized
summary lists of recommendations and to better define costs, timing, administrative
responsibilities, and funding sources for those recommendations.

GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT
Government commitment to poverty reduction is a key determinant of the focus on
poverty in strategies and project selection. Of the staff survey respondents, two-
fifths perceived government disinterest as a major obstacle to translating diagnostic
work into Bank strategy. This result is also supported by the country studies. In
Romania, Bank diagnostics found high geographic income disparities across urban,
rural, and regional groups in the 2000s. The Bank’s Rural and Regional
Development Loan is focused on social and economic regeneration and is based on
poverty diagnostics. However, country fragmentation and delegation of power to
sub regional entities complicated the efforts. The loan was not prepared due to the
lack of Romanian counterparts to champion it, though it was listed in the 2006 CAS.

In Egypt, despite some progress toward the Millennium Development Goals,
substantial regional disparities and high concentrations of poverty persist. Public
Expenditure Reviews or Public Investment Reviews would have been highly
relevant to poverty-reduction strategy formulation and related policy design. Yet
prior to the 2010 revolution, the government did not allow the Bank to do such
analytic work on a regular basis. The Bank tried to maintain a working relationship
and engage a strategically important client. Egypt did not prioritize borrowing from
the Bank for poverty reduction or social sector development. Although the strategy
formulated by the Bank over the years attempted to include some focus on poverty,
governments in Egypt during the evaluation period (FY2004–2012) generally

                                    FRAMING THE STRUCTURE: FORMULATING COUNTRY STRATEGIES
resisted these efforts. There needs to be better selectivity in terms of the Bank’s
engagement in poverty reduction.

The Bank operates in a complex environment in which the poverty focus of
government strategy conditions the Bank’s ability to focus its country strategy on
poverty. In cases where there is weak government commitment to poverty-
reduction objectives, the Bank faces a challenge in promoting a poverty focus. Weak
commitment can arise for several reasons: for example perceived risks to political
support arising from ‘pro-poor policies’, elite capture and cronyism, or even
ideological commitment to ‘trickle-down’ theories of development. Politically
feasible opportunities for Bank engagement in such cases will depend critically on
country context. There is no recipe book. But tools to strengthen engagement include
high-quality and timely diagnostics, sustained policy dialogue, and technical
assistance to better orient the country program toward addressing principle
constraints to poverty reduction. The Bank can remain prepared through piloting
projects, and identifying windows of opportunity to scale support when
circumstances permit.

The Philippines provides an example of this point. It is a middle-income country
with challenging political economy issues and deeply rooted vested interests, and it
has been challenging for the Bank to appropriately balance supporting government
priorities and institutionalizing difficult reforms needed to foster more sustained
and inclusive growth. During periods of low government commitment to poverty
reduction, the Bank focused its support on key interventions (see paragraph 4.16)
and helped to identify appropriate areas for additional interventions, laying the
ground work for reform. The Bank used Discussion Notes and formal and informal
dialogue as vehicles to provide sectoral and thematic analyses that identified key
challenges and prioritized actions to help shape and inform policy discussions. The
political changes that occurred after the 2010 presidential election opened new space
for reforms and improvements in the political and institutional environment of the
Philippines, enabling the Bank to bring greater poverty focus to the country
program and scaling up the successfully piloted conditional cash transfer (CCT)
programs.

Obstacles to focusing on poverty can also include conflicting objectives in the Bank
strategy. In Bangladesh, for example, the 2011 CAS had a broad sectoral mix of
investments, including assistance to the transformative $1.2 billion Padma bridge
project, which clearly addressed the regional integration highlighted in the 2008 PA.
After the project’s approval, allegations of corruption involving a senior government
official led to a review and renegotiation. The Bank then cancelled the project. 2 It
also withdrew from other infrastructure and energy investments, including the

CHAPTER 4
FRAMING THE STRUCTURE: FORMULATING COUNTRY STRATEGIES
proposed Poverty Reduction Support Credit. In this case, the Bank made a tough
choice and sacrificed its poverty-reduction objective for its governance objective.


Consistency between Formulated Country Strategies and Poverty Diagnostics
Overall Bank strategies (CASs and CPSs) have been broadly consistent with
underlying poverty data and diagnostics, though the priorities, mode of
intervention, and instruments used vary across countries. A majority of respondents
to the staff survey (72 percent) believe that the Bank’s country strategies address the
causes of poverty, although to varying degrees.

Growth, employment/poverty reduction, and social service delivery (specifically for
health and education) or modest variants on these are typically the main pillars of the
Bank’s country strategies (box 4.1). The Bank’s program in Romania consistently used
the same three pillars of Bank assistance throughout the past decade:
growth/employment, public sector development/reform, and poverty
reduction/inclusion. During the 2000s, the Bank’s strategies in Nigeria focused on
similar issues such as human development (particularly social service delivery in
health and education), agricultural productivity, growth, and governance. In Malawi,
the 2006 CAS objectives addressed poverty through vulnerability, agriculture,
education, and nutrition after the 2006 poverty assessment.

In supporting a government’s poverty-reduction strategy, the Bank’s country
strategies link achievement of country priorities to lending and analytical activities
by the Bank. The Bank can influence country priorities related to poverty reduction
by using high-quality and timely diagnostics to underpin its policy dialogue with
the government. The Bank can also deploy its resources to support the elements of
country strategy that will have the greatest impact on poverty reduction.

Both the general strategy and the planned lending and nonlending instruments
appear generally well aligned with the Bank’s poverty diagnostics. That is, the
objectives of the strategic plan are consistent with priorities identified by poverty
diagnostics. This is clear from country examples. The 2008 Guatemala CPS proposed
a project (Expanding Opportunities for Vulnerable Groups) directly mapped to the
2009 PA, and recommended strengthening the country’s CCT program. Extensive
nonlending activities were proposed to support its poverty-related loan portfolio,
anchored in periodic PAs and PA Updates. In Lao PDR, the 2012 CPS reflected
recommendations of the 2006 PA to support lagging regions and districts with
concentrated poverty. In Bangladesh, poverty diagnostics emphasized private
sector–led growth, human development, and vulnerability with links to climate

change, disaster preparedness, and management—all themes were reflected in
country strategies. In Peru, the CPSs are consistent with the main priorities set in the
diagnostic work, and the planned portfolio focuses on the main areas identified in
the diagnostic, from connectivity and access for the rural poor to improved delivery
of social services.


 Box 4-1. Poverty Focus of the Objectives of the Bank’s Country Strategies
 A review of the 66 countries that had at least two CPSCRRs during the evaluation period shows
 that the Bank seeks multiple objectives, with much variation in specifics. The number of countries
 pursuing at least one objective directly related to poverty increased over time (see figure, below).a
 Based on analysis of poverty-related pillars and objectives in country strategies―those defined as
 “poverty,” “education,” “health,” “social protection,” “social development,” “agriculture and rural
 development,” or “basic infrastructure” (for example, water and sanitation) ― education and
 health objectives tended to dominate, though social development and social protection objectives
 have become more important over time.b

 Note: CPS= Country Partnership Strategy
 a. The 66 countries used for this analysis each had two CASCRRs/CPSCRRs during the period of evaluation (FY 2004–
 2012), the first period was covered by the first CASCRRs/CPSCRRs, and the second by the second
 CASCRRs/CPSCRRs. The first period and the second period are not the same for every country.
 b. There is no a priori judgment whether direct or indirect poverty focus interventions is more effective in poverty
 reduction. The optimal combination of the two depends on the specific context of each country. To assess the poverty
 focus of country strategies, a data base was assembled from the CASCRRs/CPSCRRs covering basic country data, with a
 list of CPS pillars and objectives was obtained from the Bank’s Business Warehouse database. There is no coding that
 allows the poverty categorization of CAS pillars and objectives. In an imperfect way, poverty-related pillars and
 objectives were broadly defined as those that directly focused on “poverty,” “education,” “health,” “social protection,”
 “social development,” “agriculture and rural development” and “basic infrastructure.” See appendix F for details.




The Poverty Reduction Support Program (PRSP) process appeared to be a useful
vehicle in aligning the poverty focus of the government’s development priorities
and the poverty diagnostics. Strategies in International Development Association
countries often directly linked to the country’s PRSP and the government’s

CHAPTER 4
FRAMING THE STRUCTURE: FORMULATING COUNTRY STRATEGIES
development priorities. In the 2000s the CASs for both Bangladesh and Senegal were
closely aligned with their respective PRSPs, incorporating relevant Bank and other
donor-produced diagnostic work into strategy formulation (box 4.2). The alignment
of the CAS with the country’s PRSP generally helped create a strong poverty focus.

As discussed in box 1.1 in chapter 1, both direct and indirect interventions (growth
and security, for example) are relevant to supporting poverty reduction. There is no a
priori correct balance that the Bank can apply to individual countries since both are
relevant to country strategy. However, where poverty levels are severe and growth is
slow to reach poor populations, greater weight on direct interventions is likely
needed.


 Box 4-2. PRSP and the Poverty Focus of the Bank’s Country Strategies
 World Bank country strategies respond to their authorizing environment and also reflect
 diagnostic work. Since 2000 the focus has been on linking Bank strategies with country
 strategies. For International Development Association countries, the strategies are PRSPs.
 During the period evaluated, the CASs for Bangladesh and Senegal, for example, were
 directly aligned with the preceding government PRSPs.
 In the 2006 and 2010 Bangladesh CASs, the corresponding PRSPs were consistent with the
 diagnostics of Bank-produced PAs, though government documents did not cite the
 assessments. Thus, by aligning the CAS with the PRSPs, there was a clear alignment of the
 CAS, the governments’ strategies, and the Bank’s PA. The 2006 and 2010 CASs supported
 all four pillars of the PRSPs (macroeconomic stability and sector growth strategies for
 infrastructure, safety nets, and human development) and focused on governance, which the
 PRSPs treated as a cross-cutting issue. PRSP I also thoroughly discussed non-income
 poverty diagnostics that broadened the Bank’s focus on poverty reduction.
 In Senegal the strategy and interventions were also based on government PRSPs. The
 2003–2006 and 2007–2009 CASs were strongly aligned with the country’s first two PRSPs
 in creating wealth, building capacity, improving social service delivery, and protecting
 the vulnerable. The CASs justified the Bank’s strategies based on the PRSP and on the
 Bank’s comparative advantage relative to other financial and technical partners. The
 PRSPs were based on the available poverty diagnostics, so the Bank’s strategies were
 indirectly based on these diagnostics.

 Note: A 2010 IEG report, Poverty Reduction Support Credits: An Evaluation of World Bank Support, found that Poverty
 Reduction Support Credits and the corresponding PRSPs aligned well with national development strategies.



In some countries the Bank’s strategy focused mainly on aggregate economic growth.
Growth is a vital driver of poverty reduction, but it has greater impact on poverty
only when it is more inclusive and accompanied by direct poverty interventions. In
Egypt, for example, the Bank’s diagnostic work found that the during the 2003–08
growth spurt, poverty declined, but extreme poverty increased. 3 The fruits of growth

mostly bypassed rural areas, particularly in Upper Egypt, leading to the persistence of
regional and zonal income disparities. 4

Role of Coordination and Consultation
The Bank can better leverage its resources and have greater impact on poverty
reduction in countries where it recognizes that it is a small player in the economy (in
its financial support) and focuses on its comparative advantage relative to other
development partners, including the government and the private sector. In the
Philippines, the government had easy access to domestic and external financing on
favorable terms, so the Bank had limited leverage on poverty issues through
financing. During the 2000s the Bank’s team reduced the number of projects it
implemented and focused on select areas where it could generate greater impact by
selectively working with reform-minded champions. The Bank focused its support on
piloting and scaling up a CCT program and on its community-driven development
programs. Interventions to boost the productivity of agriculture and rural livelihoods
were limited in scope, and efforts to push land reform (identified in the diagnostics as
a major bottleneck for poverty reduction) were mostly absent.

In Nigeria, where the Bank’s annual lending was only 2 percent of federal revenues,
the Bank also relied on champions to have a greater impact on poverty reduction.
The highest-impact interventions provided knowledge and technical support to
motivated Nigerian teams within sectors and states, backing reform teams with
solid analytics and practical support on issues ranging from debt relief to fiscal
reform to primary health care services. Using analytic and advisory activities to
inform debate and promote domestic dialogue is particularly important in resource-
rich countries where the Bank has limited financial leverage.

In Peru, when the government’s policies stimulated economic growth, the Bank
rightly focused on the remaining pockets of poverty and tailored its services to their
special needs, such as malnutrition, infant and maternal mortality, and early
childhood education. The Bank’s health projects targeted the nine poorest regions
and were designed to reduce maternal and infant mortality by improving both
family care practices and health care during pregnancy, delivery, and breastfeeding.
The Bank’s education projects, designed to improve the capacity of the Ministry of
Education, focused on basic and preschool education.

There is significant room for both the Bank and governments to encourage and help
mobilize additional funding from other development partners, potentially including
the private sector. Malawi and Lao PDR demonstrate such selectivity and donor
coordination (box 4.3).



                                                                                      53
CHAPTER 4
FRAMING THE STRUCTURE: FORMULATING COUNTRY STRATEGIES

 Box 4-3. Selectivity and Donor Coordination
 It is critical for the Bank to be selective in its lending and nonlending activities when a
 large number of donors, relief agencies, and nongovernmental organizations are present.
 In Malawi, for example, informed by poverty diagnostics and largely based on evaluation
 of existing gaps and its comparative advantage, the Bank focused on specific areas of
 engagement in its 2007 CAS, including several with a more indirect impact on poverty.
 The Bank, for example, ceded leadership for health to the U.K. Department for
 International Development, and its leadership for intergovernmental fiscal finance to the
 German Agency for Technical Cooperation, but remained heavily engaged in nutrition--
 an area where fewer partners were operating and successful models needed support for
 scaling up.
 Similarly, in Lao PDR, the 2012 CPS states that the Bank would not work in urbanization,
 water and sanitation, and agricultural inputs.a This strategy could be faulted for not
 adequately supporting agricultural productivity and social protection. However, the
 Bank’s decision to reduce its role in Lao PDR’s agricultural sector was understandable
 given the 2006 Vientiane Declaration’s division of labor, the need to reduce fragmentation
 of staff work programs, and other development partners’ strong support for the sector.
 The 2012 CPS argues that the exclusion of some areas of engagement, made possible
 through effective development partner coordination, has enabled the Bank to concentrate
 its resources in areas where it has the greatest strengths.
 Source: Malawi and Lao PDR country case studies.
 a. Although not specifically excluded in either the 2005 CAS or the 2012 CPS, those interviewed by the IEG team said
 that the World Bank Lao PDR country program did not cover conditional cash transfers for two reasons: to keep the
 country program more manageable, and because the government was not particularly interested in this agenda.



To improve the poverty focus of country strategies, the Bank typically engages in
formal consultations with stakeholders who are close to poverty-related issues, but
questions arise over the consultations’ effectiveness. External stakeholders and
many Bank staff see these consultations as more of an information exchange than a
collaborative dialogue. In some cases, they are seen as procedural or “box checking”
exercises. This finding is supported by the surveys, focus group meetings, and
country cases (box 4.4). Stakeholders are at times seen as poorly informed about the
Bank’s work or about strategy documents, which possibly suggests inappropriate
targeting of the consultative process and weak dissemination. Staff suggested that
for CAS/CPS preparation, stakeholder feedback should be incorporated on a more
long-term, continual basis instead of in isolated sessions.


 Box 4-4. Perceptions of Stakeholders on Bank Consultation and Coordination
 The Bank frequently consults with donors and somewhat less frequently with other
 stakeholders when developing its country strategies. In the external stakeholder survey
 conducted for this evaluation, a majority of government respondents (71 percent) and other

                                                 FRAMING THE STRUCTURE: FORMULATING COUNTRY STRATEGIES
 stakeholders (67 percent) stated that the Bank seeks feedback from donors in general. Also,
 65 percent of government respondents and 64 percent of other stakeholders said that the
 Bank seeks feedback from civil society. Both government officials and other stakeholders
 agreed less frequently that the Bank seeks feedback from academia (56 percent of
 government officials and 52 percent of other stakeholders) and the private sector (54
 percent of government officials and 53 percent of other stakeholders).
 On donor coordination, respondents from the external stakeholder survey were divided
 (see table, below). Over half of the government officials who responded agreed “strongly”
 or “somewhat” with the statement that the Bank coordinates priorities between donors
 and the government; however, a high percentage of government respondents also
 disagreed. When the same question was posed to the donors, 53 percent of respondents
 agreed with the statement, while 44 percent disagreed. It is natural that development
 partners and national agencies have their own agendas. The Bank could begin by better
 coordinating across its programs, demonstrating the synergies, collaboration, and
 leveraging that it advocates for the whole development program.

 question, “When other donors provide direct support to reduce poverty in the country in which you work, the World
 Bank coordinates priorities between these donors and the government.”



Stakeholder consultations are not weak in all cases. In the Philippines, the 2006 and
2010 CASs took a comprehensive consultative approach to CAS formulation and
used the annual Philippines Development Forums to consult with other
stakeholders. Through the forums, the Bank led and coordinated about 10 working
groups on strategically important issues. The discussions surrounding these forums
helped shape the Bank’s strategy and influence the strategies of both the
government and other development partners. The Bank also continued to partner
with the government, other development partners, nongovernmental organizations,
civil society organizations, academia, and the private sector at different stages of
country strategy formulation (though the effort and regularity of follow-up vary
across groups).

 The incidence of poverty and near-poverty in Egypt fell by about 20 percent during that high-
growth period. At the same time, however, the incidence of extreme poverty (the inability to meet
basic food needs) also increased by about 20 percent. See World Bank (2011), Arab Republic of
Egypt Poverty in Egypt 2008–09: Withstanding the Global Economic Crisis.
4The poverty statistics of Egypt are highly sensitive to the selected poverty lines and the
methodology used for their calculation. For example, using the national poverty line,
poverty headcount increased from 19.6 percent in 2005 to 21.6 percent in 2009 and to 25.2
percent in 2011 (Source: WDI); using the $1.25 a day international poverty line, poverty
headcount declined from 2.26percent in 2004 to 1.68 percent in 2008 (source: PovCalNet,
poverty statistics for 2011 unavailable).

5. Building Out the House: Implementing
Country Strategies
 Highlights
 The Bank’s country strategies and the interventions supported by its lending and nonlending
  (advisory and technical assistance) portfolio broadly reflect the poverty-reduction strategies and
  development priorities of country clients.
 The Bank portfolio often deviated from formulated strategy for good reason: in response to the
  changing external and internal environments. But it sometimes deviated because of a partner
  country’s weak commitment to poverty reduction, limited implementation capacity, or legislative
  constraints.
 When the Bank’s lending and nonlending instruments complement each other, support tends to
  be more effective and better calibrated to country needs.
 Government commitment to poverty reduction and capacity constraints are often main factors
  that keep budget execution in line with formulated country poverty strategy.


The impact of strong analytic work and a robust strategy are lost if they do not
translate into consistent strategy implementation. Hence, implementation is
absolutely needed for impact on poverty reduction along the results chain. The Bank
operates in a complex environment, and the choice of portfolio is conditioned by
both the strategic focus of a government client and the Bank’s comparative
advantage. Therefore, along the results chain, strategy implementation—which
involves allocating resources and choosing beneficiaries—is inherently the most
political stage. Given this, strategy implementation is highly context-dependent and
complex, often less transparent, and challenging for an institution like the World
Bank Group, which historically has avoided direct engagement in political culture.

Due to these factors the discussion of strategy implementation relies primarily on
the 10 country case studies. The chapter seeks to identify patterns and raise issues
that the Bank confronts with efforts to tighten the link between strategy and
implementation. This report’s limitations should also be kept in mind. While the
case studies allow for a deeper investigation of portfolio choice and execution, the
report does not address the question of impact and efficacy given the very difficult
challenge of attribution—although individual project evaluations can address this at
the micro level.

CHAPTER 5
BUILDING OUT THE HOUSE: IMPLEMENTING COUNTRY STRATEGIES

Consistency between Bank Portfolio and Formulated Country Strategies
Although the poverty focus of the strategy is important as a starting point, the
implementation of the strategy and the use of Bank instruments determines the
impact of Bank support for poverty reduction. In general, differences in
implementation capacity, political commitment, political cycles, and the Bank’s own
strategy and technical quality explain much of the cross-country differences in the
Bank’s performance and the effectiveness of its support to the poverty reduction
strategies, as reflected in the evaluative assessment of the 10 country case studies. 1

As indicated in the Operations Policy and Country Services guidelines, 2 the CAS
should take as its starting point the country’s own vision of its development goals
and its strategy for achieving them, as set out in a PRSP for IDA-eligible borrowers
or a national development strategy for IBRD-eligible borrowers. It is natural to
expect that the CAS and the country’s development strategy are well aligned, and if
the Bank portfolio faithfully implements the CAS, it is also natural to expect strong
alignment between the Bank portfolio and the CAS. However, challenges lie in the
scenario in which the government’s priorities are not consistent with the Bank’s goal
of poverty reduction. In this case, even if the poverty focus is well stated in the CAS
documents, the alignment among the three and the poverty focus of the strategy
implementation (or Bank portfolio) can often be reduced.

IMPLEMENTATION UNDER CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES
The portfolio and its implementation may need to adjust to changes in internal and
external factors. Changes in the strategy focus during implementation can be a sign of
the Bank’s flexibility, and therefore are not always a bad thing. In some cases,
deviation is strategic and necessary to match the lending portfolio to new
circumstances. What is important is that the actual implementation of the Bank’s
country strategy remain focused on poverty and its key income and non-income
dimensions despite the volatile and complex environment in which the Bank operates.

Deviations often occur because of changes in the external environment. After the
2008–2009 recession, for example, the Bank substantially increased its support for
social safety nets as part of its response (box 5.1). In the Philippines, the Bank
increased the value and coverage of conditional cash transfer programs (Pantawid
Pamilyang Pilipino Program, for example) to support the vulnerable. 3 In Senegal,
the Bank provided development policy loans (DPLs) to help sustain budgetary
expenditures on health, education, and infrastructure and financed new
interventions to provide social protection to the most vulnerable. These additional
programs and activities were usually integrated into the ongoing Bank strategies

                                        BUILDING OUT THE HOUSE: IMPLEMENTING COUNTRY STRATEGIES
and generally financed by delaying, reprogramming, or cancelling some previously
envisioned activities and by making additional resources available.


 Box 5-1. The Bank’s Response to the Great Recession and Support for Social Safety Nets
 Recent IEG reports examined the World Bank Group’s response to the global crises of the
 late 2000s (IEG 2011c, 2012a, and 2011d). Chen and Ravallion (2009) estimate that an
 additional 53 million people worldwide fell into poverty in 2009 because of the financial
 crisis. As part of its response, the Bank increased its social protection lending and advisory
 services to four times the pre-crisis levels. Social protection services can include social safety
 nets (SSNs), active labor market programs, social investment, and pensions. Several of the
 country cases reviewed for this evaluation (including Bangladesh, Guatemala, Nigeria,
 Malawi, Romania, Senegal, and the Philippines) drew on social assistance initiatives to
 respond to the effects of the rapid rise in food and fuel prices and the recession of 2008–
 2009. The majority of the Bank’s support to social protection programs went to SSNs
 (though lending to active and passive labor market programs also increased).
 Many countries had SSNs that were not fully prepared to respond to the impacts of the
 crisis. A survey of Bank staff conducted as part of an IEG review of the Bank’s support to
 SSN programs during 2000–2010 showed that only 16 percent of country SSNs were
 positioned to respond to the crises by identifying and reaching affected poor households.
 Weak country institutions and inadequate data were the constraints most commonly
 identified for Bank support to SSNs, particularly in lower-income countries (IEG 2011c).
 Data inadequacies included limited information on poverty and labor market outcomes and
 on the crisis-affected poor and vulnerable. The lack of data led many countries to focus their
 SSN programs broadly on the poor. This lack of data will make it difficult to assess the
 impact of the Bank’s support to households directly affected by the crisis. At the time the
 SSN evaluation was completed, the impacts of social protection interventions on
 households were still unknown, because many crisis-generated investment loans had not
 yet closed and their ex post evaluations had not been completed (IEG 2011b).


Deviations often occur because of changes in the internal environment, too. When the
Bank resumes policy dialogue with a new government administration in a country,
there can be natural reasons for some changes to the strategy and implementation
plans set before. In Peru, the formulated strategy (as written in CPS 2012) had a strong
link to poverty issues and social inclusion, reflecting the findings and
recommendations of the Bank’s diagnostic work. The new administration came into
power and affirmed its commitment to social inclusion, and in recent years the
implementation of the Bank strategy is even more strongly focused on poverty, with a
clear set of interventions in the social sector to reach the poor.4




                                                                                                 59
CHAPTER 5
BUILDING OUT THE HOUSE: IMPLEMENTING COUNTRY STRATEGIES
IMPLEMENTATION WITH WEAK GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT
The government commitment to poverty reduction is often a key factor in the fidelity
between implementation and the formulated country strategy. As discussed in
chapter 4, when commitment to poverty reduction is embraced by the government,
the alignment between country strategy formulation and poverty diagnostics is often
strong. Similarly, when commitment to poverty reduction is embraced by the
government, the alignment between strategy implementation/choice of portfolio and
strategy is often strong. For example, in Lao PDR, the country team achieved a high
degree of alignment between what was planned and implemented for its 2005 CAS
and 2012 CPS. 5

When there is weak government commitment or strong vested interests,
implementation is much harder, and the results chain between analytic work and
priorities breaks down. In Egypt, a middle-income country with strategic
importance in the Middle East and North Africa Region, the relationship between
the Bank’s formulated country strategy and its implementation during the review
period (2004–12) offers a useful illustration of the tough choices that the Bank faced
when an important client gave priority to areas other than poverty reduction. The
choice is often between disengaging from significant lending or engaging in
significant lending but in areas that may be only tangentially related to poverty
reduction despite high national or regional poverty and the lack of shared
prosperity (box 5.2).

Another example is Romania. After accession to the European Union (EU) and a
change in the governing coalition, interest in borrowing from the Bank waned as
Romania rapidly adjusted its financing strategy toward increased use of market
finance, investment loans from the European Investment Bank, and Structural and
Cohesion grants from the EU. Because of declining political commitment, the 2006
Romania CPS period was marked by a halt in Bank lending: only 8 of 19 planned
operations were implemented. 6

 Box 5-2. Country Assistance Strategy Formulation and Implementation: Airport Project in
 Egypt
 The statement of the poverty focus was clear and well-argued in both the Egypt Country
 Assistance Strategy (CAS) 2001 and CAS 2005. However, the choice of projects designed
 and financed by the Bank suggests that the relevance of the implemented portfolio to the
 Bank’s poverty-reduction strategy was weak. On the nonlending side, substantially less
 analytic and advisory activities were undertaken than proposed, and the core diagnostic
 of a Public Expenditure Review was notably absent. In order to meet its lending target
 and stay engaged with the authorities, the Bank agreed to a government request to
 finance projects that were not part of the original CASs, including the Cairo Airport in
 2004.a Furthermore, the inclusion of such infrastructure projects brought the levels of
 lending close to what was planned (OED 2005b). The project was rated highly satisfactory
 by the project team and the Independent Evaluation Group, because it was generally well
 managed, performed well, and reflected a close working partnership with the
 government. But it is hard to make a strong direct linkage between such projects and
 reduction of poverty in areas with high and persistent poverty such as the rural areas or
 Upper Egypt (IEG 2009). The recent Country Partnership Framework indicated that the
 Bank Group strategy going forward is to focus on selectivity and for the Bank to refrain
 from lending in those areas that can attract private sector investment, such as airports.
 a. The 2001 CAS planned nine projects during 2002–2004, totaling $500 million. However, only three of the planned
 projects were approved, totaling $68 million through May 2004. To maintain lending levels, the Bank agreed to finance a
 number of projects that had not been part of the original CAS, including the Cairo Airport project, which totaled $335
 million. The airport project was included in the subsequent 2005 CAS, which cited a close linkage with development of
 tourism.


IMPLEMENTATION WITH CAPACITY AND LEGISLATION CONSTRAINTS
Several country case studies show that weak implementation capacity and
legislation against borrowing for recurrent expenditures were factors in the
deviation of implementation from the formulated CAS. Box 5.3 discusses an
example in Guatemala. In Peru, the government is not allowed to borrow externally
for recurrent expenditures, although many of the most productive expenditures in
the social sector may be recurrent. This limitation made it difficult to operationalize
efforts to use sector-wide approaches in the social sectors.


 Box 5-3. Implementation Capacity and Legislation Constraints: the Case of Guatemala
 In Guatemala, the portfolio implemented for the 2008 CPS was quite different from the one
 proposed: new lending was $767 million, substantially lower than the planned $970 million.
 Besides the unforeseen external circumstances, legislation requirementsa and problems with
 project implementation weighed heavily on this lending decline. This led to long delays in
 project execution and a backlog of undisbursed funds that reduced both legislation and
 government interest in preparing investment loans. The immediate cause of the cancellation
 of the Enhancing Opportunities (conditional cash transfer) loan was the failure of the
 Guatemalan Congress to ratify the loan and government indifference to project



                                                                                                                       61

 implementation difficulties. Development Policy Lending (DPL) was favored over
 investment lending for its fast disbursement: more than 80 percent of the new loans during
 the 2009–2012 CPS period were DPLs.b Although the loans are widely seen as financing
 fiscal deficits and recurrent costs (appropriate to bridge temporary shortfalls), it is difficult
 to justify them if they are not accompanied by reforms to generate a strong economic
 framework.
 a. There was increasing opposition in the Guatemalan Congress to government borrowing, especially to finance recurrent
 expenditures.
 b. If the Emergency Social Services Project was also considered to be budget support, almost 100 percent of the total new
 lending in this CPS period would have been in the fast-disbursing category.



Complementarities in Implementation
TRENDS IN POVERTY-FOCUSED LENDING
Although most of the Bank’s interventions contribute to poverty reduction either
directly or indirectly, it is difficult to identify the right balance of “direct” and
“indirect” between targeted investments and general growth promotion (targeted or
not). The focus here is on Bank work with a direct poverty focus, recognizing the
critical importance of growth for poverty reduction.

The current coding and classification system is imprecise and inadequate to identify
the poverty focus of the Bank’s interventions. 7 To address this methodological
limitation and broadly gauge the poverty focus of the Bank’s interventions, this
evaluation uses information from the Bank’s thematic and sector coding systems to
create a weak proxy of direct poverty focus. It calculates the extent to which
different instruments—specifically DPLs and investment lending—directly focus on
poverty reduction as a share of total lending (annex G). 8 Using the rationale outlined
in box 1.1 in chapter 1, the evaluation identified 31 themes (out of 84 total) that
specifically and directly focus on the poorest or most vulnerable populations; these
were then used as a proxy for “direct poverty focus.” Both direct and indirect
interventions can support poverty reduction. This distinction is indicative, not
judgmental, and the appropriate emphasis will vary by country.

During FY2000–2012, aggregate trends suggest variation in the poverty focus of
investment lending. The share of investment lending allocated to themes directly
focused on poverty was about 50 percent for all Bank country clients (roughly twice
the share of development policy lending allocated to themes directly focused on
poverty), with a high of 58 percent in FY2003, and a low of about 35 percent in
FY2008 (figure 5.1). The share of investment lending that went to areas directly
focused on poverty was higher in IDA/Blend countries (about 60 percent) than in
IBRD countries (about 25–30 percent). The share of investment lending to total

lending in IBRD countries declined from nearly 30 percent in FY2000 to about 10
percent in 2008, before picking up to about 20 percent in 2012.

In the same period, DPLs with themes focused directly on poverty increased slightly
for all countries, with an average of nearly 23 percent, a high of more than 34 percent
in FY2012, and a low of less than 11 percent in FY2008 (figure 5.2). 9 There are
indications that since the 2008–2009 Great Recession, policy lending in IBRD countries
has focused increasingly on areas more directly related to poverty, but not in
IDA/Blend countries. For IBRD countries, DPLs with themes directly focused on
poverty rose during FY2008–FY2012. Despite lower absolute numbers, the share of
DPLs with themes focused directly on poverty for IDA/Blend countries was greater
than for IBRD countries for the majority of the 2000s, though it declined sharply in
2010.

The sharp increase in fast-disbursing policy lending in IBRD countries after the 2008
Great Recession, in level and as a share of total lending, is likely related to the
efficiency of preparation and the fast-disbursing nature of policy lending. 10 Total
commitments for IBRD and International Development Association (IDA) lending
more than doubled from $25 billion in 2008 to $59 billion in 2010. 11 The composition of
the Bank’s lending instruments also changed, with sharp differences between IBRD
and IDA countries (figure 5.3). During FY2000–2012, the Bank deployed roughly one-
third of its total lending to policy lending. 12 For IBRD countries, the share of policy
lending was about 40 percent (except for a peak of 65 percent in 2002). The ratio for
IBRD countries declined until 2008, after which there was a strong increase during the
years immediately after the crisis. In FY2010, the share of policy lending in total
lending climbed to nearly 50 percent, up from roughly 30 percent in 2008. But for
IDA/Blend countries, the share of policy lending fluctuated around 20–30 percent
until 2008, and then declined to just above 11 percent in FY2011–2012. The DPL was
the Bank’s instrument of choice during the crisis because it “was generally efficient in
providing for rapid increases in loan sizes and disbursement amounts” (IEG 2011c).

During the crisis period, the preparation time for DPLs fell by roughly 30 percent to
5.9 months—3.2 months to appraisal and 2.7 months to Board approval (IEG 2012a).

PORTFOLIO COMPLEMENTARITY
When the Bank’s lending and nonlending instruments complement each other,
support to client countries tends to be more effective and more calibrated to local
needs. What is important is not which instruments are most effective for poverty
reduction—DPLs, investment lending, nonlending services—but how effectively
they combined with the other instruments to address particular poverty challenges.
Experiences in Bangladesh, Peru, and Malawi are good examples of synergy
between instruments (box 5.4).

 mechanisms from food distribution to cash transfer. The Bank began its support during
 the 2006 CAS period with analytic and programmatic technical assistance. Building on
 this, the Bank supported a pilot version of the Employment Guarantee Program for the
 Poorest, using a $150 million investment loan in the first year of the 2011 CAS. A scaled-
 up, follow-on operation began in FY2012 with a $500 million loan for the program and
 four other loans under the Social Safety Nets for the Poorest Project. Analytical work
 continued to support the implementation of the safety net programs, improving the
 targeting of education stipends for girls, linking the stipends to quality improvements,
 and promoting access. The program was modified to include boys when analytic work
 demonstrated that boys from poor households were being left behind.
 In Peru, there was strong synergy between the Accountability for Social Responsibility
 programmatic analytic and advisory activities and the Results and Accountability
 (REACT) Development Policy Loan (DPL) series, and between the REACT DPLs and the
 MIDIS (Ministerio de Desarrollo e Inclusión Social) DPL. The REACT and MIDIS DPLs
 supported the introduction of standards and monitoring stems to start strengthening
 beneficiaries’ “power” and hold providers more accountable. 13 The designs of investment
 projects in health, nutrition, and education were consistent with the diagnostic work on
 poverty. Technical assistance provided support to the institutional capacity of MIDIS
 monitoring and evaluation across several programs (such as Juntos, the school feeding
 programs) and programs aimed at early childhood development.
 In Malawi, the Bank tended to concentrate its development policy operations, including
 Poverty Reduction Support Credits, in sectors receiving lending and nonlending services,
 such as social protection and agriculture. The Community-Based Rural Land
 Development Project, which directly supported land reform, involved extensive
 nonlending services, including two impact evaluations essential to its success.

Several examples show how the Bank used its lending instruments to support poverty
reduction in complementary ways. In Romania between 2009 and 2012, the Bank used
investment loans and lending for budget support to provide needed resources to the
health and education sectors, and to social protection. The complementarity between
the two met the country’s need for reform and for resources to address the effects of
the financial crisis. In Senegal, the Bank used DPLs and Poverty Reduction Support
Credits to support a policy framework conducive to its poverty-related investment
operations and projects. But there was less synergy between the budget support and
the analytic work and technical assistance (IEG 2013).


Scaling Up and Portfolio Implementation
Bank-financed interventions that are explicitly focused on poverty are generally small
in scale relative to the challenge of ending poverty and, in some cases, relative to the
government’s own resources, particularly in middle-income countries. The impact of

                                                BUILDING OUT THE HOUSE: IMPLEMENTING COUNTRY STRATEGIES
Bank support for poverty reduction depends on how well the Bank can crowd-in
external resources (including those from the client government, development
partners, and the private sector) to help scale up and sustain successful interventions
after Bank financing has ceased. Use of pilots to lead by example and leverage other
funding helps to amplify impact. Assisting in the scaling up of projects with resources
of national and local government or other development partners should be an
important component of the Bank strategy to reduce poverty.

Some of the Bank’s highest-impact interventions go beyond financial assistance to
provide knowledge and technical support to clients with solid analytics and
practical advice. In many cases, particularly in middle-income countries, the balance
of Bank instruments for reducing poverty and for capacity building and institutional
sustainability in poverty-related areas would have been more appropriate with
greater emphasis on nonlending services.

In many cases, pilots are used to strengthen the design, implementation, and scaling
up of projects, and to enhance the poverty focus of the Bank’s projects. Early
intermediate outcomes can attract additional resources leading to scaling up (box 5.5).


 Box 5-5. Piloting and Scaling Up: Two Projects in Malawi
 Two projects in Malawi show how positive intermediate outcomes can lead to scaling up.
 The early success of the Malawi Social Action Fund project,a indicated in a tracer on a
 small version of the program, was the basis for scaling up the public works component in
 response to macroeconomic shocks, notably the 2005 drought. The public works
 component was scaled up again in response to Malawi’s 2010 and 2012 foreign exchange
 crises, mitigating the impact of the shocks on poor communities.
 The Irrigation, Rural Livelihoods, and Agricultural Development Project supported water
 management in poor rural areas—primarily through gravity schemes—to reduce over-
 dependence on rain-fed farming. The likely positive results of the intermediate outcome
 led to additional financing in both FY2012 and FY2013, including a scaled-up input-for-
 assets program to cushion the effect of the global and Malawian macroeconomic crises on
 the rural poor and enhance the developmental impact of small-scale irrigation.

 a. The project has a public works component that uses community targeting and self-targeting to provide up to 12 days of
 wages in the lean August–September period, providing income for agricultural inputs.



Scaling up requires not only clear planning and positive intermediate outcomes but
also a deep understanding of the local context. In Nigeria, although the country
strategies explicitly provided for scaling up, the Bank struggled to find financing
modalities that actually produced service delivery results in the government
structure. One such modality was community-driven development projects. These

CHAPTER 5
BUILDING OUT THE HOUSE: IMPLEMENTING COUNTRY STRATEGIES
projects have an explicit poverty focus aimed at raising incomes in supported
communities and have been scaled up to the extent possible across the country with
Bank funding. However, they are not yet supported by the government’s sizable
resources, and there is little indication that the program will be scaled up through
effective local government linkages, despite project components aimed at doing so.


Future Fidelity between Portfolio and Strategy
As the Bank embraces the time-bound twin goals, challenges become more
daunting. Two emerging cross-country issues have already been observed as
countries implement their development and poverty-reduction strategies: changes in
income distribution and changes in the degree of inclusiveness of the overall growth
process. Both will affect the pace of progress against poverty and the sustainability
of results. Although this evaluation does not address trends and drivers of
inequality and exclusion, it is an inescapable aspect of the changing poverty profile
in many countries and an important parameter embraced by the World Bank
through its twin goals. The new emphasis on shared prosperity is based on recent
evidence suggesting that growth alone is highly unlikely to eradicate extreme
poverty by 2030 in many of the Bank’s country clients.

Inequality: Sustained progress without shared prosperity is incompatible with long-
term growth and stability: few countries have moved beyond middle-income status
while maintaining high levels of inequality. Worsening distribution is a cause for
concern not only on equity grounds but also because rising inequality can slow the
pace of overall growth by creating or increasing political and social instability, and
by reducing social mobility.

Inclusion: Ending extreme poverty and spurring shared prosperity require
mechanisms that ensure that the poor and the excluded are integral to the growth
process. Social development lies at the heart of meeting the unique though
heterogeneous demands of disadvantaged groups (including women and youth,
ethnic minorities, and others). How a society provides opportunities will be
dependent on context and time, critically linked to the country’s political economy
and power-sharing arrangements and whether poor and disadvantaged people have
a voice in determining national or regional economic policies.

Inequality and inclusion are both very political. This points to even greater potential
for a disconnect between strategy and implementation. Country commitment is
critical to fidelity between the two. Ending extreme poverty and improving
distribution will require mechanisms that ensure that the poor are integrated into the

growth process. In many developing countries, the better-off have living standards
that are similar to the average in the developed world; it is the poorer segments of the
population that lag behind. Focusing on protecting the vulnerable from extreme
deprivation, particularly irreversible human capital damage, is critical for equitable
and sustainable poverty reduction.


1 Not surprisingly, the first year or two of the Country Assistance Strategy/Country
Partnership Strategy (CAS/CPS) period often follows the program in the strategy document
reasonably closely, because most activities in that program would have been already
initiated, though they could still be modified. The later years of the program often diverge
from the plan.

3The program was piloted in 2008 and reached just 6,000 households. Following the various
crises of 2008–2009, it was scaled up to 376,000 households. By the end of 2010, it had been
scaled up to 1 million households, and by 2013, 3 million.
4In 2012, the new government affirmed its commitment to social inclusion by creating a
new Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion. The new strategy has a stronger link to
poverty issues and social inclusion than the previous strategy, reflecting in part the findings
and recommendations of the Bank’s diagnostic work, from connectivity and access for the
rural poor to improved delivery of social services.
5Though, to adapt to the global crises, the Lao PDR country team made minor changes to
adjust to government requests, changing macroeconomic or sectoral circumstances, the 2008
food crisis, and revised development partner arrangements, the volume, composition, and
poverty focus of the CAS /CPS remained unchanged.
6Under the 2006 CPS, the Bank planned and approved Social Inclusion, Agriculture,
Municipal Services, Knowledge Economy, Nutrient Pollution Control, Transport, Judicial
Reform, and Avian Flu control projects. It dropped 11 of the 19 planned new projects,
including 3 Human Development DPLs, a Rural and Regional Development project, two
infrastructure projects (energy and transport), 3 Programmatic Policy Loans, and a Business
Environment project.
7Currently, the interventions coded as poverty possibly reflects only a small portion of the
Bank’s work that has a poverty focus. There is an indication that efforts are underway to
improve the coding system.
8We use the thematic codes that are assigned to all Bank projects, which indicate
approximately how much of the total loan amount is allocated to each of five possible
thematic areas, to calculate a “thematically weighted” commitment amount for each project.
This analysis includes all themes under Social Protection, Labor, and Risk Management; all
themes under Social Development, Gender, and Inclusion; all themes under Human
Development; all themes under Rural Development; and the Urban Services and Housing
for the Poor theme under Urban Development—a total of 32 themes out of 82—as more
directly poverty focus. The percentage of the poverty-focused theme is used as the weight to



                                                                                             69
CHAPTER 5
BUILDING OUT THE HOUSE: IMPLEMENTING COUNTRY STRATEGIES


be multiplied by that project’s total commitments. It is important to note that this does not
imply that the interventions of the 32 themes selected above are supposed to, or in reality,
have larger or smaller impacts on poverty reduction than those of other themes. The
purpose is mainly to group broadly the activities that are more or less directly related to
poverty reduction.
9Development policy loans are designed to have impact at the national level via associated
policy reform, even though they might not have a direct or immediate effect on poverty
reduction per se. For this reason, it is inherently difficult to arrive at an objective assessment
of a DPO’s “poverty focus.” In the figures, “poverty-themed” is used as shorthand for
“directly poverty focused themed,” and “non-poverty themed” as shorthand for “indirectly
poverty focused themed.”
10IEG’s report (IEG 2012a) found that during the crisis, the Bank reliance on projects that
were relatively easy to prepare and negotiate (such as standalone DPOs, additional
financing, and simple or repeater projects) was somewhat heavier than on other projects.
The quick preparation and disbursement were consistent with the need to stabilize national
economies and mitigate the impacts of the crisis.

12   Except for a peak of some 50 percent in 2002.
13Specific institutional steps included in the DPLs involved enhancing the citizen identity
registry to facilitate access to social services (including for children); performance budgeting
for specific social program and regional entities; and reforms toward better articulating
targeted programs to improve coverage and reduced leakages.

6. Opening the Doors and Windows: Poverty
Focus of the Feedback Loops
Highlights
 While the Bank generates useful information on poverty reduction from its projects and
   programs, the feedback loops—from results to data analysis to diagnostics to strategy
   formulation and implementation—have generally been weak, with sizable variation across
   countries.
 The design and implementation of country strategies need to be informed by monitoring and
  evaluation at the project and program levels, which also provides a basis for scaling up to better
  leverage resources.
 Although most of the Bank’s country strategies were developed through participatory
  consultations with government and nongovernment stakeholders, such consultations rarely had
  meaningful effects on the design or implementation of Bank strategies.


A strong mechanism for learning from results can help strengthen the design and
implementation of the Bank’s projects and programs and improve the effectiveness
of its limited resources on poverty reduction. The exploitation of information
provided by M&E activities at the project, program, and country levels to feed back
into data, diagnostics, and strategy formulation and implementation is therefore
essential. This chapter assesses these feedback loops and their relationship to the
Bank’s M&E mechanisms at the project and country strategy levels. It considers the
strengths and weaknesses of the feedback loops, as well as stakeholder coordination
and consultation. The analysis in this chapter is based on the country case studies,
internal and external surveys, focus group meetings, and the review of
CASCRRs/CPSCRRs in 66 countries.


Project-Level M&E
Deficiencies in the M&E design for projects are most frequently identified as
shortcomings in Bank support at entry (IEG 2015). In general, collecting results
information from projects has been weak. Between FY2007 and FY2013, among the
1,841 projects for which IEG assessed the M&E frameworks, 54 percent were rated
“modest” and 15 percent were rated “negligible.” Only 31 percent had M&E
frameworks that were rated “substantial” or “high.” There is no discernable
improvement over time (figure 6.1), leaving two main shortcomings. First, outcomes
are not measured as often as they should be, nor are the intended outcomes of Bank
projects and programs the focus of measurement, particularly for the groups



                                                                                                       71
CHAPTER 6
OPENING THE DOORS AND WINDOWS: POVERTY FOCUS OF THE FEEDBACK LOOPS
targeted for poverty reduction. Second, when outcomes are measured they are
seldom attributed to Bank-supported interventions to reduce poverty.
Figure 6.1. IEG Project M&E Ratings




 Source: IEG Results and Performance Database.
 Note: The data are based on the number of rated projects that received ratings of negligible, modest, substantial, or high
 as a percentage of total projects rated (excluding those deemed not evaluable). Fewer than 55 percent of projects were
 rated in FY2000–2006, and so were excluded from the analysis. In FY2007–2013, 98 percent of projects had M&E
 ratings.

The design, implementation, and use of M&E in Bank projects and programs can be
strengthened considerably. Often what gets measured are the project milestones
(mainly outputs or intermediate outcomes) but not the final outcome of poverty
reduction, although practices vary. Good practice includes the Philippines ARMM
Social Fund for Peace and Development (ASFP) project, which tracked
improvements in income, food security, literacy rates, enrollment rates, infant
mortality, malnutrition, water supply, and market access. In Guatemala, the latest
series of fiscal DPLs includes project outputs that are directly targeted to poverty-
relevant outcomes, 1 there are both poverty-related targets (child health and
nutrition) and procedural targets. By contrast, most project-level indicators in
Senegal examined outputs only implicitly linked to poverty or tracked the non-
income Millennium Development Goals. 2 In Nigeria, the Bank did not produce
substantial information on poverty reduction that would lead to M&E. Poverty was
not included in the proposed outcomes and results to be monitored as part of
assessment of the Bank’s program.

In most of the country case studies, the results frameworks of projects were not
linked in a substantive way to the CAS/CPS results framework or results chain. The
focus of the monitored indicators on outputs or intermediate outcomes failed to
provide sufficient information about the project’s impact on poverty reduction. If the
objective is reducing poverty at the regional or national level, project-level M&E
needs to pay more attention to explicit linkages to poverty reduction and the
potential for scaling up interventions to achieve a wider effect.

                      OPENING THE DOORS AND WINDOWS: POVERTY FOCUS OF THE FEEDBACK LOOPS
A recent IEG evaluation, learning for Results in World Bank Operations: How the Bank
Learns (2014), indicates that lessons from project experience are not systematically
used or developed at either initiation or completion. Project completion reports, a
main instrument for learning, also are generally weak in documenting and drawing
lessons on poverty reduction. Lessons in the implementation completion reports
(ICRs) were often too general to be useful and had limited external validity across
countries (IEG 2015). While useful as information, the lessons were not specific
about the implications for poverty reduction. The Senegal case study for this
evaluation, for example, found that the lessons from project ICRs and ICRRs
included the need for government ownership, dealing with institutional issues early
in the project design, setting up an adequate M&E system with appropriate
baselines and indicators, and moving to multidonor and harmonized budget
support. Most staff, the IEG learning study found, viewed ICRs as an accountability
tool focused on project ratings rather than learning (IEG 2015). And though reading
the reports before designing projects could help prevent the repetition of mistakes,
the lessons from ICRs were often only copied into appraisal documents without
adjusting project design.


Country-Level Results Monitoring and Learning
The monitoring of CPS results covers a wide range of poverty-related areas, with
most attention to education and health, but the monitoring of direct indicators for
poverty is limited. Figure 6.2 shows the percentage of countries that monitored
indicators in areas directly related to poverty reduction, drawing from the 66
CASCRRs reviewed. 3 Most countries focused poverty-related monitoring on three to
seven areas. 4 The indicator most frequently monitored is basic infrastructure (such
as water and sanitation), followed by schooling quality. 5 But only about 40 percent
of CASCRs included the monitoring of a direct “poverty” indicator in the first
period, which declined to some 20 percent in the second period. 6

The country case studies show varying experience. In Malawi, for example, the
poverty data and feedback from the overall picture fed directly into the monitoring
of the strategy and design of the subsequent CAS. There is constant reference to the
dire poverty situation and the disappointment that the poverty context of the
country is not changing more quickly. An explicit M&E system is used and referred
to in subsequent CAS Progress Reports (CASPRs) and CAS Completion Reports
(CASCRs), though poverty reduction was often only implicitly referred to in the
lessons learned section of the CASCRs.

However, in many countries, only a few poverty indicators are monitored in the
CAS matrix. For example in Guatemala, the CAS/CPSs reviewed during the period

                                                                                      73
CHAPTER 6
OPENING THE DOORS AND WINDOWS: POVERTY FOCUS OF THE FEEDBACK LOOPS
of evaluation present neither poverty indicators (such as headcount poverty ratios)
in their results frameworks, nor changes in poverty indicators targeted as part of the
M&E framework, though such changes are discussed in the background sections of
the strategy documents. The inclusion of more explicit poverty-relevant indicators in
CAS/CPS results matrices, and monitoring and tracking them regularly in the CAS
updates, would help programs adapt to improve their effectiveness in reducing
poverty.

 Figure 6.2. Country Monitoring of Poverty-Related Indicators




 Source: World Bank Database.
 Note: The figure shows the percentage of countries that monitored at least one indicator in areas directly related to
 poverty reduction from the 66 CASCRs reviewed.

While there was consistency between CAS objectives and Bank interventions in
some countries, it was not always clear how inputs were expected to produce certain
outputs and poverty-reduction outcomes. In Nigeria, the 2010–2013 CAS updated
the poverty context and generally observed the importance of non-oil growth for
poverty reduction. But it was not clear how the individual strategic components
related to the poverty challenges at the national or sector levels. In Guatemala, there
was a thematic disconnect between poverty diagnostics and the choice of programs
and projects, with an overreliance on development policy lending and limited links
to poverty reduction.

Most CASCRs focus on accountability rather than drawing lessons. Preparation of
the CASCR focuses on the results matrix, with the lessons coming late in the process.
Focus group discussions indicate that task teams seldom are well prepared to
discuss sector results and lessons linked to the CAS pillars.

Good practice in CAS monitoring includes Bank management commitment to the
design of M&E to measure poverty-driven “indicators.” Focusing on a small number
of monitorable targets, realistic indicators, and good baseline data is the key to
success. In the Philippines, CAS Results Days offered a platform for country teams
to break sector silos and improve the M&E system for both projects and country

                                                                                       CHAPTER 6
                              OPENING THE DOORS AND WINDOWS: POVERTY FOCUS OF THE FEEDBACK LOOPS
programs. In Senegal, by contrast, excessive reliance on national reporting systems
failed to provide clear and precise monitoring of the results chain (box 6.1).

 Box 6-1. CPS Results Monitoring Systems in the Philippines and Bangladesh
 Guided by lessons from the preceding CASCR, the Philippines country team committed to
 strengthening the design and monitoring system for the 2010–2012 CAS. The team created
 working groups mapped to each of the country strategy’s objectives. Within these groups,
 specific teams were assigned to track progress on their objectives. Five full-day workshops
 held throughout CAS implementation (CAS Results Days) allowed the teams to come
 together to share their progress. These workshops became part of the monitoring system for
 the CAS. As a result, the M&E system improved at both the country program level and the
 project level, though it continues to focus on the national monitoring system. The CAS
 included milestones to monitor progress, and supplemented them with specific and
 quantifiable indicators for each outcome, an improvement over the previous system. The
 main factor driving the difference between the two systems was the commitment of Bank
 staff and management to enhancing the results focus of their strategies.
 Similarly, in Bangladesh, a system in response to the lessons learned from the preceding
 CASCR was developed. In its 2011 CAS, each of the four strategic objectives was developed
 by a multisector results team, which identified the related outcomes and indicators, and
 also included elements that involved government participation. During the initial years of
 CAS implementation, these results teams were responsible for monitoring progress and
 reporting to the country team and government counterparts on a six-month/annual basis.
 However, though the country management effectively used the results monitoring process
 to modify and streamline the World Bank program in the 2013 CASPR, the regularity of this
 process declined over time, particularly the element which involved government
 participation. This was in part due to changes in Bank country management and also to
 shifts in the country program as well as the Bank’s relationship with the government.

Strengths and Weaknesses of the Feedback Loops across Countries
Country strategies typically use just a small share of available poverty diagnostic
work. Some issues are included in CASs/CPSs because they are current in the Bank
(such as gender mainstreaming or shared prosperity), so the strategy is expected to
refer to them. Focus group meetings suggest that country teams may not ignore
poverty diagnostic work purposely, but they omit poverty analysis because it is not
the “same language” they are used to, making it harder for them to understand and
use a more nuanced approach to poverty.

Where information is generated, it is not always used in relevant project and
program design. Although this is improving, results feeding back into project
implementation and design are typically limited (IEG 2012c). Impact evaluations can


                                                                                              75
CHAPTER 6
OPENING THE DOORS AND WINDOWS: POVERTY FOCUS OF THE FEEDBACK LOOPS
have substantial knowledge spillovers to future projects and policies, especially ones
that are similar to the ones evaluated. According to a recent IEG report, only 23
percent of PADs of World Bank-evaluated programs had their design or
implementation influenced by previous IEs of other projects (IEG, 2012b) 7. Many
project completion reports fail to mention impact evaluation evidence. 8 Only 37
percent of impact evaluations linked to a lending project were used as an input to
the ICR (IEG 2012c), a missed opportunity, especially in areas with a critical mass of
impact evaluations.

A main weakness of the Bank’s feedback loops is that M&E of individual
interventions often fail to provide broader insights to feed back into country
strategies. Although many Bank country strategies articulate poverty links to
individual components of the strategy, there is seldom a direct or explicit link
between the activity-level outcomes and the CAS/CPS “higher-level” objectives.

Piloting and scaling up of interventions are occurring in some countries. In Senegal,
several pilot cases were designed for Bank operations across all three CAS/CPSs
encouraging the scaling up of small or pilot projects. For access to land, a pilot
activity was envisaged in the FY2003–2006 CAS. The aim was to introduce market-
based mechanisms for land allocations and, once proven successful, to scale them
up. The FY2007–2010 CAS supported pilot projects in education and health to
provide performance-based incentives and to motivate key staff to relocate to
underserved regions of the country. During the global financial crisis, the Bank
scaled up its earlier pilot under the Nutrition Enhancement Project in the context of
its Emergency Nutrition/Cash Transfer Project.

In the Philippines, the Bank focused its support primarily on piloting and scaling up
the conditional cash transfer program and the community-driven development
programs. 9 The lessons from these pilots, and from the various other learning
methods, helped strengthen the design, implementation, and scaling up of projects,
enhancing the poverty focus of the Bank’s projects.

Some CAS/CPS documents discussed in general terms the scaling up of earlier
projects, either through Bank financing or through government ownership of the
interventions subsequently financed through the budget or with donor resources.
The Bangladesh CASs explicitly identified building on good performance during the
previous period for the Reaching Out-of-School Children Project. Initially funded as
a $50 million “pilot,” it received additional financing of $30 million and was
followed by a second project of $130 million.

The evidence is thin on whether successful pilots were used and whether they
leveraged non-Bank resources, compared with a general expansion through

                       OPENING THE DOORS AND WINDOWS: POVERTY FOCUS OF THE FEEDBACK LOOPS
additional financing. From June 2005 to the end of FY2014, 14 percent of the Bank’s
$233 billion in investment lending went to additional financing. 10 IEG is now
evaluating additional financing for investment lending to examine whether additional
financing was effectively used for scaling up or for covering cost overruns and
financing gaps, project restructuring, or as simply a low-cost way to expand financing.

The focus group meetings suggested that although most CAS/CPS documents
stated that the lessons of the previous CASPRs or CASCRs were considered in
developing the current CAS/CPS, there often was no direct evidence to that effect.
Feedback does generally provide the basis for scaling up to better leverage national
resources—both public and private. In several cases, the CASCR was done in the
period leading up to, or in parallel with, CAS/CPS preparation. The CAS/CPS
documents often only referred to the lessons in the main text and appended the
CASCR as an annex to the strategy, but did not indicate how and where these
lessons were taken on board—or how the lessons may have changed or affected
Bank staff views.

The lessons likely influenced Bank staff thinking, however. The Senegal FY2003–2006
CAS refers to two key lessons from the previous CASCR: more aid is a poor substitute
for better aid, and the financial management and procurement faces serious problems
in Senegal. However, it did not link these lessons to the measures it proposed. The
focus groups indicated that, formally, the Bank takes steps toward learning lessons
from the previous CAS/CPS, and in some cases even convenes action or lessons
meetings with the country management units. The focus groups also indicated that
usually the new CAS/CPS depends heavily on the existing project pipeline, the
government’s national agenda, and at times the preferences or priorities of the
country director.

Continual learning and strong feedback loops can go a long way in strengthening
the poverty focus of the country programs, as in Lao PDR. The Bank’s country team
produced, or helped produce, sufficient evidence on poverty reduction and made
good use of it in the design, implementation, and evolution of the poverty focus of
the country program. Adequate poverty data, and good and extensive poverty
diagnostics, provided strong analytical underpinning. The programmatic nature of
the Poverty Reduction Support Operations (PRSOs) facilitated the evolution of the
country program and its poverty focus. 11

The strength of feedback loops in a country varies along the results chain from data, to
diagnostics, and to strategy formulation and implementation—and across sectors (box
6.2). In Nigeria, the feedback loops on poverty were incomplete and poverty was not
explicitly included in the proposed outcomes and results matrix in the CAS to be
monitored. In Romania, they were strong in response to findings from analytical work,

                                                                                       77
CHAPTER 6
OPENING THE DOORS AND WINDOWS: POVERTY FOCUS OF THE FEEDBACK LOOPS
but less so from project M&E. Evidence from the PAs and other diagnostic work
served as underpinning for support to disadvantaged groups, but it was not clear how
the Bank used project monitoring data outside of follow-up projects. In Bangladesh,
the feedback loops were strong in education and social protection, which supported
program implementation and design through DP/government dialogue in the health
and education sector-wide approach projects and in the development of follow-on
operations in secondary education, skills training, and safety nets including
employment programs. But the feedback loops were weak in infrastructure.

 Box 6-2. Variation in the Strength of Feedback Loops within a Country
 In Nigeria, the lack of champions demanding poverty data or diagnostics is a major
 reason for the incomplete feedback loop from results back to data and diagnostics. Bank-
 financed poverty-focused interventions were small in scale relative to the problems and
 the government’s own resources, although several demonstrated strong technical
 approaches to evaluation. Explicit attention to poverty-reduction objectives was either at
 a high level of generality (as in debt relief and non-oil sector growth programs) or
 detailed in a subset of the program (as in community-driven development programs). The
 Bank program did monitor the Millennium Development Goals, which include an
 indicator on income poverty. However, in general, the Bank did not produce substantial
 information on poverty reduction that would lead to effective M&E. In neither of the
 CASs reviewed was poverty explicitly included in the proposed outcomes and results
 matrix to be monitored as part of the assessment of the Bank’s program.
 In Romania, feedback loops from analytic and advisory activities worked primarily
 because the Bank has been a credible counterpart that built its reputation on poverty
 issues over the years with a strong record of work on data, poverty measurement, and
 poverty diagnostic issues. It also helped that the Bank had traction on policy advice
 thanks to its role as an impartial observer in a very fluid political environment. The Bank
 could perhaps learn more about poverty by strengthening the poverty M&E in projects
 and extracting more lessons from its project experiences. There is scope for strengthening
 the M&E of the poverty impacts from projects.
 In Bangladesh, the strength of feedback loops varied across sectors. In some cases they are
 strong, as in the social protection program in which a history of good analytic work
 (feeding into the PAs) contributed to a well-prioritized set of operational
 recommendations (focusing on efficiency, efficacy, and targeting), which then formed the
 basis for dialogue with the key implementing agencies and project interventions when
 circumstances were ripe (as described in the preceding section). Feedback is also
 relatively strong in education beginning with a focus on improved targeting of education
 stipends to increase girls’ school attendance leading to the realization that attendance
 rates for boys were falling and the adjustment of stipend programs to tackle this problem.
 Poverty-focused feedback loops have been weaker in infrastructure lending although
 there is an increasing interest in these sectors (notably rural roads and rural
 electrification) in drawing on impact evaluations to improve project design and ultimate
 service utilization.

The effectiveness of feedback loops depended on such internal factors as the
priorities of Bank management and country teams and such external factors as the
political commitment and administrative and technical capacity of counterparts.
M&E in project implementation also varies considerably with the interests and skills
of staff, though there is a general effort to improve awareness of impact evaluations
and relevant staff skills.

Feedback loops linking institutional strategy, budgeting, and policymaking have
improved in recent years, but remained weak in the majority of countries. In some
cases, the Bank’s strategic and portfolio response has lagged considerably. The
enabling factors for strong feedback loops included government commitment, staff
incentives, and Bank management support for measuring results and increasing
technical expertise through staff training and technical assistance. Continuity in a
program—which offered assurance that feedback would be used to scale up
engagements and incorporate lessons in follow-on operations—also helped.

Stakeholder Consultation and Coordination
Most Bank country strategies include some participatory consultations with both
government and nongovernment stakeholders. In Guatemala, all three country
strategies involved extensive consultations and resulted in shifting the emphasis in
the proposed programs. Changes to the 2005 CAS increased emphasis on
environment across Bank-supported activities. They also broadened a proposed
Local and Rural Development Project to include basic infrastructure services, such
as water, sanitation, electrification, and information and communication
technologies. And they sharpened the focus on human development, infrastructure
needs, and access to finance in indigenous communities.

In Senegal, the preparation of the PRSP and the CASs/CPSs included extensive
consultations with government, development partners, the private sector, and civil
society to ensure that the poverty policies and priorities would be well thought out
and broadly supported. The FY2003–2006 CAS asserted that the Bank would seek to
ensure better country ownership of the poverty-reduction agenda through closer
policy dialogue, especially with civil society. Along with extensive public consultation
on the development of the CAS, several Bank operations used participatory and
community development methods as inputs to define local priorities. 12

The focus group discussions noted that in many cases there was no clear evidence
that consultations had a significant effect on either the design or the implementation
of Bank strategies. They were often treated as an opportunity for Bank staff to


                                                                                             79
CHAPTER 6
OPENING THE DOORS AND WINDOWS: POVERTY FOCUS OF THE FEEDBACK LOOPS
inform the government and other stakeholders of the proposed strategy and
interventions. The limited evidence available from the strategies and other
documentation indicates that suggestions from stakeholders were not fully taken on
board. The consultations usually followed a formal process, often late in the
CAS/CPS process, and partly due to the tight timetable. There were limited
evidence that showed the discussions had strong direct impact on the development
of the strategy.

In Peru, the topics discussed in the consultations differed from the major directions of
the CPS in areas of relevance to reduce poverty. Multiple consultations were carried
out with civil society for the 2007 CPS, in addition to consultations with the incoming
and outgoing authorities and with the private sector. In different parts of the country,
they focused on good development practices and income generation for the poor. But
the topics discussed were not related to public spending at the local level, to access to
services, or to a new social contract in health and education, a major area in the CPS.

Preparing meaningful and well-informed consultations in the short timeframe for
preparing a CAS or a CPS is difficult, according to staff at focus group discussions.
Identifying stakeholders who know the Bank’s well for consultation can be a
challenge. In some countries, the Bank relies on the government to invite stakeholders
to consult on the country strategies, possibly clouding the transparency of the
selection process. Finding the right stakeholders is even more difficult in fragile and
conflict-affected states, where inviting stakeholders from across the country may
preclude safety and security issues.

Effective coordination of development partners can help the Bank concentrate its
resources where it enjoys its greatest strengths, as in the selectivity of the Bank’s Lao
PDR country program (see box 4.3). But both the governments and the donors have
long pointed out the need to improve coordination and engagement with
stakeholders.


1In addition to specific targets for the Tax/GDP ratio, which are ultimately meant to place
public social spending on a more sustainable basis, the operation also has as outcome
targets: (i) the percent of children under 1 year in 83 municipalities receiving the basic
health/nutrition package, and (ii) the number of Zero Hunger Plan (Plan Hambre Cero)
offices that have been established in the country to coordinate nutrition initiatives.
2Of the projects reviewed, the subset of lending interventions for which poverty-specific
data were collected included the Community and Social Development Project and the
Community Poverty Reduction Project.
3The review of the CAEs in 14 countries that covered the period of the evaluation shows the
same pattern as the CASCRRs in 66 countries.

4Out of the 66 countries reviewed, which have two CASCRRs completed during the period
of evaluation, 48 monitored three to seven areas with direct poverty focus in the first CAS
period reviewed, while 58 monitored three to seven areas during the second CAS period
reviewed.
5   See detail in appendix F and discussions in the previous chapters.
6The 66 countries used for this analysis each had two CASCRRs/CPSCRRs during the
period of evaluation (FY2004–2012), the first period was covered by the first
CASCRRs/CPSCRRs, and the second by the second CASCRRs/CPSCRRs. The first period
and the second period are not the same for every country, so the analysis compares
countries only with themselves and not with other countries.
7 The result is drawn from a review of PADs of 117 World Bank-evaluated programs
(corresponding to 142 World Bank IEs), see IEG (2012b).
8In a review of ICRs that had World Bank impact evaluations completed between 2000 and
2012, only 47 percent of the completed impact evaluations were mentioned in project
completion documents (IEG 2012c).
9The 4Ps CCT program was initially piloted with 6,000 households in 2008. By 2009 it had
been scaled up to 376,000 households, and it is currently being expanded nationally. To
complement the initiative, the Bank also supported the development of the National
Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction (NHTS-PR), which has become the
main system of identifying the poor, providing objective information for the CCT,
community-driven development, and national health (PhilHealth) projects.
10The Board has approved 608 additional financing projects with a total volume of $32.7
billion, representing 14 percent of a total of $233 billion in investment lending during June
2005–June 2014. Data source: World Bank Business Warehouse (database).
11For example, the government and the Bank felt that sectoral coverage in PRSOs 1–3 was
too broad, and designed the PRSOs 4–7 series so that sectoral coverage was more
concentrated to improve the delivery of basic education and health services to the rural
poor.
 The operations included the Urban Development and Decentralization Program (Cr. 3006–
12

SN), the National Rural Infrastructure Program (Cr. 3315–SN), and the Social Development
Fund (Cr. 3446–SN).




                                                                                                81
7. Conclusions and Recommendations
This evaluation examined the World Bank’s support for poverty reduction in its
country programs over the period of FY2004–2012. It unpacked the main line of
inquiry—”How, and how well, has the World Bank focused its programs on reducing
poverty?”—into five interrelated elements in the evaluative chain—data, diagnostics,
strategy formulation, strategy implementation, and feedback loops—to assess the
poverty focus of the Bank’s country programs. It reviewed the adequacy of the
information base and usefulness of the analytical underpinnings in support of country
strategy formulation and implementation, and evaluated the consistency of the
poverty focus throughout the evaluative chain and the strengths and weaknesses of
the feedback loops.

The evaluation finds that although the Bank has focused its support for poverty
reduction in most of its country programs using a combination of lending and
nonlending instruments, there is significant room for improvement. While the
Bank’s work on data and diagnostics were generally good, there is significant
variation in coverage and quality across countries. Moreover, for many countries,
strategy formulation and implementation can be improved considerably. Areas that
require attention include better reflecting the findings and recommendations of the
poverty diagnostics in the country strategy formulation, enhancing the consistency
of poverty focus in strategy implementation and portfolio design, and strengthening
results monitoring and feedback loops.


Summary of Evaluative Findings
Poverty Data. The Bank provides countries with support to build capacity to collect
poverty data, a global public good that serves as a foundation for poverty-reduction
efforts. Programs like the Living Standards Measurement Study contribute to the
collection of robust and credible data. But data availability and quality are uneven
and the gaps are widest where the poverty challenge is most serious―in low-income
and fragile economies. High-quality poverty data are a product of statistical systems
capable of producing consistent estimates of income and non-income poverty using
censuses, surveys, and administrative data. Many countries require assistance to
produce statistics that meet the standards required for international reporting.
Sustainability without external support is a challenge for many countries,
compromising the timeliness and quality of data. Lack of political will, particularly
in countries where poverty is a sensitive political topic, weak technical capacity, and
costs remain major obstacles to improvements in data quality and its accessibility,


                                                                                     82
                                                                               CHAPTER 6
                      OPENING THE DOORS AND WINDOWS: POVERTY FOCUS OF THE FEEDBACK LOOPS
which hinders the understanding of the magnitude, geography, and nature of
poverty. The ability of the World Bank to meet these challenges would be enhanced
by partnering with the countries and with other development agencies to fill
persisting gaps in coverage and generate good-quality data more uniformly across
countries, by investing in sustainable data collection by government agencies, and
by reinforcing the Bank’s responsibility to help collect, analyze, and make public
data on poverty and development. There is broad scope for strengthening the Bank’s
role as a global provider of high-quality and consistent poverty data.

Poverty Diagnostics. The Bank produces poverty diagnostics of high technical
quality, often in partnership with countries and other agencies. Poverty Assessments
generally make good use of available quantitative data to derive poverty incidence
indicators, identify the key drivers of poverty, and develop a poverty profile. The
robustness of diagnostics is constrained mainly by weak poverty data. The best
diagnostic work has been done in countries in which good-quality data were
available in a timely manner. However, the country case studies suggest that the
analysis in the poverty assessments often does not fully take into account the social
and political economy framework for and obstacles to poverty reduction or tailor the
recommendations on poverty reduction to the specific country context. The resulting
absence of specific and actionable policy recommendations, along with the lack of
alignment between the timing of analytic work with political cycles and weak
dissemination, has in many cases weakened significantly the impact on strategy
formulation of otherwise solid poverty diagnostics.

Country Strategy Formulation. The Bank’s country strategy documents
demonstrate awareness of and a focus on poverty reduction. With variations across
countries, they are largely consistent with the poverty diagnostics, though the
linkage between the analytics and the strategies often is not discussed directly or
explicitly. As might be expected, the Bank’s strategy is more poverty-focused when
the client government has a clear commitment to poverty reduction and its own
development strategy is poverty-focused. When serious poverty challenges combine
with weak government commitment to poverty reduction, the Bank faces a
dilemma: to reduce engagement or continue support in areas that are tangential to
poverty reduction priorities. Political factors and uncertain opportunity then
complicate the Bank’s country assistance strategy and its overall effectiveness. In
low-income countries, the PRSP process has been important in focusing strategies on
poverty (both income and non-income), increasing cohesion in sectoral strategies
and the overall macroeconomic framework, and improving coordination among
donors and recipient countries.

CHAPTER 6
OPENING THE DOORS AND WINDOWS: POVERTY FOCUS OF THE FEEDBACK LOOPS
Country Strategy Implementation. The Bank’s country strategies and the
interventions supported by its lending and nonlending portfolio broadly reflect the
client countries’ poverty reduction strategy and development priorities. Deviations
of the Bank portfolio from formulated strategy often occurred in response to a
changing external or internal environment. This is understandable and necessary
when driven by external shocks or major political changes that lead to changing
national strategies. Deviation may also result from weak government commitment
to a poverty reduction agenda. Among the instruments, analytic and advisory
activities (AAA) are usually well deployed to impact on policy and on lending
related to poverty reduction. The Bank’s lending instruments, on the other hand,
may not have been used enough to maximize complementarities and synergies to
strengthen their collective impact on poverty reduction. In particular, project
lending is often viewed narrowly and on its own terms rather than as a means of
leveraging far greater non-Bank resources and having a broader and more sustained
impact. Complementarity of the lending portfolio with AAA, and the
complementarity between policy lending and investment lending are important and
experience is varied.

Feedback Loops. The Bank’s mechanisms for learning from project experience, from
results to data analysis to diagnostics to strategy formulation and implementation,
have generally been weak, though with significant variation across countries. The
Bank does generate information and learning about poverty reduction from its
programs, and in most cases, the formal processes of M&E are required but
inconsistently implemented. At the project level, the processes tend to focus
narrowly on outputs or immediate outcomes and often fail to reflect the broader
impact of an intervention in the medium or long term. Deficiencies in the M&E
design for projects are most frequently identified as shortcomings in Bank support at
entry. At the strategy level, they tend to focus on the process itself (i.e., “checking
the box”) without an assessment of whether a real difference is being made to
poverty. In both cases, the processes are not systematically integrated in the strategy
or in individual projects. Project and program-level M&E are most effective when
they measure outcomes and inform the design and implementation of country
strategies, providing a basis for scaling up support to better leverage resources.
Improving the use of poverty data in project M&E to improve planning and
implementation is crucial. Finally, the formal process for preparing a country
strategy often includes some form of participatory consultation. However, there is
limited evidence that such consultations have had strong effects on either the design
or implementation of Bank strategies.

This evaluation has focused on recent World Bank experience supporting poverty
reduction in countries at a time when major changes in the Bank’s strategy and


84
                                                                                CHAPTER 6

structure have just taken place. It addresses a topic central to the Bank’s new twin
goals, without evaluating major aspects of these goals, including attention to the
distribution of services, income, and opportunity (shared prosperity); the
importance of social inclusion (inclusive growth); and sustainability over time.
While not specifically addressing the topic, this evaluation does point to the critical
importance of social and political dimensions of poverty which are often less central
to the Bank’s analytic work than its economic and more measureable determinants.

Poverty diagnostics that factor in the structures of political authority, institutional
capacity, and excluded communities and their social characteristics were found to be
better prepared to provide actionable policy recommendations for reducing poverty.
In many countries, a large segment of the extreme poor are isolated culturally or
geographically and excluded socially and economically with little voice. Much of the
public services and interventions need to fit their cultural features. Country strategies
need be candid in recognizing these challenges. The social contract must include
mechanisms to raise adequate resources to support these policies. Ensuring inclusion
of the poor in the growth process requires investments that improve opportunities
and provide safety nets to protect the vulnerable against extreme deprivation and
shocks.

The issues identified in this report will become increasingly important for achieving
the twin goals. Strong data and diagnostics must underpin the new Systematic
Country Diagnostic work to present a comprehensive view of priorities for
eliminating extreme poverty and improving distribution in all countries. Strategies
need to be brought into closer alignment with diagnostics and address social and
political constraints, or at a minimum demonstrate awareness of them. With limited
financial resources, the Bank can still support transformative change through using its
diagnostic work, technical assistance, and lending instruments as pilots for scaling
up and as catalysts to leverage resources from other stakeholders. Enhancing the
relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness of Bank support must draw on constant
learning from experience and deploying this knowledge to deliver better results.

The effectiveness of the Bank’s interventions in poverty reduction will increasingly
depend on how the Bank uses its diagnostic work, technical assistance, and lending
instruments as pilots for scaling up and as catalysts to leverage resources from other
stakeholders. Focusing on mechanisms that facilitate the deployment of analytic and
advisory activities to influence policymaking, as well as on using its policy lending
and investment lending in a complementary manner to crowd-in resources from
other stakeholders, including particularly the partner countries, is essential for the
Bank to maximize its impact on poverty reduction.

Recommendations
The Bank is relatively well positioned in the early links in the results chain—data
and diagnostics—capable of providing high-quality inputs for policy and decision
making, but requires more consistent delivery across client countries. There is
greater scope for improving Bank performance in the later links (strategy, portfolio
implementation, and learning from feedback) if it is to deliver on the institutional
commitment to the twin goals. The findings support recommendations in all five
areas to guide improvements of the Bank’s future work on poverty reduction, in
particular in the process of the design and implementation of the Systematic
Country Diagnostics (SCDs) and Country Partnership Frameworks (CPFs),
calibrated to individual country circumstances.

POVERTY DATA
     •   Ensure that poverty data development and reporting needs are
         comprehensively addressed in the SCD and country policy dialogue to
         identify gaps, steps to fill them, and requisite financing arrangements.
     •   Advocate and organize support to sustainably improve the capability of
         national statistical agencies, both internal operational support and in
         partnership with external agencies.
     •   The Bank Group should take a stronger lead in strengthening mechanisms for
         quality and transparency on poverty data, motivate country compliance, and
         regularly disseminate data.

POVERTY DIAGNOSTICS
     •   Strengthen the Bank Group’s poverty diagnostic work to ensure that it
         incorporates relevant social and political dimensions of poverty analysis.
     •   Focus poverty analysis on actionable priorities for policy interventions to
         accelerate poverty reduction and develop the SCD discussion of linkages
         between recommended actions and their expected impact on poverty
         reduction.

STRATEGY FORMULATION
     •   Pursue the recommended actions on poverty from the SCD through CPF
         country strategies.
     •   In the country strategy address the mix between indirect poverty
         interventions (inclusive growth) and direct poverty interventions (social
         safety nets, access to basic services) with attention to their sequencing to
         achieve the Bank’s twin goals.

STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION AND FEEDBACK LOOPS
   •   Develop and adopt explicit evaluation protocols for piloted interventions to
       capture lessons from experience on poverty reduction, with a view towards
       opportunities for scaling up successful interventions.
   •   Ensure attention at project inception to evaluability through (1) developing
       standards for baseline measurement, (2) explicit linking of the baseline to
       indicators relevant to project objectives, including any that refer to poverty or

Appendix A. Summaries of 10 Country Case
Studies
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) evaluators prepared case studies of 10
countries in the first half of 2014. The countries were selected from a population of
144 countries comprising all International Development Association (IDA),
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), and blend
countries. 1 The selection is purposive and does not aim to fully represent the
various categories of countries. It tries to cover a range of countries at different
income levels to reflect the differing approaches and challenges to poverty reduction
in countries at different levels of development. The case study countries were
selected to roughly reflect regional balance. During the selection process, countries
were first grouped according to (i) regions; (ii) income level; and (ii) whether or not
they are classified as fragile and conflict affected states (FCS). An emphasis was
placed on countries with significant Bank engagement (lending and nonlending
activities). To provide lessons that reflect a wide range of operational experience, the
final selection of countries also took into consideration variations in the number of
poor people and in poverty rates, and potential lessons for learning in consultation
with external experts and senior Bank staff. The 10 countries selected for study are
Bangladesh, Egypt, Guatemala, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR),
Malawi, Nigeria, Peru, the Philippines, Romania, and Senegal. Focusing on FY2004–
12, each case study consisted of desk reviews, structured interviews with Bank staff,
and in-country consultations with stakeholders.

The overarching question they sought to answer was: “How, and how well, does the
World Bank focus its programs on reducing poverty in partner countries?” To
address this issue, they asked the following questions:

   •   Did the Bank have the appropriate data to understand the nature of poverty
       and provide an information base for robust analytical work on poverty?
   •   Did the Bank’s diagnostics guide development programs to effectively reduce
       poverty?
   •   Have Bank country strategies adopted the findings of analytical work on
       poverty to help prioritize and guide policy dialogue and lending?
   •   Have interventions—operations, technical assistance, and capacity building—
       reflected the strategic priorities for poverty reduction?
   •   Has the Bank collected and drawn lessons from poverty reduction
       interventions to strengthen feedback loops and improve the effectiveness of
       its country strategies and programs? If so, how did it do so?

These questions, detailed in the Approach Paper, formed the basis of the evaluation
exercise. During their field visits, each of the 10 evaluation teams closely followed
the country case study protocol. The countries were selected to reflect all regions as
well as different income levels, numbers of poor people, and poverty rates.
Countries of special interest (e.g., International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development [IBRD], International Development Association [IDA], fragile states,
small states) are represented. The case studies illustrate variations in country
program work in poverty reduction, given different institutional and political
contexts. Comparative tables are presented at the end of this appendix.

All country case studies were prepared after a thorough review by IEG evaluation
teams of related Bank documents as well as reports or documents prepared by
country authorities. These reviews were then followed by field visits and in-country
consultations with stakeholders as well as Bank managers and staff working on the
10 countries.

The evaluative evidence provided by the 10 country case studies yields a rich and
complex picture of the World Bank’s support and its dynamics in the areas of
poverty data, poverty diagnostics, and formulation and implementation of poverty
reduction strategies through the Bank’s lending and non- lending portfolio during
the evaluation period of FY2004–12. Differences in implementation capacity,
political commitment, political cycles, and the Bank’s own strategy and technical
quality explain much of the cross-country differences in the Bank’s performance and
the effectiveness of its support to the poverty reduction strategies of the 10
countries. External shocks also seem to have played an important role in
determining the quality and nature of Bank support, as shown by the impact of the
2008–09 global financial crisis on the Bank’s portfolio in each of the following
summaries of the country case studies for this evaluation.

role in determining the quality and nature of Bank support. The 2008–09 global
financial crisis resulted in a marked change in the Bank’s planned portfolios for its
clients (as envisaged in Country Assistance Strategies [CASs] and Country
Partnership Strategies [CPSs]), including an increase in the ratio of fast-disbursing
operations to all commitments as well as some changes in project lending and
analytical and advisory assistance (AAA) in response to clients’ needs.

Seven of the 10 case study countries—Bangladesh, Guatemala, the Lao People’s
Democratic Republic, Malawi, Peru, Romania, and Senegal—received more
calibrated and sustained support from the Bank for their poverty measurement
efforts. In these seven countries plus the Philippines, the Bank’s poverty-related
diagnostic work, which included recommendations, helped create strong results
chains with respect to the formulation and implementation of poverty reduction
strategies. In all of these countries (albeit with significant variance in terms of the
quality and timeliness of outcomes), Bank support helped countries produce and
maintain good-quality poverty data and prepare relevant, timely, and sound
diagnostic work on a more or less sustained basis.

In Bangladesh, Lao PDR, Malawi, and Senegal, where local capacity was weak, the
Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) process seems to have played an important role
by focusing the attention of policy makers and the donor community and directing
their financial and technical assistance toward meaningful measurement and
analysis of poverty efforts, with key targets and instruments that underpinned an
actionable overall poverty reduction strategy over time.

In Bangladesh, Lao PDR, Malawi, and Peru, strong data and diagnostic work
enabled the Bank to formulate poverty reduction strategies that were calibrated to
the realities on the ground and reflected the key findings and recommendations of
poverty diagnostic work. Bank support of strategy implementation and feedback
loops (from results to data analysis to diagnostics to strategy formulation and so
forth) was more nuanced in these countries. Its effectiveness depended on a variety
of internal and external factors, including the election cycle, political commitment,
the administrative and technical capacity of counterparts, and external shocks. The
quality and effectiveness of the Bank’s overall support for poverty reduction
appears to have been somewhat stronger in Lao PDR and Peru, particularly recently,
though support to Bangladesh, Malawi, and Romania was also significant, relevant,
timely, of good quality, and appreciated by counterparts.

In contrast, the overall quality and effectiveness of the Bank’s support for poverty
reduction in Guatemala, Nigeria, the Philippines, and Senegal was moderate/fair. In
Guatemala and Senegal, the quality of poverty-related data support and diagnostic

work was strong, but in-country capacity limitations and other constraints, such as
budgetary pressures, limited the Bank’s effectiveness. Bangladesh, Lao PDR, and
Malawi had reasonably strong feedback loops from data to diagnostics to strategy
formulation and implementation of Bank country strategies. Feedback loops in the
other cases study countries were weaker, often as a result of inadequate monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) systems at the project and program levels.

In Nigeria—home to the world’s third-largest population of people in extreme
poverty—no local champions demanded poverty data and diagnostics. As a result,
data quality issues persisted, and Bank-financed, poverty-focused interventions
were small relative to the size and complexity of the problems and the government’s
own resources. The Bank’s poverty diagnostics generally made good use of available
data, which expanded over time, and included disaggregated poverty profiles. But
the Bank’s poverty diagnostics did not drive the strategies, because governance
issues became an institutional priority.

In the Arab Republic of Egypt, the country with the weakest and most limited
poverty reduction strategy among the 10 country case studies. The government gave
priority to areas other than poverty reduction during the evaluation period. 2 It
adversely affected the availability of poverty data. It was not possible to assess the
quality of the data due to the limited data accessibility. Weak data made it difficult
for the Bank to conduct good-quality diagnostics in a timely fashion, although it did
end up producing a few high-quality diagnostic reports during the review period. In
both Egypt and Nigeria, the political economy context appears to have constricted
the strategy space in which the Bank operated. Because of the nature of the client,
the Bank’s country strategies for Egypt and Nigeria did not include clear road maps
or integral and consistent visions of the sustained interventions needed to reduce
poverty, and implementation deviated widely from the plans set forth in the Bank’s
strategy documents.

This comparative summary of the findings of the country case studies yields very
broad conclusions. The 10 case studies suggest that Bank support for poverty
reduction had a positive impact on various components, such as poverty data,
poverty diagnostics, and strategy formulation and implementation, even though
results chains and feedback loops were weak in a number of cases. Most countries in
the sample responded positively to the Bank’s efforts, taking advantage of the
Bank’s technical expertise to improve the quality and timeliness of their poverty
data, aligning their development strategy with the strategy implied by the Bank’s
diagnostics, and defining (in some cases redefining) their national poverty goals.
Most of these countries also allowed some recalibration of the Bank’s project and
program portfolio to refocus on areas where poverty was deeper or where a

significant portion of the population did not share the prosperity generated by the
economic growth process at the national level.


Cross-Cutting Themes
The country case studies address a number of cross-cutting issues that have direct
bearing on the nature of Bank support for poverty reduction and strategy
formulation. This section provides a brief summary of two of these issues—income
inequality and social inclusion—which are likely to become increasingly important
to the implementation of the Bank’s strategy going forward.

INEQUALITY
In many economies, growth in the incomes of the poor is accompanied by falling
inequality, as witnessed in many Latin American countries during the past decade.
Some rise in inequality may be necessary to generate growth—by creating incentives
that reward innovation and risk-taking, and inducing firms and individuals to
invest in human and physical capital. This phenomenon occurred in a number of
East Asian countries a few decades ago, when income growth of the bottom 40
percent was rapid but still lagged the growth of average income. Income growth of
the bottom 40 percent that is consistently lower than average should be a cause for
concern—not only on sheer equity grounds, but also because the resulting rise in
inequality could eventually slow the pace of overall growth, by affecting the quality
of institutions, creating or increasing political and social instability, and reducing
mobility in society. Sustained progress in shared prosperity is incompatible with a
long-term increase in inequality: no country has transited beyond middle-income
status while maintaining high levels of inequality. One could, therefore, argue that
where inequality is high, boosting shared prosperity is likely to require that the
income of the bottom 40 percent grow faster than average income.

Between the early to mid-1990s and 2012, poverty headcounts declined significantly,
albeit to varying degrees, in all 10 countries studied. In contrast, income inequality,
as measured by the Gini coefficient, fell in only six countries (Egypt, Guatemala,
Malawi, Nigeria, the Philippines, and Senegal). Inequality rose in Bangladesh, Lao
PDR, Peru, and Romania.

A somewhat different picture emerges from comparison of inequality in the early
2000s and the latest level available, which overlaps with the period of this
evaluation. Over this period, inequality as measured by Gini rose in Lao PDR,
Malawi, Nigeria, and Senegal. The rise in inequality in the three Sub-Saharan
countries is particularly disconcerting, as it was already high before the recent rise.

                                                                             APPENDIX A
                                                    SUMMARIES OF 10 COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
The trend reflects both slow growth and slow poverty reduction between 2009 and
2013, in the aftermath of the global crisis.

As measured by the share of income or consumption of the top 10 percent of the
population relative to the share of income or consumption of the bottom 40 percent,
inequality rose in Lao PDR, Malawi, Nigeria, Romania, and Senegal during the same
period. Among the 10 country cases, inequality has been highest (with Gini in the
range of 40 to 52) in Guatemala, Malawi, Peru, the Philippines, and Senegal, where
issues of exclusion, ethnicity, and lagging regions, have not been addressed
effectively, at least until recently. In Egypt the apparent increase in inequality and
vulnerability of the population, particularly among domestic migrants and informal
workers may not have been adequately captured by the official poverty data prior to
the 2010–11 revolution, which, until recently, had indicated a significant decline in
both extreme poverty and inequality between 2000 and 2008.

Distribution of the fruits of growth is a major issue in many countries, although the
poor quality of data in some cases casts doubt on the evidence. When the initial level
of income or non-income inequality is high, the growth rate is lower and has a more
subdued effect on poverty.

INCLUSION
Spurring shared prosperity requires mechanisms that ensure that the poor and the
dispossessed are integral to the growth process. No single institutional arrangement
for ensuring such inclusion will be optimal for all societies; how a society provides
these opportunities will be context- and time-dependent and critically linked to the
country’s political economy and power-sharing arrangements, and whether poor
and disadvantaged people have a voice in determining national or regional
economic policies.

The notion of shared prosperity requires that progress be sustainable over time and
across generations, in terms of the environment, social inclusion, and fiscal
prudence. However, ensuring inclusion of the poor in the growth process requires
investments that improve opportunities for all citizens, including women and youth,
and provide safety nets to protect the vulnerable against extreme deprivation and
shocks. The social contract must also include adequate mechanisms to raise
resources to support these policies, including a tax system that creates incentives for
economic growth and promotes fairness.

Regional income disparity is a major issue in Egypt, where wide disparities persist
between Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt, and between rural and urban populations.
The highest poverty rates are in Upper Egypt, where 44 percent of the rural


                                                                                    101

SUMMARIES OF 10 COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
population was living in poverty in 2009, compared with the national average of
about 25 percent. Egypt’s growth spurt in 2003–08, which helped reduce poverty at
the national level, by and large bypassed rural areas and the south. The strategies of
both the Bank and the government in dealing with this important issue, which was
identified in the Bank’s diagnostics work, proved ineffective.

Similar issues weakened the link between economic growth and poverty reduction
in certain regions of Guatemala, Nigeria, Peru, and Romania, particularly remote
places with inadequate connectivity and lack of access to social services. In
Guatemala, geographic, ethnic, gender, and rural-urban disparities in social
indicators are large. The incidence of child malnutrition—particularly stunting
(height-for-age)—is the highest in Latin America and among the highest in the
world. It is especially high among rural and indigenous groups, with a
concentration in the northern and northwestern regions. The Bank and the
government did not pay adequate attention to ethnic issues or the empowerment of
indigenous communities during the evaluation period.

In all case study countries, the Bank’s strategy formulation, which benefited from
good-quality diagnostics, emphasized social inclusion and inclusive growth.
Implementation of the strategy and the lending portfolio were slow to be fully
calibrated to deal with the lack of inclusiveness of growth in an effective manner,
however.

Ending extreme poverty and spurring shared prosperity requires mechanisms that
ensure that the poor are integrated into the growth process. Social development lies
at the heart of meeting the unique, though heterogeneous demands of
disadvantaged groups (including women, youth, ethnic minorities, and others). In
many developing countries, the better-off have living standards that are similar to
the average in the developed world; it is the poorer segments of the population that
lag behind. Focusing on protecting the vulnerable from extreme deprivation,
particularly irreversible human capital damage, is critical for equitable and
sustainable poverty reduction.


Bangladesh
CONTEXT
Bangladesh’s location and high population density results in high vulnerability to
natural disasters, particularly floods and cyclones. Limited and poorly performing
infrastructure, and a confrontational political environment, with associated

                                                   SUMMARIES OF 10 COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
weaknesses in government capacity, exacerbated by high levels of corruption, have
contributed to a challenging development environment.

Given these challenges and the depth of poverty and famine Bangladesh faced in the
1970s, performance has far exceeded expectations. Economic growth has accelerated
by about one percentage point in each decade since independence in 1971, averaging
about six percent a year during the past 10 years. Growth has also been relatively
stable, with lower fluctuations than many other rapidly growing low-income
countries. Over the period 2003–13, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita grew
by an average of 4.9 percent. Gross national income (GNI) per capita (in purchasing
power parity) reached $1,940 per capita in 2011. Despite these achievements,
Bangladesh remains home to about five percent of the world’s poor.

Bangladesh dramatically lowered the share of people living on less than $1.25 per
day, from 58.6 percent in 2000 to 43.3 percent in 2010—a rate that was 60 percent
faster than the rate of poverty reduction in the rest of the developing world,
excluding China. As the share of people living on less than $1.25 per day is about 40
percent, a focus on reducing extreme poverty is at the same time a focus on
promoting shared prosperity for the bottom 40 percent of the population. The two
World Bank Group goals thus come together.

Bangladesh has sharply improved its social indicators. It is expected to partially
achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for poverty reduction and
primary school enrollment, and it is on track to achieve the MDGs for gender parity
in education; child mortality; maternal health; and HIV/AIDS, malaria, and
tuberculosis. The contributors to these achievements include Bangladesh’s attention
to health outcomes, elementary education, family planning, and gender equality
(especially in education and workforce participation), all supported by (mostly
female) grassroots workers and organizers mobilized by the government and
leading world nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), such as BRAC, and a vast
network of microfinance institutions led by the Grameen Bank.

The World Bank is Bangladesh’s single-largest development partner, allocating 23
percent of all IDA resources disbursed between 1971 and 2012 to Bangladesh.
During the period 2006–14, the Bank committed $8.8 billion in IDA funds to 62
projects in Bangladesh.

POVERTY DATA
Poverty data in Bangladesh are generally of high quality and have improved over
time. The Household Income Expenditure Survey (HIES) data provide robust
estimates of both extreme and general poverty. Although it is conducted only every


                                                                                   103
APPENDIX A
SUMMARIES OF 10 COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
five years, it appears to be timely for capturing the impact of structural changes,
though not for documenting the impact of short-term crises or immediate responses
to policies or programs.

The HIES is the main data set used for poverty headcount estimates and for linking
poverty incidence with other characteristics. Because it has used a comparable set of
questions and sample frame in the last three rounds (2000, 2005, and 2010), it has
facilitated a robust framework for analyzing both the incidence and the drivers of
poverty over this period. Nevertheless several World Bank staff, researchers, and
policy analysts noted that the five-year gap between surveys was a long period in
relation to monitoring the impact on poverty of programs and short-term
interventions. Although past efforts to design and implement a reliable but more
frequent poverty monitoring instruments were not successful, there is strong
demand for greater frequency in poverty headcount estimates. Therefore, there is
strong demand for interim poverty data.

The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) is pursuing one approach to linking policy
targeting and monitoring with the implementation of a poverty database project. It
will develop a proxy means test score that can be applied to every household and
used for more effective policy targeting. The Bank is supporting this activity with a
$40 million component to its Social Safety Nets (SSNs) Project. The BBS also
conducts a number of sample surveys every year, either as a regular activity or on
an ad hoc basis. These surveys include the Agriculture Crop Production Survey and
the Survey of Current Industrial Production. At different intervals it conducts
important sample surveys regularly, such as the HIES and the Labor Force Survey.
Interviews and other sources of information suggest that stakeholders do not regard
many of these other surveys as having the same robustness as the HIES.

Overall, the Bank has been involved with the development of the HIES since the
1990s. It has played a significant role in building capacity in Bangladesh to carry out
the surveys, disseminate results, and prepare poverty maps. Since 2000,
improvements in survey questionnaires have allowed extensive longitudinal
analysis, and the data and other basic survey results have been made widely
available. Nevertheless, the timing of the survey is not well coordinated with the
country’s planning cycle, and important poverty-related data (Labor Force Surveys)
receive less attention and are regarded as less reliable.

DIAGNOSTICS
The Bank produced comprehensive poverty assessments following the HIES rounds
in 2000, 2005, and 2010. Each of these assessments exploited the available data and
provided a rich profile of the poor and of key drivers of poverty and poverty

                                                      SUMMARIES OF 10 COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
reduction in Bangladesh. Because of the comparability of survey design over the
decade, successive poverty assessments were able to look in detail at the dynamics
of the incidence and determinants of poverty and provide a rigorous analysis of
interactions between them. Although the focus of each poverty assessment varied,
they all examined the major programs affecting poverty dynamics, with a focus on
improving targeting of government programs and strengthening governance to
reduce leakages in safety nets. As the Bank had long supported health and
education through multidonor, sector-wide approaches (SWAps), the poverty
assessments focused more on the institutional framework governing social
protection and support for the private sector–led growth process in Bangladesh.

The diagnostic work of the poverty assessments included close collaboration with
BBS and benefited from the support of other development partners, such as the UK
Department for International Development (DFID) for specialized funding or
detailed analytic inputs. Poverty analysis and diagnostics are a major focus of all
stakeholders in Bangladesh, many of whom, such as the Center for Policy Dialogue,
have produced significant independent pieces of analysis. United Nations (UN)
agencies are also involved in poverty diagnostics through such work as the
Bangladesh Human Development Report and the Child Equity Atlas of the United
Nation’s Children Fund (UNICEF). BRAC, the world’s largest NGO, with an
extensive network of grassroots workers in Bangladesh, is also a major source of
situational, qualitative, and quantitative poverty diagnostic work.

Although the recommendations of these poverty diagnostic reports have tended to
become less specific over the past decade, their policy impact has probably increased
over time, thanks mainly to the consistency of policy messages across the poverty
assessments and increased activity by the Bank in social protection. These diagnostic
reports have tended to coincide with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)
process since 2002 and have facilitated considerable interactions between the
government, the Bank, other donors, and local think tanks. Although the Bank has
continued to support Bangladesh with diagnostics and analytical reports related to
human development, safety nets, disaster preparedness, and poverty-linked rural
investments, it did not prepare a Public Expenditure Review (PER) because of the
lack of demand by the government (since the Bank’s policy-based lending halted as
a result of major policy differences between the government and the Bank). Key
stakeholders and development partners regretted the absence of a PER by the Bank.

STRATEGY FORMULATION, IMPLEMENTATION, AND FEEDBACK LOOPS
Overall, the Bank’s role has been central to the analysis of income poverty in
Bangladesh. Stakeholders defer to the Bank’s diagnostic capacity even though
perspectives on underlying causes and interrelationships vary. The links between

data, diagnostics, and strategy formulation in Bangladesh have grown stronger over
time. In the case of the FY2006–09 and FY2011–14 CASs, the relevant PRSPs were
consistent with the data and diagnostics of the relevant poverty assessments. These
strategies emphasized private sector led growth, human development, and, more
recently, vulnerability with links to climate change and disaster preparedness and
management. The formulated strategies were consistent with the relevant poverty
diagnostics.

Regarding CAS implementation, the poverty focus of the Bank program in
Bangladesh benefited from a diverse and strong analytic base, especially before and
during the initial years of the FY2006–09 CAS. However, the analytic base weakened
somewhat as linkages with policy-based lending and government dialogue
weakened. By the time of the FY2011–14 CAS, a complicated policy dialogue with a
new government put policy-based lending on the back burner, although the strategy
did include a broad sectoral mix of investments, such as assistance to the
transformative $1.2 billion Padma Bridge Project, which clearly addressed the issues
of regional integration that the 2008 poverty assessment had highlighted. However,
because of allegations of intended corruption involving senior government officials,
the Bank cancelled the bridge project. It also withdrew from all other infrastructure
and energy projects, with the potential Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs)
an additional casualty.

The Bangladesh program is characterized by a large number of follow-on and
additional financing operations. Over the period FY2006–13, almost half (44 percent)
of all IDA operations were follow-on projects or additional financing. These
operations included sequences of Development Support Credits and support to the
health and education SWAps. Another follow-on project that the CASs identified as
building on good performance during the previous period was the Reaching out of
School Children Project, which was initially funded as a $50 million pilot. It received
additional financing of $30 million and was followed by a second $130 million
project. A notable example of building on a successful intervention is the support to
employment generation safety nets, which began as technical support to the 100–day
Employment Guarantee Program of the government late in the FY2006–09 CAS
period, followed by $150 million project support early in the FY2011–14 CAS period.
The FY2011–14 CAS indicated that successful experience with that project would
trigger a scaled-up, follow-on operation, which materialized in FY2012, with the
$500 million SSNs Project for the poorest. This sequence is a good example of the
effective interaction of analytic, technical, and financial support.

There is little direct evidence on the sustainability of Bank-supported activities
implemented during the FY2006–09 and FY2011–14 CAS periods, as most activities

linked to poverty reduction received continuing support over multiple periods.
Bangladesh’s low revenue generation suggests a lack of fiscal space. Most observers
do not regard finance as the binding constraint, however, they regard capacity and
institutional issues as more significant, and pointing out that in spite of low
revenues, Bangladesh’s investment program traditionally underspends. However,
Bank staff cite sustainability concerns as a major program risk, and the frequency of
additional financing and follow-on operations suggest that the lack of fiscal space is
an important constraint.

The Bank’s country strategies in the FY2006–09 and FY2011–14 CASs were well
aligned with Bangladesh’s national poverty reduction strategy, as articulated in the
relevant PRSPs. The CASs supported all four pillars of the PRSPs (i.e.,
macroeconomic stability; sector growth strategies, including infrastructure; safety
nets; and human development). They also focused on governance, which the PRSPs
treated as a cross-cutting issue. PRSP I (2005) had a particularly thorough discussion
of poverty evidence and diagnostics, which put the Bank focus on supporting the
reduction of income poverty in a broader context. Of course, ownership is the key to
actually implementing a national strategy. Many observers question the extent of
PRSP ownership in Bangladesh. Ownership certainly varied over the three regimes
holding power during the past 10 years, with the technocratic caretaker government
most committed to PRSP policies and programs, particularly on the cross-cutting
governance issues. The current government has reverted to national five-year plans
as the mechanism to articulate its national vision and strategy. The Sixth Five-Year
Plan (2011–15) is a much broader document than the PRSP, but it still retains a
strong focus on poverty reduction, including an analysis of poverty diagnostics from
the 2010 HIES. Noting that a new five-year plan was under preparation to take effect
from 2016, the CAS Progress Report (CASPR) extended the Bank program by one
year to coincide better with the Bangladesh planning cycle. However the disconnect
between the next round of the HIES and the government and Bank’s planning cycles
will continue, as the 2015 HIES results will not be available during the plan
preparation period.

The sequence from data to diagnostics to strategy formulation and implementation
varies across sectors. In some cases, feedback loops are strong. In the Social
Protection Program, for example, a history of good analytic work feeding into the
poverty assessments contributed to a well-prioritized set of operational
recommendations focusing on efficiency, efficacy, and targeting. This then formed
the basis for dialogue with the key implementing agencies and project interventions
when circumstances were ripe. Feedback loops are also relatively strong in
education. A focus on improved targeting of education stipends to increase girls’
school attendance led to the realization that attendance rates for boys were falling,

and stipend programs were adjusted to tackle the problem. Poverty-focused
feedback loops have been weaker in infrastructure lending, although there is
growing interest in these sectors (notably rural roads and rural electrification) in
drawing on impact evaluations to improve project design and ultimate service use.

Several elements worked reasonably well in Bangladesh but could have worked
better. Bank support to the various survey rounds (BBS and HIES) over a 20–year
period created a strong database and effective partnership, which could have
expanded earlier to include other key surveys (such as labor force surveys) and
more general strategy formulation and capacity building at BBS. The Bank could
have supported broader and easier access to BBS data and devoted more attention to
the challenge of poverty monitoring between the five-year HIES rounds. Poverty
assessments closely followed the HIES rounds with strong analytic and research
links and consistent messages; a programmatic approach to them might have
provided more timely inputs into strategy formulation. The alignment of the CASs
with the Bangladesh PRSPs facilitated a strong poverty focus, but the results chain
could have been more explicit in sectors having a more indirect influence on poverty
reduction. If the Bangladesh CASs had presented and analyzed poverty reduction
more rigorously, the poverty focus would likely have been more clearly linked to
the growth objective, with the probability of stronger results. Country management
and the country team succeeded in preserving a poverty focus to the Bank program
following the cancellation of the Padma Bridge Project, but this episode suggests
that the Bank’s reputational risk assessment could have been more effectively
managed so as not to sacrifice impact on key development outcomes and poverty
reduction.

SUMMARY ASSESSMENT
In terms of the Bank’s contributions to Bangladesh’s goal of poverty reduction,
many aspects of the Bank’s program over the period of this evaluation worked
reasonably well, but they could have worked better. Bank support to the various
survey rounds and the HIES over a 20–year period created a strong database and
effective partnership that could have expanded earlier to include other key surveys
(such as labor force surveys) and more general strategy formulation and capacity
building at the BBS. The Bank could have supported broader and easier access to
BBS data more strongly and devoted more attention to the challenge of poverty
monitoring in between the five-year HIES rounds. Poverty assessments closely
followed the HIES rounds, with strong analytic and research links and consistent
messages. A programmatic approach to poverty assessments could have provided
more timely inputs for strategy formulation. The alignment of the CASs with the
Bangladesh PRSPs facilitated a strong poverty focus, but the results chain could

reduction. If the Bangladesh CASs had applied a poverty reduction more rigorously,
the poverty focus would likely have been more clearly linked to the growth
objective, with the probability of stronger results. Country management and the

Arab Republic of Egypt
CONTEXT
Before the political changes began taking shape in 2009–10, Egypt’s economy was
strong in many respects. The economy was growing at a fairly rapid pace, averaging
five percent a year between 2000 and 2010. Starting in 2004, the government pursued
wide-ranging structural reforms—including tariff reduction, privatization of state-
owned enterprises, and reduction in regulation of the private sector—that aimed to
improve the business environment and make Egypt’s economy more competitive.
During 2003–13, GDP per capita growth of Egypt averaged about 1.7 percent a year,
and its GNI per capita reached $6,120 in 2011.

However, behind strong growth and significant capital inflows during the first
decade of the 2000s, Egypt’s economy faced a number of vulnerabilities. Average
Egyptians saw little immediate benefit from economic reforms. Growth had done
little to reduce persistently high unemployment, which averaged about 10 percent
during the 2000s (with youth unemployment approaching 40 percent in more recent
years). Poverty headcount, as measured by the national poverty line, increased from
19.6 percent in 2005 to 21.6 percent in 2009 and to 25.2 percent in 2011 (Source: WDI).

The revolution in Egypt unraveled the conditions underpinning growth in the 2000s
and brought potential vulnerabilities to the forefront. Economic growth has fallen to
about two percent a year, and unemployment has continued to rise.

Egypt made good progress toward achieving several non-income MDGs since 2000.
In the past decade (between 2000 and the latest date for which data is available), the
average primary school enrollment rate rose from about 85 percent to about 93.8
percent, the ratio of girls to boys in primary schools rose from 92 percent to 97
percent; the under-five mortality rate fell from 45 percent to 21 percent; and the




                                                                                    109
APPENDIX A
SUMMARIES OF 10 COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
maternal mortality ratio fell from 75 to 50 per 100,000 live births. There were also
improvements in access to safe water and to sanitation facilities.

However, according to diagnostic reports by the Bank, these improvements in
averages mask substantial regional and income disparity in progress toward the
MDGs. Wide disparities persist between Upper Egypt (the south) and Lower Egypt
(the north) and between rural and urban populations. The highest poverty is
concentrated in Upper Egypt, where 43.7 percent of the rural population was living
in poverty in 2009 and where 95 percent of Egypt’s poorest villages are located.
Although only a little more than half of the population lives in rural areas, more
than 78 percent of the poor and 80 percent of the extreme poor live there. These
income disparities are reinforced by gaps in social indicators: virtually all health
indicators and literacy rates are worse in Upper Egypt than in Lower Egypt and
worse in rural areas than in urban areas. Illiteracy rates among young women in
Upper Egypt are twice the rates of their male counterparts.

Despite the rise in poverty in recent years and large disparities across regions and
income groups, the Gini coefficient for Egypt (0.307) is only among the lowest in
developing countries. Moreover, it shows a decline over the past decade, which
contradicts with the perceived level of inequality by Egyptian experts. This likely
points to underestimation and possible data quality issues. Some recent estimates
indicate that if the data corrected for under-reported or unreported top incomes, the
estimated Gini coefficient may rise significantly.

POVERTY DATA
The poverty and inequality issues in Egypt are tied to the political discourse used by
successive governments. The Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics
(CAPMAS) is not an independent statistical agency and this is an important issue.
International organizations, including the World Bank, and the public do not have
access to the full dataset. Full access to the raw data is controlled through “trusted”
consultants, and only relatively small samples (typically 20 percent) are made
public. This lack of access compounds the observation that there is a concentration
of households at relatively low levels of consumption, and numbers are likely to
vary considerably with slight variations in the poverty lines.

The HIES estimates released by CAPMAS and repeated in the 2011 World Bank
poverty assessment suggest that, during the later years of the evaluation period,
there was no substantial increase in poverty or inequality (poverty remained
virtually unchanged between 2004–05 and 2008–09 in urban areas and increased
slightly in rural areas, and Gini coefficients in both urban and rural areas declined).
However, data from nutritional surveys suggest a significant increase in child

wasting and stunting since 2003. Moreover, recent estimates released by CAPMAS
show a steady increase in poverty, with absolute numbers doubling between 2004
and 2014.

The HIES data most likely miss the tails of the size distribution and are less able to
capture nonwage income. Consequently, conclusions concerning inequality using
the HIES should generally be treated with caution, as several researchers have
pointed out. The troubling independent anthropometric data 3—especially the trends
on the deterioration of standards since the early 2000s—should have been available
to Bank staff. These data—and the clear increase in the number of the extreme
poor—should have tempered the story on no increase in poverty or inequality.

As pointed out in the discussion during the University of Cairo launch of the recent
Bank monograph on poverty and inequality, the CAPMAS data likely underestimate
both tails of the size distribution and are unable to capture the extent of nonwage
income, particularly from financial assets. There is clearly a distrust by some
academics and economic experts of the poverty and income inequality estimates
presented in the Bank report, especially given the perception that disparities are
clearly visible but not picked up by the incomplete data. More troubling from a
policy perspective is the Bank’s observation that there is limited mobility among
Egyptian households. This observation is not consistent with the perception that
mobility is high wherever there is an expectation of employment opportunities, both
in urban areas in Egypt and abroad. Indeed, some of the informality in housing as
well as the labor market reflects mobility of some but not all members of extended-
family households. Anthropological work in Egypt suggests that women seldom
leave their family homes, as it is difficult to establish property rights in new
locations. Moreover, some family members are needed to work on small farms and
maintain their homes. Consequently, the structure of formal households remains
remarkably stable, leading some observers to believe that there is relatively little
mobility in Egypt. Yet men typically migrate to find employment, either seasonal or
longer term.

In addition to the HIES, specific village-level studies have established that many
women and children in Upper Egypt live in abject conditions. These vulnerable
groups may also be affected by a shock in urban areas that affects informal
employment, which may also affect the income of the extended household,
particularly the build-up of assets and remittances sent to rural family members.

The Bank’s recent work on the labor market, however, suggests that there is
considerable informality and vulnerability in Egypt, including in the “large-scale or
established sector,” as is seen in other middle-income countries, such as Mexico.


                                                                                     111
APPENDIX A
SUMMARIES OF 10 COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
Much of this type of informal labor force is urban-based and reflects firms’
concealment of labor use, outputs, and profits. Informal workers are also likely to be
most affected by relative price changes, including changes in the prices of food and
energy.

Reducing inequality is important to ensure that the benefits of growth are not
captured by the elites, fanning the flames of resentment in the aftermath of the Arab
Spring. Given the extent of informality and likely concealment by firms in the formal
sectors, it may be necessary to splice the HIES data, reflecting the middle ranges of
the size distribution, together with information from other data sources. Thus, a
possible reconciliation of the phenomenon of evident poverty in Upper Egypt with
the new appreciation of informality and vulnerability is likely to be important, as it
will also guide the design of policy responses. Further work on diagnostics is
needed, including a careful juxtaposition of the data from the HIES and the labor
force and other surveys, and sophisticated econometric assessments.

DIAGNOSTICS
Substantially less AAA were undertaken in Egypt than proposed in the various
strategy documents. Notably absent were the core diagnostics of a Public
Expenditure Review and a social and structural review. Consequently, it was
convenient that poverty assessments suggested the incidence was low and stable
and concentrated in the rural areas of Upper Egypt, and only modest increases had
occurred in poverty based on national poverty line or inequality during the period
of 2005–2009. Other indicators of poverty, basic needs, and informality suggested
that the situation was not so positive. By missing out on the increasing vulnerability
of informal migrants in urban areas, the CAPMAS estimates—although correctly
identifying poor households in Upper Egypt—may not have provided the
government the needed information for policy making.

The recent release of new data for 2012–13 and previous years by CAPMAS cast
further doubts on the Bank’s 2011 poverty assessment and raises further questions
concerning a recent Bank report on income inequality. It suggests a continuous
increase in poverty since the early 2000s, with absolute numbers doubling between
2004 and 2012–13, and the proportion of the population below the poverty threshold
increasing from 16.7 percent in 1999–2000 to 26.3 percent in 2012–13. The big
question remains whether the numbers accurately reflect the number of poor
inhabitants in metropolitan area slums.

A conundrum in the CAPMAS data is that the percentage of people living in
extreme poverty—people spending less than Egyptian Pound LE 214 a month (or LE
2,570 annually)—declined after 2008. The proportion fell from 6.1 percent in 2008–09

                                                      SUMMARIES OF 10 COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
to 4.8 percent in 2010–11 and 4.4 percent in 2012–13. Although these figures are
higher than the 1999–2000 figure of 2.9 percent, the implications need to be thought
through and investigated further.

The recent jobs and informality report by the Bank is the second serious analytical
report that breaks new ground in an innovative manner. However, like the equally
innovative and interesting economic geography report by the Bank in 2012, it relied
on an unsatisfactory overall assessment of the governance framework that basically
assumes that the modernization of the public finance management (PFM) and tax
agendas are well in hand. But perhaps the most serious drawback of both reports is
the assumption that mobility in Egypt is low, which is not the case, particularly
given the large outflow of labor to the other parts of the Middle East and North
Africa Region.

One of the most important contributions of the Bank’s report on jobs and informality
(2014) is that it introduces realism on labor market conditions. As in many other
middle-income developing countries, like Mexico, informality covers more than just
people selling cigarettes on street corners. Large, formal sector firms often hire
informal workers: the 51 percent share of informal workers in formal firms is
remarkable. The report points to the complex nature of need and vulnerability—and
the prospect that a broader approach to long-term poverty reduction may be needed
than providing cash transfers to the population in Upper Egypt. The economic
geography report (2012) provides an analytical framework that could be recalibrated
by tweaking the assumption of limited internal migration. It reveals a more complex
and diverse nature of vulnerability and need than the assumed concentration in
Upper Egypt and a much more difficult PFM and governance environment than
assumed in the report.

STRATEGY FORMULATION, IMPLEMENTATION, AND FEEDBACK LOOPS
The Bank’s Board discussed the last CAS for Egypt in May 2005. In July 2008 the
Board discussed Egypt’s CASPR, and the then-current CAS was extended to the end
of FY2009. An Interim Strategy Note for Egypt, covering the period June 2012–
December 2013, was presented to the Board in May 2012. The work on a new CPS,
which started in 2010, was suspended in 2011 because of the political upheaval in
Egypt. The new CPS will cover FY2015–18.

The CAS Completion Report (CASCR) for the FY2002–04 CAS noted that although
the overarching objective was to reduce poverty and unemployment, poverty may
have increased. Substantially less AAA was undertaken than proposed, and notably
absent were the core diagnostics of a PER and a social and structural review. It also
noted that with IBRD terms, the government was able to borrow more cheaply,

SUMMARIES OF 10 COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
including from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for an
information infrastructure project. Budgets were not consolidated, and
megaprojects, wages, and subsidies led to a spiraling deficit. Consequently, the Bank
delivered a small portion of the economic and sector work (ESW) program and a
large loan (Cairo airport) to meet its lending target. A similar pattern was repeated
with the FY2006–09 CAS. Despite the clear statement of the poverty focus in the
well-argued FY2006–09 CAS, the subsequent choice of projects suggests that any
linkage with poverty is purely coincidental.

Attempts to design and implement development policy loans (DPLs) have
foundered on the issue of overall macroeconomic imbalances and the absence of an
agreement between the Egyptian authorities and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF). The spiraling fiscal deficit is caused in large part by the system of
administered prices, especially for energy products. As shown in work by both the
IMF and the Bank, the bulk of the benefits of such policies now accrue to the
relatively well-off and the middle classes, especially in urban areas. This evidence
lends support to the public perception that inequalities have increased. Until the
recent election, governments lacked either the political legitimacy or adequate
appreciation of the situation to take corrective measures. Typically, inaction is
justified on the grounds that price adjustments would hurt the poor—but the reality
is that powerful middle-class interests are likely to be affected.

A question that has been asked in Egypt and within the Bank is whether conditional
cash transfers (CCTs) could be used as part of a strategy of energy price
rationalization, as often recommended by both the IMF and the Bank. Clearly, CCTs
have a role to play in empowering rural women and encouraging girls to go to
school, as part of a permanent social safety net for the poorest groups in society.
There has been considerable research in Egypt on this issue. However, these groups
are distinct from those who have to adjust as a result of the relative price changes.
People affected by price changes are not just the poorest; CCTs could cause labor
market distortions and become an entitlement that cannot easily be removed;
diminish the intended reduction in incentives to adjust spending in response to
higher prices; and with weak PFM mechanisms are subject to leakage and abuse.

In the absence of a PER, the likelihood of the government endorsing the tax and
PFM infrastructure (a Treasury Single Account [TSA]) appeared unlikely, although
the overall fiscal fragility was recognized. “Silos” among donors do not help. The
IMF seems to have principal responsibility for advice on tax policy, including
property tax, and budget and treasury design (the Government Finance Statistics
Manual framework and TSA). However, USAID has been assisting with
implementation (of the Government Financial Management Information System

[GFMIS] and tax administration). The apparent failure of the GFMIS and the
inability to implement a TSA could have serious consequences for the Bank’s
support for a poverty reduction strategy. Similarly, it is becoming increasingly clear
that an effective system of local property taxation has to be linked to local service
delivery and access to credit for local infrastructure. These are not issues with which
the IMF typically deals.

Regulatory costs and bureaucratic hurdles are high in Egypt. As described in a 2012
World Bank report, 120 industrial zones and numerous cities have been developed
in several phases. All were established on public land, with relatively poor linkages
and connectivity and considerable regulation. Few have been successful, and the
incentives for different players (firms and workers) are poorly aligned. Any new
initiative to create growth hubs—say, along the Suez corridor—would have to
simplify regulations, establish an incentive compatible tax regime, and provide
workers with adequate housing and services as well as the infrastructure needed for
stepped-up investments.

The quality of poverty data in Egypt during the period of this evaluation is
questionable. The full sample is made available only to select groups of consultants
and researchers favored by the government, and it is not possible to assess the
quality of the full set of data. The data that are publicly available do not seem to
capture the new type of poverty that has been building up around the major
metropolitan areas and in major shanty towns, thus leading to a serious
underestimation of the extent of poverty in Egypt. Although the quality of the Bank
diagnostics has been generally good and the topics covered relevant, they may have
been based on questionable data. In addition, the government has not allowed the
Bank to prepare important analytical pieces, such as PERs or Public Investment
Reviews, which are highly relevant to any government’s poverty reduction strategy
formulation and related policy design. The strategy formulated by the Bank over the
years attempted to include some focus on poverty, but the government in power
during most of the evaluation period (2004 to February 2011) did not wish to borrow
from the Bank for supporting its development programs in the social sectors.
Moreover, implementation of the strategy (in terms of the Bank’s portfolio of
projects and program) deviated from the agreed plans in the various strategy
documents, resulting in an even weaker focus on poverty during the
implementation phase.

During much of the period covered by this evaluation, the Bank tried to engage and
maintain a working relationship with a reluctant but strategically important client
who was not committed to the goal of poverty reduction and did not want to
borrow from the Bank for the purpose of poverty reduction or developing its social

sectors. Despite these difficulties, the Bank made a few successful attempts (mainly
through analytical reports) to highlight the daunting challenge of poverty, including
its strong regional dimension. Its efforts did not result in a strategic shift toward a
greater focus on poverty and inclusion, however, until after the revolution of 2010–
11. It is expected that the newly elected government of Egypt will pay greater
attention to poverty and inclusion issues than previous governments ones did.

as PERs, which are highly relevant to any government’s poverty reduction strategy
formulation and related policy design. Although the strategy formulated by the
Bank over the years has attempted to include some focus on poverty, previous
governments in Egypt during the evaluation period had generally different
priorities than focusing on poverty. In general, the governmentthat was in power
during most of the evaluation period (2004 to February 2011), did not seem to focus
on poverty and related issues. Moreover, implementation of the strategy
underpinning the Bank’s portfolio of projects and program deviated from the agreed
plans in the various strategy documents, resulting in an even weaker focus on
poverty during the implementation phase of strategy.

During much of the period covered by this evaluation, the Bank was trying to
maintain a working relationship and be responsive to the requests of a reluctant but
strategically important client who had different priorities than poverty reduction
and did not want to borrow from the Bank for the purpose of reducing poverty or
developing its social sectors. Despite these difficulties, the Bank made a few
successful attempts (mainly through its analytical reports) to highlight the daunting
challenge of poverty, including its strong regional dimension, facing Egypt. Its
efforts never resulted in a strategic shift toward a greater focus on poverty and

Guatemala
CONTEXT
Guatemala grew by about 4.5 percent a year until it was hit by the global financial
crisis in 2008–09 and a serious of natural disasters in 2010–11. Average annual
growth in 2003–13 was about 3.5 percent (1 percent in per capita terms). GNI per
capita was about $4,760 in 2011. Although Guatemala’s economy is the largest in
Central America and its per capita GDP is close to the regional average, it has one of
the highest levels of poverty (especially in rural and indigenous areas) and income
inequality in the region. Moreover, poverty indicators have changed very little over
the past decade in spite of positive average economic growth. Although some
modest gains appear to have been made in reducing extreme poverty, the lot of the
nonindigent poor has not improved and may have even worsened. The overall
national poverty headcount rate declined from 56 percent in 2000 to 51 percent in
2006, but it rose to 54 percent in 2011, yielding an overall reduction of only 2.5
percentage points over the decade. Moreover, the relation between poverty
indicators and economic growth appears to be very weak. Guatemala’s social
indicators exhibit a somewhat steadier picture of gradual progress over time,
although huge gaps remain across ethnic, gender, geographic, and rural and urban
divides. Most worrisome is the persistence of child malnutrition indicators: with
about 50 percent of its children malnourished, Guatemala continues to lag behind
some of the poorest countries in world in this indicator. On the positive side, the
national household surveys suggest that there has been a substantial decline in
inequality between 2003 and 2011. However, questions remain about the accuracy of
the figures on distribution based on these household surveys.

POVERTY DATA
Starting in the late 1990s, the Guatemalan authorities, with Bank and other donor
support through the Mejoramiento de las Encuestas de Hogares y la Medición de
Condiciones de Vida program, pushed to strengthen the main public institutions in
charge of carrying out living standards surveys and generating reliable poverty-
relevant data. Living Standard Measurement Surveys (LSMSs) were carried out in
2000, 2006, and 2011. During this period, Guatemala also carried out two National
Maternal and Child Health Surveys in 2002 and 2008/09, and annual labor surveys
that complement the findings from the LSMSs. This capacity-building effort helped
create a critical mass of technical expertise in the National Statistics Institute and the
government’s planning secretariat, resulting in a vast improvement in the quality of
data, greater transparency in the management of data, a broad consensus on how to
measure poverty, and widespread consciousness of the importance of having
reliable, objective poverty data. In addition to the technical and financial support

provided, the Bank played a critical role in helping achieve public consensus on the
measurement of poverty, based on objective technical criteria instead of political
ones.

The advances made in strengthening Guatemala’s capacity to produce high-quality
poverty statistics may not be sustainable. Despite their tremendous success, the
technical assistance programs that supported the production of good poverty
statistics expired at the beginning of this decade, and the prospects of future support
with resources from the national budget remain uncertain. The Bank may have
underestimated the need for continued institution-building support to guarantee
sustainability, as there are already signs that the institutional capacity that was built
up over the previous decade has begun to decline, compromising the ability to
continue generating good poverty statistics in the future.

Although providing solid analytical work, the poverty assessments for Guatemala
were not uniformly consistent in proposing actionable recommendations and
assessing institutional capacity-building needs. The 2003 poverty assessment
provided a number of detailed recommendations for addressing poverty in
Guatemala; the subsequent two assessments limited themselves to broad strategic
recommendations. More detailed recommendations for addressing labor and
product market rigidities might have been useful. Even so, the poverty maps and
proxy-means testing formulas developed as part of the Bank’s diagnostic work have
played an important role in the government’s strategic planning processes and in
the design of public programs. These instruments either did not exist in Guatemala
or existed only in very rudimentary form until the 2003 poverty assessment was
prepared. The Bank’s poverty diagnostic work played an important role in bringing
the topic of poverty reduction into the national political discourse from a technical
perspective. Before this work, this topic was considered too sensitive to discuss in
view of the country’s historical and political circumstances.

DIAGNOSTICS
The Bank’s poverty diagnostic work has improved the government’s and donors’
understanding of the main drivers of poverty by identifying the contribution made
by different sources of income on the reduction of poverty. It also points toward
structural rigidities that may have prevented faster poverty reduction. The 2005
Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) found that two of the most important
factors responsible for this relatively slow growth performance are low education
attainment levels and poor public infrastructure, which in turn reflect low public
sector spending levels. The Bank’s PERs have raised questions about the quality of
public expenditures, particularly in the social sectors, noting problems related to
geographic targeting and technical efficiency. In particular, the 2013 PER found no

                                                      SUMMARIES OF 10 COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
clear relationship between the level of public spending and student achievement in
education. Health outcomes also did not appear to be strongly linked to health
expenditures. The general absence of quantitative links between recommended
measures and poverty reduction is a significant limitation of the Bank’s diagnostic
work. Although existing diagnostic work makes a convincing case that certain
interventions, such as measures leading to improvements in social indicators,
contribute to poverty reduction, it provides little help in estimating the degree to
which poverty rates may decline in response to certain sector outcomes and thus
offers little guidance in choosing the appropriate balance between interventions that
promote growth, improve social indicators, and redistribute incomes to reduce
poverty in the most efficient manner.

STRATEGY FORMULATION, IMPLEMENTATION, AND FEEDBACK LOOPS
All three country strategies produced by the Bank since 2004 refer to poverty
reduction as the underlying objective and draw on the findings from the latest
poverty assessments, CEMs, and PERs to propose interventions designed to reach
that objective. The Bank prepared three country strategies during this period: the
FY05–08 CAS, the FY09–12 CPS, and the FY13–16 CPS. All recognize the importance
of economic growth as a necessary condition for achieving faster poverty reduction
and point toward low education attainment and poor productive infrastructure as
key obstacles to faster growth. In addition, all three strategy documents recognize
that unequal access to social and productive public services has been a major
obstacle to poverty reduction, independent of the poverty-growth nexus.
Accordingly, all three strategies propose measures to promote faster sustained
economic growth and new operations designed to increase access to social services
and public infrastructure services, with particular attention on groups that have
traditionally been underserved.

Although sharing these common elements, the three strategies exhibit differences in
emphasis that respond to new developments and new insights gained from
successive poverty diagnoses. The FY05–08 CAS focused mainly on DPL-supported
actions meant to promote growth and competitiveness, coupled with investment
loans to strengthen the education, health, and rural infrastructure sectors to provide
better structural underpinnings for faster economic growth. In contrast, the FY09–12
CPS supported a program of conditional cash transfers, with the aim of reaching the
pockets of poverty that the 2006 LSMS had revealed to be unresponsive to economic
growth. The FY13–16 CPS focused on the need to address crime and violence as
increasing threats to economic growth and poverty reduction in Guatemala and the
need to strengthen institutional capabilities to improve the quality of public
spending, in parallel with efforts to raise fiscal revenues further (as recommended in

the 2013 PER). The Bank strategies also adapted to different priorities across
government administrations. The greater focus on growth-promoting reforms in the
FY05–08 CAS and FY13–16 CPS also reflect the greater priority given to improved
governance and competitiveness by the administrations in power, while the focus on
conditional cash transfers in the FY09–12 CPS coincides with the administration in
office at that time and its greater emphasis on social inclusiveness and reducing
inequality.

The FY09–12 and FY13–16 CPSs called for a larger share of lending in the form of
fast-disbursing support, for reasons in part unrelated to poverty reduction. In the
case of the FY09–12 CPS, more lending in the form of DPLs was called for to address
fears of illiquidity triggered by the then emerging global financial crisis. The FY13–
16 CPS proposed to maintain a very DPL-intensive lending portfolio, less because of
crisis-related fears and more because of increasing operational obstacles to the
implementation of investment projects in Guatemala. A preference for DPLs over
investment lending on account of the latter’s greater implementation difficulties,
however, is difficult to justify on poverty grounds and ultimately becomes
counterproductive if it threatens to undermine fiscal sustainability.

Bank interventions proposed for Guatemala reflect the Bank’s priorities, as
expressed in the results framework of each country strategy. The new lending
operations proposed in each strategy document are closely aligned with the main
recommendations that emerged from previous diagnostic work. In addition, the
Bank proposed an extensive program of nonlending AAA activities to complement
its poverty-related loan portfolio, anchored in periodic poverty assessments and
poverty assessment updates that were included in the CAS and CPSs. The 2003
poverty assessment recommended actions in the areas of economic growth,
education, health and nutrition, rural infrastructure, public sector management, and
the targeting of interventions on the poor. The 2009 poverty assessment added the
recommendation to strengthen the CCT program. Even though not all the proposed
interventions have a direct poverty-reducing objective, each has a proposed loan or
loan component that can be mapped to each of the main recommendations
highlighted in the poverty assessments.

Programmatic series of DPLs played a major role in all the CASs/CPSs prepared
since 2004, accounting for at least half of the total proposed lending. The DPLs have
been broadly justified as vehicles for supporting structural reforms to promote faster
growth as the key underpinning for poverty reduction. Beyond that indirect link,
only very small portions of the DPL-supported programs address poverty reduction.
The only policy objective that is remotely linked to poverty reduction in the first
series of DPLs (2005–07) was the raising of total social spending to at least 6 percent

of gross domestic product (GDP). Concerns about sustainability have influenced the
operations included in the Bank’s country strategy to reduce poverty.

Two developments in the composition of lending operations implemented between
2005 and 2012 are the hugely increased proportion of lending through fast-
disbursing DPLs and the decline in lending devoted to poverty-related investment
projects. The share of DPLs increased from 55 percent of total lending during the
FY05–08 CAS period to 83 percent of total lending during the subsequent CPS
period. The FY05–08 CAS was implemented during a period of favorable
macroeconomic conditions, marked by modest economic growth and a stable
external environment. As a result, the actual lending program turned out to be fairly
close to the planned base-case program envisioned in the FY05–08 CAS. Although
most of the lending and nonlending targets in the FY05–08 CAS were achieved,
project implementation problems led to uneven achievement of the poverty-related
development outcomes. Most lending and AAA outputs proposed in the FY05–08
CAS were delivered, and the bulk of the expected outcomes from Bank-supported
interventions were achieved. As a result, the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)
rated achievement of development outcomes of the CAS overall, as well as the
Bank’s contribution to those outcomes, as moderately satisfactory. The weakest
performance was in the development outcomes associated with the most poverty-
relevant projects. IEG rated these outcome as moderately unsatisfactory in its
CASCR review of 2008.

The FY09–12 CPS was implemented in much more difficult economic and political
circumstances, resulting in significant program deviations. In contrast to the FY05–
08 CAS period, the CPS period of FY09–12 saw the global financial crisis, a food
price crisis, rising drug-related violence, and several Guatemala-specific natural
disasters in 2010. As a result, much of the proposed lending program was redirected
toward other priorities. A major setback to Bank efforts to support poverty
reduction was the cancelation of a project to support the government’s flagship CCT
program. Despite considerable differences between the originally planned and
implemented portfolio during this CPS period, however, the Bank’s performance
was considered moderately satisfactory. The CPS Completion Report (CPSCR) rated
both Bank performance and the achievement of results as moderately satisfactory.
The CPS outcomes as redefined by the progress report were, for the most part,
achieved or partially achieved.

The project implementation problems that led to the cancelation of the CCT project
appear to have worsened over time. These problems are largely attributable to an
increased reluctance to borrow by a very conservative Congress, as well as to
increasing institutional obstacles that have led to long delays in project

implementation. After the Bank approves a loan, it takes Guatemala’s Congress an
extremely long time to ratify it. As a result, many projects need to be restructured by
the time they become effective. Once they become effective, most projects face
further implementation delays, brought on by a combination of weak institutions,
overly centralized public management, complex procurement rules, inflexible
administrative procedures and high staff turnover in government.

The Bank has produced considerable evidence on poverty reduction in its programs
and adjusted its programs in response to that evidence, but it does not target
poverty indicators directly. Neither the CAS nor the two CPSs prepared since 2004
present poverty indicators in their results frameworks, and changes in poverty
indicators are not targeted as part of the monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
framework. Most Bank-supported operations reviewed for this task include M&E
systems to assess project impact or contain provisions for building capacity to put
such systems in place. Nevertheless, it is widely perceived that a culture of
systematic evaluations still remains to be created across the public sector.

The feedback loops characterizing World Bank operations in Guatemala—from data
production to poverty diagnostics to country strategy and implementation—have
not been strong in all areas. The Bank seems to have done an excellent job in
supporting the generation of poverty data and in preparing poverty diagnoses over
the past decade, so that lack of adequate data and diagnostics do not stand out as
major obstacles in addressing poverty in Guatemala. Concerns have subsequently
arisen about the sustainability of past capacity-building efforts in Guatemala’s
statistics-producing institutions. These concerns were not pertinent for most of the
period covered by this analysis; rather, they may become a problem for future
operations. The CAS/CPSs and choice of planned lending and non-

Lending operations appear generally well aligned with the poverty diagnostics in
seeking to address the key bottlenecks to poverty reduction. A potential thematic
disconnect between poverty diagnostics and the choice of programs and projects
does not stand out as a major problem. The area in the feedback loop where the
Bank’s support for antipoverty efforts appears to have been least successful during
the past decade is country strategy implementation. The result has been overreliance
on DPLs with limited links to poverty reduction. Although this lack of success was
partly caused by unforeseen external circumstances, it also reflects both institutional
impediments that paralyze the public sector’s capacity to function and an
inadequate fiscal framework that undermines sustainability.

SUMMARY ASSESSMENT
The feedback loops characterizing Bank operations in Guatemala—from data
production to poverty diagnostics to country strategy formulation and
implementation—have not been evenly strong in all areas. The Bank seems to have
done an excellent job in supporting the generation of poverty data and in preparing
poverty diagnoses over the past decade, so that lack of adequate data and
diagnostics do not stand out as major obstacles to addressing poverty in Guatemala.
Concerns have arisen about the sustainability of past capacity-building efforts in
Guatemala’s statistics-producing institutions. These concerns were not pertinent for
most of the period covered by this analysis but rather may become a problem for
future operations. The CAS and CPSs and the choice of lending and nonlending
operations appear generally well aligned with the poverty diagnostics; a thematic
disconnect between poverty diagnostics and the choice of programs and projects
does not stand out as a major problem. The one area in the feedback loop where the
Bank’s support for anti-poverty efforts appears to have been least successful during
the past decade is country strategy implementation. This difficult in project
implementation has resulted in an overreliance on development policy loans (DPLs)
with limited links to poverty reduction. Although this lack of success was caused
partly by unforeseen external circumstances, it also reflects both institutional
impediments that paralyze the public sector’s capacity to function and an
inadequate fiscal framework, which undermines sustainability.


Lao People’s Democratic Republic
CONTEXT
During the review period, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic enjoyed annual
GDP growth of about 8 percent (5.7 percent in per capita terms), and the poverty
headcount rate continued its long-term decline, falling from 33 percent in 2002/03 to
28 percent in 2007/08 and 22 percent in 2012/13. GNI per capita reached $2,580 in
2011. Progress was also achieved on primary education and basic health care (life
expectancy, for example, increased from 46 years in 1970 to 67 years in 2011). The
share of rural households with access to electricity expanded from 16 percent in 1995
to 45 percent in 2004 and about 80 percent more recently.

However, there are real threats to maintaining macroeconomic stability and growth
and therefore to achieving further reductions in poverty. Although primary school
enrollment rose from 75 percent in 2000 to 96 percent in 2012 and the under-five
mortality rate fell from 120 to 72 (per1000 live births), progress on achieving some of
the other MDGs is inadequate. Growing fiscal deficits threaten macroeconomic
stability in the near term, and the overly rapid expansion of foreign direct

investment in hydropower, mining, transport, and agricultural projects may
produce negative social and environmental impacts. Significant disparities in
economic growth and poverty reduction persist across the country’s diverse ethnic
groups and geographical regions, and it appears likely that some of the nutrition,
universal primary education, child mortality, maternal health, and environmental
sustainability MDGs will not be met.

POVERTY DATA
The Bank country team has had adequate survey and administrative data of
sufficient quality to carry out detailed poverty diagnostics and support the poverty
reduction focus of the country program for the Lao People’s Democratic Republic.
The five Lao PDR Expenditure and Consumption Surveys (LECS) (undertaken in
1992/93, 1997/98, 2002/03, 2007/08, and 2012/13) are nationally representative
household surveys of consumption expenditure and a wide range of socioeconomic
information. The Lao PDR Statistical Bureau has conducted all of the LECS surveys.
The Bank and other development partners have provided extensive technical and
financial support to the LECS surveys since 1991. Although there are some concerns
about the quality, accessibility, and timeliness of the LECS survey data, the data
have been sufficient and played a core role in the preparation of the Bank’s poverty
diagnostics during the review period. The Bank and other development partners
provided extensive technical and financial support over the review period to
improve the quality, availability, and timeliness of administrative data on
educational attainment, health outcomes, nutritional status, and other indicators.
These additional data have allowed for deeper and more multidimensional poverty
diagnostics work.

DIAGNOSTICS
The Bank’s poverty diagnostics work was of good quality and demonstrated good
practice in most, but not all, areas. The good practice elements of the poverty
diagnostics work include (i) collaborating and sharing with the government and
development partners all aspects of the poverty diagnostic work; (ii) building Lao
PDR capacity for gathering and analyzing poverty data; (iii) making full use of the
available survey and administrative poverty data to provide a comprehensive and
multidimensional poverty profile that assessed poverty trends over time, across
Regions, and across social groups; (iv) assessing the key drivers of poverty reduction
including growth, access to social services and basic infrastructure, agricultural
productivity and rural development; (v) examining the poverty reduction impact of
relevant government poverty reduction programs, funding, and sectoral policies;
and (vi) encouraging deep country ownership of the poverty analytics and seeking
full consistency with the government’s poverty reduction strategy.

The Bank team’s poverty diagnostic work was closely tailored to country specifics,
such as the inclusion of an examination of the special concern of unexploded
ordinance. It provided a good understanding of extreme poverty and the special
concerns of poor women and upland ethnic minority groups, and it consolidated list
of priority poverty reduction measures. The shortcomings of the work include the
limited analysis of the government’s poverty reduction institutions and the limited
integration of the results of available participatory and qualitative poverty
assessments. Although the consolidated list of priority poverty reduction measures
was not as specific, actionable, time-bound, or costed as it might have been, these
weaknesses did not in any way thwart or limit the poverty reduction focus of the
Bank’s country program.

STRATEGY FORMULATION, IMPLEMENTATION, AND FEEDBACK LOOPS
Poverty reduction is a central focus of the Bank’s country program in Lao PDR. The
FY05–08 CAS and FY12–16 CPS fully reflect the Bank’s poverty diagnostics and have
a sharp focus on poverty reduction. There is a near exact fit between the
recommendations of the 2006 poverty assessment and the FY12–16 CPS; the one
important exception is fully explained in the FY12–16 CPS and by the division of
labor agreed to under the 2006 Vientiane Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. There is a
favorable balance of analytical work, technical assistance, and project work, and the
results chain is evident. The FY12–16 CPS does an excellent job of mapping all
aspects of the country program into the government’s poverty reduction strategy
and is fully consistent with the development partners harmonization explicated in
the 2006 Vientiane Declaration. The key elements of the poverty focus of the Bank’s
country program include (i) the lynchpin Nam Theun 2 Project (NT2) and the closely
associated Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO) projects; (ii) the Poverty
Reduction Fund and Khammouane Development Projects; (iii) education and health
projects; (iv) rural electrification, transport, and agricultural development projects;
and (v) the extensive analytical work and technical assistance programs associated
with these activities.

The core poverty reduction results chain of the programs of AAA, technical
assistance, and project activities in the FY05–08 CAS and FY12–16 CAS was clear
and strong throughout the review period and very closely mapped to the
government’s poverty reduction strategy. The poverty reduction results chain is
sustaining strong economic growth through improved economic management,
regional integration, private sector development and competitiveness, and natural
resource management and development. It is improving social outcomes and
reducing vulnerability through strengthened public financial management and
public service delivery, improved infrastructure services in transport and energy,

and targeted poverty reduction programs. Adequate quality poverty data and
extensive and good-quality poverty diagnostics underpinned this results chain
throughout the review period.

The poverty diagnostics work showed that extreme poverty, ethnic minorities, and
other disadvantaged groups are concentrated largely in first-priority districts—those
districts with high poverty headcount and receiving high priority for antipoverty
programs. As nearly all of the Bank’s support for basic infrastructure, education,
health, and other social services; poor area development programs; and natural
resource development and management activities is concentrated in these districts
and some other lagging regions, much of the country program has
disproportionately benefitted the extreme poor, ethnic minorities, and other
disadvantaged groups.

The FY05–08 CAS takes explicit note of the major risks of possible loss of
government commitment to continued policy reform and weak implementation
capacity as well as poor performance of the NT2 program. The FY12–16 CPS goes a
step farther by stating that the FY05–08 CAS “included some bold and potentially
risky activities, most obviously the NT2 project, but also commitments to budget
support operations, community driven development, and policy reforms in a low
capacity environment.” The Bank’s country program did indeed embark on a high-
risk and high-reward poverty reduction path during the review period, and the
FY12–16 CPS concluded that “performance was impressive.” This favorable
performance in very large part reflected the fact that the country program was
designed to mitigate these risks through a strong focus on capacity building and the
concentration of much of the Bank’s resources on the core NT2 program. The FY12–
16 CPS correctly concluded that “this success in turn demands raising the level of
engagement” during FY12–16. The risks to the country program are now at least as
great as they were at the outset of the FY05–08 CAS. Looking forward, there are
signs that the growing fiscal deficit and weak management of the rapidly expanding
investment in, and land concessions for, hydropower, mining, and agricultural
activities have the potential to undermine the achievements made during the review
period.

Interviews and the review of documents by the IEG team provide additional details
on these risks to the poverty reduction focus of the country program. First, the
growing inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) for hydropower development is
part of the rapidly growing FDI for mining, transport, and agricultural projects,
which is contributing to the surge in government expenditure and the fiscal deficit.
This process appears to be overwhelming the government’s economic management
capacity, contributing to threats of inflation, an unsustainable debt overhang, and

the potential for Dutch disease. Second, as stated in the FY12–16 CPS and the 2010
Lao PDR Development Report, the good practice standards established by NT2 for
large-scale infrastructure projects appear to be weakening under the onslaught of
escalating FDI. Third, during the two years since the FY12–16 CPS, the government
was not in full compliance with the reporting and auditing requirements of the NT2
Revenue Management Agreements. However, the most recent IEG team interview
suggests that this problem may have been corrected by mid-2014. Overall, the
interviews for this case study confirmed that the Lao PDR country team and
government are well aware of these issues and are now actively collaborating on
measures to control these risks.

IEG identified two additional concerns. First, although the Bank country team’s
decision to forgo more active engagement in agriculture is understandable, a strong
case is to be made for engaging in efforts to better mitigate the negative impacts on
the well-being of the rural population of land concessions for hydropower, mining,
transport, and agricultural projects. Although some of these land concessions may
have benefits to the rural population that exceed their costs, in many and perhaps
most cases this has not been true. Several interviewees suggested that rural
inhabitants adversely affected by such land concessions are now becoming the
poorest of the poor. Consistent with the Bank’s core mandate of poverty reduction, it
seems essential that its country team fully engage on this key issue. A promising
option is the approach being developed under the Northern Uplands Development
Program. This approach reportedly includes a politically appropriate program to
better protect the welfare of the rural population giving local governments several
politically safe options for better containing or perhaps even reversing the
potentially negative impact of land concessions on the rural population.

A second potential weakness in the current approach appears to be related to the
fact that the Bank’s country team has not actively examined labor mobility as a
priority poverty reduction measure. International experience has shown that labor
mobility has been a powerful poverty reduction mechanism. (The outflow of more
than 200 million rural migrant laborers in China, for example, played perhaps the
lead role in that country’s extraordinary success in poverty reduction over the past
30 years.) Some work on skills training for labor mobility is being undertaken as part
of the upcoming Lao PDR Development Report, but it would appear that more
ambitious analytical work on this topic is merited.

The feedback loop of the core elements of the poverty reduction focus in the Bank’s
country program is strong and clearly evident. The country team produced, or
helped produce, sufficient evidence on poverty reduction and made good use of this
evidence in the design, implementation, and evolution of the poverty reduction

focus of the country program. Given the programmatic nature of most of the core
elements of the poverty reduction focus, there has been a continual learning process
and feedback loop. This programmatic nature has facilitated the evolution of the
country program and its poverty reduction focus. For example, the government and
the Bank felt that the sectoral coverage of PRSOs 1–3 was too broad and that PRSOs
4–7 concentrated their sectoral coverage on improving the delivery of basic
education and health services to the rural poor. This narrowed focus on just
education and health services for the rural poor also included a strong emphasis on
improving provincial reporting of basic education and health sector performance
indicators, including improved management information systems for tracking
education and health outcomes.

The Bank and other development partners have worked intensively to improve the
quality and accessibility of statistical capacity in Lao PDR. The main objective of the
2013 Strengthening the National Statistical System Project is to “improve the
capacity of the Lao PDR national statistical system to produce and disseminate
reliable and timely macroeconomic and poverty statistics in accordance with
international standards and in response to user needs.” Strong Bank and
development partner support has also played an important role in improved
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capability in at least several Bank-supported
projects and activities in Lao PDR. For example, interviews by the Independent
Evaluation Group confirmed the vital role that an AusAid trust fund plays in the
M&E system in the Poverty Reduction Fund (PRF) 2 Project. Similarly, the Policy

Malawi
CONTEXT
Malawi is a poor, landlocked, primarily agricultural, aid-dependent country of 16
million people in southern Africa. It experienced significant economic growth in
most of the past decade, averaging 7 percent over 2006–10. Most farms in Malawi
are less than 1 hectare and focus on maize for food security (given past famines).
There has been slow progress on diversification including away from burley tobacco
(which had helped move many smallholders out of poverty). The economy is highly
vulnerable to climatic, price, and political shocks, compounded by high HIV
incidence. Between 2005/06 and 2010/11, the national poverty headcount fell from
52.4 percent to 50.7 percent. It declined from 25.4 percent to 17.3 percent in urban
areas and rose from 56.2 percent to 56.7 percent in rural areas. The rural poverty
results in particular disappointed the development community, given several pro-
poor elements in the strategy. The Gini coefficient increased from 0.39 to 0.45.

The subsequent period was marked by macroeconomic imbalances, falling donor
inflows, and little growth, which are likely to have worsened poverty. Progress on
the other MDGs during the assessment period was mixed. Between 2000 and 2012,
the primary completion rate rose from 65 percent to 74 percent, the ratio of girls to
boys in primary and secondary schools rose from about 96.6 percent to 103.7
percent, and the under-five mortality rate declined from 174 to 71 per (per 1000 of
live births). Child mortality, malnutrition, and HIV/malaria targets are likely to be
met by 2015. In contrast, maternal mortality and primary enrollment progress has
been slow, and their targets will be missed.

POVERTY DATA
The data effort in Malawi is well above average for Sub-Saharan Africa, especially
for small poor countries. Household survey data is solid, collected roughly every
five/six years by National Statistical Office (NSO). Results between 2005/06 and
2010/11 (the latest round) are fully comparable and representative at the national
and three sub-regional levels as well as urban/rural. Data are disaggregated,
including by the gender of the household head. The surveys are well documented,
accessible on both the Bank and NSO websites, and made available after formal
release roughly within two years of data collection. Access has steadily improved. A

panel survey is currently underway for a subsample from 2010/11 repeated for
2013.

Poverty statistics were calculated from consumption basket of food and nonfood
components to the poverty line. There is a national poverty line as well as an ultra-
poor poverty line based on the food poverty line. The national line is generally
slightly below the international extreme poverty line, although the methods are not
strictly comparable. The data include both income and non-income poverty
indicators, including nutrition, infant mortality, and access to safe water,
disaggregated by region, rural or urban area, and gender. Modules are
comprehensive. There is little divergence between income and non-income indictors,
with the possible exception of nutrition. Although there are different ethnic groups
across regions, there is not an ethnic diversity dimension to poverty.

The government has been keen to track poverty, especially rural poverty, as has its
vast development partner community. The Bank has maintained an active research
LSMS technical team throughout the period in its Development Economics (DEC).
Malawi has received substantial financing and technical support from donors—in
particular the government of Norway (lead donor), the Bank, DFID, Irish Aid, and
Millennium Challenge Corporation—for poverty data. The donors have good
mechanisms for coordination and technical discussions. On technical assistance from
the Bank, the Bank LSMS Measurement Study Team in DEC has been collaborating
with NSO on a multiyear program, with the objective of designing and
implementing the Integrated Household Survey (IHS) in 2013. NSO and the broader
stakeholder community is appreciative of the technical support, which is steady and
collegial. However, capacity remains thin, as the capacity-building effort has not
resulted in sustained domestic capacity, with high staff turnover and limited
domestic skills. Nonetheless, Malawi is a model of how to ensure high-quality
poverty data despite capacity constraints, through a combination of coordination
within the Bank and with other donors.

Despite attention in the context of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the
PRSP, and the Common Approach to Budget Support and effective coordination by
Economic Planning and National Development, parts of the M&E system remain
weak. For example, administrative data on education inputs and outcomes remains
elusive, and agricultural production data are notoriously weak. The Bank is now
stepping up its broader support efforts, including to NSO.

DIAGNOSTICS
The poverty diagnostic work for Malawi has been of good quality, with the Bank
carrying out major exercises upon availability of the IHSs. These surveys were

available for the CAS FY07–10 (extended to FY12). A programmatic poverty work
program was initiated in 2014, drawing on IHS3 2010/11. For the CPS FY13–16, a
poverty update was carried out using preliminary results of IHD3. These poverty
analytics link data and diagnostics, noting the high quality of the data, including
poverty profiles and maps. The diagnostics made use of available data and
supported enhanced data collection efforts in order to be able to not only to monitor
poverty trends and guide development programs but also to evaluate at a more
granular level.

The Bank diagnostic reports discuss the key drivers of income and non-income
poverty at the national level and for different segments of the population. They
draw on sources such as a five-year rural panel data set from the International Food
Policy Research Institute and the Center for Social Research. They discuss poverty
trends over time and provide explanations of changes in the incidence and
characteristics of the poor at the individual and regional levels. The Bank diagnostics
are particularly strong on issues of poverty mobility and vulnerability.

The diagnostics discuss interlinkages such as the growth-inequality-poverty nexus,
especially in rural areas. Analysis of the incidence of growth shows that real
incomes of the rural poor are falling and only better-off households are experiencing
some growth in real expenditures. This result raises concerns about the impact on
poor rural households of the Farm Input Subsidy Program, introduced in 2005/06,
on poor rural households and specifically the beneficiary targeting methodology.
The diagnostics are rich in gender-specific content.

The Bank’s diagnostic work provides concrete recommendations to address
obstacles to reducing poverty, organized by themes, taking into consideration the
Malawian context and drawing on a broader body of analysis conducted outside the
Bank. The diagnostics reveal breadth of coverage, with a strong team leader
facilitating collaboration among a cross-sectoral team, although inevitably some
parts of the country team engaged more than others. Poverty diagnostics have
generally flagged important gaps in the understanding of poverty reduction,
guiding the AAA program. The 2006 poverty assessment also flagged the
institutional developments needed to improve M&E. Additional notes continued to
update the Bank’s understanding of what works and what doesn’t in selected areas.
Close collaboration with DEC helped ensure that some of its research was policy
and program relevant. Other integrative pieces touched on poverty. From example,
the 2010 Growth CEM included in-depth work on smallholder agriculture, and the
2007 and 2013 PERs included benefit incidence analysis in their treatment of the
health, education, social protection, roads, and agriculture sectors.

SUMMARIES OF 10 COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
STRATEGY FORMULATION, IMPLEMENTATION, AND FEEDBACK LOOPS
The Bank’s strategy as laid out in the FY07–10 CAS and FY13–16 CPS reflected the
poverty diagnostics and made good use of the recommendations of the poverty
diagnostics, which were timely and perceived to be of good quality. The strategies
were consistent with the direction and recommendations, of the poverty diagnostic
work. The CASs and CPSs clearly lay out components that directly and explicitly
address poverty, namely, nutrition; agriculture, including smallholder support,
land, irrigation; and education quality and access. A specific example of the
influence of the diagnostics was the inclusion of nutrition in the FY07–10 CAS. The
2006 poverty assessment sharply highlighted the extent of stunting in Malawi and
its links to achieving progress on a broad range of fronts. Other components had
been the staple of the Bank’s program over a longer period of time.

For a small poor country such as Malawi, poverty considerations are inevitably
central for the Bank. With two-thirds of the population below the international
extreme poverty line and roughly half the population below the country’s own
definition of poverty line, the broad based issues of growth and governance have a
huge indirect poverty dimension. Another reason for the consistency of the poverty
strategy with the diagnostics is that the government’s explicit strategy has tended to
focus on its rural and poor population. Although actual practice may deviate and
have different consequences, at least on paper, it is more straightforward to align
than in a country that is heavily urban or in which explicit poverty reduction is
absent in the country’s stated objectives.

The road map for poverty reduction laid out in the country strategy had to be in the
context of a large presence of donors, relief agencies, and humanitarian NGOs and
strong commitment by the Bank to working within a broader development partner
framework. Hence, at the same time as the Bank was linking its strategy to the
diagnostics, it had to be increasingly selective and partial in the scope of its
programs and nonlending activities. These choices were informed by poverty
diagnostics but made largely based on evaluation of comparative advantage and
gaps and encouragement by the broader community (government, other donors,
civil society) for the Bank to focus on specific areas, including several with a more
indirect impact on poverty.

The CAS had an integral and consistent vision of the interventions needed within
this broader partnership framework. The Bank’s strategies are explicit in explaining
why other issues important for poverty reduction are excluded in the Bank program.
The FY07–10 CAS reduced the Bank’s role in health to a junior one, concentrating on
fiduciary capacity for the SWAp and malaria booster program. The Bank’s financial

support to the sector was not renewed once the two health projects expired (at the
end of FY08).

For intergovernmental fiscal finance and strengthening of local governments, at the
coal face of service delivery to the poor, the Bank ceded leadership to the German
Agency for Technical Cooperation, later replaced by the German Agency for
International Cooperation. It kept the links to the broader budgetary and
expenditure management intervention as well as design dialogue for the Malawi
Social Action Fund (MASAF, later the Local Development Fund). These strategic
selectivity choices have not been amiss, as progress in health MDGs is more or less
on track and decentralization seems to be proceeding better in Malawi than
elsewhere. The Bank remains heavily engaged in nutrition, where there are few
partners and successful models need support in scaling up. However, the Bank
continues to be spread too thinly; more tough choices will need to be made if the
Bank is to ensure effective support in key areas. The results chain laid out in the CAS
and CPS was convincing in relation to the projected activities and the supported
outcomes based on the best knowledge at the time of formulation. In both the FY07–
10 CAS and the FY13–16 CPS, the critical areas and drivers of poverty, as developed
in the rich diagnostic program, are identified and explored at length.

There was a good balance between lending (both budget support and investment
lending) and AAA. For vulnerability, for example, a block of policy dialogue under
the development policy operations (DPO) series was devoted to effective targeting
issues. The investment lending vehicle MASAF3–4, HIV/AIDS MAP (to which the
Bank contributed), and the Irrigation and Rural Livelihoods Project (IRLDP)
supported programs of public works and social cash transfers. The AAA program
included work on specific thorny issues, such as effectiveness and allocation across
programs (including relief), the targeting of Farm Input Subsidy Program, and
options for exploiting data for a more accurate common targeting system. Bank
support blended policy dialogue under DPOs (such as land tax) with specific
poverty-targeted investments (such as Lilongwe Rural Development Project) with
technical assistance and other convening functions (such as the Land Governance
Assessment Framework).

In many indirect areas, the CASs and CPSs identify the links to poverty reduction.
For example, macroeconomic stability is explicitly linked to budget allocations and
expenditure execution critical to primary service delivery.

There have been some synergies across programs. The Bank has tended to
concentrate its policy dialogue underpinning DPOs, including PRSCs, in areas
where sectoral teams also are active in lending and nonlending services, as


                                                                                    133

suggested above for social protection and agriculture. SWAps have been effective in
coordinating implementation of interventions but less so in integrating policy
dialogue. Nonetheless, cross-sectoral interactions within the Bank team have been
more episodic than systematic.

The CASs and CPSs made explicit provisions for scaling up by maintaining presence
in a subsector over an extended period. (Examples within the Bank’s portfolio, such
as small-scale irrigation IRLDP, public works MASAF, and nutrition, are described
below under feedback loops.) The Bank’s strategy was well aligned with the
Malawi’s own strategy. The government’s priorities for poverty reduction are
officially and technically stated in the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy for
2006/07–2010/11, which underpins the FY07–10 CAS, and the Malawi Poverty
Reduction Strategy II, which underpins the FY13–16 CPS; the congruence and
alignment of the Bank’s strategy with the government’s stated priorities are
complete. However, there are important deviations, especially with what might be
deemed to be actual government priorities. The 2010 CASPR determined that
despite the changes in the external environment resulting from the global downturn,
the strategy remained appropriate.

Results have been achieved in several areas, leading to scaling up. One example is
IRLDP. Intermediate outcome indicators pointed to likely positive results, which led
to additional financing in both FY12 and FY13, including a scaled-up input-for-
assets program to cushion the effect of the global and Malawi macroeconomic crisis
on the rural poor and enhance the developmental impact of small-scale irrigation.
Another example is the MASAF public works program. On the capacity-building
side, the Bank has been involved in strengthening the broader M&E system of the
government, of which poverty dimensions are one part. This complex undertaking
links poverty outcomes with program inputs and outputs and further scales it up to
cross-sectoral and cross-cutting decision making.

During the assessment period, CASPRs needed to reflect both external shocks (the
2008 global food and fuel price shocks and the 2009 global economic crisis) and
changes in internal circumstances during the assessment period (inappropriate
responses to external shocks under the 2005–11 government and a new government
in 2012 upon the president’s death). In particular, the Bank’s strategy had to be
modified in a significant way in 2010–12. Although there was not a perceived need
to change the strategic focus on poverty, there were adjustments in DPOs and Bank-
financed programs targeting poor households. On the AAA side, the Malawi
program intensified dialogue on the poverty impacts of macroeconomic
developments and alternative response measures, drawing on both recent Malawi

household-level data and other country experience, which were well communicated
at senior levels.

Feedback loops in the Malawi country strategy from poverty data to poverty
diagnostics to strategy formulation and implementation have been strong. It is not
clear what the answers are, however, in a country with such severe challenges.
There has been progress in certain areas: maternal and child health and nutrition
indicators have improved; moderately poor households have moved out of poverty
through farm and nonfarm diversification and improved access to irrigation and
other agricultural services; and there has been no repeat of famine in the country.
Yet the poverty challenges have only been exacerbated over time: population
growth is putting further pressure on limited land resources in a situation of land
threshold effects; the mix of competitive politics and continuing patrimonial
attitudes of the elite is not having the hoped for impact on government institutions
and accountability; and a crowded aid support network has its own unintended
adverse consequences on institutional development and norms. The increase in rural
inequality and the large share of ultra-poor is disappointing but perhaps not
surprising.

Larger country programs and the evolution of global practices can learn from the
connectedness of the program and attention to learning that has been taking place in
Malawi. One example is the usefulness of the DPO instrument, including PRSCs in a
poverty reduction context to round out sectoral programs on the policy and
budgetary resources front. In addition to cross-cutting public expenditure and
financial management issues, the Bank has concentrated its policy dialogue
underpinning DPOs in areas where sectoral teams are active in lending and
nonlending services—namely, agriculture and vulnerability. SWAps have helped on
the coordination front for implementation of interventions; they have been less
successful in integrating a policy dialogue. The PRSC series has been assessed as
satisfactory in its development effectiveness. Another example of good practice is
the sharing of successful delivery mechanisms for targeted programs across the
various sectoral teams working on Malawi. Being a smaller program may have
facilitated this knowledge exchange.

Nigeria
CONTEXT
Nigerian statistics reveal a puzzling contrast between rapid economic growth and
minimal welfare improvements for much of the population. Annual GDP growth
rates that average more than 7 percent in official data during the last decade place
Nigeria among the fastest-growing economies in the world. GNI per capita reached
$2,580 in 2011. This rapid growth has been concentrated particularly in trade and
agriculture, which would suggest substantial welfare benefits for many Nigerians.
Nevertheless, improvements in social welfare indicators have been much slower
than would be expected in the context of this growth. Poverty reduction and job
creation have not kept pace with population growth, implying social distress for an
increasing number of Nigerians. Progress toward many of the MDGs been slow, and
the country ranked 153 out of 186 countries in the 2013 United Nations Human
Development Index. Nigeria weathered the 2008–09 crisis, the sharp fall in
petroleum prices, and the virtual collapse of parts of the banking sector well. The
government drew on the special stabilization account established in 2004 from oil
revenues to maintain public expenditures and finance a stimulus package. Although
nonoil growth continued at a robust pace and real GDP grew at 7 percent between
2009 and 2012, with average per capita income growth reaching 4.3 percent, well
above the average of about 2.2 percent per year in 2003–13, it had a limited impact
on poverty, which remained very high (54 percent of the population at a poverty
line of $1.25 a day in 2011).

Nigeria is unlikely to meet most of the MDGs, with the primary school enrollment
rate stuck below 65 percent, an under-five mortality rate of about 124 per 1,000 live
births, and a maternal mortality ratio of 610 per 100,000 live births, one of the
highest ratios in the world. Access to improved sanitation and safe water remain
appallingly low at 28 percent and 64 percent, respectively.

Comparison of poverty estimates using adult-equivalent welfare measures and
absolute poverty lines for 2004 and 2010, with only a modest decline in national
poverty headcount from 48 to 46 percent, along with modest declines in the poverty
gap and severity of poverty, raises questions about the quality of the consumption
data. Both biases in the surveys themselves and changes that introduced
comparability issues have undermined the quality and reliability of poverty data.
Poverty may have been slightly overestimated in 2010 compared with 2004. Even if
the figures are overestimated, however, poverty is still high. Poverty is much higher
in rural areas and in northern states, and inequality has been rising. There is also a
large North–South divide in terms of education, health care, and the condition of
women.

POVERTY DATA
During the period of this review, the Bank began to obtain survey data in Nigeria to
carry out poverty diagnostics and guide development programs on poverty
reduction. The comprehensive living standard survey (Harmonized Nigeria Living
Standard Survey, HNLSS) is well designed being representative, timely, and
distinguishing different degrees or levels of poverty, including extreme (food)
poverty. Nonetheless, official statistics in general and the results of the large 2009/10
HNLSS survey in particular lack credibility. Data are considered insufficient for
strategic purposes. It appears increasingly likely that the 2009/10 survey
underestimated consumption and hence overestimated poverty rates in Nigeria.
Inadequate data reflect a combination of the change in the consumption estimation
method and the way in which the survey was carried out (including nonpayment of
enumerators in the later phase of the survey, given the shortfall in the government’s
budgetary contribution), as acknowledged by both the National Bureau of Statistics
and the Bank. Technical problems with the first 2003/04 survey were discovered
only recently. To reinforce the principle of cost sharing, as agreed to before the
survey, the DFID, which financed the survey, chose not to fill the financing gap.

Data concerns extend to other components relevant for understanding the drivers of
poverty. At least for the HNLSS, the Bank teams have access to the raw data,
something they lack for other critical core statistics (including the recent GDP
rebasing exercise). Population numbers are very outdated. For non-income poverty
indicators, there are multiple sources and conflicting trends. Agricultural data are
weak, with the recent GDP rebasing exercise resulting in much lower agricultural
growth rates. The Bank is working with multiple partners to provide technical
assistance on several aspects of these data series.

DIAGNOSTICS
The poverty assessment and other ESW made good use of available data, which
expanded over time and include disaggregated poverty profiles. The availability of
comprehensive household survey data was a major contributing factor. Notes and
assessments were completed two to three years after the surveys, about a year after
the release of major poverty data sets, which were available at the time of strategy
formulation. The 2004 poverty assessment, conducted in the context of country
reengagement, drew on limited qualitative and quantitative surveys. A relatively
comprehensive poverty assessment was carried out in 2006/07, taking advantage of
the 2004 household survey. It was a more traditional and comprehensive, including
on policy recommendations, drawing on sectoral reports produced jointly with
development partners. The 2013 Poverty Note used analysis of the comprehensive
household survey of 2009/10. The chapter on poverty in the 2014 Nigeria Economic
Report draws on the panel surveys of 2010/11 and 2012/13. Partners look to the
Bank’s diagnostics for guidance and leadership on the poverty agenda.

The poverty diagnostics’ assessment of the adequacy of the Nigeria’s institutions,
programs, funding, and M&E arrangements was partial and stronger in some areas
than in others. A major contributing factor was the fact that the Bank’s diagnostics
have generally narrowed explicit poverty considerations to the human development
sector and to a lesser extent agriculture, as in the major 2007 poverty assessment.
This poverty assessment was of high quality in its analysis and actionable
recommendations. The 2004 and 2013 poverty assessments made broader links
(namely, macroeconomic stability as well as growth and employment, respectively)
but at a high level of generality. The 2013 poverty assessment also used the data to
confirm that poverty correlates by and large had not changed.

In a country as large and complex as Nigeria, other diagnostic work would have
been expected to drill down on key poverty reduction issues and inform both the
client and the Bank on how to operationalize their strategies. Notable in this regard
was the public expenditure and monitoring work on basic health (for example, the
2005 Health Status Report) and education services (for example, the 2008 Review of
Costs and Financing of Public Education). Other reports included the 2006 Getting
Agriculture Going report, the 2009 Employment and Growth study, and the 2013
Social Safety Net Stocktaking. Although not explicitly included in the poverty
assessment narratives, the Bank continued to work on fiscal management of oil
wealth at both the federal and state level, with a focus on macroeconomic stability
and sustainability for indirect poverty impact. Overall, the Bank’s analytics are held
in high regard.

Even if the totality of the poverty diagnostics had represented a more integrated
package, the major weakness of the Bank’s poverty diagnostics would still have
been the effectiveness of those diagnostics. The Bank focused more heavily on the
technical quality of the work than on following up and communicating with
stakeholders, resulting in much more limited awareness of the Bank’s work than
necessary to have impact in a large and complex country like Nigeria. There is a
relatively low level of understanding of poverty analysis and only limited Bank
efforts at outreach. No interviewee outside the Bank referenced the Bank’s 2004,
2007, or 2013 poverty assessments. Weaknesses in the data (i.e., no comprehensive
survey available in 2004, the absence of multiple surveys in 2007 to analyze drivers
of poverty, and the underestimation of consumption in 2013) limited the ability to
draw strong conclusions or make credible recommendations on several issues. The
poverty diagnostic work has not been used to derive action plans for future poverty
reduction work and the country’s poverty strategy, although elements are contained
in select sectoral components. The diagnostics did not explain how and when such
an action plan or updated strategy will be developed.

The character and extent of poverty in Nigeria did not change much during the
decade. The Bank’s strategy partly reflected the poverty diagnostics. Each of the
strategies focused on similar issues, including areas highlighted by the poverty
evidence and diagnostics as key to poverty reduction. The country strategy tended
especially to emphasize the human development component of the poverty agenda,
in particular expanding social service delivery in health and education, with a focus
on states but spanning federal, state, local and community levels. Another issue with
significant poverty focus was agriculture productivity, as a subset of the nonoil
growth agenda. The regional differentiation issue, also underpinned by the poverty
diagnostics, was flagged in the strategies, usually as part of the governance agenda.

STRATEGY FORMULATION, IMPLEMENTATION, AND FEEDBACK LOOPS
The FY05–09 CAS put poverty front and center in its motivation and context setting.
It noted that Nigeria had 70 million people in poverty, the third largest number in
the world after China and India, and drew on the 2004 poverty assessment and other
findings for details. Given these levels of poverty, the poverty assessment was an
advocacy document for more international support, noting that official development
assistance was only $2 per person in Nigeria versus $28 for Africa. It made the case
for consideration of debt relief, noting the government’s commitment to use the
proceeds for MDG-related efforts, even if funding is fungible. The strategy
articulated poverty links to individual components of the strategy, but a results
chain was not explicitly developed. It identified gaps in knowledge and proposed to
fill them through poverty assessment and statistical capacity building.

SUMMARIES OF 10 COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
The FY10–13 CPS provided an update on the poverty context in Nigeria and made
general observations about the importance of nonoil growth to poverty reduction. It
was less explicit about how the individual strategic components related to the
poverty challenges (something that was never asked for in the corporate context of
that time), so there was no explicit results chain relating projected activities to
poverty reduction at the national or sector levels. These, however, can be inferred.
Midway through this period, the CPS shifted slightly to support priorities of the
new government, including the agriculture transformation agenda, which had some
pro-poor focus.

The poverty diagnostics did not drive the strategies. Several other considerations
drove the strategies, particularly the centrality of governance, which was a Bank
institutional priority, and the political economy context, which constricted the
strategy space in which the Bank operated. Because of the nature of the client, the
Bank’s country strategies did not have had an effective road map or integral and
consistent vision of the interventions needed to reduce poverty. Notably,
governance and corruption issues associated with a resource-rich state and the
complexities of federalism and regional differentiation, as well as the potential for
conflict along ethnic, religious, and regional lines, in Africa’s largest country meant
significant divergence between the country’s stated objectives and actual Nigerian
policy and program implementation.

Although the country strategies made explicit provision for scaling up, the Bank
struggled to find financing modalities that actually worked to produce basic service
delivery results in the Nigerian government structure. The social community-driven
development (CDD) programs are not having the hoped for scaling up through
effective local government linkages, despite project components aimed at doing so.
Building on a decade of Bank knowledge- sharing on social protection, CDD safety
net components are being supported in states with demonstrated ownership of
reforms. This approach builds on existing modalities, including the government’s
conditional grant scheme, including those with a focus on youth employment.
Support to nonoil growth has been a second component of the Nigeria country
strategies.

In both diagnostics and strategy formulation, nonoil growth was deemed as having
strong synergies and complementarities with the social service delivery agenda: the
poor can realize benefits of services only in the face of economic growth. The
poverty reduction case for support to agricultural productivity was more central,
given the larger rural nature of poverty in Nigeria. This is home to the productive
CDD Fadama projects, which have explicit poverty focus. They have been successful
in raising incomes in supported communities and been scaled up across Nigeria.

The case for addressing the huge infrastructure deficit for growth was compelling,
for example, power sector reforms where the Bank has played a transformational
role, although the poverty-focused elements were more limited in projects such as
rural roads and Lagos urban transport (e.g., lowering bus costs for poor). The focus
on geographic growth poles made sense from an aggregate growth perspective, but
with the caveat that these growth poles were not primarily in those parts of the
country with the greatest poverty headcount percentages, although some were in
largely populated areas with large numbers of poor.

The Bank CPS adjustment in the face of the global economic crisis included a DPO
supporting financial and PFM reforms without poverty linkages. The adjustment of
the CPS midway, as reflected in the CPSPR, including the agricultural DPO series,
was aimed at getting behind the Johnson government’s reforming Agriculture
Transformation Agenda (ATA), which included at least some pro-poor elements.
However, Fadama is not yet supported with the government’s own sizable
resources. In addition, the trade-offs, if any, between a focus on growth (agricultural
commercialization and growth poles) and poverty reduction, let alone the
distinction between moderately and core poor, were less explicit in the strategy. One
component of the DPO that is explicitly pro-poor is the elimination of the
government’s direct fertilizer procurement and distribution system.

Another potential synergy in the strategies that has not been realized is geographic.
The Bank has only recently made an effort to systematically link its rural
interventions, including the agricultural market–focused Rural Access and Mobility
Project, with the successful scaling up of a pilot to other states. Notable from the
poverty perspective is that the additional financing for Fadama 3 focuses on linking
Fadama groups to the ATA commercialization agenda and coordination.

The apparent increase in income equality suggests the centrality of a focus on
broader based nonoil growth. The nonoil growth story also needs to be nuanced
from the geographic perspective: the national average hides large differences across
regions. Preliminary evidence from the (more reliable) panel survey suggests that
parts of the country, such as the Southwest, have also experienced rapid declines in
poverty. In parts of the North, growth has been more modest and accompanied by
worsening inequality—notably in the Northeast—and hence worsening poverty.

Feedback loops on poverty reduction from data to diagnostics to strategy
formulation and implementation have been incomplete in Nigeria. There were no
Nigerian champions demanding data and diagnostics. The Bank-financed explicit
poverty-focused interventions were of small scale relative to the problems and the
government’s own resources, even though several demonstrated strong technical

and interpersonal approaches to evaluation. Lending programs for Nigeria required
attention, as the largest IDA program for the Africa Region, but “projectizing”
drained energy and incentives away from a more concerted effort to help build a
constituency for poverty reduction. It may be too much to expect that the Bank
could ever have the instruments and leverage to be transformational in this country,
so expectations need to be tempered. However, not all options have yet to be
explored.

There appear to have been few champions or strategists in Nigeria who were linking
their growth-oriented agenda more strategically to poverty consideration including
jobs, urbanization and agricultural commercialization agendas, compounded by the
competitiveness difficulties facing any resource-rich economy. The lack of clear
evidence of poverty reduction in official numbers after strong nonoil growth—
combined with concern with Nigeria’s image from unrest in poorer parts of the
country—might represent a window of opportunity for a more transformational
approach to poverty reduction in Nigeria than has been possible in the past. The
Bank’s articulation of such growth-poverty links could help move forward this
bigger picture and get more traction with leadership, going beyond targeted focus
on safety nets and social service access. This goes well beyond technical foundations
usually covered by poverty assessments and calls for blending political economy
analysis, microeconomic poverty analysis, pragmatic knowledge sharing and
effective communication within the Bank’s wider program.

Evidence on poverty reduction in the Nigeria program was modest. Explicit
attention to poverty reduction objectives was either at a high level of generality (as
in debt relief or nonoil sector growth) or detailed in only a subset of the program (as
in CDD programs). The Bank program for Nigeria did monitor the MDGs, which
include an indicator on income poverty. However, in general, the Bank did not
produce substantial information on poverty reduction that would lead to M&E. In
neither of the CASs under review was poverty included in the proposed outcomes
and results to be monitored as part of assessment of the Bank’s program, including
within a sectoral context.

The Bank’s country programs evolved, although there were no major deviations of
the implemented operations addressing poverty from the original CAS and CPS.
Given the governance challenges and need to focus on champions of reform, the
Bank shifted its programs accordingly. For example, it continued to stay engaged in
health, enabled by pockets of reform champions at both the federal and state level,
notably for maternal, child, and other basic health services that are pro-poor. The
Bank responded to the global crisis with a (financial-sector/PFM) DPO combined
with ramping up of social safety net dialogue to increase the visibility of the

weaknesses in Nigeria. The slight pro-poor shift was enabled by a strong Bank team,
which once again is receiving a little more attention in light of unrest in the
Northeast. Other obstacles in implementing the Bank’s strategy (for example,
lending delays because of disagreements between the executive and legislative
branches) were unrelated to the poverty focus.

SUMMARY ASSESSMENT
The Bank is a small player in financial terms in resource-rich Nigeria, with annual
lending level representing roughly 2 percent of federal revenues. This has seriously
constrained the ability of the Bank to build effective poverty reduction into its
strategy. The Bank has likely had a greater impact on poverty reduction through
reliance on champions—and there are committed counterparts, despite the
aggregate picture. Support to champions went beyond financial resources. Some of
the highest-impact interventions provided knowledge and technical support to
motivated Nigerian teams within sectors and states, getting behind reform teams
with solid analytics and practical support (on issues ranging from debt relief, fiscal
reform, and a virtual poverty fund to impact evaluation of primary health care
services at the federal level and from procurement to education learning outcomes
in states). The Bank appears to have become less risk averse over time, engaging
more actively on the petroleum subsidy and publicly flagging the extent of poverty
in Nigeria, but its efforts have probably been excessively balanced in favor of
lending over AAA. The Bank will need to play an even more prominent advocacy
role, putting the poverty issue in a context that promotes domestic dialogue and
debate; for example, couching it in terms of inequality or jobs or peace and security.
A possible lesson is that AAA and advocacy may be even more important in a
resource-rich country, especially if the timing and approach are well informed. The
importance to the overall lending program of a large country such as Nigeria cannot
be allowed to overshadow this imperative.

Feedback loops on poverty reduction from data to diagnostics to strategy
formulation and implementation have been incomplete in Nigeria. There were no
Nigerian champions demanding data or diagnostics. The Bank-financed poverty-
focused interventions were of small scale relative to the scale of the problems and

Peru
CONTEXT
Peru grew steadily at about 6 percent a year during the last decade, and GDP per
capita grew at an annual rate of about 5 percent. GNI per capita reached $9,440 in
2011. The poverty incidence fell from about 58 percent to 31 percent during 2004–
2012, with the incidence of extreme poverty falling from 17 percent to 10 percent.
The stability of economic policies at the macro and regulatory level has created good
incentives for domestic and foreign direct investment, which a benign external
scenario has also helped. According to the latest IMF Article IV report, Peru has
been one of the best macroeconomic performers in Latin America over the past
decade. It continued to be a leader in high growth and low inflation in the region,
thanks to prudent macroeconomic policy implementation, a far-reaching structural
reform agenda, and a benign external environment. Not least because of these
factors, the economy came out virtually unscathed from the 2008‒09 global financial
crisis, with growth rebounding to nearly 9 percent growth in 2010 and being
sustained at high levels in 2011–12.

There is a strong consensus among Peruvian experts that growth has been a key
driver of poverty reduction across income groups and regions. However, large
regional differences remain, in both poverty rates and non-income indicators. The
incidence of extreme poverty is three times the national average in the rural sierra
and twice the national average in the jungle. The incidence of malnutrition in
children under the age of five is 38 percent in the lowest income quintile and 2
percent in the highest quintile (the average for the entire population is 17.5 percent).

POVERTY DATA
Between 2000 and 2012, Peru carried out 12 National Household Surveys and seven
nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys to assess the health and
nutritional status of the population. The evolution of the national statistical system
faced some significant challenges; the Bank played a critical role in reforming the
system. In 2004 several changes in the methodologies for the National Household
Surveys took place, resulting in changes in poverty estimates. As a consequence, no
official poverty estimates were made publicly available between 2004 and 2007,
which added to the loss of credibility of the poverty data and of the National
Institute of Statistics. The authorities requested technical assistance from the Bank to
address the methodological problems and to help restore public trust. Rather than
providing solely traditional technical assistance, in 2007 the Bank set up an external
expert advisory committee to help reach consensus on best methodological practices
to produce comparable poverty estimates. Under this new initiative, the Instituto

Nacional de Estadística e Informática (INEI) was able to issue comparable poverty
figures for all years between 2001 and 2010. The communication of the results was
transparent, the figures were not contested, and public trust was restored. In 2011
new methodological changes were adopted to better reflect the profound
socioeconomic changes experienced by Peru during the past 15 years. As a result of
the Bank’s technical assistance, INEI has become institutionally stronger, and
transparency has increased substantively.

DIAGNOSTICS
Three sets of diagnostic work were available before the two CPSs during the period
of this evaluation: the 2005 poverty assessment, the 2006 New Social Contract for
Peru, and public finance studies, such as the Decentralization Process and the Public
Expenditure Process and the PER of 2012. In general, these studies were of high
quality in terms of the meaningful use of empirical evidence (including good-quality
statistics), relevance, timeliness, depth of analysis, and identification of policy
directions.

A major contribution of the poverty assessment is the integrated (general
equilibrium) nature of the analysis. The assessment recognizes the role of growth
and sustainability issues and provides a taxonomy of the most binding constrains on
urban employment expansion and the productivity growth of poor farmers. It then
turns to the provision of social services to the poor and the role played by low-
income households’ demand for those services. The emphasis on non-income
aspects of poverty is critical in Peru, because some of these indicators are lagging
with respect to improvements in incomes. For example, although children
malnutrition has been reduced, it remains high, despite income growth of the poorer
segments of the population, particularly in isolated rural areas.

The discussion of the demand side is important and innovative. A large proportion
of the poor is concentrated in indigenous groups, whose demand and use of social
services depends highly on the degree to which these services are aligned with their
cultural practices. There is consensus in Peru that a key issue is the fact that the
remaining pockets of extremely poor are increasingly concentrated among rural
indigenous groups.

The New Social Contract is a good-quality diagnostic report relevant to the delivery
of social services to poor families. The five-year Accountability for Social
Responsibility (RECURSO) programmatic AAA program played a critical role in the
diagnosis and what is needed to move the delivery system out of a low-equilibrium
trap. It calls for action across a wide front, ranging from the need for standards,
transparent information, and better ways to monitor quality to a new a system of

incentives and accountabilities to improve incentives on the supply side. This work
supported the dialogue with the incoming authorities at the time and was
disseminated widely in Peru, helping create consensus on the major areas of reform
in the social sectors. This strong effort at dissemination is an especially positive
aspect of the Bank’s diagnostic work in Peru.

The work on public finances undertaken in 2010 and 2012 focus on the regional
dimensions of poverty. It also updates the expenditure incidence analysis, calling
attention to the relatively small size of the more poverty-targeted programs
compared with other social transfers. The study is candid about the fact that the
fiscal rules guiding the allocation of mineral revenues may not be reducing regional
inequalities. The Bank’s diagnostic reports for Peru were innovative and candid, and
they were disseminated widely in the country.

STRATEGY FORMULATION, IMPLEMENTATION, AND FEEDBACK LOOPS
The FY07–11 CPS followed the key areas identified in the diagnostic work: widening
the base of growth (in particular rural infrastructure in poor areas), promoting a
new social contract in the delivery of social services, and addressing the challenges
of decentralization and the new responsibilities of local governments. However, the
CPS had a cryptic discussion of social assistance in Peru, and the targeted programs
represented only a small share of GDP compared with the rest of the Latin American
and Caribbean Region. The CPS did stress some specific areas of urgency raised in
the diagnostic work, such as infant malnutrition; educational quality, which has
become a major priority; and the system of fiscal transfers, which may have
accentuated regional inequalities.

The FY12–16 CPS has a significant degree of continuity with the previous strategy,
but it has a sharper focus on extreme poverty, with an emphasis on reaching the
rural poor. It explicitly acknowledges the significantly higher level of poverty and
child malnutrition in rural selva (jungle) areas than in the rest of the country, and it
identifies a set of priorities targeted to these groups. The CPS also identifies more
specific areas of targeted interventions than the earlier CPS. These targeted
interventions reflect the priorities of the new administration.

Overall, the proposed portfolio of lending and nonlending activities in the two CPSs
is consistent with the diagnostic work and the formulated strategies. The FY07–11
CPS envisaged a series of three social sector DPLs to support key policy steps in the
social sector delivery in the context of the announced decentralization of services. In
spite of their potential systemic importance, there are no details on the specific
policy steps to be supported by these DPLs. This area remains vague, an important
shortcoming of the FY07–11CPS. There are no efforts to develop a results chain

linking these operations to objectives in this area. The strategy also contains a follow
up of the RECURSO AAA program, which seems highly relevant to poverty and
potentially to the design of the social DPLs. However the CPS missed an
opportunity by not integrating well the discussion of the diagnostic work with the
lending operations. Similarly, the program envisages five DPLs in the area of fiscal
management and competitiveness, with an emphasis on examining public
expenditures and result-based systems. These operations could potentially be good
vehicles to address the inequalities created by fiscal transfers and to reallocate
resources to the most targeted social transfer programs. Another major shortcoming
of the FY07–11CPS was the lack of reference to the special situation of the
indigenous populations and ways to adapt basic education and health interventions
to meet the need of these groups.

In contrast, the FY12–16 CPS envisages new initiatives to help consolidate the
dispersed programs targeted to the poor and make Juntos, the main CCT program,
the centerpiece of such assistance. The initiative is to be implemented with a tight
timetable, and the CPS envisages a possible DPL or SWAp, accompanied by strong
technical assistance. A SWAp in the area of nutrition (not originally planned in the
first CPS) is to support expansion of Juntos in this area. An important piece of AAA,
RECURSO V, is to study (through a survey) the extent to which better parental
knowledge on the effect of nutrition could enhance the impact of Juntos. The
envisaged activities in this area thus incorporate important complementarities
between lending, technical assistance, and AAA, with a clear result chain of
outcomes and milestones of progress.

At the sectoral level, the FY12–16 CPS also included a new Health Reform III project
to reach poor rural mothers and children, making health facilities culturally
appropriate for potential beneficiaries. The explicit objective is to increase the
number of institutional rural births in the nine poorest regions of the country. An
education SWAp envisions introducing a result-based system involving the
participation of families and communities, with the objective of improving learning
outcomes of children from rural and indigenous communities. Thus in both health
and education, the interventions proposed were highly targeted to the poorest
families.

Both CPSs also included activities to provide better infrastructure to the rural poor
and help them get better connected to markets and services. The FY07–11 CPS
envisaged operations to reach the rural poor in the Sierra and assist the rural
transport decentralization process. The Sierra projects aimed at enhancing the
connectivity of farmers to markets, which seemed to be relevant interventions.
However, there is no discussion of how these isolated or pilot type interventions

would be replicated or scaled up when Bank funding ceases; a result chain in
addressing this issue was missing in the CPS.

The FY12–16 CPS has a richer set of proposed interventions in rural infrastructure.
Projects on decentralized rural transport seek to strengthen the role of the Provincial
Road Institutes and promote microenterprises in the routine maintenance of rural
and provincial roads. However, the discussion does not provide information on the
extent to which these interventions will focus on poorer rural areas or how the
project will mobilize resources through microenterprises beyond the project period.
A similar problem emerges in the discussion of projects in electricity and
communications. The CPS, however, does include a targeted initiative in water and
sanitation aimed at poor populations in peri-urban and rural areas, including the
efficiency of small and medium-size water utilities. The results chain incorporates
outcomes and milestones, as well as possible scaling up by the International Finance
Corporation (IFC), providing advisory services to support public-private
partnerships at the subnational level.

Finally, the FY12–16 CPS discusses some activities to strengthen local government
and advance the decentralization agenda. The idea is to identify key bottlenecks
according to the different capacities and needs of local governments, probably
through some technical assistance activities. This activity seems to be a highly
relevant given the new responsibilities of local governments. However, the
discussion is not sufficiently specific and does not elaborate on how priorities will be
determined.

The CPS documentation suggests that the operational strategy contains a more
explicit and clearer set of interventions to reach the poor in the social sectors and
safety nets than in the physical infrastructure sector, including the issues of scaling
up and sustainability. The FY12–16 CPS also includes a richer description of
envisaged operations to reach the most vulnerable groups. The support given by the
Bank to the social sectors represents a significant share of its total support in Peru.
Social sector DPLs accounted for about 25 percent of total lending to Peru during the
review period, and the RECURSO programmatic AAA accounted for the largest
bulk of the analytical work. Based on the project documentation approved and
discussions in the field, the portfolio had significantly more coherence, clarity, and
synergisms than what was described in the CPS documents.

Several positive features characterize Bank support for the social sectors in Peru.
These features, which were acknowledged explicitly in the field by Peruvian
counterparts, include (i) strong complementarity (stronger than envisaged in the
CPS) between the DPLs, AAA, and technical assistance, with a high level of


                                                                                      149

SUMMARIES OF 10 COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
participation by Peruvian counterparts; (ii) good synergism between the steps
supported by the DPL series and the individual operations in the sectors; and (iii)
consistency between the design of projects in health, nutrition, and education and
the diagnostic work on poverty, in particular in better targeting resources to the
poorest households, particularly indigenous populations in rural areas that required
special design features. Child malnutrition, infant mortality rates, and maternal
mortality ratios were special areas of focus. The health project targeted reducing
maternal and infant mortality in the nine poorest regions in the country.

Peru seems to have valued most the convening role and know-how of the Bank—
much more than its financing contribution. The DPLs and SWAps were very small
relative to the Peruvian economy and relative to the scope of the technical assistance
operation. The Bank team working with the Peruvian authorities had a high level of
expertise and commitment to the Bank’s program of support for Peru, which was
critical given the strong and innovative nature of the analytical work, the quality of
the dialogue, and the degree of trust that was generated. Most Bank task team
leaders remained engaged with Peru for at least five years. Peruvian counterparts
unanimously acknowledged this commitment.

Efforts to better connect the poor to services and markets focused on pilot projects
that could lead to innovation, learning, and scaling up. Project documents contained
result chains identifying modalities to facilitate financial sustainability, mobilizing
the willingness to pay from rural communities together with some transparent
subsidization to allow reaching poor groups (such as localities increasingly
dispersed and far from the grid). Mobilizing private investment was important to
ensure scaling up and sustainability. Peruvian experts explicitly acknowledged
these efforts, particularly on roads. However, there are some concerns about scaling
up and sustainability, which are explicitly discussed in project documents.

Overall, the portfolio of approved operations contained a much clearer articulation
of the poverty objectives and result chains than was described in the CPS
documentation. There was also a positive change over time: the second CPS has a
clearer articulation and poverty focus than the FY07–11 CPS, and the operations in
the social services area were better aimed at reaching the poorest groups.

The Bank’s self-evaluations based on CAS and CPS Progress Reports and
Completion Reports, as well as status reports of individual projects, converge in the
three important operational messages. First, the process of regional decentralization
has made efforts to reach the poorest and more isolated rural populations more
challenging. Weak institutional capacity at the local level, particularly in the poorest
municipalities, limits the effectiveness of additional transfers to these municipalities.


150

                                                    SUMMARIES OF 10 COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
Replacing traditional investment loans by technical assistance and capacity-building
activities targeted to local governments may remedy the situation. Second, the
challenge of reaching the more isolated rural populations is manifested particularly
by the difficulties of achieving major improvements in maternal and child health.
Neonatal mortality, early malnutrition, slow improvements in breastfeeding
practices, and the slow expansion of laboratory testing for pregnant mothers are
some examples of problem areas that call for solutions that need to be fine-tuned at
the local level. Third, the challenges of reaching more dispersed rural groups are
detected in some of the rural community development projects and electrification
projects. These projects require significant coordination across levels of government,
the mobilization of local finance. Subprojects play a critical role in scaling up and
sustaining these investments.

These messages seem to suggest the importance of experimenting with local pilot
projects, complemented by technical assistance to local municipalities and incentives
to scale up pilots by mobilizing resources at the local level. A distinctive
contribution of the Bank program was to help Peruvian households monitor
progress in the social sectors themselves. Enhancing local M&E capabilities to gauge
service quality and delivery has become a major priority in Peru, with the issue
raised by many stakeholders during the field visit. Creating metrics and standards
to better inform users and local authorities is seen as critical. The Bank seems to
have played a major role in empowering poor families by producing and
disseminating information on nutrition standards and learning outcomes as a means
to evaluate outcomes and the quality of social services at the local level. For
example, the Bank team worked to develop easy-to-understand metrics for
education and health services. The My Future, My First Centimeters initiative
showed that children everywhere in the world have the same growth potential in
the first five years of life and that bad nutritional practices and lack of information
can contribute to stunting. The program led to a wider recognition and
understanding of inequality in nutritional status and educational outcomes across
localities.

Since 1985 Peru has consistently collected household survey data to assess living
standards and provide the evidence necessary to design social policy. The process
has improved over time; today the information system is continuously up to date.
The surveys include both income and non-income indicators and provide nationally
and regionally representative data on different aspects of livelihood. The diagnostic
reports prepared by the Bank covered the most relevant issues of poverty in Peru.
Overall, the studies were of a very good quality in terms of meaningful use of
empirical evidence (complemented with good-quality statistics), relevance and
timeliness, the depth of analysis, and identification of policy directions. The most

recent CPS has a stronger link to poverty issues in Peru and better reflects the
findings and recommendations of the Bank’s diagnostic work. A key issue in Peru
has been the significant divergence between the planned portfolio, as reflected in the
CPSs, and the implemented portfolios. The situation improved in more recent years,
particularly with the FY12–16 CPS, and there is now strong complementarity
between the Bank’s poverty-related lending and nonlending activities.

Key features of the Bank’s program of support have been strong complementarity
between AAA and technical assistance, with a high level of participation of Peruvian
counterparts; good synergy between the steps supported by the Results and
Accountability (REACT) DPL series, the Ministry of Development and Social
Inclusion (MIDIS) DPL, and individual operations in the sectors in which these
DPLs supported the introduction of standards and monitoring systems to start
strengthening beneficiaries’ power and hold providers more accountable; strong
complementarity between DPLs and technical assistance; and the specific design of
projects in health, nutrition, and education, which was consistent with the
diagnostics work on poverty. The Peruvian counterparts seemed to have valued the
most the convening role and the know-how of the Bank over its financing
contribution. The DPLs and SWAps were very small relative to the Peruvian
economy, except for REACT II, which was approved during the 2009 global crisis
(and consisted largely of a deferred drawdown option [DDO] with a contingent
component). The lack of interest in large loans became more apparent as growth in

between the Bank’s poverty-related lending and nonlending activities. Detailed
review of the formulated CPSs and their implementation reveals that the operational
strategy contains a more explicit and clearer set of interventions to reach the poor in
the social sectors and safety nets than in the physical infrastructure sectors. In
addition, concerns about scaling up and sustainability emerge from many of the
interventions in infrastructure—at least in the way these interventions have been
discussed in the CPS documents.

Key features of the Bank’s program of support have been the strong
complementarity between AAA, technical assistance, and lending with a high level
of participation of Peruvian counterparts. Moreover, synergies between the steps
supported by the REACT DPL series, the MIDIS DPL, and the individual operations
in the sectors where these DPLs supported the introduction of standards and
monitoring systems to start strengthening beneficiaries’ power and hold providers
more accountable.

Other important synergies included: (i)the strong complementarity between DPLs
and technical assistance; (ii) the design of projects in health, nutrition, and
education, which was consistent with the diagnostic work on poverty; and (iii) the
fact that Peruvian counterparts seem to value the technical expertise and know-how,
as well as the convening role of the Bank over its financing contribution. The DPLs
and sector-wide approaches were very small relative to the Peruvian economy,
except for REACT II, approved during the 2009 global crisis (and consisting largely
of a development policy loan with a draw down option with a contingent
component). Peru’s lack of interest in large loans grew as growth recovered and
external finances improved.

An important factor in the success of Bank support in Peru seems to have the fact
that the Bank mobilized a team with a high level of expertise and commitment. Most
of the Bank’s task team leaders remained engaged with Peru for at least five years.
Its commitment and expertise seems to have been critical for the strong and
innovative nature of the analytical work, the quality of the dialogue, and the high
degree of trust that was generated.


Philippines
CONTEXT
The Philippines experienced moderate annual growth of 4–5 percent during the
early 2000s that recently accelerated to 7–8 percent. GDP per capita grew by an
average of 3.5 percent a year during 2003–13. GNI per capita reached $4,140 by 2011.

APPENDIX A
SUMMARIES OF 10 COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
Despite this good growth performance, the poverty headcount changed very little in
the past decade, inequality has remained stubbornly high, and progress toward
achieving the MDGs has been mixed. Although the country remains on track to
achieve goals related to gender equality, infant and child mortality, and access to
safe water, it is lagging on indicators related to basic education and maternal health.
Although the under-five mortality rate declined from 40.4 per 1,000 live births in
2000 to 29.8 in 2012, the maternal mortality ratio remained stuck at 120 per 100,00
live births. Roughly one in four Filipinos (24 million people) continue to live below
the national poverty line, most of them concentrated in rural areas (working in the
agricultural sector or living in conflict-affected areas of Mindanao). In 2012 the
incidence of food poverty (or national extreme poverty) was estimated at about 10
percent of the population, meaning that roughly 10 million people did not have
sufficient income to meet their basic food requirements. About 10 percent of the
population is at risk of falling into poverty and especially vulnerable to natural
disasters or economic crises. Between 2003 and 2009, one in three of the poor was
persistently poor, and two-thirds were transient (meaning they fluctuated in and out
of poverty). As weather patterns shift the path of seasonal natural disasters, the
poorest regions of the country are faced with increased vulnerability to shocks.

In the second half of the decade, the economy was hit by multiple shocks, including
the food and fuel price shocks, the global financial crisis, the global recession, and a
series of deadly typhoons. The occurrence of the global financial crisis, the food and
fuel crisis, and several highly destructive typhoons in 2008–09 was estimated to have
increased poverty by nearly 4 percentage points, or an additional 3 million people.
The economy has been resilient, however, rapidly recovering from these crises.

The reason why growth in the Philippines has failed to translate into poverty
reduction is puzzling. One of the major contributors to this mystery is that the
stubbornly high level of income inequality in the Philippines (the Gini coefficient
hovers at about 0.45) limits the growth elasticity of poverty reduction. Another
primary constraint to translating growth into poverty reduction is the high fertility
rate (particularly among the poorer segments of the population). Frequent natural
disasters, including deadly typhoons that disproportionately hit poor regions, push
vulnerable groups into poverty and jeopardize long-term human capital
development.

POVERTY DATA
The Bank has provided considerable support to the Philippine Statistics Authority,
contributing to the improvement of poverty data collection and management as well
as the strengthening of the methodology for estimating poverty. Given the capacity
constraints of the national statistical agencies, the necessary reforms on survey

                                                                              APPENDIX A
                                                     SUMMARIES OF 10 COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
design and data management have not been pushed through. The quality and
timeliness of poverty data in the Philippines constrains the construction of poverty
estimates as well as the monitoring of progress on poverty reduction.

There are multiple sources of administrative and survey data available for
constructing poverty estimates, including the Family Income and Expenditures
Survey (FIES), the Labor Force Survey, and the Annual Poverty Indicators Survey.
The FIES, which is the basis for computing poverty estimates, is carried out every
three years. Mainly because of the limited capacity and fragmentation of the national
statistical agencies, the design of the FIES survey has contributed to delays in data
processing and release. The sharp decline in the number of staff in the national
statistical agencies has exacerbated problems of timeliness: on average, it takes
roughly two years after the completion of an FIES survey to clean the raw data,
significantly undermining the timeliness of poverty estimates. There are also
concerns about the quality and reliability of the FIES poverty data and the national
account data. There are inconsistencies between the definitions of rural and urban in
the 2003 survey round and later rounds. The lack of clarity in the methodology for
establishing poverty lines, particularly related to regional price selection, renders the
poverty trends not fully comparable over time. On the non-income poverty side,
there is also variation in the availability and quality of data. Non-income poverty
data at disaggregated levels (urban, rural, and agriculture) are particularly
inadequate.

Methodological problems with the construction of the national poverty lines have
undermined the comparability, and thus quality, of constructed poverty statistics.
Recognizing the constraints posed by quality issues, the Bank has been at the
forefront of supporting the improvement of data quality in the Philippines. The
Bank has full access to the raw survey data, albeit with large delays because of data-
processing problems. Although there is a clear indication of appreciation from the
government statistical agencies for Bank technical assistance and close collaboration
at the technical level, real improvements in the timeliness and quality of poverty
data are still lacking.

DIAGNOSTICS
Stakeholders, including representatives from the government, development
partners, academia, NGOs, and civil society organizations, consider the Bank’s
knowledge products on poverty to be of high quality. Overall, the quality of Bank
poverty diagnostic work on the Philippines has been good, given the data quality
and availability.

SUMMARIES OF 10 COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
The Bank’s poverty diagnostic work generally made good use of the data available
between 2005 and 2012, providing a reasonably complete picture of both income and
non-income poverty. However, the absence of a full poverty assessment or poverty
update during the entire period of evaluation limited the comprehensiveness and
depth of the analytical work on poverty. Its absence, the lack of timeliness of survey
data, and the delayed release of key pieces of Bank analysis limited the effectiveness
of Bank poverty diagnostic work in contributing to policy dialogue. The latest
poverty assessment was conducted in 2001, using 1997 FIES data. The poverty
assessment planned for 2006/07 was included as a chapter in a report on inclusive
growth and released only in 2010.

In the absence of a full poverty assessment, the empirical underpinnings of the
drivers of poverty and the unique challenges facing the extreme poor were limited
in depth and breadth. Between the 2001 poverty assessment and the 2010 report on
inclusive growth, poverty diagnostic work was embedded in many other pieces of
analytical work produced by the Bank, including the annual Philippines
Development Report, Discussion Notes, and Development Policy Updates. The Bank
also conducted a series of PERs to examine the efficiency of public spending in
priority areas and identify ways to improve pro-poor public actions. The most recent
PER, prepared in 2011, highlighted the fact that data gaps limit the scope for
analysis and the M&E of public revenues and expenditures.

STRATEGY FORMULATION, IMPLEMENTATION, AND FEEDBACK LOOPS
The Bank had two country strategies during the period of evaluation: the CAS for
FY06–09 and the CAS for FY10–13. Both reflected the broad recommendations of the
poverty diagnostics available at that time and were closely aligned with the
strategies of the Philippine government. The focus in the FY10–13 CAS on the
distributional aspects of growth was supported by considerable analytical
underpinning, despite the absence of a formal poverty assessment or poverty update
since 2001. However, the lack of timeliness of poverty data and its limited
representativeness translated into similar issues with the diagnostic work, which to
some extent undermined its usefulness, particularly for monitoring the effectiveness
of Bank interventions. The absence of a poverty assessment or poverty update
between 2001 and 2010 limited the scope and depth of poverty analysis that the
FY06–09 CAS could draw from. However, as the challenges the country faced with
respect to poverty reduction remained largely unchanged overall, the negative effect
of the poor timeliness of poverty diagnostic work on the Bank’s country strategy
formulation was limited.

Seizing the window of opportunity opened by the government, the Bank focused
primarily on supporting the piloting and scaling up of the conditional cash transfer

                                                                            APPENDIX A

program and CDD programs, including the Kapitbisig Laban Sa Kahirapan-
Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Service (KALAHI-CIDSS) CDD
program. The Bank also supported the development of the National Household
Targeting System for Poverty Reduction, which has become the main system of
identifying the poor, providing objective information for the CCT, CDD, and
national health projects. The Bank also supported several CDD programs that
targeted conflict-affected areas of Mindanao including the Autonomous Region in
Muslim Mindanao Social Fund, Mindanao Trust Fund for Reconstruction and
Development, and the Mindanao Rural Development Program 2.

In FY06–09 there were major deviations between the CAS program that was planned
and that which was implemented. Only five of the 15 projects listed under the base-
case lending scenario materialized. The bulk of the lending interventions occurred in
response to government demands to shift from pure investment lending to sector
wide national program support initiatives. One DPL, prepared in 2006, was
implemented during this period; it was planned only as a possibility for the high
lending scenario in the CAS. The results framework was clearer than in the previous
CAS, with a stronger causal link to poverty.

In FY10–13 there were major deviations between the planned and actual CAS
programs, for both lending and nonlending. In the CAS, some 36 percent of lending
was allocated to reducing vulnerability, 25 percent to macroeconomic stability, 21
percent to improvements in the investment climate, and 17 percent to public
services. In actuality, two-thirds of the lending portfolio was allocated to
macroeconomic stability, because of implementation of a series of DPLs and the
Catastrophe DDO (CAT-DDO) in response to global economic crises and natural
disasters. The Bank responded swiftly to support the Philippine government
respond to natural disasters. The disbursement of both the emergency DPL and the
CAT-DDO occurred with record speed, helping fund normal expenditures,
including social expenditures. However, several stakeholders expressed concerns
that the money was sitting at the national level and not used to support the poor in a
timely manner.

The Bank has provided considerable support to the Philippines concerning poverty
data improvement, including data collection and management and the
strengthening of the methodology for estimating poverty. Despite this support, the
Bank has not been able to strongly influence the introduction of necessary reforms
on data management and analysis. The lack of timeliness and quality of poverty
statistics remains a constraint in monitoring the progress of poverty reduction. The
Bank’s poverty diagnostic works were of high quality and provided strong
analytical underpinnings for policy making and strategy formulation. The absence

of a full poverty assessment or poverty update since 2001 limited the depth of the
work in certain aspects, including in identifying the drivers of poverty at a
disaggregated level and tailoring recommendations to overcome obstacles. The
CASs were closely aligned with government strategies. There were, however,
significant deviations between envisaged and actual implementation of country
programs. The M&E system improved both at the country program level and the
project level, though it continues to focus on national level and intermediate
outcomes.

disaggregated level and tailoring recommendations to overcome obstacles. The
CASs were closely aligned with the government’s strategies. There were, however,
significant deviations between the envisaged and implemented country programs.
The M&E system improved at both the program and the project level, though it
continues to focus on national-level and intermediate outcomes.

The Bank team in the Philippines has a strong sense of being a small player in a
middle-income country with challenging political economy issues and deeply rooted
vested interests. The main themes of the CASs—”islands of good governance” and
seizing the window of opportunity to help “make growth work for the poor”—
indicate the Bank team’s clear view of engagement in select areas. One of the key
challenges the Bank faces is achieving an appropriate balance between supporting
government priorities in reducing poverty and laying the groundwork to
institutionalize difficult reforms needed to foster more sustained and inclusive
growth.

Romania
CONTEXT
Romania experienced rapid growth during 2003–08, with GDP per capita growing
by about 8 percent a year. However, following the severe downturn in 2008–09, the
Romanian economy contracted sharply, and the pace of growth in 2009–13 has been
very slow (0.2 percent a year in per capita terms). Romania’s GNI stood at $15,700 in
2011. The post-crisis recovery remains fragile and the outlook is challenging. With
strong trade and financial sector linkages to the euro area, Romania has been and
remains vulnerable to the regional economic slowdown. Although the economy is
expected to grow at a moderately faster rate, growth momentum has been weak and
lags most other emerging economies in Europe. Difficulties in absorbing structural
funds from the European Union and frequent delays in advancing the structural
reform agenda are weighing on the economy’s potential growth.

Romania’s absolute poverty (national line) fell sharply from 30.6 percent of the
population in 2001 to 4.4 percent in 2009. Despite this progress, the consumption
deficit, which also had fallen, rose to more than 22 percent of the population.
Inequalities remain an important issue, as the difference between poverty rates in
rural and urban areas increased from 10 to more than 20 percentage points.

Good progress was made in reaching the MDG targets. Between 2001 and 2009, the
proportion of underweight children under the age of five fell by more than 50
percent, under-five mortality rate fell from more than 26 per 1,000 live births in 2000
to slightly more than 12 in 2012, and the maternal mortality ratio fell from 53 to 30
per 100,000 live births.

In Romania, the second largest ethnic minority (and by some estimates the largest) is
Roma. Most of the Roma are poor, vulnerable, and socially excluded. Among the
non-Roma population of Romania, 31 percent are at risk of poverty; the figure for
Roma is 84 percent. The secondary school completion rate for the Roma is only 10
percent, compared with 58 percent for non-Roma. A meaningful poverty reduction
strategy must address the situation of the Roma.

POVERTY DATA
By 2006 Romania had a well-developed information base for poverty monitoring
and analysis. It included credible household, living conditions, and labor force
surveys as well as two censuses (2002 and 2011) that, combined with the household
surveys, allowed for the estimation of poverty and living conditions at the local
level.

APPENDIX A
SUMMARIES OF 10 COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
The Bank has been involved in Romania’s data development since the 1990s. Its
involvement began with the first poverty assessment, conducted in 1993, which
provided an input into the development of data sets and methods of calculating
absolute poverty when the first representative survey was implemented in 1994.
Romania continued with the implementation of the survey. As new needs were
identified, it added new modules, temporarily or permanently. The Bank assisted
during the process.

DIAGNOSTICS
During the period covered by this evaluation, the Bank engaged in significant
capacity-building efforts. In 2007–08 it prepared three poverty reports in close
collaboration with the Ministry of Labor, Family, Social Protection, and Elderly
Persons and the National Institute of Statistics. These reports included the 2007
poverty assessment and two 2008 reports, one on inclusion and social protection, the
other on labor market vulnerabilities. The Bank supported the government with
technical assistance throughout the preparation of these reports. Preparation of the
2007 poverty assessment included analytical workshops that focused on impact
evaluation and evidence-based policy making and poverty measurement. The
Bank’s credibility on technical issues, built over the years; its pioneering work on
poverty as Romania transitioned from a centrally planned to a market-based
economy; and the deepening of poverty as a social program were largely responsible
for partnering with the government on poverty data, measurement, and policy
issues.

The Bank’s focus on increasing the volume and coverage of data and improving the
targeting of social transfers is implicitly a recommendation to improve the equity of
income after transfers. As its poverty assessments documented, the Bank paid
attention to regional and urban/rural inequalities through multivariate analysis and
poverty maps (showing high significance of geographic income disparities). Bank
efforts on poverty monitoring covered the impact of the 2009 global crisis on poverty
and focused increasingly on local conditions and exclusion. A joint Bank–UNICEF
report provided a rapid assessment of the impact of the 2009 crisis. The Bank
updated Romania’s poverty map with the use of 2011 census data. A recent report
supported the development of poverty and inclusion indicators as the subnational
level, including data on marginalized communities. These efforts responded partly
to an increased focus on inclusion.

The Bank’s diagnostic work was thorough and of good quality, contributing to
credible and widely shared findings on the drivers of poverty. Both the 2003 and the
2007 poverty assessments conducted multivariate analyses of the predictors of
adult-equivalent household consumption and reported the effects of geographic

(urban or rural area, region) and household conditions (including ethnicity, gender
of household head, and other variables). The 2003 poverty assessment provided
information on deprivation (nutrition, durables, housing); education, health, and
employment; and social capital (from a specially designed survey). The poverty
assessments also produced poverty maps. The Bank continued supporting the
production of poverty and exclusion maps following these poverty assessments,
using census data together with household surveys.

The Bank assessed the adequacy of the country’s poverty reduction institutions,
programs and funding, and poverty monitoring and evaluation arrangements. In
early 2009, it prepared a set of policy notes for the government covering all sectors
with a role in poverty reduction. Both in its poverty assessments and through its
more direct advice to the government, the Bank proposed broad as well as specific
and actionable recommendations to reduce poverty. The Bank’s broad approach was
to combine measures to accelerate growth with measures to reach those vulnerable
groups that would be unlikely to be reached by growth alone. The poverty
assessments and sector AAA developed specific and actionable recommendations.
Policies to reduce poverty through higher growth remained high on the list, with the
2004 CEM covering structural reforms across a wide range of areas. Several Bank
reports covered policies on social protection, a focus of Bank support since its
reengagement with Romania in the early 1990s, and developed actionable
recommendations to improve the coverage, targeting, and integration of social
protection arrangements. The Bank proposed actions to increase equity and quality
in schooling, both regular and vocational. The Bank’s functional reviews probed
deeply into delivery systems in these and other areas. The Bank earned its credibility
in Romania partly by sharing international knowledge and working closely with
local consultants and government line ministries and agencies.

STRATEGY FORMULATION, IMPLEMENTATION, AND FEEDBACK LOOPS
Through its past engagement, the Bank provided input into the government’s
poverty strategies (1998, 2002, 2009). Good as the Bank diagnostic work has been, it
must not obscure the contribution of other players. Before the review period of this
report, the United Nations Development Programme and other United Nations
agencies also supported poverty reduction efforts.

The FY06–09 and FY09–13 CPSs, as well as the FY02–04 CAS and the FY14–17 CPS,
consistently defined three pillars of overall Bank assistance with some variations in
phrasing: growth, public sector, and poverty reduction and inclusion. Under the
results chain articulated in the FY06–09 and FY09–13 CPSs, increased growth was to
be achieved through privatization and improvements in the investment climate, the
financial system, education and skills building, agricultural productivity, transport

(roads and rail), and energy. The FY09–13 CPS sought improved public sector
performance through better public financial management and civil service
administration. Both CPSs were to support poverty reduction and inclusion through
improvements in social protection, programs for the most disadvantaged and
vulnerable people, increased effectiveness of health services, and reductions in
regional disparities. The employment dimension of the poverty reduction vision was
to be achieved through increased growth (particularly nonagricultural growth) and
some direct interventions to bolster the formal economy and improve employability.
The CPSs’ broad results chain was reasonable, although perhaps more attention
could have been afforded to addressing the jobless growth record of past
performance.

Through their three pillars, the CPSs were broadly consistent with the vision
emanating from poverty diagnostics that identified growth, employment, and social
protection as the critical targets of public policy for poverty reduction. This vision
was underpinned by the poverty assessments’ diagnosis that growth was critical but
not sufficient for poverty reduction, because it was unlikely to reach disadvantaged
groups. Accordingly, a social protection component was critical for a comprehensive
poverty reduction strategy.

To achieve results under the road map to poverty reduction, interventions under the
two CPSs relied on the broad results chain outlined above, although details in the
two CPSs differed. Both CPSs aimed Bank inputs at similar outcomes: inclusion,
improved living and social standards, human development, and reduction of urban,
rural, and regional disparities. Under the FY06–09 CPS, the Bank planned three key
lending inputs toward its poverty and inclusion objectives: a series of human
development DPLs, a social inclusion loan, a rural and regional development loan,
and a second mine closure project. The planned portfolio was complemented by
AAA covering poverty, rural and regional development, and policy notes on the
human development areas. Under the FY09–13 CPS, the Bank planned a DPL series
that would reflect the intended content of the human development DPLs that had
not materialized under the 2006 DPL. Planned AAA covered the same areas as in the
FY06–09 CPS, except for rural and regional development. The country program
underpinning the FY09–13 CPS appeared to have a stronger commitment to
inclusion, possibly as a result of the effects of the crisis on the poor. The Bank
accordingly included a social inclusion pillar. Toward the end of the CPS period, the
government hired the Bank to prepare its poverty strategy.

The FY06–09 CPS period was marked by a halt in Bank lending. After loan approval
and effectiveness of 8 of 19 planned operations in 2006–07, little else took place on
lending. As the CPSCR indicated, “Following accession and a change in the

governing coalition, interest in borrowing from the Bank waned rapidly … as
Romania rapidly adjusted its financing strategy toward increased use of market
finance, investment loans from the European Investment Bank and Structural and
Cohesion grants from the EU [European Union].” Furthermore, continuing
macroeconomic weaknesses, slippages in the reform agenda after accession, and lack
of attention to strengthening institutional capacity derailed the program from a
high- to a low-case lending scenario (as specified in the CPS). The quality of the
portfolio declined as government interest in new loans weakened. The Bank
remained engaged only through a low-case program of AAA.

Bank engagement recovered under the FY09–13 CPS, as the 2009 global financial
crisis raised Romania’s financial needs and reform stance. Therefore, the Bank
implemented only part of its planned new lending under the FY06–09 CAS (but with
some with delays), as well as preexisting projects and an unplanned operation.
Preexisting projects the Bank implemented or closed during the two CPS periods
accounted for the bulk of implementation. The Bank dropped 11 of the 19 planned
new projects, including 3 human development DPLs, a rural and regional
development project, two infrastructure projects (energy and transport), 3
programmatic policy loans, and a business environment project.

Similarly, the Bank cut short the delivery of AAA under the FY06–09 CPS, after
delivery of 7 of the 20 AAA it planned. Delivered activities with high poverty
relevance included three poverty monitoring reports and a rural and regional
technical assistance activity. Dropped activities with high relevance from the
poverty perspective included a poverty monitoring note, a CEM, and three
macroeconomic assessments. Unplanned delivered AAA with high poverty
relevance covered (education and health), social protection, agriculture and rural
development, and public expenditure.

Planned and delivered lending picked up during the FY09–13 CPS period. The Bank
planned and approved three DPLs with human development components and a
health sector reform operation. It also approved an unplanned Social Assistance
System Modernization Project. Planned AAA (28 activities) under the FY09–13 CPS
was generally delivered; it covered most poverty-related sectors (poverty
monitoring, social protection, health, and education). At the end of the CPS period,
the Bank was implementing several reimbursable technical assistance activities
covering a broad range of areas. Other projects had no obvious poverty reduction
effects but could be argued to have some poverty impact. The 2006 Transport Sector
Support Project, for example, while not a poverty-focused operation, is expected to
provide access to schools, health, and jobs, especially in rural areas, with road and
railway works generating employment. The CPS did not monitor those effects.

Evidence on sustainability is spotty. Some investment projects, such as the Social
Fund and Municipal Services projects, indicate continued reliance on external
funding. In the case of the Social Fund, such funding came from a different donor
after the Bank project closed.

DPLs that supported reforms with good project ratings may prove to have
sustainable development outcomes. Two poverty reduction areas deserving more
attention are skills development and employment and regional development. The
Bank has explored these issues in the past, but it has not achieved the kind of
engagement demonstrated in health or social protection. Efforts on employment,
mainly analytical, emphasized the need to strengthen formal labor markets through
tax and regulatory changes; promote economic growth through changes in the
investment climate; and improve the links between education/training and
employment. Efforts on regional development have yet to develop a good paradigm
for action, although recent work on cities and “growth poles” shows promise. These
efforts need Romania’s own efforts to develop policies in these areas, where much
remains to be done.

The Bank monitored overall poverty reduction outcomes closely, through its work
with the Ministry of Labor, covering both the national and municipal levels (through
poverty maps). Evidence from the poverty assessments and other diagnostic work
informed the design of its programs. This evidence includes evidence on poverty
drivers as an underpinning for support to disadvantaged groups; evidence on the
relationship between growth and distribution, to underpin a strong emphasis on the
growth pillar as a way of reinforcing more direct poverty reduction efforts; and
more recently, evidence on the Roma, to underpin a progressively stronger focus on
this population.

The FY06–09 CAS articulated poverty-related targets from its projects under its
Targeting Poverty Reduction and Promoting Social Inclusion pillar. These targets
covered extreme poverty, living conditions at the local level and for the Roma
population, delivery of early childhood education in selected communities, the
quality of services to persons with disabilities, the youth employment rate, medical
care of the poor, and the quality of infrastructure in rural and economically
depressed areas. Under its inclusion pillar, the FY09–13 CPS monitored project
targets, including Roma living conditions, the payment of benefits under the
guaranteed minimum income (GMI) program and adequacy of GMI benefits, and
the targeting of social assistance. The CPSs also monitored other poverty-related
indicators, such as the costs of means-tested programs, consolidation of social
assistance programs, and the efficiency and quality of health services. Except in
follow-up projects (for example, the 2005 Mine Closure Project, which scaled up

activities under its predecessor), it is unclear how the Bank used the project
monitoring data. CPSPRs and CPSCRs referred to the CPS indicators and provided
updates and comments on progress with regard to the indicators.

There is room for improvement of monitoring poverty outcomes at the project level.
With the databases that the Bank has developed at the local level, the poverty focus
of projects could be more systematically measured, even for projects that are not
designed with a poverty focus. More systematic measurement of poverty impacts
could strengthen the feedback loops that help inform the poverty content of new
programs and operations.

Overall, the Bank responded to changing conditions. Its programs changed as a
result of Romania’s accession to the EU, in particular by supporting Romania on EU
issues with analytic activities linked to its programs. Nevertheless, planned DPLs
under the FY06–09 CPS did not go forward, as government interest in borrowing
from the Bank waned. Nevertheless, the Bank responded to the effects of the 2009
global crisis, under its FY09–13 CPS, by finding an opportunity to provide DPL
support that addressed both Romania’s financing needs and reform priorities. Its
reform priorities included poverty-related issues, including health, education, and
social protection, as the crisis briefly raised poverty numbers. The feedback loops
were strong in response to findings from analytical work, perhaps less so from
project M&E. Feedback loops from AAA worked in Romania primarily because the
Bank has been a credible counterpart that built its reputation on poverty issues over
the years with a strong record of work on data, poverty measurement, and poverty
diagnostic issues. It also helped that the Bank gained traction on policy advice
because of its role as an impartial observer in a very fluid political environment. The
Bank could perhaps learn more about poverty by strengthening the poverty-related
M&E of projects and extracting more lessons from its project experience.

SUMMARY ASSESSMENT
The Bank already had a long-standing engagement on poverty in Romania by the
time it prepared its FY06–09 CPS. In 1991, following a nine-year hiatus in support to
Romania, the Bank prepared social protection and health services operations,
beginning a long-term engagement in these sectors. As poverty was not
acknowledged, let alone measured, by Romania at the time, the Bank provided
support on data collection and poverty indicators, partly to underpin its support for
social transfer arrangements. As the Bank identified economic growth as a key
driver of poverty reduction, Bank support for structural reforms also deserved
attention from the poverty reduction perspective.

The Bank monitored overall poverty reduction outcomes in Romania closely
through its work with the Ministry of Labor, which covered both the national and
municipal levels (through poverty maps). Evidence from the poverty assessments
and other diagnostic work informed the design of its programs. Evidence was
gleaned from the following areas: poverty drivers as an underpinning for support to
disadvantaged groups; the relationship between growth and distribution to
underpin a strong emphasis on the growth pillar as a way of reinforcing more direct
poverty reduction efforts; and more recently, focus on the Roma to underpin a
progressively stronger focus on this sizeable minority group.

The FY06–09 CAS articulated poverty-related outcome targets from its projects
under its Targeting Poverty Reduction and Promoting Social Inclusion pillar. They
included the project targets and covered extreme poverty, living conditions at the
local level and for the Roma, delivery of early childhood education in selected
communities, the quality of services to people with disabilities, the youth
employment rate, medical care of the poor, and the quality of infrastructure in rural
and economically depressed areas. Under its inclusion pillar, the FY09–13 CPS
monitored project targets, including Roma living conditions, the payment of benefits
under the guaranteed minimum income (GMI) program and the adequacy of the

poverty-related indicators, such as the costs of means-tested programs, the

earned traction on policy advice thanks to its role as an impartial observer in a fluid

about poverty by strengthening the poverty M&E in projects and by drawing
lessons from the experience. There is scope for strengthening the M&E of the
poverty impacts from projects. Several projects that were not explicitly poverty
focused had likely effects on poverty reduction.


Senegal
CONTEXT
Following the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994, the Senegalese economy
experienced high levels of economic growth for a decade. From 1995 to 2005, annual
GDP growth averaged 4.5 percent, and inflation remained in check. Growth peaked
at about 6 percent in 2003 and 2004, thanks mainly to favorable weather conditions,
external environment, and domestic policies. Since 2006 the country has been
buffeted by a series of domestic shocks (poor rains in 2006–07, floods and droughts
in 2009 and 2012) and external shocks (world food and fuel price shocks in 2008, the
global financial crisis of 2008–09). These shocks have put Senegal in a low-growth
equilibrium, with average annual GDP per capita growth of only 1.3 percent
between 2003 and 2013. GNI per capita stood at $1,940 in 2011.

Senegal has a population of about 10 million, almost half of whom are poor. The
proportion of the population living below the national poverty line decreased from
67.9 percent in 1994 to 48.3 percent in 2005–06 and 46.7 percent in 2011. The level of
extreme or food poverty remained relatively unchanged throughout the entire
period at 15 percent. Because of continued growth in the population (estimated at
2.5 percent a year), the number of people living below the national poverty line in
Senegal has increased since 2001.

Senegal has made some progress toward other MDG targets. Between 2000 and
2012, the prevalence of undernourishment declined from 24.4 percent to 21.6
percent, primary school enrollment rose from 57.4 percent to 73.3 percent, under-
five mortality rate declined from 139 to 59.6 per 1,000 live births, and the maternal
mortality ratio fell from 480 to 360 per 100,000 live births.

Income distribution is highly unequal, with the Gini index estimated to have fallen
from 39.2 in 2001 to 37.4 in 2005 and 37.8 in 2011. The lowest income quintile in 2011



                                                                                     167

SUMMARIES OF 10 COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
accounted for 5.2 percent of total consumption while the highest income quintile
accounted for 50 percent. Senegal’s Human Development Index was 0.459 in 2012—
about average for Sub-Saharan Africa (0.463), ranking it 155 out of 187 countries.

POVERTY DATA
Poverty data in Senegal are generally of high quality and have continuously
improved over time, thanks in part to the support provided by the Bank. The main
limitations to income poverty data are that they are collected only once every five
years; they are not sufficiently disaggregated (for example, to the village level); and
raw data are not accessible to the public. The Bank (and other donors) put in place a
capacity-building effort at the national statistical agency that supported the
collection of income poverty data, the implementation of household consumption
and poverty surveys, and the preparation of reports that present the outcome of the
surveys. Non-income poverty data are abundant, but they are dispersed across the
various ministries without any central depository.

The National Statistics and Demographics Agency (NSDA) is responsible for
household survey design and data collection in Senegal. Three principal surveys
were conducted during the period under review: the 2001/02 Senegal Household
Survey (ESAM II), the 2005/06 Senegal Poverty Monitoring Survey (ESPS I), and the
2011 Senegal Poverty Monitoring Survey (ESPS II). The surveys cover the entire
country. The data can be broken down by area, allowing for the construction of a
poverty profile. Beginning in 2008, survey data are available at the administrative
unit level, which for the first time permits the creation of a poverty map. There are
also limitations to the survey data: the three surveys are not fully comparable, the
poverty indicators are estimated on the basis of consumption rather than income,
the data are collected only once every five years, and there were long lags between
the completion of the surveys and the availability of the results. Sector ministries
conduct their own non-income surveys regarding sectoral data, often in
collaboration with regional and international organizations. Perception surveys
capture households’ perceptions of poverty.

The NSDA is well staffed and well financed. Household surveys and poverty
surveys are well documented and broadly in line with international standards.
Survey reports are available on the NSDA website, but the underlying micro data
are not readily available for use by other government officials, development
partners, and civil society. The NSDA is also responsible for overseeing the quality
of non-income poverty data collected by ministries, but it has yet to create a central
depository for such data.

The Bank and other donors have been strengthening government statistical capacity
through the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building. The ANSD (National
Agency of Statistics and Demography) financed throughout the period under
review. Bank staff have been working closely with the ANSD regarding both the
survey methodologies and the preparation of survey analyses and poverty
diagnostics.

DIAGNOSTICS
Since the onset of the PRSP process in Senegal, in 2001, the government entity in
charge of poverty monitoring has prepared good-quality poverty diagnostics and
assessments, undertaken in close collaboration with the Bank. More recently, Bank
support for diagnostics (including inputs for the PRSP process, poverty assessments,
and poverty notes) was stepped up, with joint Bank and government poverty
diagnostics underpinning preparation of the country’s poverty reduction strategies.
Despite these efforts, there is no evidence that the government used the diagnostics
to craft action plans for future poverty work, the preparation of subsequent PRSPs,
or the design and targeting of specific interventions. There is also no evidence of
linking the diagnostic to the selection of any particular intervention.

Both government officials and other donors concurred that the Bank was the
preeminent and lead expert regarding poverty analyses and hence used the Bank
diagnostics for internal purposes. Representatives from civil society, however,
complained that they were unaware of or did not have access to these diagnostics,
underscoring an apparent communication gap, as these documents were in the
public domain.

The Bank carried out three main poverty diagnostics during the period under
review: the 2004 poverty report (“La Pauvreté au Sénégal”); the 2008 poverty report
(“Sénégal: Diagnostic de la Pauvreté”); and a collection of poverty notes prepared by
Bank staff in 2011 (the overview diagnostic document is entitled “Poverty,
Inequality, and Gender”). The 2004 report, a joint report by the Bank and the
government, provides comparable estimates of poverty using survey data from the
1994/95 ESAM I and the 2001/02 ESAM II. The 2008 poverty report, also carried out
jointly by Bank staff and government counterparts, provides an overview of poverty
in Senegal, an analysis of employment, and a diagnostic of the education and health
sectors using the 1994/95 ESAM I, the 2001/02 ESAM II, and the 2005/06 ESPS I. It
develops a poverty profile and for the first time a poverty map, with data
disaggregated down to the local community level.

The 2013 study “Poverty, Inequality, and Gender: An Overview” uses data from the
2011 ESPS II. It derives a poverty line consisting of both a food and a nonfood


                                                                                   169

component and includes an assessment of inequality. Its main findings include the
following: diagnostics have tended to be completed “just in time” before the Bank
country team require it as an input into CAS and CPS preparation; the methodology
for deriving Senegal’s poverty indicators is well documented and in line with
international standards; development partners relied on Bank poverty diagnostics
for their country strategies, but civil society appears to be unaware of the diagnostics
available for its use; the poor can be characterized as people living in rural areas
without access to local basic infrastructure; with a large number (10 or more) of
household members; and with a head of household who is a man with a primary or
lower level of education and seeking employment or economically inactive.

The 2004 diagnostic was mainly descriptive. The 2006 and 2011 diagnostics
conducted additional and deeper analysis of policy options available to the
government. They did not rank or prioritize the policy options. None of the
diagnostics discussed explicitly the impact of growth and income distribution on
poverty reduction or discuss obstacles to poverty reduction or identify the
constraints to address these obstacles. They did, however, discuss gender-specific
components of poverty in the context of the poverty profile and the drivers of
poverty.

STRATEGY FORMULATION, IMPLEMENTATION, AND FEEDBACK LOOPS
Although the available poverty data and poverty diagnostics underpinned the
Bank’s strategy, there is no evidence that the activities proposed under the strategy
were directly linked to or evolved from the diagnostics. Although the CAS/CPS
used the information provided by the household surveys and diagnostics as inputs
to their descriptive background chapters, they did not draw on the diagnostic’s
findings in justifying its activities. Despite the weak link between diagnostics and
strategy formulation and implementation, aspects of the Bank portfolio (such as
rural and agricultural sector development) were in areas identified in the diagnostic
work as being where the poor are located.

Three CAS and CPSs were prepared during the period under review: the CAS for
FY03–06, the CAS for FY07–10, and the CPS for FY13–17. The FY03–06 CAS was
aligned with Senegal’s first PRSP. It focused on wealth creation, capacity building
and social services, assistance to vulnerable groups, and implementation of the
strategy and monitoring of its outcomes.

The FY07–10 CAS was fully aligned with Senegal’s second PRSP. The FY13–17 CPS
supported Senegal’s priorities as presented in its National Economic and Social
Development Strategy for 2013–17 (or PRSP III), which builds on the government’s
political program (the Yonnu Yokute), the joint action platform of civil society (the

Assises Nationales), and the earlier Accelerated Growth Strategy. Its three main
pillars are growth, productivity, and wealth creation; human capital and sustainable
development; and governance, institutions, peace, and security.

The Bank’s assistance and partnership strategies for Senegal during the review
period drew on the poverty data and poverty diagnostics available at the time. The
poverty profile remained broadly the same, with a higher incidence of poverty in
households that were large; rural; and headed by a man with low education who
worked in the agriculture sector but who was currently unemployed or looking for
work. The formulated strategies had a strong focus on results and articulated a
reasonable results chain linking IDA interventions to desired outcomes to higher-
level country goals. They presented a logical sequence of the problems facing the
country and the expected outcomes of IDA involvement, including linking the
proposed projects and AAA to the specific outcomes being sought. The Bank
assistance strategies were aligned with Senegal’s PRSPs and selective, focusing on
areas of Bank expertise and comparative advantage and given other donor
interventions. However, the CAS and CPS discussion of trends in poverty incidence
and the poverty profiles were largely descriptive. No attempt was made to link the
proposed set of interventions to the findings of the diagnostic. They did not discuss
whether or how the proposed strategy and set of interventions evolved from the
poverty data and diagnostics. They did discuss targeting the poor and the most
vulnerable.

The CAS and CPS adopted a two-tier approach to poverty reduction. Income
poverty was to be addressed through a set of interventions to stimulate private
investment and private sector d under the growth and wealth creation pillars. Non-
income aspects of poverty were to be addressed through activities in support of
pillars on improving public service delivery, particularly in basic education, health
services, and water and sanitation. None of the Bank strategy documents identified
gaps in knowledge about poverty arising from the poverty data and diagnostics or
proposed filling any such gaps.

Implementation of Bank interventions was broadly consistent with the available
poverty data and diagnostics as well as the Bank’s strategy. Projects that focused on
rural areas, basic education, and the vulnerable parts of the population were
particularly consistent with the poverty data.

Overall, the Bank’s programs and projects were implemented as planned and hence
reflected the strategic priorities for poverty reduction as outlined in the CAS and
CPS, even though the feedback loops from data to diagnostics to strategy
formulation and implementation in Bank country strategies for Senegal were weak.

SUMMARIES OF 10 COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
Deviations from the interventions proposed in Bank strategies largely reflected
support measures aimed at cushioning the impact of the global financial crisis and
new government priorities. Although the CAS and CPS were prepared with input
from the Bank’s poverty and sector specialists, the country management unit largely
drove the process, and the specialists felt that they had little impact on decisions.
There were also concerns over the dominant role of the country directors and the
regional vice president regarding the direction and selection of Bank activities.
Although other stakeholders (financial and technical partners, civil society
organizations, and others) participated in discussions with Bank staff regarding the
CAS and CPS, these discussions were more informational than consultative. There is
a general perception by both Bank staff and development partners that once the
Bank’s strategy was completed, it was placed on the shelf and it was “back to
business as usual until the next progress report or completion report.”

The CASCR and the IEG CASCR Review of the CAS FY03–07 concluded that its
implementation was moderately satisfactory. On wealth creation, efforts to improve
the climate for private sector development yielded mixed results. The Bank was
successful in improving the private sector development environment, but progress
was slow on measures involving entrenched interests, customs, and development of
institutions. Bank support to improve public expenditure management contributed
to better budget management, but it was undermined by off-budget spending and
other special arrangements. Good progress was made on the capacity-building and
social services pillar on extending access to primary and secondary education and
improving gender parity in primary and secondary education, but little was
achieved with regard to efficiency, quality, or learning outcomes. Bank support in
health had mixed results, but considerable progress was made on improving access
to water and sanitation. Progress in improving the living conditions of the
vulnerable was positive, thanks to the Social Fund and rural infrastructure projects.
Nonlending services were delivered roughly as planned, with emphasis in the early
part of the period on core diagnostics to underpin planned use of the subsequent
DPL instruments.

IEG rated the overall outcome of the FY07–10 CAS as moderately unsatisfactory, in
line with the CASCR rating. Most objectives were only partially achieved, and some
were not achieved at all. Under the growth pillar, little progress was made toward
removing key transport and energy bottlenecks, and the overall business
environment deteriorated, despite some promising regulatory reforms. Under the
human development pillar, good progress was made in broadening access to
education and closing the gender gap, but there was no indication of improvement
in quality. In health and nutrition, there was a large disconnect between the positive
results at the project level and the disappointing outcomes. A child-focused social

cash transfer project achieved good results, but there was no information on the
welfare of street children. Most of the nonlending activities were delivered, albeit
with some delay.

Overall, there was no significant change in the poverty focus of Bank CAS, CPS, and
lending and nonlending activities during implementation, and the proposed set of
interventions envisaged in the Bank’s programs was broadly consistent with the
results chain in the CAS and CPS. New and unplanned activities arose largely
because of new priorities of the government and in response to domestic and
external shocks. Only some of these unplanned activities had an explicit poverty
focus. Budget support operations were key instruments for poverty reduction, but
there was no planned dialogue or conditionality in budget support operations
regarding the reallocation of public spending toward programs reaching the poor.
The Bank effectively leveraged its assistance, by financing pilot projects, co-
financing Bank projects with other donors, and financing projects with other Bank
Group entities (IFC and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency).

As the draft report for Senegal points out, during the period covered by this
evaluation, the Bank provided strong support to Senegal for generating good-
quality poverty data and diagnostics. Senegal’s government appeared to be
committed to poverty reduction and made good use of the technical support
provided by the Bank (and other donors) for its poverty data, poverty diagnostics,
and preparation of its PRSPs. However, the feedback loops from data to diagnostics
to strategy formulation and implementation in Bank country strategies were weak,
and there is a widespread belief that the Bank’s strategy was not closely monitored
by the government or the Bank’s own staff.

Appendix B. External Stakeholder Survey on
the World Bank’s Support for Poverty
Reduction
As part of the evaluation, the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) commissioned
an independent survey firm, ICF International, to conduct a stakeholder survey in 20
client countries. To ensure the authenticity of responses, the company was
instructed to conduct the survey in a confidential and anonymous manner sharing
only the cumulative results with IEG. ICF International communicated to the
respondents in its emails and follow-up calls that their individual responses would
not be shared with IEG or the World Bank.

The survey countries were selected to represent six regions of the world with
consideration of the balance between the types of countries by lending (i.e.,
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, IBRD, International
Development Association, IDA/Blend), accessibility of data, and fragile and non-
fragile countries (FCS and non-FCS). The final list of survey countries included
China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Dominican Republic, Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti,
Honduras, India, Jordan, Kosovo, Kyrgyz Republic, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal, Papua
New Guinea, Russia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and the Republic of
Yemen. For the distribution of selected countries by type and the corresponding
response rates, please refer to the lists of survey countries by type and survey
responses by country (See tables B.6 and B.7). The survey targeted several groups
including government officials, civil society, academia, donor/international
community, and private sector. The heavier weight in the respondent list was given
to government officials as they are World Bank’s primary clients.

The list of respondents was randomly generated from the list of respondents to the
Bank’s recent country client surveys and IEG evaluation interview lists, and was
complemented by the research of the independent survey firm. To improve the
representativeness and size of the sampling frame and to add independently found
respondent names, the survey firm supplemented the initial respondent lists. The
original sampling frame contained 4,619 contact names with email addresses from
which the stratified sample of 100 names in each country was drawn to be the final
respondent list. In most cases, each country list included a mix of approximately 60
government and 40 other stakeholder respondents. Within the “other” stakeholder
selection, the goal was to have equal representation of each group from donors,
academia, and private sector. To the extent possible these criteria were followed,


                                                                                  178
                                                                             APPENDIX B
                      EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDER SURVEY ON BANK SUPPORT FOR POVERTY REDUCTION
with the emphasis on having each stakeholder group represented. Where the
numbers in the sampling frame exceeded the number required, an analyst from the
survey firm randomly selected names within each target group. Additional names
were available in many countries to replace the emails that bounced back. Thus, in
cases where respondents’ emails bounced back and it was not possible to verify
appropriate contact information, the names of individuals were substituted with
additional names available in the same group of stakeholders. This was the only
time when the names of respondents were substituted by additional names.

The survey was fielded via email through the survey firm that followed up with
multiple email reminders and individual phone calls in each country. The survey
questionnaires were translated into the relevant language for each country. Every
individual that had an email address and phone number listed received at least five
reminders and calls. Among the five countries with most government respondents
were China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Honduras, Jordan, and Mexico. The
top five countries for non-government stakeholder respondents were Ethiopia,
Kosovo, Dominican Republic, Nepal, and Rwanda. A 27 percent response rate is on
a par with similar stakeholder surveys administered by the World Bank and other
international organizations. 1

In their research, Stoop et al. (2010)2 show that the absence of nonresponse bias and
the actual size of bias depend not only on the response rate but also on the
difference between respondents and nonrespondent groups, among other things.
Other researchers conform with this view stating that using response rates alone as a
way of judging the quality of a survey can be misleading. A high response rate can
still introduce a sizable bias in an estimate 3. Some literature suggest a distinction
between “active” nonrespondents and those who did not respond due to situational
factors, which means that they may not be objective to the specific survey topic or
surveyor or any other survey related issue. 4 Given that the number of respondents
to IEG’s external survey was high enough (over 540 people), the evaluation team
analyzed the respondent demographics to ensure that they were not deviating from
the overall demographics of the population list. There was no particular group of
stakeholders that was predominantly absent in the responses. Nonrespondent rates
varied from country to country more significantly rather than in comparable groups
of respondents among countries. The evaluation team also did not find “active”
nonrespondent bias among those who did not respond as conversations with the
independent survey firm showed that the nonrespondents were mostly those who
were not reachable by phone for individual reminders and who had situational
factors such as public holidays (in the Middle East and North Africa Region),
political situation in the country (e.g. Russia), etc.

APPENDIX B
EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDER SURVEY ON BANK SUPPORT FOR POVERTY REDUCTION
Further, to ensure the validity of responses, the evaluation team calculated the
implied error of responses at a 95 percent confidence level (z =1.96) and used it to
benchmark the responses to each question. As such, the implied error of responses
at the 95 percent confidence level is 3.6 percent.


Overall Profile of Respondents
The total number of respondents was 542 people, for a response rate of 27 percent
across all targeted countries. Among all of the respondents, 305 respondents were
government representatives and 237 were the representatives of other stakeholder
groups. Government respondents most frequently were involved with the Bank
through negotiations or discussions about loans or technical assistance (72 percent)
or through reading some of the Bank’s poverty-related reports (60 percent). The
primary areas of focus of government officials’ work were infrastructure,
agriculture/rural development, and finance (each representing about 13 percent of
respondents). More than half of all respondents had worked in their field for more
than 10 years (55 percent). Reflecting on the possible areas of involvement, the
greatest percentage thought that the World Bank focuses most of its attention in
their respective countries on infrastructure, including urban, transport, water, and
sanitation (46 percent).

The distribution of the respondents in other stakeholder groups included civil
society (27 percent), donors (23 percent), academia (23 percent), private sector (16
percent), and other (11 percent) 5. These respondents most frequently were involved
with the Bank through reading some of the Bank’s poverty-related reports (75
percent) or through participation in Bank-initiated discussions on poverty (52
percent), which is not as “intense” an engagement as indicated by government
respondents. The primary areas of focus of their work were education, public sector
development, or “other.” About two-thirds of this group had worked in their field
for more than 10 years. Reflecting on the possible areas of involvement, the greatest
percentage also thought that the World Bank focuses most of its attention on
infrastructure, including urban, transport, water, and sanitation (40percent).


Constraints to Data Availability and Use
Stakeholders only occasionally use data on poverty that are available from the
World Bank’s website and publications. Around quarter or less of the respondents
mentioned that they frequently use poverty data from the World Bank’s website and
publications. As such, only 18 percent of government stakeholders and 26 percent of

data. The majority of the respondents identified that they occasionally use Bank
sources for poverty data, with government officials indicating so in 49 percent of
cases and other stakeholders in 48 percent. While 33 percent of government
stakeholders and 26 percent of other stakeholders rarely or never use Bank sources
for poverty data.

The World Bank adds value to the improvement of the quality of data on poverty.
Around 86 percent of government and 90 percent of non-government respondents
agreed somewhat or strongly that the Bank adds value to improvement of the
quality of data on poverty. Of all the government respondents only four percent
disagreed somewhat with this statement and less than one percent disagreed
strongly. Similarly, among non-government respondents only five percent disagreed
with this statement and none disagreed strongly. Furthermore, the majority of
government respondents (85 percent) agreed strongly that the Bank’s analysis of
poverty data is beneficial for their agency’s work, with less than 6 percent indicating
that they disagreed with this statement.

Government stakeholders also agreed that the Bank has sufficient data on poverty to
develop its country strategies in their countries. As such 72 percent 6 of respondents
indicated that they “somewhat” or “strongly” agreed with the statement that the
bank has sufficient poverty data to develop its strategies, with 31 percent agreeing
strongly.

Government officials identified insufficient budget to collect data (64 percent) and
lack of regular household surveys (56 percent) as two primary constraints, closely
followed by insufficient government capacity (53 percent) to obtaining data on
poverty in the respective countries (see table B.1). Government officials most
frequently identified insufficient budget to collect data (64 percent) among obstacles
to obtaining poverty data. There were no large variations among IBRD, IDA/Blend,
FCS and Non-FCS countries in responses to this category. However, the comparison
of responses from government officials who use the data on poverty from the Bank’s
website and publications “frequently” and who responded to the question about
data constraints show that the frequent users of the data identify insufficient budget
to collect data more often as a constraint to obtaining data than any other category
(30 percent).

In the category “Lack of regular household surveys,” 27 percent of respondents were
from the IDA/Blend countries and 15 percent were from the IBRD countries.
Responses varied between the respondents from the FCS vs non-FCS countries in
the category “Lack of regular household surveys,” where 32 percent of respondents
from the FCS countries chose it as an obstacle vs. 19 percent of respondents from the
non-FCS countries. The two-tailed test of responses to this category shows a
statistical significance of means between the respondents from the IBRD/IDA
countries, FCS, and non-FCS countries, and between the respondents from the “data
weak” vs. “data rich” countries.

At the same time, 53 percent of government officials cited insufficient government
capacity to collect data as an obstacle, which was the third most cited constraint.
Government officials from the IDA/Blend countries cited this constraint in 24
percent of cases, while those from IBRD countries cited it in 18 percent of cases. The
corresponding two-tailed test shows that there is a difference of means in the scale
of this question between IBRD and IDA/Blend countries. There was no statistical
variation and large percentage variation in this category between the responses from
the FCS and Non-FCS countries.


Poverty Diagnostic Work
The stakeholders consider the Bank’s analytical work useful for developing their
government’s poverty reduction policies and programs. All of the listed products
(i.e., Poverty Assessments; Poverty Assessments and Poverty and Social Impact
Analyses, PSIAs; and Public Expenditure Reviews, PERs) received more than half of
the positive responses ranging between somewhat and to a great extent, while the
most positive feedback was received for PSIAs (73 percent). Government officials
believe “to a great extent” in 32 percent of cases that PSIAs are useful in developing
their ministry’s or agency’s programs and policies for reducing poverty, while they
express the same sentiment about the Public Expenditure Reviews in 25 percent of
cases. There was some variation between the government respondents to this

                          EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDER SURVEY ON BANK SUPPORT FOR POVERTY REDUCTION
question from the IDA/Blend and IBRD countries. As such, 78 percent of
respondents from the IDA/Blend countries agreed that PSIAs are “somewhat” or
“to a great extent” useful in developing poverty reduction-related policies and
programs in their agencies, while only 65 percent of the respondents from the IBRD
countries mentioned so. Similarly, around 71 percent of respondents from the
IDA/Blend countries mentioned Poverty Assessments being useful to “somewhat”
or “a great extent” vs. respondents from the IBRD countries. In regards to PERs, the
respondents from the FCS countries were more likely to say that the PERs were
useful than respondents from the non-FCS countries with 65 percent and 56 percent,
respectively (agreeing strongly in 32 percent and 22 percent of responses,
respectively.) In further analysis around 49 percent of respondents who indicated
they are “fully aware” and 48 percent who indicated that they are “somewhat
aware” of the poverty assessments also found the Bank’s diagnostic work on
poverty useful to their ministry’s or agency’s work to “a great extent.” The
percentages are calculated with the exclusion of those who indicated that they are
not aware of poverty assessments or they are not applicable. See table B.2 for more
information. 7

The vast majority of both government and non-government respondents were
positive about the quality of the Bank’s diagnostic work on poverty and its
recommendations. The responses were similar between the two groups and across
various categories. A detailed analysis of this question shows that around 75 percent
of government respondents and 73 percent of non-government stakeholders
mentioned that Poverty Assessments and PSIAs provided an identification of key
constraints to poverty reduction; 75 percent of government and 69 percent of non-

government stakeholders believe that these products provide actionable
recommendations; and 73 percent of government and 74 percent of non-government
stakeholders believe that the products provide a well-grounded analysis. Slight
variations included that government officials most frequently agreed “to a great
extent” that the Bank’s Poverty Assessments and PSIAs helped identify constraints
to poverty reduction (30 percent government vs. 27 percent of non-government),
while other stakeholders most frequently agreed “to a great extent” the that Bank’s
products provided a well-grounded analysis of poverty (22 percent of government
vs. 30 percent of non-government).

Government officials believe that, overall, Bank instruments address the poverty
focus in their country. All of the three listed instruments (Development Policy
Operations, DPOs; Investment Lending, IL; and Analytical Works) were deemed to
address the Bank’s poverty focus “somewhat” or “to a great extent” in the 70 to 78
percent range, although 11 to 14 percent of respondents don’t know or did not
answer. As such, DPOs were believed to address the poverty focus in some or great
extent by 74 percent of respondents, ILs by 71 percent of respondents, and
Analytical Works (AW) by 78 percent of respondents. Overall, ILs had higher
percentages of officials believing they address the poverty focus “to a great extent,”
with 38 percent of respondents indicating so vs. the other two instruments, where
the frequency was 32 percent. Further analysis shows that, in general, IDA/Blend
countries more frequently mention that DPOs somewhat or to a great extent address
the Bank’s focus on poverty (77 percent) vs. respondents from the IBRD countries
(68 percent). Additionally, the IDA/Blend countries more frequently believed that
the DPOs address poverty focus than IBRD countries with 81 percent of the
responses vs. 70 percent, respectively. For more details see table B.3.

Country Strategies and Projects
Looking at Bank products, the government respondents were more frequently “fully
aware” of the Country Partnership Strategy (37 percent) than poverty analytical
work or data. Overall, government respondents also were more “fully aware” about
country strategies than other stakeholders (27 percent).

The Bank needs to increase its focus on the poorest segments of population. Overall,
a total of 66 percent of government officials and 63 percent of non-government
stakeholders agreed with the statement “strongly” or “somewhat” that the World
Bank’s country strategy in their respective countries focuses on the poorest segments
of the population, with less than a third (27 percent) of government officials and less
than a quarter (16 percent) of other stakeholders agreeing strongly with the
statement. There were no significant variations between government respondents
from the IDA/Blend vs. IBRD countries and FCS vs. non-FCS countries. However,
both government and other stakeholders disagreed somewhat or strongly between
25 and 28 percent. Government and other stakeholders from the IDA/Blend
countries were disagreeing more frequently than those from the IBRD countries. As
such, government respondents disagreeing with this statement in 63% percent of
cases were from the IDA countries, while 37 percent were from the IBRD countries.
Among the other stakeholders who disagreed with the statement, 73 percent were
from the IDA/Blend and 27 percent were from the IBRD countries. More
government respondents from non-FCS countries disagreed than those from the FCS
countries with a 74 percent vs. a 26 percent frequency. Similarly, more non-
government stakeholders from non-FCS countries disagreed than from the FCS
countries with a 70 percent vs. a 30 percent frequency.

When government officials were asked whether they agree that the benefits of Bank-
funded projects continue after the projects are completed, around 66 percent agreed
with the statement, with only a quarter of the respondents agreeing strongly.
Furthermore, another quarter of the respondents disagreed with the statement and
nine percent of respondents indicated they did not know an answer to the
statement. There were no large variations in the responses agreeing with the
statement between the government respondents from IDA/Blend and IBRD
countries, but those from the IDA/Blend countries more frequently disagreed with
the statement (29 percent) than those from the IBRD countries (17 percent). The
biggest gap in disagreement range was observed in the “disagree strongly”
category, where 11 percent of IDA/Blend countries chose it vs. three percent from
the IBRD countries. At the same time, respondents from the FCS countries were
more likely to disagree with the statement (39 percent) than those from the IBRD

countries (20 percent), with the larger gap in the “disagree strongly” category that
had 18 percent vs. four percent, respectively.

FEEDBACK LOOPS

The Bank’s coordination between donors and the government needs further
strengthening. A little over half (57 percent) of government respondents agreed
strongly or somewhat that the World Bank coordinates priorities between donors
and the government, while 27 percent disagreed strongly or somewhat with this
statement. When donors were asked whether the World Bank coordinates priorities
between the donors and government, only 53 percent agreed with the statement, of
which only 11 percent agreed strongly. At the same time, around 44 percent
disagreed with the statement, of which 13 percent disagreed strongly. This question
had the highest total percentages of people disagreeing with the statement both
among the government officials and the donors. The analysis of the negative tale of
the responses shows that government officials and donors from IDA countries were
more likely to disagree with this question than those from other types of countries.
As such, 72 percent of government officials disagreeing with this statement were
from IDA/Blend countries, while 28 percent were from IBRD. Similarly, donors
responding negatively to this question were 88 percent from IDA/Blend and 13
percent from IBRD. More respondents from non-FCS countries disagreed with this
statement than those from FCS countries. Among government respondents
disagreeing with the statement, 65 percent were from the non-FCS countries and
among the donors 67 percent.

The Bank seeks feedback more frequently from donors compared to other
stakeholder groups. Both government officials and other stakeholders responding to
the survey felt that the World Bank seeks feedback while developing its country
strategies more frequently from donors (including bilateral and multilateral
organizations) than other listed stakeholder groups. Overall, 71 percent of
government respondents and 67 percent of other stakeholders believed that the
Bank seeks feedback from donors to “some” or a “great extent” from donors. The
next most frequently mentioned group was civil society, with 65 percent of
government respondents and 64 percent of other stakeholders choosing this
category. Both government officials and other stakeholders indicated less frequently
that the Bank seeks feedback from academia (with 56 percent of government officials
agreeing and 52 percent of other stakeholders agreeing) and private sector actors
(with 54 percent of government officials agreeing and 53 percent of other
stakeholders agreeing). For more details, please see table B.4 and B5).

The issue of better coordination was mentioned in responses to the open-ended
question on the lessons the World Bank can use to help government to strengthen
the poverty focus of its policies or strategies. Around 7 percent of comments from
government stakeholders answering the question mentioned better coordination
among donors and government as an important lesson. One of the comments was:

“Our government has a strong focus on poverty reduction. The support that the [World Bank]
could give is more in ensuring that reliable data are available to support the analysis as well as
the monitoring of the efforts. [The World Bank] could also play a better role in helping
coordinate/facilitate the discussions between donors and recipient country government[s] on
better policies to reduce poverty. It seems that often the [World Bank] acts like just another donor
and also that it does not like to get involved in strategic policy change discussions.”

In 24 percent of comments, government respondents mentioned the importance of
ensuring more local ownership and beneficiary engagement in developing projects
and strategies. The comments highlighted the necessity for the Bank to have a
“bottom-up” approach to developing poverty-related strategies and policies to
ensure greater ownership and sustainability. Some comments included:

“It is essential to include local governments and communities in the development of policies to
ensure the sustainability of the actions arising from the implementation of these policies. It is
important to establish a system to monitor the impact of actions taken on behalf of the population
in poverty with sufficient visibility to allow these people to demand accountability.”

“The discussion of strategies should be included with civil society activists, parliamentarians,
people from the villages, [and] the beneficiaries, in order to receive the full and objective
information.”

“Support is needed during the entire project process, develop population-based project impact
assessments, and develop projects from the bottom-up, as part of a policy of ‘closeness’ and an
approach that is participatory.”

In 81 percent of cases, government respondents mentioned that they agree
somewhat or strongly that the lessons from projects implemented by the Bank and
other development agencies inform the development of the Bank’s country
strategies. Among those who agreed, 34 percent agreed with the statement strongly.
There were no significant variations between the respondents from the IDA/Blend
vs. IBRD and FCS vs. non-FCS countries.

government or international/development agencies. Some respondents in this category also
indicated that they worked for more than one category i.e., public sector and private sector
or government and international institution.

Appendix C. Staff Survey on the World Bank’s
Support for Poverty Reduction
The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) conducted a survey among World Bank staff
to capture their perceptions of best practices and constraints to obtaining poverty data,
creating poverty diagnostic work, and translating analytic work into country strategies
and policies. The survey was conducted between April 15 and May 13, 2014, and was
sent to 4,150 Bank staff, of whom 866 responded (a rate of 21 percent). The universe of
4,150 respondents was narrowed to exclude those working on services that are not
directly related to country strategies or operations. Among the excluded units were
procurement, human resources, information and technology, business solutions, the
World Bank Institute, and IEG. 1 The full list of excluded units and staff titles is
provided at the end of the appendix.

Since the evaluation team narrowed the list down to include staff working on
operational and poverty related issues, it was decided not to sample the list further. A
similar technique is used in a number of Bank-administered staff surveys and the
response rate (21 percent) is within the range of similar surveys. 2

The survey probed three main issues related to the Bank’s poverty work: (i) constraints
to obtaining poverty data; (ii) best practices and challenges to creating poverty
diagnostic work; and (iii) challenges in translating poverty diagnostic work into country
strategies. Survey limitations are described in box C-1.


 Box C.1. Limitations of the Survey
 The results of the internal survey are subjective and based on staff perception rather than
 factual evidence. The following aspects need to be considered when interpreting the survey’s
 results.
    There is self-selection bias among respondents, which exists in all surveys where
     respondents are given an option to choose whether or not to respond to the survey.
    There was an overrepresentation of staff self-identified as knowledgeable about certain
     countries. As such, roughly six percent of survey respondents self-identified as most
     knowledgeable about Indonesia, while just over five percent self-identified as most
     knowledgeable about India. Other countries identified by a significant number of
     respondents include: Brazil (3.1 percent), Vietnam (2.9 percent), Bangladesh (2.8 percent),
     Ethiopia (2.7 percent), Nigeria (2.4 percent), Pakistan (2.4 percent), Tanzania (2.4 percent),
     Kenya (2.3 percent), and China (2.2 percent). Over 80 percent of respondents self-identified
     as mapped to one of the six Regions and only 16 percent as mapped to the networks. The
     highest percentage of respondents self-identified as mapped to the Africa Region.

                                                                                    APPENDIX C
                                    STAFF SURVEY OF WORLD BANK’S SUPPORT FOR POVERTY REDUCTION
    Since the survey was not randomly sampled and was sent to the universe of respondents, it
     does not have a sampling error and did require confidence level testing.


Despite the survey limitations mentioned in box C.1., the comparison of the distribution
of population and that of the respondents by mapping, location, and grade levels shows
that there is no significant variation between the groups. The differences were in 1 and 2
percent between each of the compared groups. For more details, please refer to figures
C.1. and C.2. This shows, overall the respondent group is not significantly different
from the population chosen for this evaluation.

classification to find differences between countries that are either International Bank for

(IDA)/blend and fragile and conflict-affected states (FCS) or non-FCS. Some of the
survey results were also analyzed across countries that have no or only one Household
Income and Expenditure Survey and Living Standard Measurement Survey versus
those with more than one survey conducted between 2000 and 2012 and available in the
central data platforms of Development Economics (such as the Micro data Library and
PovcalNet). Overall, 79 percent of respondents identified themselves as most
knowledgeable with countries with more than one survey, while a little over 18 percent
of respondents identified themselves as knowledgeable about countries with one or no
survey.

Overall Respondent Profiles
Five fields that respondents most commonly selected as the area in which they were
most knowledgeable were: infrastructure (14 percent); macroeconomic and fiscal policy
(10 percent); agriculture and rural development (9 percent); public sector development
(9 percent); and poverty (9 percent). About 58 percent of respondents indicated that
they had worked on country strategies and 52 percent indicated that they had worked
on projects and instruments targeting poverty in the past five years. Over one-third of
the respondents (around 35 percent) indicated that they contributed to or led diagnostic
work on poverty in the past five years.

The majority of respondents were senior-level staff members, as roughly 48 percent of
respondents self-identified as GG level 3 and 24 percent identified as GH level or above,
while 28 percent of respondents identified themselves as GF-level staff. This
distribution is similar to the distribution of grade levels of the respondent universe. 4
Additionally, over 68 percent of respondents have been employed by the World Bank
for more than five years, of whom over 39 percent of respondents have been at the Bank
for more than 10 years. This means that the respondent pool is over-represented by staff
who have been at the Bank for five or more years.

The geographic distribution of the respondents was almost evenly spread between the
World Bank headquarters and country offices. However, the representation of Regions
and networks was uneven. Staff from the Regions took a more active part in the survey
than staff from the networks. The highest participation rates were observed among staff
from the Africa (24 percent) and East Asia and Pacific (14 percent) Regions. Among the
networks, the highest participation was from the respondents in the Sustainable
Development Network (SDN, six percent) followed by Finance and Private Sector
Development (FPD, three percent). 5


Key Messages
The majority of respondents agreed that the Bank has sufficient access to data to
provide policy advice to client governments. Roughly 77 percent of respondents agreed
with the statement that the World Bank has sufficient data to make policy advice to
client countries on poverty-related issues; 20 percent agreed strongly with this
statement. This feedback was shared almost uniformly across GF, GG, and GH-level
staff and across Regions. There were no significant variations between the positive
responses from staff working on IBRD, IDA, and blend 6 countries, with 75 percent, 75
percent, and 83 percent of responses, respectively. Similarly there were no significant
variations between FCS and non-FCS countries in the proportional percentage of

positive responses, with 70 percent and 78 percent, respectively. However, 65 percent of
staff working on countries with one or no survey between 2000 and 2012 agreed that the
Bank has sufficient data to make policy advice while 79 percent of respondents from
countries with more than one survey responded similarly to the question. Although the
difference in the percentages of responses between these two groups of respondents is
not very large, the two-tailed test comparing the means of responses show statistical
differences in responses, with staff from one or no survey countries tending to respond
more negatively.

Staff who indicated that they have been at the Bank longer than 10 years were more
likely to agree strongly that the Bank has sufficient data to make policy advice (24
percent) to governments than those who said that they have been at the Bank for less
than two years (15 percent).

Staff believe that the Bank has the needed quality of data to understand the causes of
poverty in client countries. When asked whether the quality of the data that the Bank
has is high enough to understand the causes of poverty in client countries, the overall
feedback was positive, with 13 percent agreeing strongly and over 51 percent agreeing
somewhat.

The majority of respondents believed that the primary challenges to obtaining data on
poverty are the client government’s insufficient capacity, budget, and political will. As
such, staff identified insufficient capacity (57 percent), insufficient budget (42 percent),
and insufficient political will of the government agencies (39 percent) as the top three
constraints to obtaining data (see table C.2).

In general, a higher percentage of staff from the Regions identified insufficient
government capacity and budget as primary constraints to obtaining poverty,
compared to the networks. Among the Regions, staff from the Africa, East Asia and
Pacific, and South Asia Regions were more likely than others to choose the
government’s weak capacity as a constraint to obtaining data on poverty. As such, from
64 percent to 67 percent of respondents from each of these Regions chose the
government’s insufficient capacity as one of the primary constraints. Furthermore, 69
percent of staff working on IDA countries believed that insufficient capacity of
government agencies is one of the two major constraints as opposed to 56 percent of
staff working on IBRD countries. Similarly, 76 percent of staff working on FCS countries
believed the government’s weak capacity is one of the major constraints versus 54
percent of staff working on non-FCS countries. Additionally, staff working on countries
with one or no survey were more likely to cite weak government capacity as a
constraint than those working on countries with more than one survey with 95 percent
and 60 percent, respectively.

Bank staff mentioned the lack of sufficient government budget (42 percent) as the
second most frequently cited constraint. This feedback was more frequently shared by
staff most knowledgeable of IDA, blend, and FCS countries. It was defined as an issue
by 53 percent of staff working on FCS countries, 40 percent of staff working on non-FCS
countries, 52 percent of staff working on IDA countries, 32 percent of staff working on
IBRD countries, and 35 percent of staff working on blend countries. Similarly, staff
working on data poor countries indicated more frequently that the budget is an issue
than those working on data rich countries, with 63 percent versus 45 percent,
respectively.

Another top obstacle identified by staff was insufficient political will (39 percent). Staff
working on blend countries were more likely (50 percent) to identify insufficient

STAFF SURVEY OF WORLD BANK’S SUPPORT FOR POVERTY REDUCTION
political will within government as a main constraint compared to staff working on IDA
countries (40 percent) and IBRD countries (34 percent).

Staff have alternative sources of data to rely on when they don’t have poverty data.
Respondents indicated that when data are scarce, the census or household surveys (74
percent), the Bank’s poverty assessments (37 percent), and administrative data on
government programs (36 percent) are among the top three sources of data used to
create diagnostic work. The smallest percentage of respondents (12 percent) indicated
that they use experiences from other countries with similar poverty-related issues.

The flow of data among the Bank networks and Regions is inconsistent. Fewer than half
of the respondents (49 percent) believed that Bank staff almost always or frequently
shared data on poverty within or across the Bank’s networks and Regions, while over
43 percent of responses ranged between sometimes, occasionally, and hardly ever.
Challenges from data sharing in the Bank were flagged in an open-ended question
when respondents were asked to provide feedback on why the Bank’s diagnostic work
may not have an impact on government policies. As one respondent said: “Data
collection is something Poverty Reduction and Economic Management [PREM] needs to
take on as a core part of their program—we need spatially disaggregated, robust data.
Currently we rely on the government's data, which PREM colleagues say is
‘confidentially’ shared by [the] Office of Statistics, and do not share this with others in
the Bank although they freely use it for their own work. Sector teams do not get access
to it, although one part of the Bank has it. It is not shared on the grounds of ‘building
client relationships and trust.’”

Bank staff appear to have positive outlook on the influence of poverty diagnostic work
on government policies. As such, when asked about the influence of the Bank’s
diagnostic work on poverty, 72 percent of respondents indicated that they agreed with
the statement, of whom 54 percent agreed somewhat and 18 percent agreed strongly
(see figure C.3). There were no significant variations among staff mapped to Regions
(see table C.2). However, staff from the Europe and Central Asia and Middle East and
North Africa Regions chose “agree strongly” less often than staff from other Regions (9
percent and 10 percent, respectively).

Those who did not think that the Bank’s diagnostic work influences government
policies were invited to explain why they thought so. Over 100 people responded to the
open-ended question by sharing experiences and feedback that ranged from poor data
quality and data sharing practices in the Bank, to the lack of practical knowledge among
Bank staff, to lack of political will in the government, all the way to a perception that the
Bank’s work provided little value added. As such, the lack of political will and different
government priorities was mentioned by 39 percent of those who responded to the
open-ended question, lack of coordination with government by 15 percent, corruption

and fragility in countries by 14 percent, and lack of political knowledge by 11 percent.
Some of the quotes from the responses are:

      •   “The government has its own political and economic objectives and is very
          reluctant to be influenced by external diagnostic works, however evidence-based
          they might be.”
      •   “We focus too much on data and think if the Bank provides relevant data-
          informed analysis this will somehow automatically translate into the right policy
          choices, while we neglect the adverse political economy that holds up policy
          choices for other reasons and [are] related to strong entrenched patronage.”
      •   “Lack of political will in the government to make and implement the difficult
          decisions required. The World Bank has used its influence for getting various
          policies made, but has been quite ineffective in improving implementation.”

Respondents indicated that the main challenges that Bank staff face in preparing certain
analytical products are related to lack of sufficient data, budget, or time. Around 38
percent of respondents indicated a lack of sufficient poverty data as one of the major
constraints to creating Poverty and Social Impact Analyses (PSIAs) and around 37
percent felt the same constraint while creating poverty assessments (PAs). In both
PSIAs and PAs, staff also felt that time and budget constraints were key challenges. As
such, over a quarter of the respondents said that they lacked sufficient time to do the
PSIAs, while only 19 percent identified this constraint for PAs. Insufficient budget was
also mentioned by 32 percent of respondents for PSIAs and 26 percent for PAs.

Overall, staff have a positive perception that the Bank instruments address the poverty
focus of country strategies. Over half of the respondents (55 percent) felt that
development policy operations (DPOs) focus on the poverty issues outlined in the
Bank’s country strategies either to a great extent or somewhat, while over one-third felt
that it did so to a very limited extent or not at all (30 percent). Respondents mapped to
Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS, 33 percent) were among those who
most frequently identified DPOs as being focused on poverty (see table C.3).to a great
extent. In contrast, over 79 percent of respondents indicated that investment lending
(IL) addresses the poverty focus as described in the Bank’s country strategies to a great
extent or somewhat. Respondents agreeing that IL focuses on poverty to a great extent
were more frequently mapped to the Africa Region (47 percent), South Asia Region (40
percent), Latin America and the Caribbean Region (44 percent), and SDN (41 percent).
The more negative responses came from staff mapped to the Middle East and North
Africa Region (25 percent) and PREM (25 percent) compared to others (see table C.4).

Over 75 percent of respondents were positive that the Bank’s analytical work (i.e.,
economic and sector work, SW) and technical assistance (TA) addressed the poverty
focus of the Bank’s country strategies. Only a quarter of respondents in each of the
options felt that ESW and TA focus on poverty to a great extent. Staff mapped to the
Africa Region were more likely to respond that ESW addresses country strategies’ focus
on poverty to a great extent than staff from other Regions and networks (see table C.5),
while staff mapped to the Human Development Network (HDN) felt similarly about
TA (see table C.6). Respondents at the GH and above levels were more positive (33
percent) that ESW addresses the poverty focus to a great extent than staff at GF and GG
levels (see figure C.5).

Overall, staff feel that the Bank has sufficient data for country strategies. Of
respondents, 71 percent agreed that the Bank has sufficient data to develop its
strategies, with only 14 percent agreeing strongly. Staff working on IDA 7 countries were
less likely to agree with the statement (68 percent agreeing) compared to staff working
on blend countries (75 percent agreeing) and IBRD countries (73 percent agreeing).
Also, 65 percent of staff working on FCS countries agreed while 72 percent of staff
working on non-FCS countries agreed. (See table C.7).

IEG Staff Survey Staff who have been at the Bank for more than 10 years were more
likely to agree strongly that the Bank has sufficient data to create country strategies (20
percent) than staff who have been at the Bank for less than two years (10 percent) and
between two and five years (11 percent).

Staff believe that the Bank addresses the causes of poverty in its strategies. Over 82
percent of respondents believed that the Bank addresses the causes of poverty in its
strategies. More than half of the respondents (52 percent) believed that the Bank does so
somewhat while only one-third (30 percent) believed that it does to a great extent. The
extent to which respondents believed the Bank somewhat or to a great extent addressed
the causes of poverty in its strategies increased according to a respondent’s length of
service at the Bank. Of the respondents with less than two years of experience, 69
percent believed that the Bank integrates the causes of poverty into its strategies
somewhat or to a great extent compared with 86 percent of similar responses from staff
with more than five, but less than 10 years of experience, and 88 percent of responses
from staff with 10 or more years of experience.

Government reluctance to accept the findings of analytical work and time lag were
identified as the two most important constraints to translating the Bank’s analytical
work into country strategies. The top two constraints chosen by staff were government
reluctance (38 percent) and time lags between the release of analytical work and the
drafting of country strategies (37 percent). As seen in table C.8, a higher percentage of
respondents from the Europe and Central Asia Region identified government
reluctance as one of the two major constraints (48 percent) while staff from the Middle
East and North Africa Region were least likely to cite it as a reason (22 percent),
compared to other Regions.

Although there were no significant variations across respondents mapped to Regions, a
higher percentage of staff (46 percent) working on FCS countries believed that time
disparities between the release of a country strategy and the poverty diagnostic work is
a constraint versus staff working on non-FCS countries (36 percent), as shown in table

In the open-ended responses provided by those who selected “Other,” staff further
shared their insights. In almost 21 percent of open-ended responses (total n = 78), staff
mentioned that, in some cases, analytical products are too technical, not grounded in
country realities, or too general to be used in country strategies. A few respondents
commented:

      •   “Diagnostic's recommendations are often very general and are of little value to
          technical sector specialists who would like more details and narrower sector
          perspective, which is often missing.”
      •   “General poverty analysis [is] not helpful, [it] requires focus on key sectors such
          as health in which data is scarce, and there is [a] lack of interest on the part of
          government.”
      •   “The diagnostic work tends to be nonspecific and very aggregate. For example,
          determinants of poverty are usually about personal characteristics (large family,
          low education), but does not capture the impact of infrastructure on
          productivity, job opportunities, or wages; it doesn't even capture the impact of
          health on poverty status.

2 For instance, the World Development Report 2015 on Mind, Society, and Behavior, which
is the largest flagship report of the World Bank, reported staff survey results at a 39 percent
response rate. The survey was not sampled and was sent to 4,797 World Bank staff from all
sectors of the World Bank to participate in a survey designed to measure perceptions. The
WDR further reports that this response rate is well above the needed rate for

at Work: Assessing the Influence of World Bank Research. Development Economic Unit.
World Bank 2012).
3The Bank uses 10 grade levels as a way to structure its workforce. Letters are used to
signify the various grades which reflect increasing levels of responsibility, skills, and
requirements
4The distribution of grade levels in the respondent universe is: 27 percent, GF staff; 47
percent, GG staff; and 25 percent, GH and above staff.
5   Refer to the disclaimer about country and regional distribution of responses in Box D-.1.
6The analysis of the internal survey results by the types of countries (IBRD, IDA, blend, FCS
and non-FCS) excludes the responses from staff indicating that they are most
knowledgeable about the countries that are not classified by the World Bank. These
countries include Australia, Cuba, Finland, Hungary, Kuwait, Latvia, Lithuania, Saudi
Arabia, South Sudan, Spain, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, and West Bank and Gaza.
One exception is South Sudan, which did not become a World Bank member until 2012. The
responses from all of these countries were included in the cumulative numbers of responses
in each question.
7 Economies   are divided into IDA, IBRD, and Blend countries based on the operational
policies of the World Bank. International Development Association (IDA) countries are
those with low per capita incomes that lack the financial ability to borrow from the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Blend countries are eligible
for IDA loans but are also eligible for IBRD loans because they are financially creditworthy.

Appendix D. Key Findings from Focus Group
Discussions with Staff
As part of the evaluation, the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) conducted six
focus group discussions with Bank staff to gather insights on how the availability of
poverty data affects the Bank’s poverty diagnostic and whether and how they
translate into country strategies. The focus groups collected qualitative feedback
based on the participants’ personal experiences and views. As such, the responses
were treated as exploratory and were triangulated with other sources of data in the
final report.

Focus groups brought together 22 staff members working on countries across all six
Regions of the world. Participants were selected with the consideration of the
balance between the types of countries by lending (i.e., International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, IBRD; International Development Association,
IDA/blend), fragile and non-fragile countries, and availability of data. Given
resource and time constraints, focus group discussions gathered staff working on 18
countries: Afghanistan, Botswana, Cambodia, Democratic Republic of Congo, India,
Indonesia, Jordan, Kosovo, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Pakistan, the Russia
Federation, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Papua New Guinea, West Bank and Gaza, and
the Republic of Yemen as well as the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States. 1

The homogeneity of each focus group was in the type of work participants
performed as their main duties. As such, each focus group distinguished between
task team leads (TTLs) or co-leads of poverty assessments and poverty updates,
country economists, and TTLs and co-TTLs of country partnership strategies.
Invitations were extended to all identified types of staff in each of the above
mentioned countries. In the cases where poverty assessments for the identified
countries were produced prior to 2009, the country economists were invited to
participate instead of the assessment TTLs. Not everyone who was invited to
participate in the discussions was able to join. Every effort was made to
accommodate the busy and varying schedules of the invitees to ensure their
participation. The main questions raised in the discussions were the same across all
the focus groups. The same facilitator led discussions in each focus group. Each
focus group discussion was conducted for an hour and a half. When necessary, the
facilitator asked for additional information and probed for emerging trends. The list
of the main questions appears below. The discussions about the use and translation
of poverty analytics and data in country strategies varied among groups. As such,
poverty assessment leaders and country economists did not respond to all of the

questions regarding country strategies since they felt their experience in this field
was relatively limited. Similarly, a few of the country partnership strategy (CPS)
TTLs and co-TTLs were not comfortable responding to some of the questions related
to data and poverty diagnostic.


Main Questions
DATA AVAILABILITY
      •   Do you think the Bank has sufficient poverty data to make policy advice
          related to poverty in client countries?
      •   What are the main constraints to obtaining poverty data in your line of work?

QUALITY AND CONSTRAINTS TO POVERTY DIAGNOSTIC WORK
      •   What are the main constraints that the World Bank faces when developing
          analytical work on poverty?

TRANSLATION OF POVERTY DATA AND DIAGNOSTIC INTO COUNTRY STRATEGIES
      •   What are the primary constraints to translating analytical work on poverty
          into the Bank’s country strategies?
      •   In your experience, what plays an important role in the design and focus of
          country assistance strategies (CASs) and CPSs?

FEEDBACK LOOPS
      •   How much does the Bank consult with external stakeholders while creating
          country strategies?
      •   What are the obstacles for an effective integration of stakeholder feedback, if
          any?


Perceptions on Availability of Poverty Data
Despite many data constraints, the participants do not consider the adequacy of data
a main constraint to making policy advice, particularly when the economists and
experts know the country context well. In general, all of the participants were in
agreement that data availability and data quality vary by country and region.
However, participants in the focus groups did not express strong feedback that, in
the countries where there has been only one or no Household Income and
Expenditure Survey (HIED) or Living Standard Measurement Survey (LSMS)
between 2000 and 2012, 2 staff face significantly more constraints in producing their

compared to countries with the greater number of surveys. The general explanation
was that the Bank has sufficient data to make policy advice and uses its strong
knowledge of country context to do its work even in the countries with limited data.
Discussions further highlighted that in countries where there is no sufficient HIES or
LSMS data, Bank staff become more opportunistic in using other sources of data and
try to do quicker assessments on the ground.

The Bank needs to have long-term investments in data collection and analytical
work, including building client country capacity. Most of the participants agreed
that the Bank has a comparative advantage and client-country demand to do
capacity building work. Capacity building work benefits the Bank in the long run
because it ensures the systematic collection of higher quality data and greater
supervision over data collection. The discussions also highlighted that in certain
cases, the Bank engages in one-off deals to collect HIES data in low-income countries
or uses limited engagement through trust funds for capacity building. Both
strategies may not be sustainable if there is no long-term planning. Some
participants also highlighted different types of challenges the Bank faces in countries
while helping build capacity. According to the participants, in low-income countries
and in the Sub-Saharan Africa Region, particularly, an influx of donors compete for
governments’ attention and in some cases have competing agendas. In those
situations the Bank could be a smaller player and may either duplicate efforts in
building data capacity within the client governments or not be able to convince the
governments that higher data collection capacity may have long-term positive
impact. The discussants also highlighted that working on middle-income countries
is also challenging because donors are not as willing to invest in these countries as
they are in low-income countries and often the Bank can’t secure its own trust funds
to do this work.

Discussions with country program coordinators pointed out that building data
collection capacity of the client governments not only helps governments collect
better data, but also ensures greater country ownership and consideration of country
context.

In addition to capacity building work, poverty assessment leads and country
economists pointed out that there is a need for additional budget and long-term
investments in the data and diagnostic work. Participants highlighted the current
tension between the Bank’s “belt-tightening” and staffing policies, and its need to
produce more data and poverty analytics to better understand the root causes of
poverty and to achieve the Bank’s new twin goals. Some of the participants
highlighted that the Bank’s budget and organizational structure does not support
having a cadre of well-trained staff who work continuously on data collection and


                                                                                      229

data harmonization as well as retaining highly specialized poverty economists on
open-ended contracts. In all of the discussions with country economists and poverty
assessment leads, and in one of the focus groups with the CPS leads, staff
highlighted that data-related work is mainly done by short-term consultants who
work on an ad-hoc basis. Because of this, available data are not harmonized, and,
often times, is not comparable for the purposes of proper analysis.

It is important to consider political economy around the collection and sharing of
poverty data. In general, participants indicated that the Bank’s access to data in its
client countries is improving. At the same time, the discussions highlighted a highly
sensitive political nature of poverty data in the countries that participants have
worked in. Based on this experience, the discussions also stressed the importance for
the Bank to establish trustworthy and long-term relationships with client
governments to collect the needed data. The CPS and CAS leads stressed the
importance of building relationships with client governments as a building block for
obtaining poverty-related data after they are collected.

Several discussion groups pointed to the Bank’s important role in making data
available to all interested parties in the client countries. Some of the staff working on
the fragile and conflict-affected countries noted that client governments share data
with the Bank that have not been released publicly or shared with others. Thus, the
Bank has a critical role to play in making such data transparent and available.

The Bank needs to make better use of other sources of data and consider changing
its data sources to have a more comprehensive picture of its impact and
engagements. Most of the country economists and poverty assessment leads, along
with some CPS leads, mentioned that relying only on LSMS and HIES data is not
sufficient to understand the impact of the Bank’s work on poverty, and the Bank
needs to rethink its data needs and investments. Participants mentioned that there is
a need for collection of data on the impact of Bank’s and other donors’ projects on
poverty. Discussions highlighted that HIES and LSMS data are very useful in
creating poverty profiles but are not dense and multidimensional as they focus only
on income-based dimensions and do not cover the large number of issues important
to poverty work. Collecting detailed and multidimensional data will help poverty
specialists respond to specific questions from country directors and country
management units (CMUs) on policy choices. For instance, some poverty assessment
leads mentioned that they are being asked to add language on shared prosperity to
all documents and strategies because it is the new trend in the Bank, but there is not
enough data to do so.

                                   KEY FINDINGS FROM THE FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS WITH STAFF
The issue of relating and harmonizing various datasets reverberated through all of
the discussions and was pointed out as an imperative going forward. As a few of the
participants pointed out, including some of the CPS and CAS leads, the Bank needs
to ensure that the “various datasets talk to each other.” Some participants
highlighted that harmonization and centralization of data will require better
collection and use of the project level data, and could accordingly shed light on the
impact of the Bank’s interventions on the ground.

Additionally, one of the CPS leads groups and one of the poverty assessment leads
groups highlighted the urgent need for the Bank to strengthen its data availability at
the subnational level, where government capacity is usually weaker and data are
much scarcer. The discussions highlighted that since the Bank aims to work on
eliminating extreme poverty, it needs to better understand the underlying causes of
poverty and the impact of its interventions at the subnational level.


Perceptions on the Quality of and Constraints to Analytical Work on Poverty
In general, the participants agreed that the Bank’s work on data quality and poverty
analytics has significantly improved in the past 10 years, particularly since it created
a centrally located team of poverty experts. Some of the discussions with CAS and
CPS leads pointed out that multidimensional analysis of issues, including the use of
both quantitative and qualitative tools, helped create better pictures of poverty in
their countries. Furthermore, the Bank has created useful analytical tools, such as
poverty maps, incidence analysis, and STATCAP that create more opportunities for
working with governments on capacity building and data collection because these
tools provide mutually beneficial services.

The overall feedback was that the quality of the analysis in poverty assessments
is usually strong but often does not provide specific policy recommendations. The
focus groups with the poverty assessment leads and country economists highlighted
that poverty assessments are not designed to provide specific policy
recommendations, but rather they serve as background information and analytical
tools. Some of them pointed that poverty data currently collected by the Bank do not
lend themselves for being used for policy recommendations in diagnostic work. ), .
Poverty assessment leads felt that they lack time and cross-sectoral collaboration to
deliver comprehensive products.

Poverty diagnostic work needs better continuity through long term planning and
budgeting. Poverty assessment leads and country economists mentioned that
poverty diagnostic work deserves greater continuity. Currently incentives to be a

APPENDIX D
KEY FINDINGS FROM THE FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS WITH STAFF
poverty economist are not high because staff contracts have limited terms (two to
three years), and internal recognition of the work is insufficient. Thus, the Bank does
not have enough well-trained staff with extensive backgrounds in poverty work.
Furthermore, some of the poverty assessment, CAS, and CPS leads mentioned that
poverty assessments and knowledge work heavily depend on the availability of
trust funds, particularly in middle-income countries where governments are more
selective about Bank engagement. This sentiment was broadly shared by the staff
working on IBRD countries and countries with rich data.

As a positive example, poverty assessment leads and country economists noted the
benefits of adopting a programmatic approach to poverty work more widely. In four
groups with poverty assessment leads and country economists, participants
underscored that more systematic poverty assessments and updates leading to the
production of shorter and more regular notes have more potential of being used
both by the clients and the country teams. For example, a large poverty assessment
right before the CPS process starts may not have an impact on it as much as regular
poverty updates submitted to the country team. The programmatic approach also
allows TTLs to secure funds and to plan better for the dissemination of poverty
work. The participants further highlighted that the dissemination of poverty work is
usually neglected.

The Bank needs to create more opportunities and incentives for staff to
disseminate the findings of poverty diagnostics. Participants pointed out that the
Bank does not do enough to disseminate the findings of its poverty work internally
and even more so in the client countries. Poverty assessment leads also pointed out
that the Bank’s communications team (External and Corporate Relations) does not
provide adequate support on how to best package messages from the poverty work
based on the needs and interests of various stakeholders. Some of the
recommendations from the focus group participants included building in time and
sufficient budget into poverty analytical work for proper dissemination and
collaboration with the government agencies, which may mean working closely on
capacity development and communication with the Bank’s teams.

Additionally, the participants pointed out that there is more institutional recognition
of and rewards for large poverty assessments than smaller updates and poverty
notes, because the larger products tend to have a “big splash” in the media.
However, it is not evident that larger studies have more impact. Thus, the Bank
needs to reward staff for good work on smaller products that are tailored to country
needs or for informal consultations with clients, where most of the learning may
happen.

                                   KEY FINDINGS FROM THE FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS WITH STAFF

There is a need for better collaboration and coordination among World Bank
networks and sectors. Poverty assessment leads highlighted that the engagement of
sector specialists across networks and countries depends on personal connections
rather than institutional policy and official staff terms of reference. As such, poverty
assessment leads often use their personal connections with experts they know to
provide inputs to chapters in their assessments. Some participants pointed out that
the lack of collaboration between poverty teams and sector staff negatively impacts
the results of the analysis and specificity of recommendations in poverty work. A
positive example of cross-sectoral collaboration cited by some poverty assessment
leads was Poverty and Social Impact Analysis, which according to the discussants,
required formal coordination and involvement across sectors and thus had strong
multisectoral analysis. Two of the focus group discussions with poverty assessment
leads highlighted that it was easier to collaborate with the social protection teams
than with the education and health teams.


Perceptions on How Poverty Data and Analytics Translate into Country Strategies
CMUs and country directors play a critical role in CAS and CPS design processes.
There was a general agreement in all of the focus group discussions that CMUs and
country directors, in particular, play an important role in CAS and CPS processes. 3
Both CPS and poverty assessment leads mentioned that country directors’
preferences and past experiences have a great impact on the CPS, which could be
both a positive learning experience and a drawback in cases when they don’t align
with a specific country context. A division of opinions was observed between the
two focus groups including CAS and CPS leads where one group believed that a
country director’s experience and agenda play a critical role and can change the
trajectory of country engagements whereas the other group believed that a country
director can change the pace and leadership style rather than the strategy direction.
One of the explanations could be the size of the client countries and Bank’s
engagement as well as IBRD/blend countries versus IDA countries.

Poverty diagnostic is not consistently and comprehensively used in CAS and CPS.
The discussions with the poverty assessment leads and country economists revealed
a unanimous sentiment that typically only a small percentage of poverty work is
used in country strategies. They added that usually the time and efforts spent to
prepare the poverty works are not used efficiently as only a small percentage of their
work is used in strategies. They mentioned that poverty experts are usually called
on to provide either descriptive information or support a point with specific data
that the CAS and CPS want to promote. A number of the discussants in the groups
including poverty assessment leads and country economists highlighted that some


                                                                                       233
APPENDIX D
KEY FINDINGS FROM THE FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS WITH STAFF
issues are included in CAS and CPS because they may be current trends in the Bank
and are merely used to “tick the box,” citing gender and shared prosperity as two
examples. At the same time, some of the poverty assessment leads in various groups
acknowledged that country teams may not be ignoring poverty diagnostic on
purpose, but they omit poverty analysis because it is not the “same language” they
are used to, which makes it harder for them to understand a more nuanced
approach to poverty.

The discussions with the CAS and CPS leads confirmed that they view poverty
diagnostics as key to creating poverty profiles but not to providing concrete policy
advice or even being directly used in the CAS and CPS documents. However, these
underpinnings provide the Bank with the ability to have an informed dialogue with
governments and have a strategic vision around its interventions.


Perceptions on How the Bank Creates and Uses Feedback Loops for Designing Its
Country Strategies

The Bank has a limited engagement with stakeholders and needs to adopt a better
approach for creating stronger feedback loops. In all of the focus group discussions
there was a sentiment that although the Bank consults with stakeholders on country
strategies, it is usually more of a formal process. The CPS leads pointed out that it is
better for the Bank to engage in ongoing consultations with the stakeholders rather
than expect to have informed and well-prepared feedback from a smaller group of
stakeholders in the short timeframe during which a CAS or a CPS is prepared. They
added that often one-off and quick consultations raise unnecessary expectations
among stakeholders as they hope to see the reflection of their ideas and advice in the
final document. Additionally, some of the poverty assessment and CAS and CPS
leads pointed out that often the stakeholders don’t know enough about the Bank’s
work on the ground to be able to provide feedback on the strategy or any other
document. It was recommended that the Bank work on raising awareness and
engaging with stakeholders.


1Although  the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States includes six independent countries
and three British Overseas Territories, the focus group discussions covered only the six
independent countries: Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis,
St.Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines since they are World Bank client countries.
2 Forthe purpose of this evaluation, data accessibility is measured by the data available in
Development Economic’s central data platforms (such as PovCalNet) and looks at the
frequency of the Household Income and Expenditure Survey and the Living Standard
Measurement Survey.

to other people in a country management unit, and thus the country partnership strategy
usually looks more like a collection of sector-based pieces than a strategy.

Appendix E. Selection Criteria and Methodology
Used to Assess the Quality of Poverty
Assessments from 20 Countries
The objective of this Poverty Assessment (PA) Quality Review is to determine the
extent to which the PAs (a) provided sufficient background information on available
poverty surveys and data, (b) made good use of available survey and other data to
provide a clear understanding of the extent and drivers of poverty, (c) assessed the
adequacy of the countries’ poverty reduction institutions, programs and funding, (d)
evaluated poverty monitoring and evaluation arrangements, (e) proposed specific
and actionable recommendations for reducing poverty, and (f) influenced the
countries’ poverty reduction strategies and programs, helped build in-country
capacity, and supported joint work and partnerships. The methodology for
evaluating the quality of the twenty PAs is consistent with the World Bank’s 2004
Guidance Note on Poverty Assessments. 1

The review period is 2002–13. The term “poverty assessment (PA)” includes full PAs
as well as poverty notes, updates, reports, and TAs. The term “poverty profile”
refers to estimates of the levels and trends in poverty (a) at the national level and
disaggregated by regions and social groups, and (b) across income, consumption,
and non-income indicators. The term “poverty diagnostics” refers to the
examination of the (a) key drivers of income and non-income poverty at the national
and regional levels and across social groups, (b) determinants of the changes in
poverty incidence over time, including growth and distributional changes, and (c)
obstacles to poverty reduction nationwide, most-affected regions, and across social
groups.


Poverty Assessment Selection
The Review examined the quality of 20 country poverty assessments (PAs), notes,
and poverty reduction technical assistance projects. There is some overlap with the
study’s country case studies (Bangladesh, Egypt, Lao PDR, and Nigeria). Most of the
20 countries have at least one publically available poverty assessment and many
have poverty notes, poverty updates, and technical assistance reports.

The 20 countries were selected to (i) provide equal coverage of each of the Bank’s six
Regions (four countries each for the Africa and East Asia and Pacific Regions, and
three countries each for the remaining four Regions); (ii) countries with greater rates


                                                                                    237

of poverty either as a proportion of the developing world’s poor or as a share of
country population; and (iii) at least one weak data country in each Region. 2These
selection criteria should identify any gaps in the quality of Bank poverty diagnostics
across the Regions—across those countries with the greatest poverty reduction
challenges in absolute or relative terms—and countries with weak data.

The 20 countries, with weak data countries in italics, are:

      •   Africa (4): Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Nigeria
      •   East Asia and Pacific (4): China, Indonesia, Lao People’s Democratic
          Republic, and Papua New Guinea
      •   Europe and Central Asia (3): Armenia, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Moldova
      •   Latin America and the Caribbean (3): Brazil, Colombia, and Guyana
      •   Middle East and North Africa (3): the Arab Republic of Egypt, Iraq, and
          Republic of Yemen
      •   South Asia (3): Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and India

POVERTY HEADCOUNT
Using the most recent year that data were collected, nine countries were selected
based on having the greatest poverty headcounts under an international poverty
line of $ 1.25 per day per person at 2005 purchasing power parity (PPP) prices. These
nine countries are (year of PA completion and the number of poor in millions are in
parentheses): Nigeria (2010, 109), the Democratic Republic of Congo (2006, 49),
Ethiopia (2005, 37), Mozambique (2008, 14), China (2009, 157), Indonesia (2010, 44),
Brazil (2009, 12), India (2010, 394), and Bangladesh (2010, 65). The number of poor in
these nine countries totaled to about 881 million, or nearly three-quarters of the 1.2
billion poor in all developing countries in 2010. One additional country was selected
on the basis of national poverty: Egypt (2009, 17). Not surprisingly, there is a heavy
overlap between the rankings of countries with the greatest poverty headcounts
based on the international and national poverty lines.

POVERTY RATES
An additional six countries (namely, Armenia, Colombia, Iraq, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao
PDR, and the Republic of Yemen) were selected to bring the regional distribution
into balance (that is, two additional countries each for Europe and Central Asia and
the Middle East and North Africa, and one country each for East Asia and Pacific
and Latin America and the Caribbean. These six countries were selected from a
sample of 46 countries with high rates of headcount poverty as reported in the 2008
World Development Report. The 46 countries had headcount poverty rates greater
than 40 percent on the basis of the national poverty line or greater than 20 percent on

the basis of the international poverty line. Of these 46 countries, 15 were eliminated
due to a lack of poverty diagnostics during 2000–2013, and the 11 countries in the
Africa Region were eliminated since 4 countries had been selected on the basis of the
poverty headcount criteria. Of the remaining 20 countries, 6 were selected for the
Review in accordance with those having the greatest number of publically available
poverty diagnostic works. These six countries are Armenia, Colombia, Iraq, Kyrgyz
Republic, and Republic of Yemen.

WEAK DATA
The list of 16 countries selected for the study on the basis of poverty headcount and
poverty rates includes three weak data countries (namely, the Democratic Republic
of Congo, Iraq, and Republic of Yemen) in Africa and the Middle East and North
Africa. In order to cover at least one weak data country in each region, three
additional weak data countries were added: Afghanistan, Guyana, and Papua New
Guinea. They were selected from a list of the weak data countries, and two of these
countries (i.e., Guyana, and Papua New Guinea) had no surveys available in
PovCalNet during 2000–2012. Moldova is included in the list for the Europe and
Central Asia Region.

POVERTY DIAGNOSTIC WORK
Many of the 20 countries selected for the study include a mixture of poverty
assessments, notes, technical assistance, and other poverty diagnostic work. This
amalgam allows for a preliminary assessment of the 2008 trend in Bank poverty
diagnostic work away from full poverty assessments toward poverty notes, updates,
and technical assistance.

QUALITY ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY AND TEMPLATE
The methodology used for the assessment of the quality of the twenty PAs closely
follows the 2004 Guidance Note. 3 The 2004 Guidance Note did specify that the PAs
would be prepared “in close coordination with national institutions, partners and
civil society groups” and would cover three topics: (a) an assessment of the poverty
situation, (b) an analysis of the impact of growth and public actions on poverty, and
(c) the appraisal of poverty monitoring and evaluation systems. Further, a PA was to
include: (a) an analytical synthesis of existing knowledge on these three topics, (b)
an identification of key knowledge gaps with respect to these three topics, and (c)
new analysis that addresses selected gaps or complements existing work. The 2004
Guidance Note also calls for the consideration of qualitative data and
sociological/anthropological studies (see para. 4), the inclusion of specialists in the
relevant sectors on the task team (see para. 26), and the wide dissemination “of
poverty work within the Bank and outside” (see para. 27). Importantly, the 2004

                                                                                       239
APPENDIX E
SELECTION CRITERIA AND METHODOLOGY USED TO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF POVERTY ASSESSMENTS FROM
20 COUNTRIES
Guidance Note states that good-practice PAs aim to inform good pro-poor policy
and that “good technical analysis is a means to this end” (see para. 7), and the need
for strong linkages between the PAs and CASs, lending operations, and nonlending
activities is noted.

Consistent with the World Bank’s 2004 guidance note on poverty assessments, the
systematic review of the quality of the Poverty Assessment follows six criteria and
26 sub-criteria as below:

      •   Surveys and Data. Did the PA provide sufficient background on the:

             ◦   data used to undertake the poverty diagnostics, including the survey
                 type, year, location, and content (income, consumption, education,
                 health, and/or other non-income indicators),
             ◦   survey methodology and whether the data were publically available,
                 and,
             ◦   Institutional arrangements and capacity for the survey design and
                 implementation and, where appropriate or needed, was capacity
                 building planned and/or undertaken?

      •   Poverty Profiles and Diagnostics. Did the PA:

             ◦   identify and provide an analytical synthesis of the poverty statistics
                 and knowledge available from alternative sources,
             ◦   explain the methodology used to determine the PA’s poverty statistics
                 including types of data used, poverty line(s) used, and possible
                 alternative poverty lines,
             ◦   make use of analytical tools developed in recent years such as ADePT,
                 poverty mapping, and micro-simulation,
             ◦   provide estimates of the levels and trends in poverty (i) at the national
                 level and disaggregated by regions and social groups, and (ii) across
                 income, consumption, and non-income indicators,
             ◦   examine extreme poverty,
             ◦   report any participatory assessments of poverty,
             ◦   examine the key drivers of income and non-income poverty at the
                 national and regional levels and across social groups,
             ◦   consider the determinants of the changes in poverty incidence over
                 time, including growth and distributional changes, and,
             ◦   explore the obstacles to poverty reduction nationwide, most-affected
                 regions, and across social groups?

2The Europe and Central Asia Region is an exception. During the period of 2000–12, most
countries in the Region had at least two rounds of household survey data available in
PovCalNet. Turkmenistan did not have surveys during the period of evaluation but it did
not have a poverty assessment after 2001. Armenia, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Moldova
were selected for the review of PAs.
3 The 2004 Guidance Note was intended to provide good practice guidance for the
preparation of PAs. Its requirements were not binding and allowed for considerable
flexibility in the content and focus of the PAs in accordance with country needs and specific
circumstances.

Appendix F. Technical Note on the Methodology
Used in the CASCRR/CPSCRR Review
In order to assess general trends in the poverty focus of the Bank’s country
strategies, this evaluation reviewed a sample of IEG’s Country Partnership Strategy
Completion Report Reviews (CPSCRRs) and Country Assistance Evaluations
(CAEs).


Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report Reviews
A typical CPSCRR is a desk study that discusses the relevance and implementation
of the strategy (including projects and AAA) and assesses the extent to which the
Bank achieved the strategic pillars and objectives within a given Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) period. Based on this assessment, it rates the overall
outcome of each pillar or set of objectives. There are 105 countries that had CPSCRRs
between FY2004–2013. 1 This evaluation examined the 66 countries 2 that had at least
two CPSCRRs during this period. 3

To assess the information from the CPSCRRs, a data base was assembled covering
basic country data, presence of poverty-related pillars and objectives, ratings of
poverty related pillars, and monitoring of poverty related indicators.

A list of CPS pillars and objectives was obtained from the Bank’s Business
Warehouse systems. Poverty-related pillars and objectives were defined as those
that directly focused on “poverty,” “education,” “health,” “social protection,”
“social development,” “agriculture and rural development” and “basic
infrastructure.” To determine which pillars and objectives fell into these broad
categories, the team first conducted a comprehensive word search for key words
and phrases. The list of words used in this search are shown in table F.1. 4 Following
the word search, the team individually reviewed all pillars and objectives that
contained the relevant wording identified by the search to ensure correct
categorization and poverty focus.

CPS indicators are typically designed to measure progress on CPS objectives. To
determine which indicators were poverty-focused, the results indicators of CPSs
(listed both in the CPSs and the Country Partnership Strategy Completion Reports)
were individually reviewed. They were then categorized into the following
groupings: Poverty, school enrollment, school quality, health access, health
outcomes, social transfers, basic infrastructure, and “other.”

a. The use of the term “poor” will lead to a pillar being categorized under the poverty column if the pillar or objective
references increasing the income or the poor, or employment, and so on. This category excludes pillars that address “pro-
poor growth” as this falls under Social Development.
b. Excludes tertiary education.
c. Many pillars and objectives with the term “social service” were categorized as being under the Social Development
category. References to vulnerability to environmental damage, health epidemics, or violence have been excluded from this
category. Vulnerability to epidemics is captured under the Health Category, and vulnerability to violence will be captured in
the Social Development Category.
d. Delivery of “unspecified services” and access to services were included under Social Development, this includes “urban
services” and “public services.” This does not include specified services such as health or education services, which are
captured under other categories. The search term “social” was used to identify objectives and pillars about cohesion and
areas of social development not covered by other search terms. Objectives and pillars identified from a search of “poor” that
were relevant to equity or access were included in this category.
e. Energy efficiency, water management and sustainability were not included in the Infrastructure category. Access to water
was included in this category.


Country Assistance Evaluations
Country Assistance Evaluations (CAEs) provide detailed discussions of the Bank’s
engagement in a country over a broad time period, often covering multiple Country
Assistance Strategies (CASs). The CAEs are based on field visits and include input
from government and other stakeholders. Fourteen CAEs were reviewed for this
evaluation. 5 The selected CAEs covered periods ranging from 7 to 15 years since
2003, all of which included at least 2 years of engagement post 2005. Accordingly,
the CAEs aggregated Bank objectives over two or more CPS periods and rated


                                                                                                                         245

outcomes during the total period, although in some cases they provided separate
ratings for the different periods they covered. The fourteen available CAEs were
reviewed primarily to identify examples of successful and unsuccessful results,
which partly reflect implementation.


1This includes the six OECS countries (Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, Dominica,
Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines), who have a joint CAS and
CASCRR. CPSCRRs also may cover final Country Assistance Strategies (CAS), CAS drafts,
as well as Interim Strategy Notes (ISNs).
2 CASCRRs/CPSCRRs      from the following countries were reviewed: Albania, Argentina,
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Benin, Bhutan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil,
Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Djibouti, Ethiopia,
Gabon, The Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Jamaica,
Jordan, Kenya, Kyrgyz Republic, Lesotho, Macedonia (former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia), Malawi, Mauritania, Mexico, Moldova, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique,

Russian Federation, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe, Senegal, Serbia, South Africa, Sri
Lanka, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Vietnam,
Republic of Yemen, Zambia.
3 Because of variation in the timing of CPSs and CPSCRRs for different countries, period 1
and period 2 CPSCRRs are not divided by year, only the sequence within a given country.
As a result, the years covered by a CPSCRR in period 1 in a given country may overlap with
the years covered by a CPSCRR in period 2 in another country.
4 Various spellings and permutations of these words were searched for using STATA. All
terms in the data set were put into lower case letters to facilitate searches, and all hyphens
were removed. Some objectives and pillars fit under multiple sections are counted as such.
5 The CAEs covered include: Afghanistan Country Program Evaluation, 2002–11: An
Evaluation of the World Bank Group Program (2012); Bangladesh Country Assistance
Evaluation (2009); Cambodia: An IEG Country Assistance Evaluation 1999–2006 (2010);

Appendix G. A Technical Note on Calculating
the Proxy for Poverty Focus in Bank Lending
In order to broadly gauge the poverty focus of the Bank’s interventions, the
information from the theme and sector code system was used to calculate a
weighted ratio of the Bank’s lending, Development Policy Operations and
Investment Lending, respectively, that goes to areas that are more directly related to
poverty reduction as a share of total lending.

The theme and sector code system, which was initiated in July 2002, provides the
basis for analyzing and reporting on the content of Bank activities (e.g., Bank budget
allocations to strategic goals and priority sectors). Theme and sector codes are
assigned to policy lending, investment lending, economic and sector work, technical
assistance, research services, client training, and other activities that directly serve
the Bank’s external clients. 1 Activities that serve the Bank's internal needs—e.g.,
quality assurance, country assistance strategies, sector strategy papers, knowledge
products, training of Bank staff—are not coded for sectors and themes.

Sector codes relate more to the part of a country’s economy that is targeted or
impacted by a Bank operation (e.g. Education, Energy & Mining, or Transportation,
etc.) whereas theme codes have more to do with the strategic end-goal and
development objectives of the Bank (e.g. HIV/AIDS, Rural Markets, Pollution
Management and Environmental Health, etc.). Themes refer to the goals/objectives
of Bank activities; they are also consistent with the Bank's corporate advocacy and
global public goods priorities and are used to capture Bank support to the
Millennium Development Goals. Themes are not methods/instruments of delivery
or ways of doing business, nor are they reflections of the structure of networks in the
Bank. They may also be somewhat overlapping (i.e., not mutually exclusive). 2

Out of the 82 total theme codes available, the 31 themes in italics in table G.1 were
chosen because they relate to the poorest or most vulnerable populations and, thus,
serve as a proxy for “poverty-focus” in Bank lending.

Calculating the thematically weighted commitment amount (table G.2) for each
project entailed the following steps: first, the list of all Bank projects was
downloaded into Excel from the Bank’s Business Warehouse (BW) Operations
database using Project Theme Detail Report 2.c.2.1, which provides thematic coding
for all Bank operations of all instrument types and all product lines. Second, filters
(in BW) were used to retrieve only those projects that were approved between
FY2000–12 and that have any of the 31 “poverty-focused” theme codes listed for
themes 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Next, the “# Projects” variable in BW was modified under the
macros function in BEx Analyzer/Excel to automatically calculate the “poverty
themed” weight for each project; that is, for every project that is comprised of any of
the 31 “poverty-focused” themes, the theme percentages for those poverty themes is
added up to get one total “poverty theme” percentage. This number represents the
total share of that project that was designated by the Bank’s project team to go towards those
“poverty focused” themes. This percentage was then multiplied by the Commitment
Amount variable to yield the “Poverty-Weighted Commitment Amount (PWCA).”
Finally, all of the PWCAs were aggregated across all projects and analyzed
according to their various product lines and instrument types (e.g. International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development [IBRD], International Development
Association [IDA], Adjustment, Investment) to yield the total amount of money
committed to any of the 31 poverty-focused themes in any given year. The example
below shows the calculations for a generic project. Here, the PWCA for Project A is
derived by: PWCA= [(Theme 1 + Theme 4 + Theme 5) x Commitment Amount] =
[(.2+.25+.05) x 25.2] = 12.6. For Project B, the calculation would be: PWCA= [(Theme
2 + Theme 4) x Commitment Amount] = [(.2+.15) x 73.2] = 25.62.

Appendix H. Poverty Data Availability in Micro
Data Catalog and Cost Estimation of Statistical
System Improvement
Micro Data Catalog
The International Household Survey Network (IHSN) provides a public catalog with
listings for 4,224 surveys and censuses conducted in low- and middle-income
countries, along with metadata, survey questionnaires, manuals, and reports, if
available. Roughly 1,200 are identified as containing income, consumption, or other
poverty-related data. Data cannot be obtained directly from the IHSN catalog, but a
third of the micro data sets are available from external data repositories.

Through the Central Micro data catalog 1 the World Bank provides a public listing of
1,762 surveys of various types along with their metadata and related documentation
including 60 LSMS surveys. Micro data can be downloaded directly from the source,
while others require approval before data are made available.

A larger micro data catalog is maintained for internal use by World Bank staff. It
contains more than 5,000 surveys, of which somewhat less than a thousand contain
household income or expenditure data. This catalog includes the harmonized
datasets used for much of the World Bank’s poverty work. However restrictive
covenants placed on many of underlying surveys by the owners or producers as a
condition of their transfer to the World Bank limit their use even within the World
Bank. Because the World Bank lacks a uniform policy on data acquisition, the terms
of use for data sets acquired from countries or other producers are often ad hoc and
poorly documented.

There are also issues related to sharing data inside the Bank. Internal sector silos
hinder data harmonization and dissemination. Within the Bank, data appear to have
not been adequately shared among staff working on poverty. The lack of a
consistent flow of poverty data among the Bank networks and regions was cited as a
key internal constraint to obtaining data beyond the external constraints posed by
countries. In the Staff Survey, Focus Groups, and the case studies, Bank staff
frequently noted that data needed to be shared better across the regions and the
networks. Although about half (49 percent) of the internal survey respondents
believed that Bank staff “almost always” or “frequently” shared poverty data,




                                                                                  253
APPENDIX H
POVERTY DATA AVAILABILITY IN MICRO DATA CATALOG AND COST ESTIMATION OF STATISTICAL SYSTEM
IMPROVEMENT
slightly less than half (43 percent) maintained that this occurred only “sometimes,”
occasionally,” or “hardly ever.”

The creation of the Global Poverty Working Group, regional data platforms, and the
internal Micro data catalog containing harmonized datasets from different sources
are all efforts to address some of these problems. However work on the harmonized
databases, important for conducting cross-country studies and monitoring progress
over time, remains fragmented, undertaken by different units at different times and
without sufficient resources committed to ensure continuity. 2 Bank-sponsored
surveys are typically planned by local Bank teams with national counterparts.
Although the teams may receive advice from the LSMS unit or other experienced
staff, decisions about sampling, content of the questionnaire, and processing of the
data may be made without adequate consideration of comparability or adherence to
recommended standards. Likewise the terms under which data can be used and
disseminated are often idiosyncratic, failing to take into account the Bank’s and
general public interest in open access. Surveys obtained by World Bank staff for use
in their work, may or may not be made available to other units or included in the
Micro data Catalog. And because of the lack of common standards, considerable
effort must be expended on ex post harmonization of data sets, which may still fail
to resolve inconsistencies.


The Cost of Improving Statistical System
The World Bank and other partners have attempted to estimate the shortfall in
funding needed to upgrade statistical systems in developing countries. In 2004 the
consensus estimate included in the Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics (MAPS) was
$140–$160 million per year in additional resources for low-income and lower-
middle-income countries. The MAPS cost estimates and the work program helped
donors coordinate their support and encouraged partnerships for statistical capacity
building.

Although MAPS achieved its objectives and stimulated additional investments in
statistics, it did not address all of the shortcomings in national statistical systems.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently estimated the cost of scaling up
investment in global civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) for 73 countries to
be on the order of $3.82 billion over 10 years (WHO 2012). Taking into account
domestic contributions and recurrent expenditures, they conclude that an additional
$1.99 billion is required over a 10–year period, or an average of $199 million per
year; $40 million more than the Marrakech estimate per annum, for just one
important statistical tool.

     POVERTY DATA AVAILABILITY IN MICRO DATA CATALOG AND COST ESTIMATION OF STATISTICAL SYSTEM
                                                                                  IMPROVEMENT
Morten Jerven at Simon Fraser University (2014) has estimated that using survey
techniques for collecting data for the eight MDGs along with a population census
would cost $1.08 billion per annum, assuming that the majority of MDG
development data are survey-based and that poverty analysis requires annual
collection of survey data (Jerven 2014). Demombynes and Sandefur (2014) have
refined Jerven’s estimate by identifying the funding gap taking into account
preexisting spending on household surveys. Focusing on countries below $2,000 per
capita GDP in PPP dollars yields a total cost to international donors of closing all
remaining survey gaps of less than $300 million per annum, which they point out is
a fairly small share of global aid budgets.

The differences between these estimates demonstrate, as much as anything, the lack
of consensus on the statistical tools needed to monitor a comprehensive
development agenda. There are efforts underway with involvement from the World
Bank to estimate the full cost and incremental investment needed to monitor the
post-2015 agenda using broadly agreed assumptions and estimation methods. These
estimates will be presented to the Financing for Development Conference scheduled
for July 2015.
