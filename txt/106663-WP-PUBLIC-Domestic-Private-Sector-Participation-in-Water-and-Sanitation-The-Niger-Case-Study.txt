be a solution to the single private operator approach.
These two aspects should be taken into consideration by
policy makers.

The options for the Government of Niger for the transfer
of 19 RWSSs to the assets-holding company were to:
  (i)	 Include these 19 RWSS in the lease perimeter
         operated by SEEN.
  (ii)	 Launch an open tender process that calls for the
         participation of SEEN and other domestic private
         enterprises.
  (iii)	 Launch an open tender process that calls for the
         participation of domestic private enterprises other
         than SEEN.

The Government selected the last option. The idea is to
have SPEN and SEEN contribute to the capacity building
training program of domestic private operators. The World
Bank Global Water Practice is supporting this process in
relation with other sectors (education and private sectors)
through follow-up programmatic technical assistance that                         Water fetching from a standpostin rural Niger.
