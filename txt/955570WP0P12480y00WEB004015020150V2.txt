This report is the culmination of a cross-African countries analytical and empirical
study commissioned by the World Bank, which set out to improve the understand-
ing of the characteristics and environmental, economic, and social performances
of small-scale fisheries in Africa. It applies a common evaluation tool, called Fish-
ery Performance Indicators (FPIs), which evaluates the ecological, social, and
economic performances of a particular fishery (see details in Anderson et al.,
forthcoming).

Executive Summary

Small-scale fisheries (SSFs) in developing countries are extremely impor-
tant for local communities, as they are the main source of food, liveli-
hood, and income. Small-scale fishing communities are vulnerable to
overexploitation of fish stocks owing to insecure access and use rights to
the fishery resources and limited alternative livelihood. This is most often
the group in extreme poverty and also one that is frequently overlooked. To cast some
light on the status of SSFs in Africa and their relationship with the existing institutional
and governance arrangements, the World Bank (former Africa Region Environment
and Natural Resources Management unit together with PROFISH) and the New Part-
nership for Africa Development (NEPAD) commissioned a series of case studies across
Africa in 2013. The fisheries case studies range from inland to marine, single to multi-
species, East to West African, and from artisanal to semi-industrial fisheries.

A template was developed to provide structure and guidance for these
case studies. Each case study involved the following elements: (a) characterization of
SSFs (at both the national and case-study levels); (b) legal and institutional framework
for case-study countries and communities; and (c) social, economic, and environmen-
tal performance of case-study fisheries. This synthesis report focuses on element (c)
by using the standard Fishery Performance Indicators (FPIs) to do the comparison
analysis.

Methodology
The FPIs are a new set of evaluation tools to measure the triple bottom
line sustainability of a particular fishery recognizing that the sustainabil-
ity of fish stocks, fishing industries, and fishing communities are interre-
lated and that none can provide benefits without the others. The FPIs consist
of two categories: output indicators that measure the wealth generation status of a fish-
ery and input factors that enable or contribute to the success or failure of fishery wealth
generation. All of the indicators are coded on a five-point scale, with the bins chosen to
reflect the quintiles of performance on the global metric. FPIs are designed to be easy
to collect. They are quantifiable, understandable, accurate, and feasible.

Chapter One
Introduction

Many of the world’s fishery resources—both in marine and inland
waters—are in a precarious state despite the fact that the international
fish trade broke records of more than US$136 billion in 2014 (FAO 2014).
Fisheries generate livelihoods for more than 100 million people and represent a vital
source of nutrition (FAO 2014); however, it is estimated that around 5.8 million fisher-
man exist in poverty, often in rural coastal communities in Africa and Asia (FAO 2014).
Overfishing and overcapacity characterize numerous fisheries around the world,
resulting in lower potential for fisheries to contribute to sustainable economic, social,
and environmental development in the way the sector could.

Small-scale fisheries are particularly vulnerable because of insecure
access and use rights with respect to the resources upon which communi-
ties depend for income, livelihoods, and food. In many developing countries,
legitimizing and bolstering traditional rights over SSFs could be part of the formula
for improving the governance of fisheries (World Bank and FAO 2009). Custom-
ary practices for resource allocation and benefit sharing within coastal communities
engaged in fishing have been frequently undermined by weak access rights leading to
destructive competition with fellow fisherman and with other higher-profile economic
sector developments such as tourism, aquaculture, energy, mining, industry, and infra-
structure.

Improving governance of tenure, taking these aspects and underlying
causes into consideration, is therefore a matter of urgency for fisheries
to continue providing contributions to growth, nutrition, and livelihoods
in developing countries. To address this issue, during 2013 the World Bank (for-
merly Africa Region Environment and Natural Resource Management unit together
with PROFISH) and the NEPAD commissioned a series of case studies throughout
Africa. The studies set out to identify the relationship between the performance of
SSF and the existing institutional and governance arrangements that underpin these.

FPI OUTPUT SCORES—MEASURING
WEALTH

The main output components of the FPIs include stock performance, harvest sector
performance, and postharvest sector performance. Each output component is bro-
ken into several key dimensions, each of which is a composite of several individual
measures (see appendix A for details). This chapter demonstrates the results as FPI
output scores between the African SSFs and the other comparison groups. Figure
2.1 compares the average score on each output dimension across the recent African
SSFs, the entire FPI database, and the subset of FPI fisheries that are managed using
harvest rights (quotas). It shows clearly that there are large performance gaps in the
recent African SSFs for fish stock healthy status, risk resilience, market performance,
and postharvest industry performance. The case-study fisheries also lag behind in
harvest performance, harvest asset performance, and postharvest asset performance.
They appear to slightly outperform the rest of the database in wealth accumulating
to processing workers, which might be attributed to the fact that the majority of these
processing workers in African SSFs come from the local community, whereas they are
often outsiders in those more advanced fisheries in developed countries. Figure 2.1 also
demonstrates that harvest rights tend to improve the wealth-generating performance
of the fishery, particularly along the dimensions of environmental performance and
harvest performance. The analysis in this chapter focuses on the role played by indi-
vidual ecological, economic, and community measures and demonstrates how the FPI
scores can yield a framework for rigorous econometric comparison of fishery wealth
generation.

Table 2.1 depicts the average score for all case-study fisheries and some relevant com-
parison groups across each of the three output sustainability categories. It appears
that the gap between the recent African SSF performances is the largest in ecology
and economics and the smallest in community indicators. The case-study fisheries
appear to be underperforming in most dimensions even relative to other African
fisheries. This could be because the case-study communities were targeted based on
their poor ecological status and the majority of the fisheries surveyed are artisanal

CHAPTER THREE
FPI INPUT SCORES—ENABLING
WEALTH CREATION

The main input components of the FPIs include macroenvironment, property rights,
comanagement, management, and postharvest. Each input component is broken into
several key dimensions, each of which is a composite of one to six individual measures
(see appendix B for details). Importantly, the structure of the FPIs does not presup-
pose whether, how, or how much these inputs support wealth creation. The FPI scores
merely facilitate data analysis to determine the empirical causal or correlative rela-
tionships between these inputs and the different dimensions of wealth creation. This
chapter demonstrates the results of FPI input scores between the African SSFs and the
other comparison groups.

Figure 3.1 compares the average score on each input dimension across the recent
African SSFs, the entire FPI database, and the subset of FPI fisheries that is managed
using harvest rights (quotas). It shows that there are large performance gaps
in the recent African SSFs with regard to macroindicators such as general
environmental performance (measured by the country’s Environmental
Performance Index); governance (World Bank indicators); and economic
conditions (measured by Index of Economic Freedom and gross domestic
product). The case-study fisheries also lag behind in general environmental perfor-
mance, governance, economic conditions, access rights, harvest rights, data manage-
ment, and infrastructure.

All of the recent African case-study fisheries are relatively data poor. The average
African SSF has available data based only on small samples with much missing data
­
that impedes making the inferences needed for management. Even when data on land-
ings exist, they are used only inconsistently or irregularly, as shown in the average
data analysis score. In Senegal, for example, they score very high in the collection of
ex-vessel price and quantity data but these data are rarely analyzed to inform policy
decisions and may be collected by federal agents without being distributed to local
authorities. Despite the proliferation of cellular phones, price and quantity information
are often inaccurate, delayed, or available to only a few and very little ­historical data

CHAPTER FOUR
HYPOTHESIS TEST

The FPIs are designed to allow researchers to test for causal relation-
ships between the wealth-enabling inputs and the outputs that represent
wealth accumulation, as well as other hypotheses related to the ecological,
social, and economic dimensions of fisheries. This report does two prelimi-
nary graphic tests of correlation to show what can be done by using the FPI database.

Hypothesis (i): Increased rights over management of the resource lead to improved ecological, economic,
and community outcomes (in both harvest and postharvest sectors).

Figure 4.1 tests for correlations between access rights and the attainment of the triple
bottom line. The variable on the horizontal axis is the average of all six access rights
input measures (existence, transferability, security, durability, flexibility, and exclusiv-
ity); therefore, increases along this access can be interpreted as a strengthening in the
exclusivity and security of an individual’s rights and not an extension of access rights
to a greater number of individuals. The variable on the vertical axis changes in each
graph, but it is the average of all output measures that either deal with ecology, eco-
nomics, or community. Access rights refer to a set of enforced regulations that give
harvesters the right to determine who can access the resource. In the recent African
SSF case studies, all of the fisheries had official organizations (predominantly at the
local landing site level) that were granted the authority to determine who could fish
or land from their beaches. However, as was previously discussed, none of the fisher-
ies made a strong attempt to limit the amount of harvesters who were allowed to fish.
When permits existed, there was no cap on the number allocated and the de facto
right to open access trumped any effort to limit participants. In this sense, none of our
fisheries are limited-access fisheries in the way that the term is used by economists.
(The “All limited access” data point does not include the case-study fisheries. It aver-
ages across the scores of fisheries in which there is an enforced limit on the amount of
vessels allowed to access.)

Increasing the exclusivity of access rights leads to improved ecosystem
health and less overfishing. The Liberian fisheries in particular are outliers
                                                                             ecological

HIGHLIGHTS OF KEY FINDINGS
AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The findings in the preceding sections lead us to the following conclusions.
   (a)  The FPIs are a useful tool for data-poor fisheries because they
        provide cost-effective yet holistic estimates of the existing state of
        fisheries management by efficiently relying on the input of local ex-
        perts. Fisheries can be scored by using the FPI framework in only one to two
        weeks, yet the information gathered provides insight into economic and social
        variables that are traditionally ignored in fisheries management benchmarking.
        Collection of quantitative FPI data led to a high degree of variation in scores
        across the nine individual case-study fisheries, which allowed us to make inter-
        esting comparisons across management regimes. There was not a correspond-
        ingly high variation in the confidence scores of our experts, which leads us to
        conclude that these scores are reasonably accurate and the specificity of the
        scoring bins used by the FPIs permits us to compare scores across both devel-
        oped and developing countries. The FPIs are not a substitute for more detailed
        household and firm-level data that could be used to drill down and uncover
        the causal relationships that underlie some of the more interesting trends we
        observed, such as whether processor-driven market integration leads to higher
        economic scores or more exclusive access rights contribute to ecological and
        economic sustainability but not to community welfare. However, the FPIs are a
        necessary starting point from which to observe more macrolevel trends and lend
        insight into the avenues that will be more fruitful for more detailed survey work.
   (b)  The variability of fishery rankings when done according to ecology, econom-
        ics, or community FPI output scores leads us to conclude that ecological
        variables are not suitable proxies for economic welfare or commu-
        nity well-being. Fisheries that score high in environmental sustainability do
        not necessarily contribute livelihoods and economic growth to the communi-
        ties where they are based. Economic and social variables cannot be omitted
