“…Very importantly, with the Philippines needing to urgently put itself on track to meet its target for maternal mortality, the government
has intensified its commitment to improving the CRVS system.  It simply must know who, where and why mothers are dying and children
are being born.” (Source: Philippines 2014 “Strengthening Civil Registration and Vital Statistics: A Case Study of the Philippines”)

“For the future, Mozambique intends to continue expanding the coverage of CRVS.  Previous positive interventions in the sector are to be
replicated throughout the country.  Regional and international experiences that showed best results are to be adapted to local circum-
stances.  And a greater commitment to ICT will enable the country to create more flexible, reliable and efficient CRVS.”
(Source: Mozambique 2014 ‘The Vital Statistics Journey: A Case Study of the Mozambique’)

“As a country implementing a civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) system for the first time, the focus of action in the next few
years is preparing the groundwork for full implementation. … careful planning, designing and testing are being implemented in prepara-
tion for developing a national system” (Source: Ethiopia 2014 “Establishing Vital Events Registration and strengthening: A Case Study of

Box 3  E-Governance and birth registration in Cape Verde




Although Cape Verde ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (dated 1989) in 1991, the country was still
witnessing very low birth registration rates, with large variations among municipalities. As a result of a project aimed at modernizing
the public administration, Cape Verde computerized the entire CRVS system during 2007 and 2008. This allowed not only biometric
enrollment and massive registration of births, especially in the remote, previously inaccessible areas of the country, but also enabled the
issuance of birth certificates online.

Some government agencies were concerned that the rapid pace of technological change might compromise the legal integrity of the
existing system. Unanswered questions about privacy issues and the danger of security breaches persisted. The general public has
also shown some concern about confidentiality issues. Major capacity-building and communication efforts were necessary to create an
enabling environment to allow the system to grow as quickly and comprehensively as it has. Indeed, the consensus reached and the
political support gained facilitated data collection and sharing among agencies. The results are encouraging: the national rates of unreg-
istered children (aged 0 to 4 years) went from 39 percent in 2009 to 25 percent in 2010, and reached less than 10 percent in 2013.
This is the highest birth registration level in West and Central Africa. The government is aiming for 100 percent birth registration in the
years to come. For this purpose, mobile stations and enrollment kits have been installed in all major hospitals in the country and qualified
personnel are continuously being trained. In addition, the government is adapting its legal and interoperability frameworks to allow for the
development of new services and applications enabled by a well-functioning CRVS system, such as e-voting and e-taxes, increasing the
overall value proposition of this public service.

     Box 4  Traditional leaders and birth registration in Senegal




     In Senegal, village chiefs are empowered by the State to register births. The Orange mobile birth registration solution was designed to
     make the most of existing methodologies and infrastructure, and the application was therefore tailored to meet the specific needs of
     village chiefs.

     •	 The solution chosen by Orange was a Java applet. This was considered to be more appropriate than an SMS-based solution because
        it offered more wide-ranging customization options and a better overall customer experience.
     •	 Mobile phones equipped with specific Java software have been distributed to 30 village chiefs. The chiefs are responsible for captur-
        ing information regarding births in their villages and transferring that information to the Senegal State Registrar. The registration office
        is equipped with a mobile phone in order to receive the information sent by village chiefs.
     •	 Once received, this information is checked and the birth is registered both physically in the registry and electronically in a database. A
        registration number is then sent back to the village chief, who communicates it to the parents.
     •	 This registration number means that the child has been registered. Using this number, parents can collect a birth certificate from the
        registration office at any time, provided they pay the corresponding fee.

     Results became evident very quickly because of the inherent inefficiency of the legacy paper-based system. Nevertheless, some areas of
     improvement have been identified, such as interoperability. Having subscribers of any and all networks able to use the same, interopera-
     ble solution would allow for the creation of a unified database of birth registration events.

Box 5  Online and offline mobile birth registration in Uganda




Before the mobile birth registration solution was launched in Uganda, it could take several months for a child to be registered. As the
whole procedure was paper-based, there were several barriers to effective child birth registration:

•	   Distance and lack of communication channels
•	   Lack of awareness of the need to register births
•	   Administrative delays and process inefficiency
•	   Cost and poverty obstacles

In consultation with the development community, Uganda Telecom, the country’s major mobile operator, decided to become involved in
the development of the Ugandan nation and its people by rolling out a mobile birth registration pilot. As part of the pilot, hospitals were
equipped with a 3G connection, whenever necessary, to access a web-based application to register births. The registration agents (i.e.
village chiefs, regional administrators) were given SIM cards mapped to their names, so as to be able to send USSD codes to register
births occurring locally. Uganda Telecom used USSD codes on mobile phones and a web-based application on computers. USSD may be
considered less user-friendly than a customized Java applet, but has the advantage of being able to work on any telephone. Frequent
communication was set with the Registration Office, which validated each birth and sent a certificate to be printed in the hospital or the
district office for distribution to the family.

From a technical perspective, the solution is best adapted to developing countries’ context. For instance, in areas where the Internet
connection is unreliable, Uganda Telecom devised an offline version that allows registrars to register births in an area where there is no
Internet and synchronize with the online version later. This offline solution is currently in the final stages of being developed and tested.

The results obtained have been very encouraging. Today, the company’s birth registration initiative is seen as a key means of demon-
strating that mobile operators could contribute to development and the welfare of citizens. The next step is to extend the service to other
mobile networks by encouraging the interoperability of systems. UNICEF is currently developing a USSD menu for MTN, another mobile
network operator, which will send birth notification information to the Mobile VRS server.

     Box 6  Modernizing the civil register in Albania




     The year 2008 was a milestone for the Albanian national civil register project. By the end of that year, all residents were entered into a
     digital national register with an online connection to all civil status offices throughout the country. It is used as the basis for providing
     voters lists, biometric passports, and producing national identification cards. A subsequent project focused on resolving two remaining
     problems—scanning the archive register books and transferring the data from the National Civil Register to third parties.

     By the end of 2010, the scanning project had completed the digitization of the register books and created an important archive that was
     accessible through all civil status offices across the country. The information is also accessible from the register to the national Institute of
     Statistics for producing register-based statistical information. One challenge involved the purchase of software; since this turned out not
     to be open source, there were limitations on how much the government and the Institute of Statistics could maintain and further develop
     it. Evidently, wider consultations at an earlier stage might have resolved this problem. Another lesson learned was the importance of
     involving more institutions from countries that have developed and maintained their own population registers so that they could provide
     advice based directly on their own experiences.

Box 7  Community health workers and birth registration in Bangladesh




The aim is to register all pregnant women and their children in a unified electronic system. The core technological aspect of this is the
use of mobile devices for such registration at the community level by household health workers. The project uses two existing codes for
the National Identification (NID) and Birth Registration Number (BRN). If these are not available, a temporary tracking number is generat-
ed, thus imparting a degree of flexibility into the system.

In 2004, the Government of Bangladesh enacted a new Birth and Death Registration Act. The Act and subsequent amendments and rules
state that presentation of a birth certificate is mandatory in order to open a bank account, export and import licenses, connect to utilities,
register a car, and obtain a national identification card. To obtain a birth certificate, within 45 days of birth, parents must provide proof of
birth. However, 80 percent of live births occur outside of hospital facilities. Community EPI workers check for the birth certificate on the
first day of immunization and enter the unique Birth Registration Number onto the EPI card. This information is then sent online to the
local registrar and on subsequent immunization days, parents submit the Birth Registration Certificate to the EPI workers.

Consultations were held with experts to develop minimum data sets for maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH), and reviews were
done of available MNCH-related instruments nationally and globally. Two sets of data were created: one for pregnant mothers and the
other for children. This formed the foundation for work on digital design and software development aimed at collecting and processing
data around individual name-based records, which would feed into the District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2) being used by the
Ministry of Health, Bangladesh and integrated with other ICT-based strengthening efforts by the Ministry of Health. One lesson learned
was that the results may have been achieved more quickly had an existing open source application been used and customizes for the
specific requirements, rather than trying to build applications from scratch.

     Box 8  Automated Verbal Autopsies in the community in South Africa,
     Malawi, India, and Nepal




     For the first time the development of WHO Verbal Autopsy (VA) standards have coincided with the refinement of an automated method
     for the interpretation of VA data. This is based on a long-established series of VA interpretation models developed over the past decade.
     It uses Bayesian probabilistic methods for a totally consistent and comparable source of cause-of-death data. Research on implementing
     the automated VA system is underway in South Africa, Malawi, India, and Nepal, and is expanding to Bangladesh and other countries.
     Experience to date shows that it is quicker and cheaper than traditional VA methods, it improves data quality and completeness, it is easy
     to use and secure, it is liked by field-workers, and the use of phones does not seem to be a problem even in remote areas. Challenges
     remain however, in remaining consistency with WHO questions in particular when translated versions are prepared. There is a need to
     have strong, well maintained trainer-of-trainer programs and funds secured to ensure long term maintenance and sustainability of the
     software.

Box 9  Improving hospital mortality data in Mozambique




In Mozambique, prior to 2006, no routine data were available on cause of death and morbidity, and there were no representative civil
registration data. In 2006, the Ministry of Health formally adopted the decision to use ICD-10 and standard classifications through the
creation of a national committee for the implementation of standard classifications. A pilot was conducted in 2007 in one hospital using
shortlists based on aggregated data, and in 2008, mortality registers were introduced. The mortality register allowed for the first national
mortality analysis based on routinely collected data, although initially restricted to a hospital setting. There were further reforms initiated
in the mortality system through the revision of the death certificate, introduced nationwide in 2009, and the introduction of SIS-ROH
(Sistema de Informmacao de Saude – Registo Obitois Hospitalares), software designed to enable individual-based data management,
including demographic data and data on hospitalization and cause of death.

Building upon these ongoing processes of reform, in 2011, a project was initiated on the modernization of the national vital statistics
system, which at that time was not implemented nationally and only covered deaths in hospitals. Capitalizing on existing initiatives was
an important factor in the project’s success. An application was introduced that captured hospital deaths and permitted expansion of
the system to allow extra-hospital deaths to be registered (that is, deaths registered by police stations and from declarations recorded
by local community authorities). A later version of the application will be web-enabled and linked to scaling efforts and consolidation of
data into a single database. The SIS-ROH software has improved with regular use and feedback from the users in selected hospitals.
Simultaneously, there have been ongoing efforts to develop the capacity of nodal provincial staff, in both information technology and the
use of SIS-ROH, so that they are able to provide technical support on the software to end users. It is hoped that the interest the project
has generated will lead to a future national-level initiative for the computerization CRVS systems.

     Box 10  Civil register links with maternal and child events in Philippines




     The project was collaboration between the National Statistical Office (NSO) and the Department of Health and involved linking two existing
     monitoring tools: the Barangay Civil Registration System (BCRS) and Watching Over Mothers and Babies (WOMB). The WOMB system
     is an ongoing project of the department to enable registration and processing of maternal and child vital events, and for the generation
     and utilization of vital statistics at the local levels. The BCRS was developed by the NSO for use at the Local Government Units (LGUs) to
     support the process of civil registration by the local municipality. The BCRS also seeks to establish a database of social and demographic
     profiles of Barangay residents.

     The project supported the gathering of data on demographic profiles for all residents, including vital registration status. This involved
     supporting technical advances on BCRS, redesigning the data-gathering tools to facilitate data processing, and creating an online data-
     base at the national level for hosting authorized BCRS implementers. The project also aimed to increase awareness among the Barangay
     constituents of the importance of civil registration, as a part of their basic human rights, ensure interoperability between WOMB and
     BCRS, and improve quality and completeness of BCRS data. It also monitored the use of data with a view to improving the utilization of
     vital statistics for public health action. The project also performed an analysis of why births were not being registered: reasons varied from
     negligence to lack of awareness, with registration not being seen as part of the culture. Similar analyses were carried out of the status of
     marriage and death registrations and reasons for their non-registration.

Box 11  Strengthening vital statistics through inter-institutional efforts
in Nicaragua




Nicaragua’s assessment of the vital statistics system drew attention to its problems, such as a weak legal framework, poor inter-insti-
tutional coordination, a lack of access to and an insufficient number of civil registry offices, difficult connections due to transportation
difficulties, the extremely low quality of data, and a lack of awareness of both the system and the importance of vital statistics. During
the period May 2011 to September 2013, Nicaragua started a dialogue among the institutions involved in vital statistics registration in
the country, with the Ministry of Health leading the process of integration to facilitate the connection and improve the timely reporting of
births and deaths.

In addition, authorities seized the opportunity to draft and place before the National Assembly legislation to create a legal framework for
the civil registration of births and deaths. To reduce sub-registration, the institutions jointly embraced public education radio campaigns
implemented with 43 radio stations in three languages: Spanish, English, and Miskitu. This activity facilitated registration in 118 com-
munities, achieving a total of 253 children under 1, 4,451 children under 5 years of age, and 4,704 youth. In the same period, it was
possible to carry out 19 workshops targeting municipal personnel and midwives, train 435 doctors on ICI-10 data, and review perinatal
records on selected sites. Today, with a national legal framework in place and strong inter-institutional relations and commitment, resolu-
tion of Nicaragua’s remaining challenges seems more feasible.

Note: The table summarizes the associated assumptions used to estimate average unit costs per activity and per CRVS level. Activity and aggregated cost for each country were estimated using
per-capita costs as shown in the table. The last column indicates whether that category was included in the recurrent cost for the next five years (2020–2024). Categorization of CRVS activities
and costs have been based on the available information in the investment plans and have required a degree of judgment given some incomplete/unclear information in the plans. Country in-
vestment plans vary also in terms of the activities included so this exercise offered the possibility of standardizing the costs included in the estimate. In addition, each country investment plan has
been developed independently and employs slightly different approaches to costing. Country plan costing has been adjusted for inflation for the country’s specific implementation period between
2014 and 2020. All country plans had a five-year time horizon except Ethiopia, which had a seven-year investment plan period. Currency exchange rate fluctuations have not been factored into
the analysis.
