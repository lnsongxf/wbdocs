                               I.      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
To date, there have been very few systematic approaches to ensuring the provision of adequate
social services and assistance to persons with disabilities in MENA countries. Most wide-scale
efforts include:

           a. Income support: Social Insurance programs provide income support to insured
              workers who become disabled; in addition, some programs also provide rehabilitation
              and eventually support reinsertion in the labor markets, although the first objective is
              predominant in these programs;

           b. Social Assistance: Assuming that poverty is higher among PWD than in the general
              population, Social Safety Nets programs often include categorical targeting for them,
              with objectives also mostly focused on income support;

           c. Medical treatments and Rehabilitation: programs are usually part of Health
              Insurance and Public Health programs, but they are also sometimes part of the Social
              Insurance benefit package;

           d. Inclusive education: Education programs promote the inclusion of children and youth
              with disabilities, with the overall objective of improving their life and work
              opportunities;

           e. A number of other programs address cross-cutting issues, such as infrastructure and
              transportation, to improve access to services.

Most countries in MENA lack integrated national disability policies, and while some public
agencies have the mandate to coordinate the different programs, the effectiveness of any effort will
face the challenges of inadequate information. Program coordination is missing or weak and even
information about programs outreach and gaps is limited or non-existing. While some countries
are making efforts to improve disability programs management, the use of systematic tools to
collect and process information about the programs is very limited.

The first challenge facing any attempt to coordinate policies for PWD is the huge data gaps, while
programs are so fragmented, have so many different objectives and run by public, private and
international agencies.

This report proposes a toolkit which can be used to produce national assessments in MENA
countries. The toolkit consists of a series of four questionnaires to be completed by institutions
delivering specific programs in the areas of Social Assistance, Social Insurance, Health and
Education. A first attempt was made to collect primary information from a selected group of
countries in the region, but the level of response was low and it resulted evident that systematic
collection of data from widespread sources can be best achieved if supported by field work,
possibly in connection with ongoing operations, as in the case of a recent assessment produced by
the World Bank in Palestine1.

Social Insurance programs are probably the ones where information is most readily available. In
addition, there may be important learning for other programs if further analysis is conducted for
these programs. Better understanding and improvements in critical related processes such as
disability assessment, costs and the links with rehabilitation programs in Social Insurance may
render important lessons for the better implementation of other programs addressed to PWD.

Social Insurance faces enormous challenges in the three areas mentioned above: assessment
procedures are unclear, long term costs of the programs are hardly known and links with
rehabilitation programs are weak. This report also explores ways to improve knowledge as the
basis to set sound regulations in the area of Social Insurance.

Among them, the methodology presented in the report to estimate the long term costs of disability
pensions can be a powerful tool to support policy dialogue. Results of its use in some countries in
MENA are also presented and compared. While the overall expenditures in disability insurance
represent a minor part of the overall Social Security expenditures, the absence of objective
parameters to define disability may result in unexpected changes as the programs mature and
covered population is extended or becomes older. The extent to which Disability Insurance meets
basic principles of design, such as sustainability, adequacy and affordability can be better
understood through the costing methodology presented in Section II of this report.

The logical sequence of to present our findings should start from a system’s level, down to specific
programs. However, given the relatively better availability of data on Social Insurance programs,
we have adopted an alternative sequence, and present a discussion of disability pensions in Section
II, followed by a presentation of the toolkit to assess programs from a system’s perspective in
Section III. Specifically, the toolkit is included as Annexes I to IV.

                               II.     DISABILITY INSURANCE
Social Insurance and Social Assistance are probably among the largest programs providing income
support and services to persons with disabilities as measured by their size, but they only cover part
of the needs of a subgroup of people with disabilities: the insured workers of the formal sector and
to some extent the “poor” or “vulnerable, usually defined in a rather unclear manner. In addition
to income support, these programs usually include rehabilitation and healthcare support.

However, there is still an important vacuum concerning statistics and cost analysis of Social
Insurance programs. Ad-hoc studies were performed by the World Bank for a group of countries
in MENA, and the results are also summarized in this chapter.

Most countries in MENA provide social insurance programs for workers who become disabled,
and in exceptional basis, also on a non-contributory basis. As a general rule, these programs
provide income support and rehabilitation to workers who become disabled due to illness or
accidents that result in a significant reduction of the ability of the worker to continue working.
The illness or accident resulting in reduced capacity to work may be associated with the working
conditions (work accident or injuries) or to any other reason (general disability programs).

Social Insurance programs provide the most important, regular and sustainable income support to
people with disabilities in MENA. However, these programs only apply to workers who were
already in the formal sector (thus, insured by some form of Social Security) at the time they became
disabled, and only 35% of the labor force in MENA is covered by any social security program
(Gatti, R. et al, 2011).

In addition, the way to define eligibility criteria (and thus the disability assessment) is sometimes
unclear or not entirely objective, and seldom follows international benchmarks generally accepted
as best practices.

While Social Insurance disability programs are normally considered to be an integral part of the
pension programs, the definition of the monetary benefits is not always consistent with the general
principles from which old age pensions derive. In addition, the design of these programs has been
the result of less careful attention than other Social Security interventions: old age pensions have
been at the center of pension policy design, and even unemployment and health insurance
programs have received larger attention. Social Security programs do not have separate costing
of disability programs, and the extent to which they comply with basic principles of design, such
as sustainability, adequacy and affordability are not known.

Finally, while disability insurance programs usually include in-kind benefits (such as access to
rehabilitation) in addition to the monetary ones, implementation and enforcement of the first is
weak, and beneficiaries of the programs only receive monthly payments and remain lifetime
excluded from the labor force.

Eligibility Criteria
Disability insurance programs in MENA lack common patterns concerning basic design features,
including the definition of the population being covered. All countries establish a certain “degree

                                                 8
of incapacity” as the minimum required to be eligible for a pension, but the percentages show wide
variation across countries, and a similar situation happens with the criteria to assess incapacity.

Out of fourteen countries analyzed2 (Table 1), five allow for partial disability pensions (Jordan,
Yemen, Algeria, Egypt and Libya). Total disability, in turn, is defined as a loss of 100 percent of
working capability in eight of the countries, while others define the total disability as a loss of a
portion of working capability (50% or more). Disparity of criteria is not exclusive of MENA, and
comparison with other regions also shows lack of clear benchmarks in the way disability is defined,
but percentages of working capability loss usually concentrate around 66% as a standard eligibility
criterion. As we will discuss below, subjective assessment of disability is also reflected in the way
the percentage of capability loss is measures, which makes international comparisons even more
difficult.

The definition of incapability to work is not exempt from ambiguity: in some cases it is defined as
incapacity to do any job, while in others it refers to incapacity to perform a specific job. In
Lebanon, for example, it is defined as a loss of normal working capability, while in Egypt it is
defined as incapability for any gainful employment.

The ambiguity in the definition of disability is not exclusive of Social Insurance programs, and it
has important consequences in terms of program objectives and population to be covered. In
Egypt, for example, different definitions of disability have resulted in a variety of estimates.
According to the UN, Egypt has more than 12 million people living with disabilities, of which
children represent one third. Together with their families, More than 36 million people are directly
or indirectly affected by disabilities (Plan International, 2014). Central Authority for Public

                                                                 9
Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS), however, estimated around 3.5% of the total population
to be disabled3.

Benefit Levels
Even in countries with retirement saving pension systems, disability pensions are defined benefit,
with the amounts expressed as a percentage (“replacement rate”) of the average income perceived
during a reference period before becoming disabled.

The benefits offered by different social insurance schemes shows wide variations among countries.
As a result, commuting factors (replacement rates) in MENA vary from 3.33% to 100% of salary.

Variations among countries are also common in the case of old age pensions, but the differences
are even higher in the case of disability pensions. Rules to calculate pensions are usually complex,
as reflected in the main parameters of the schemes: commuting factors (replacement rate),
minimum contribution requirements, insured wage (salary base and ceiling), and indexation show
wide variations among countries.

For example, in Bahrain, the disability pension is 44% of the insured worker’s average monthly
earnings in the last year of contributions before becoming disabled, or 2% of the insured’s average
earnings during the last year of contributions multiplied by the number of years of contributions,
whichever is higher. Minimum is 44% or 200 dinars a month. In Iran, the pension is 3.33% of the
insured’s average earnings in the last two years multiplied by the number of years of contributions.

In Tunisia, The pension is 50% of the insured’s average earnings in the last 10 years before the
disability began plus 0.5% of average earnings for each three-month period of contributions
exceeding 180 months. In Morocco, the pension is 50% of the insured’s average monthly earnings
in the last 96 months plus 1% of average monthly earnings for every 216 days of insurance
exceeding 3,240 days, up to 70%. As a result, workers with identical salaries and a contribution
period of five years would receive a monthly disability pension (expressed in US dollars in all
cases) of $79 in Iran, $ 355 in Bahrain, $ 475 in Tunisia and $ 1059 in Morocco.4

The differences are not only the result of different commuting factors, but also due to differences
in the definition of the insured wage and the influence of the length of service before the worker
became disabled. Table 2 and Figure 1 depict the wide fluctuation in benefit calculation observed
in the region, as shown in the previous examples.

Disability Assessment
Assessing disability is another area where different criteria prevail, which in turn affects the
conditions to become eligible for disability pensions.

Ideally, disability assessment for Social Security programs should include the following elements:
   i)        A transparent process with clear roles and accountabilities;
   ii)       Objective guidelines, including medical and socio-economic factors;
   iii)      Mechanisms of appeals, grievance and redress.


          Institutional set up: Roles and accountability
In MENA countries, different agencies are responsible for the evaluation and certification of
disability. As summarized in Table 3, while several countries in MENA rely on professional
assessment of a specialized board, the level of autonomy and accountability mechanisms vary from
one country to another.

             Table 3: Assessment Institution in MENA countries
Country                Assessment Institution
Bahrain                Medical Committee
Jordan                 The Central Medical Committee, Appeal Medical Committee
Saudi Arabia           The General Organization for Social Insurance’s medical board
Tunisia                Medical Commission (central)
Qatar                  High Medical Commission
Palestine              Medical Committees (different for West Bank and Gaza)
Egypt                  Medical Commissions

One important element of the institutional set up is the separation between the assessment
process and the administration of the program. In general, separation of both functions allows
for the second to appeal the decisions of the first, but this is not the most common case, with the
possible exception of Bahrain. In this country, both the insured and the Social Insurance
Organization may request periodic medical examinations during the first four years of disability.
By contrast, in Saudi Arabia, The General Organization for Social Insurance’s medical board
assesses the need for constant attendance.

While the institutional framework for disability assessment is an important design ingredient of
transparent and objective criteria, it needs to be complemented with clear guidelines on how
disability will be assessed.

          Guidelines
Most developed countries worldwide have adopted regulatory guidelines for the assessment of
disability. In USA, for example, the initial assessment is done using the Regulation Basis Code
(RBC), which appears in Social Security’s administrative data systems as well as related research

                                                12
data sets. The RBC documents the detailed reason for each SSA determination, in terms of medical,
medical-vocational, and other criteria. The RBC is recorded in the National Disability
Determination Service System (NDDSS).

The disability determination process is used by Social Security field offices and state DDS
agencies to make initial disability determinations. The steps in the disability determination process
for adults are the following: Step 1: Financial screens; Step 2: A medical screen to deny applicants
without a severe impairment; Step 3: A medical screen to allow applicants who are the most
severely disabled; Step 4: Can severely impaired applicants work in their past jobs? Step 5: Can
severely impaired applicants do other work in the national economy? Field offices implement the
first of the five-steps, and DDS agencies are responsible for the medical determinations at steps 2
to 5.

The specific criteria used by the DDS in the allow/deny determinations are identified in the RBC,
which is included in the NDDSS data generated by DDS agencies. The RBC describes the basis
for initial determinations and reconsiderations. Outcomes of higher-level appeals, such as
decisions of ALJs, are in principle, based on the same criteria as DDS determinations, but such
appeals decisions are not included in the NDDSS data generated by DDS agencies. ALJ-level
decisions are recorded in the Case Processing and Management System in US.

However, there are a number of weaknesses in the disability assessment process in USA. Among
others, the process is long, and decisions are often taken following bureaucratic processes with
little professional judgment of the disabling conditions of individuals.
The United Kingdom has one of the easiest and most simplistic assessment systems called the
Work Capability Assessment (WCA). It is solidly based on medical evidence, but once it
establishes the existence of the condition, it then focuses on how the existence of the condition
impacts the person’s remaining functioning. It does not reason from medical tests, but instead
starts with the level of the functional impact, and eligibility for the benefit is based on a range of
descriptors of limited capability for work that are categorized under 21 activities designed to assess
both physical and mental health. Claimants score “points” on these descriptors, and a benefit is
approved if a minimum number of points are met. However, the claimant would still be considered
for vocational habilitation or rehabilitation.

By contrast, MENA countries lack a comparably objective and transparent process of disability
assessment resulting in potentially high level of discretion5. Therefore, not only disability
insurance covers a fraction of the population, but the inclusion errors are often high among the
covered population. In other words, disability insurance provides many undeserved benefits, while
a large number of PWD in the informal sector or unemployed only have access to income support
through social assistance programs, whenever available.




5Egypt is in the process of adopting a similar functional tool to assess disability for the new Social Assistance “Karama”
program.

                                                                13
         Medical and environmental factors

In most countries in MENA, disability assessment is guided by medical principles, assimilating
disability with health impairment. Environmental factors recommended by WHO’s CDRP are not
considered. This is the case in Palestine, according to a recent World Bank assessment of disability
programs6. The assessment also notes, in addition, that criteria are outdated.

In Egypt, the definition of disability is also heavily driven by the medical approach7. Consequently,
the policies made by the government are based on individualization and medicalization of
disability rather than on the social and economic aspects of the issue (Hagrass, 2005). Disability
is still deemed as something to be ashamed of by the families who become socially stigmatized
and economically vulnerable because of disability (Plan International, 2014).
In Qatar, the High Medical Commission assesses disability based on medical conditions, but the
criteria are not documented and the Commission only produces a summary document with the
final decision, which the Social Security does not appeal.

Medical criteria are still the main drivers to give disability benefits, even in developed countries,
although empirical evidence shows that non-medical, social determinants, such as the level of
education and occupational factors should be addressed in assessments and rehabilitation
programs8.

Costs of Disability Pension Programs
Actuarial analysis and projections are often produced to assess the financial situation and
sustainability of pension schemes, but in most of the cases they are focused on the analysis of old
age pensions. Disability insurance has received much less attention and, in consequence, little is
known about the specific costs and trends of these programs.

In contrast with elderly pensions, disability pensions are less exposed to deterministic trends and
depend to a large extent on the definition that different countries adopt to define not only the
benefits, but also eligibility conditions. Consequently, significant differences are observed in costs
and coverage across countries.

While the overall expenditures in disability insurance represent a minor part of total Social
Security expenditures. The relatively smaller costs of disability pensions are therefore less at the
center of attention and pension reforms often take care of old-age pension reforms only, excluding
disability pensions. However, changes in demographic structure, especially for fairly young social
insurance schemes such as those of MENA countries, may impact significantly the costs of the
programs, and aggravate the financial burden imposed on the programs. Together with the level
of discretionality in disability assessment and the varying ways in which disability is defined in

7 As part of the implementation of the new Karama program, disability assessment will shift from medical to functional approach,
but the new methodology is still being developed.
8 Krokstad et al (2002) analyze 62,000 cases in Norway and conclude that social determinants are strongly correlated with the

prevalence of disability

                                                              14
different countries, this may result in unforeseeable long term financial needs. A clearer projection
of financing needs may support early adjustments in the regulatory framework.

countries.

The World Bank extensively uses PROST model to project long term financial costs and
sustainability analysis of pension schemes, and the tool has proved to be an effective instrument
to support policy dialogue on reform options. However, the long term financial needs of disability
and survivorship pensions could be better captured through a complementary and more customized
tool. Such a model has been developed and used extensively in LAC, and also in some MENA
countries, such as Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Qatar and Malta.

This section presents a general framework of how costs can be calculated and shows results for
the Jordan, Egypt and Qatar.

       The model
Several variables affect disability pension costs in general and are listed here:
      Replacement ratio for the defined benefit;
      Definition of eligible beneficiaries and their survival probabilities;
      Probabilities of dying for the insured population;
      Marital status, sex, age and number of children of insured members, if applicable;
      Discount rates for likely future payments;
      Previous work experience and insured earnings history;
      Contribution rates and investment returns;
      The probability of becoming disabled;
      The survival probabilities for disabled workers.

At a first stage, two factors are important for the calculation of disability costs (DCt). The risk of
becoming disabled (it), and the present value of the insured capital (DICt). The disability insured
capital (DICt) is equivalent to the defined benefit (DDBt) net of the amount accumulated in the
individual account (IAt):

                              DCt  it * DICt  it * ( DDBt  IAt )t      (1)

The gross components included in equation (1) do not only depend on the period considered, but
also on individual ages (x) and their relative wages (Wx / W), if applicable.

                                                 Wx                             W
                       DCt   DCx;t * c x;t *        ix;t * DDBx ;t * cx ;t * x   (2)
                              x                  W    x                         W

DDBx;t : Defined benefit is an annuity with monthly payments equivalent to a given percentage
of the earnings base that applies. This annuity largely varies with regard to years of contribution
and level of earnings.

cx;t is the weight of contributors’ age distribution

The replacement rate in all three samples is set fixed at 70%. This is based on three factors:
    International experience: The replacement rate is 70% in Chile and 70% in Argentina. An
       exception is made (in Argentina) for those affiliates who contributed irregularly;

                                                     16
              A rough empirical average;
              The fact that years of contribution are positively correlated with age, but flat amounts imply
               a proportional inverse correlation with growing salaries.

In case of death of a disability pensioner, the eligible beneficiaries often have the right to a benefit
equivalent to the total or some fraction of the pension. However, the impact of these costs is not
considered here, since they correspond to a different project on survivorship pensions.
Thus, the total defined benefit for the basic scenario is:
                                                              
                                             DDBx  0.7 * (  t p x
                                                                  i
                                                                    * vt )       (3)
                                                              t 0


           where:
           t   p x i = probability of surviving from age x to age x+t according to the MI85 Life Table9
           v = discount rate = 1/1.03 = 0.97087

From equations (1) to (3), it was shown that the theoretical disability cost for a given age depends
on the probabilities of becoming disabled, the defined replacement rate, and the survival
probabilities of disabled workers. The overall cost depends also on the age structure of the insured
population (since it is a weighted average of the age-specific costs), and their relative wages.

Baseline scenarios on costs have been produced for Jordan, Egypt and Qatar. The main results are
summarized in the following sections.

               Jordan
As shown in Figure 4, the present value of future payments of disability benefits decrease slowly,
on average at an annual rate of 1%. The probabilities of becoming disabled increase very fast (16%
a year) and thus, the age-specific insurance cost (obtained by multiplying these probabilities times
the insured capital) also increases very fast (14% a year). While the cost is less than 1% for workers
aged below 45, it is between 1% and 7% of their salary for those aged above 45, reflecting once
again the relevance of the age composition.

On average (weighted by the age structure of the contributing population in 2005/07), disability
pensions imply 13 annual salaries, the gross annual risk of becoming disabled is 0.5 per thousand,
and the cost is 0.5% of the salary. Weighting by the relative wages, the total average disability cost
is 0.7% of the salary.

The financing of disability pensions will be inexpensive in the short term given that mainly young
workers are covered, but the models show a significant growing trend for the long term costs.
While different assumptions may produce different results, it is critical to make use of the
regulatory power to define a sustainable framework. In order to meet the goal of having lower
costs for these benefits, replacement ratios and/or beneficiaries covered might be redefined
accordingly.

The cost of non-work related disability pensions in Jordan is around 1% of total wages. When
taking the ageing process into account, costs are assumed to rise to 1.6% of salaries.

                 EGYPT10
The probabilities of becoming disabled increase very fast (about 29% a year for ages above 40, at
a higher rate before) and thus, the age-specific insurance cost (obtained by multiplying these
probabilities times the insured capital) also increases very fast (about 24% a year for ages above
40), reflecting once again the relevance of the age composition (Figure 5).

While the cost is less than 1% for workers aged below 40, it is between 2% and 3% of their salary
for those aged above 50. On average (weighted by the age structure of the contributing population
in 2006), disability pensions imply 12 annual salaries, pensions for the surviving widow represent
8 annual salaries (adding up 20), and (net of the balance in the individual accounts) produce a
defined net benefit equivalent to 15 annual salaries.

The gross annual risk of becoming disabled is about 0.1% and the total average disability cost is
1% of the insured salary. As previously noted, these estimates do not reflect the ‘real’ costs,
although they are expected to converge in practice.

The system to finance disability pensions will be inexpensive in the short term given that mainly
young workers would be covered and that reserves would not be constituted, but these models
show a reasonable horizon for the long term costs, which are increasing. It is critical for the
Government to make use of the regulatory power to define a sustainable framework for the future
in order to prevent rising costs while at the same time keeping benefits at an acceptable level.



       GCC Countries: the case of Qatar

Population structure will change rapidly in GCC countries. As shown in Figure 6 below,
population over 65 years as a proportion of active population will increase exponentially. In the
case of Qatar, UAE and Oman, projections show similar levels to those of OECD countries
between 2045 and 2060, while KSA, Bahrain and Kuwait will move in the same direction but at a
lower pace.

As in previous cases, ageing population will not only affect the costs of elderly pension programs,
but also those of disability pensions, given the increase of age-specific costs of these programs.
Estimates made for Qatar using the same model are presented in figure 7.

On average (weighted by the age structure of the contributing population in 2013), cost of disability
pensions represent 11.8 annual salaries (or 11.5 after adjustment for wage growth by age), the
gross annual risk of becoming disabled is 0.7 per thousand, and the cost is 0.86% of the average
salary. Considering the aging process already taking place in Qatar, we compare a more mature
system (with an even age distribution), and the new cost would grow 39%, up to 1.2% of salaries.

The analysis in this section was mainly focused on the determination of costs of disability pensions
based on long term considerations. The analysis defined a baseline scenario under current
experience. The results for all MENA countries where disability costs were projected shows
recurrently similar results. In the baseline case, disability pensions exhibit a comparatively low
cost (in the range of 0.9% to 1% of salary), but in the longer term, changes in the demographic
structure will increase this cost by a percentage ranging between 40% and more than 100%.

While administrative or regulatory reforms may result in efficiency gains, the impact on the
system’s finances will not be significant in the short term, and therefore the incentives to set in
place such reforms may not be high. However, the situation will be quite different in the future,
mostly associated with changes of covered population structure, and this will require additional
efforts to monitor the financial situation of this program. Financing disability pensions will show
an increasing trend if the disability rates are kept constant over the long term11 and the population
ages as expected. A prudent and objective regulatory framework minimizing the leakages and
discretionality of disability assessment is essential to preserve the sustainability of the programs.




11   This assumption may overestimate the long term costs, if sinistrality rates are reduced thanks to improved health treatments.

       III. BEYOND SOCIAL INSURANCE: MAPPING SOCIAL ASSISTANCE
                      AND OTHER PROGRAMS FOR PWDS

Social Insurance programs are just a piece in the complex mosaic of programs for PWD. A recent
assessment conducted in Palestine shows that disability is strongly correlated with informality,
unemployment and lack of education12. With more than one third PWD above the age of 15 being
illiterate, and close to 90% unemployed, the role of social insurance can only have a limited scope.
While the numbers in other MENA countries may be lower, the limited capacity of social insurance
programs to address the needs of PWD is quite evident.

A number of other programs provide income support for PWD in MENA. These mainly consist
of social assistance programs defined categorically, and in most cases they are provided by the
government or public agencies, and a number of civil society organizations.

Social Assistance for PWD provide income support in the form of cash transfers targeted to poorer
families with one or more PWD living in the household. Examples of such programs are the new
Karama program of Egypt, which will gradually reach all poor families with people living with
disabilities. Social Pensions in Egypt also provide income support to PWD, although the program
is now phasing out as the better targeted Karama program expands countrywide. Similar programs
with different levels of outreach and targeting exist in most MENA countries.

Social Assistance for PWD, can reach a far larger number of potential beneficiaries, but they face
important challenges in terms of organizational capacity, financing and sustainability. Since these
programs rely on budget allocations and partnerships with CSOs, their sustainability is challenged
by potentially limited resources, which in turn is also affected by the limited information about
their coverage (actual and potential), and even their institutional set-up.

Both from a human rights and development perspective, however, income support programs
cannot address all the needs of PWD. More broadly, from an integrated policy perspective, what
PWD need is to be integrated (or re-integrated) in the labor market and be included in all forms of
social life. Ideally, income support programs for PWD should include non-monetary benefits such
as rehabilitation, daycare centers and employment. Particular importance also have inclusive
education programs, since the astounding rates of illiteracy among PWD in MENA represents the
most serious constraint to inclusiveness.

The toolkit presented in this section and Annexes has the objective of providing policy makers
with elements to support a comprehensive and integrated agenda for PWD. The information
gathered from these questionnaires is expected to show gaps which the programs would need to
address.

Mapping programs for PWD
Collecting information to map programs for PWDs in the areas of Social Assistance proved to be
much more difficult than reviewing the social insurance programs (which are fairly centralized
and limited in number).

A survey instrument was designed to collect information covering program goals and objectives;
program beneficiaries (targeting, eligibility and demographics); disability assessment, program
funding; program activities and benefits; program partnerships and collaboration; and monitoring
and evaluation. Survey data explored each of these processes and in this way aim to identify
variations in approaches and potential gaps in each of these areas. The instrument was self-report
and allowed each respondent to select an answer from choices provided, or in many instances, to
provide their own answer.

Similar instruments were also designed to gather information about programs providing in-kind
support to PWD, notably in the areas of education and health.

These surveys are proposed as possibly useful instruments to collect basic information on large
number of fragmented programs administered by governments, CSOs and international agencies,
at country level. A first attempt to collect information from the survey showed that the tools would
be most effective if conducted from the field, a task which is beyond the scope of the current work.
The questionnaires included as Annex of this report may serve as basis for country-level
assessment, such as the one conducted in Palestine in 2015. They may be used as separate
modules, or as a basis to support a comprehensive mapping of existing programs. In the second
case, they may serve the much needed task of coordinating national programs, an important need
which countries in MENA have not addressed in a systematic manner, with the possible exception
of Palestine.



Rehabilitation
One area of particular focus in the survey toolkit presented is the link between rehabilitation and
other programs. All countries in MENA have rehabilitation programs, but they have limited scope
and coverage, and they are not well integrated with the rest of the programs. Initial assessments
reveal that in many cases, income support through disability pensions or cash transfers do not
adequately meet the needs of many persons living with disabilities. Supporting their inclusion and
integration in society should be the overarching objective of programs for PWD, and rehabilitation
is an important component of this.

According to the survey conducted by UN in 2004-2005 (UN, 2006), to fulfill their commitment
to the provision of rehabilitation to persons with disabilities and in order for them to reach and
sustain their optimum level of independence and functioning, governments were required to
respond on seven (7) measures that form the core actions for meeting the rehabilitation needs of
persons with disability. The measure are 1) Adopting policies; 2) Passing legislation; 3)
Adopting programs, 4) Allocating financial resources, 5) Training personnel, 6) Making
rehabilitation services accessible to persons with disabilities, and 7) Consulting and cooperating

                                                23
with organizations of persons with disabilities. As shown in Table 4 and Figure 8, a large number
of countries are not reporting compliance with actions to assure access to rehabilitation services.

With regard to legislations for rehabilitation services, the region has had some steps in developing
the platform for equitable opportunities for people with disabilities. In Jordan, the law for the
Welfare of Disabled persons ensures the integration of the rehabilitation rights of people with
disabilities (education, employment, sports and recreation) into the general life of society (Al-
Hussein Rehab, 2008). In Egypt, the Law no. 39 on Rehabilitation of the Disabled people provides
5 percent employment quota for people with disabilities in any public or private employers with


                                                             24
50 or more employees (JICA, 2002). Free health insurance and education aid are secured by the
Palestinian law which was enacted in 1991. This law exempts people with disabilities from all
customs and taxes on the private transportation means (World Bank, 2008). Through its
comprehensive legislations on disability, Lebanon ensures health and rehabilitation services at the
expense of the state (LMSA, 2000)
However, coverage gaps are alarming. Rehabilitative educational programs in the MENA region
continue to exclude more than 95 percent of the disabled school-aged population at the primary
level, and almost entirely at the university level (Alasuutari, 2000). In Jordan, around 92 percent
of children with disabilities are underserved by the few rehabilitation services provided by the
public or private providers, based on the Jordanian National Council of Family Affairs (NCFA,
2004). This reflects the lack of the national strategy for rehabilitation services to identify the needs
and bridge the gaps (Gharaibeh, 2008).

With respect to integration of rehabilitation services, there are gaps of a clear governance system
and an institutional framework to govern the interaction between government agencies, CSOs and
communities (World Bank, 2005). Accordingly and following the 2011’s revolution, the
government of Egypt established the NCDA so as to play this coordination role and bridge the gap
in the currently fragmented system of rehabilitation services for people with disabilities.

As the main provider of rehabilitation services, many local CSOs do not have the technical or
operational capacity to apply and introduce a community-based approach or interact enough with
the affected families. The old rehabilitation techniques are the main niche for the majority of the
CSOs who are not sufficiently exposed to rehabilitative inclusive education policies, pedagogical
methods, and practices. In most of the cases, their programs are not evaluated to measure whether
that activities provided have reached the target population with the means to live independent and
productive lives. Let alone the mild and moderate degrees of people with disabilities who are
either not diagnosed or misdiagnosed due to the lack of early identification programs using cost-
effective tools and protocols. Mostly, local CSOs target individuals with disabilities who are
registered as disabled, showing severe disabilities or exhibiting “noticeable” late behavioral
symptoms.

Apart from the low capacity to implement and manage such rehabilitation services, government
programs and line ministries often lack the mandate, capacity, knowledge and resources to guide
and monitor local CSO activities. The governmental agencies also lack the expertise to support the
CSO transition towards inclusive community-based services, which integrate education, primary
health care, and early intervention with vocational training and job matching. The aforementioned
legislative framework on disability in the MENA reflects the governmental commitment, and
provides a basis for systematic and strategic work in the future. However, as enforcement remains
limited and implementation capacity weak, legislation alone does not guarantee benefits for
individuals with disabilities.

Nevertheless and on the public-private integration front, a number of initiatives addressing
disability in the region are emerging to address several bottlenecks. The Social Protection
Initiatives Project (SPIP) in Egypt (1999-2004), for instance, has yielded some lessons learnt that
could be considered by the government. For example, the community-based Inclusive education
Model, as a form of Community-Based Rehabilitation, was shown to be a feasible entry point for

                                                  25
inclusion of children with disabilities. This could be achieved through a network of local CSOs
supports the disability component, managed by the Ministry of Social Solidarity. Inclusion was
piloted in formal and non-formal education programs to instill the principles of a culture that
recognizes "diversity" rather than "disability". As a result, the Ministry of Education issued a
decree in 2005 supporting the enrollment of disabled children in formal schools turning these
schools into inclusive associations.

Another good example of public-private partnership is a program supported by the Yemen Social
Fund for Development (SFD). Guidance and a framework for public-private cooperation were
piloted under SFD. The guidance was translated into legislation for the management of
government centers by CSOs. The SFD not only finances disability programs implemented by
local NGOs, but also finances buildings, equipment and capacity building to sustain their work
(Coleridge, 2004). SFD initiatives have also fostered inclusive education reaching out to blind,
deaf, physically disabled persons and children with mental health disabilities. SFD further
supports the training of teachers to enable them serve children with disabilities. These initiatives,
however, are urban-based, and there are very few local NGOs working in rural areas, where many
of the poor and disabled live. The leadership role played by the SFD did not result in government
engagement in disability, and the current situation of conflict in the country will require a new
assessment as part of the country’s reconstruction and recovery efforts.

Yet another example of public-private partnership can be found in West Bank and Gaza, where
the Palestinian Authority initiated systematic cooperation with local CSOs in the area of service
provision for the disabled. The Palestinian National Committee for Rehabilitation is composed of
representatives from local CSOs providing rehabilitation services and the Ministry of Health.

Almost all specialized rehabilitation services in Palestine are provided by CSOs: The mapping
identified 55 NGOs in West Bank and 33 CSOs in Gaza that provide health-related rehabilitation
services. The majority of these are small local NGOs providing a variety of services to a small
number of people. However, around 7-8 larger rehabilitation centers provide a wide range of
specialized services.13

In Egypt, the policy, regulation, partial provision, and supervision of rehabilitation services are
shared among three ministries, namely; The Ministry of Social Solidarity (MOSS), The Ministry
of Health and Population (MOHP), and the Ministry of Education (MOE) (JICA, 2002). The
MOSS, through its dedicated Department for Social Rehabilitation of the handicapped, is
mandated with making policies to cater to the rehabilitation needs of people with disabilities, and
licensing the NGOs which provide social and rehabilitation services to the disabled community.
The department also refers persons with disabilities to non-governmental agencies that offer
rehabilitation services, physiotherapy, education and other social services. The MOHP, on the
other hand, has no specific department or unit in charge of the disability-related services, and
merely provides medical and therapeutic rehabilitative services (JICA, 2002). As a way of
inclusion and through its resolution No.154, the MOE has already introduced special education to
the system whereby children with disabilities (visual, hearing, mental, or other physical cases) are
integrated with their non-disabled peers in the same schools. Figure 8 below provides an overview
of the administrative governance of disability in Egypt.

In 2012 and due to lack of coordination among different ministries, the cabinet approved the
establishment of the National Council for Disability issues to be in charge of policy making, and
supervision and monitoring of the performance of the government as well as the agencies
concerned with the services provided to people with disabilities. This includes the development of
a national plan for disability.

Services

Egyptian stakeholders have been underlying the poor level of applying the existing legislation, the
limited access to relevant rehabilitation services, the significant obstacles people with disabilities
are facing to secure income, and there minimal involvement of public authorities in social service
provision.

As per the scope of privileges secured by the government, people with disabilities have access to
government-owned mass transit buses free of charge, special subsidies to purchase household
products, wheelchairs, and prosthetic devices. They are also entitled for expeditious approval for

                                                 27
the installation of new telephone lines and reductions on customs duties for specially equipped
private vehicles (USICD, 2010). This, however, is only reaching the minority of disabled
community, of which the majority cannot use the disabled-unfriendly public transportation and
cannot afford to buy the subsidized vehicles (Daily News Egypt, 2012). Additionally, disability
pension and/or health insurance coverage are only provided to the civil or public employees. That
is, the majority of the disabled community who are not employed (65%) is deprived of those social
security benefits.

Unfortunately, the data on the coverage of rehabilitation services, the need for them, type and
quantity of measures provided by public and/or private, the quality of those measure, and estimates
of unmet needs are very limited in Egypt. There is not registry of people with disabilities in the
country and thus the supply-demand gap is unclear. Governmentally-sponsored physical
rehabilitation services in Egypt reach less than 5 percent of the disabled population (World Bank,
2005) and only 2 percent of disabled children have access to rehabilitation services (Plan
International, 2014). The rehabilitation services, social or physical, are mainly provided by the
NGOs and CDAs who are primarily sponsored by international organizations or through charity.

A critical element of a policy framework for PWD, rehabilitation programs need a space on their
own in the analysis of services and policies. The toolkit proposed in the Annexes may be an entry
point to assess the current situation and needs, and it may support further analysis and policies.
Including persons with disabilities means, in a broad sense, providing the necessary elements to
improve the opportunities to access to education, jobs and social activities in general. Income
support by itself is not enough to achieve this objective. Even the potential of rehabilitation
programs varies a lot from one country to another, depending on a number of factors such as the
availability of adequate infrastructure, the space for inclusive education, the existence of laws
promoting the employability of PWD. All these essential factors are present in variable degrees.
Assessments at country level should explain how to improve the design and coordination of the
existing programs, or introduce new ones. The proposed survey toolkit is intended to fill this gap,
although a more comprehensive analysis should also look at accessibility and infrastructure, which
is beyond the scope of this study.

                                      IV. CONCLUSIONS

This report does not include a comprehensive analysis of the programs for PWD in MENA, but it
does identify some of its challenges or provide tools for further analysis.

There are information and regulatory vacuums in the programs for PWD in MENA. Financing
shows unfair assymetries, since most people with disabilities remain uncovered, and among those
who receive benefits, some do not deserve.

In the case of Social Insurance programs, a clear assessment of costs, long term financing needs
and sustainability may support policy dialogue for reforms. The costing tool presented has been
used in MENA and LAC countries, complementing the World Bank PROST toolkit, and it is
expected to continue being used and improved as part of future engagements.

Disability assessment has also been presented as an area in which important progress needs to be
made, and concrete cases of adoption of simplified tools to assess capability gaps are already
happening in MENA, and expected to shed light to future reforms.

Existing programs are mostly centered around income support and only to a minor extent they
include non-cash benefits. Rehabilitation services, for example, have limited scope and coverage,
and they are not well integrated with the rest of the programs.

Stroger links between Social Insurance, Social Assistance and Rehabilitation programs are
essential to reach the needs of PWD, which go well beyond income support. As a developmental
objective, integration of PWD in the labor market and more broadly in society should be the main
drivers of national policies. Information gaps, program coordination and resources are key
ingredients to develop national policy frameworks.

In an effort to effectively map disability programs in MENA and to better understand them, the
institutional survey tool that was developed as part of this study can be applied to expand the level
of understanding and improve the diagnosis at country level. Policy makers would benefit from
better information, analysis of international benchmarks and best practices, and improved
coordination among different existing programs.
