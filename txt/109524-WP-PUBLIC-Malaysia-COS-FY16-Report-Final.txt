I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Malaysia perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Malaysia
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Hub in Malaysia
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Malaysia
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Malaysia
    The World Bank Group’s Work and Engagement in Client Countries
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From May to June 2016, 871 stakeholders of the WBG in Malaysia were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the Prime Minister; office of a minister; office of a
parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies; Project
Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 258 stakeholders participated in
the survey (30% response rate).
Some respondents received and returned the questionnaires via email or online. Others filled out
the survey with a representative of an independent fielding agency. Respondents were asked
about: general issues facing Malaysia; the WBG’s knowledge hub in Malaysia; overall attitudes
toward the WBG in Malaysia; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the
WBG; the WBG’s future role in Malaysia; the WBG’s work and engagement in client Countries;
and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey (COS) must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate was 26%, N=74). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, mean
ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are
slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY’13 COS report and the non-
weighted data presented in appendices A, B, C, and E. For the weighted stakeholder breakdown
and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix D (page 75).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the Office of the Prime Minister were combined
       with respondents from the office of a minister; employees of a ministry were combined
       with consultants working on Bank projects and respondents form PMUs; respondents
       from the financial sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector
       organizations; respondents from NGOs/community based organizations, private
       foundations, youth groups, and trade unions were combined in the “CSO” category; and
       the small number of respondents from local governments, bilateral/multilateral agencies,

       were no respondents from faith-based groups.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group

     Stakeholder groups: respondents from the office of the Prime Minister/Minister,
      employees of a ministry/PMU, and consultants working WBG projects are significantly
      more familiar with the work of the WBG in Malaysia than respondents from other

     Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
      with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Malaysia, and significantly,
      moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG is perceived to be playing a
      relevant role in development in Malaysia.

Appendix D: Responses to Selected Questions by Year3
All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number of respondents
indicated will be slightly different from the aggregated responses in Appendix A. Similarly, responses from FY 2013
respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2013 COS report.

FY 2013 Number of comparable respondents = 67  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 256

By weighting, the FY 2013 data has the same stakeholder composition as it is in FY 2016. Therefore, the two years
are comparable. Respondents from the office of a parliamentarian, PMUs, multilateral agencies, private
foundations, trade unions, faith-based groups, youth groups, and the judiciary branch were not included in the year
comparison analysis, because there were no respondents from faith-based groups in FY 2016 and no respondents
from the office of a parliamentarian, PMUs, multilateral agencies, private foundations, trade unions, youth groups,
the judiciary branch in FY 2013. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:
