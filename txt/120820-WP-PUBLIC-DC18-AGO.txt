About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

        of company as the Guichê has 4 di erent types of statutes. The business

      The applicant must submit the company's documents to the Notary Public at
      the One-stop shop or Guichê Único da Empresa. Once the Notary reviews
      the dossier, he will have a reading with the applicant present or the

      included in the Guichê fees and this takes one day, depending on room
      availability and complexity of the company’s Articles of incorporation.

      Once the documents are reviewed, the notary makes 4 copies which are
      signed and sent to each of the agencies involved for approval and ling.
      Copies are distributed to the representatives of the Commercial Registry, the
      National Press (Imprensa National), National Institute of Statistics, Tax o ce
      of the Ministry of Finance, Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Public
      Administration, Employment, and Social Security.


      Each agent from each institution is in charge of sending the les to his/her
      agency, but this doesn't impede on the process of registration. For Imprensa
      National, the receipt is su cient to continue the process. Despite the fact
      that law says that documents should be published before getting the license
      to operate, the system at Imprensa National makes it unlikely for daily or
      weekly publication, therefore the Ministry of Commerce uses the receipt as
      proof.

      For company and employee registration with Social Security, the required
      forms must be downloaded, completed and presented to the One-stop
      shop, so that they can be submitted to the relevant authority.

      Guichê Único da Empresa with authority to deliver the accreditation that the

submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

      This is often a time-consuming procedure taking up to one year or more.
      However, it is assumed in the case study that BuildCo already owns the land.

      BuildCo must obtain a proof of title of property for the land from the Real
      Estate Registry in Luanda. An updated certi cate of the property ("certidão
      predial") is obtained from the relevant Real Estate Registry. It sets out a full
      description of the property, including information on its owner and any
      charges, liens or encumbrances pending on the property.

      The total fee for the "certidão predial" includes: stamp duty (calculated
      according to the Law on Stamp Duty); justice fees (calculated according to
      the Law on Justice Fees); fees to justice o cers (according to the set
      contributions for the Justice budget); notary fees and other fees. The total
      fee is also dependent on the current value of the scal unit (UCF), currently
      at AOA 88.00, according to Despacho no. 174/11 of March 11, 2011.

      The fees, varying according to project size and location, must be paid to the

                      information to obtain from the tax certi cate is whether the property was
                      ever con scated by the State upon freedom from Portugal. Sometimes this
                      information will not be included in the tax certi cate. In this case, the buyer
                      or his/her lawyer has to search the records of the O cal Gazette (Diario da
                      Republica) to con rm that there were no con scation dispatches covering

      An updated tax certi cate is obtained from the relevant Tax O ce, detailing
      the description of the property (Certidão Matricial). An important piece of
      information to obtain from the tax certi cate is whether the property was
      ever con scated by the State upon freedom from Portugal. Sometimes this
      information will not be included in the tax certi cate. In this case, the buyer
      or his/her lawyer has to search the records of the O cal Gazette (Diario da
      Republica) to con rm that there were no con scation dispatches covering
      the property. The Certidão Matricial contains the name of the current owner
      and an estimated value of the property.

      An updated certi cate of the property ("certidão predial") is obtained from
      the relevant Real Estate Registry. It sets out a full description of the property,
      including information of its owner and any charges, liens or encumbrances
      pending over the property.


      The total fee for the "certidão predial" includes: (i) Stamp duty (calculated
      according to the Law on Stamp Duty); (ii) Justice fees (calculated according to
      the Law on Justice Fees); (iii) Fees to justice o cers (according to the set
      contributions for the Justice budget); (iv) Notary fees and (v) other fees. The

      A statement by the seller setting out the sales value or a copy of the
      Promissory Agreement of Sale and Purchase signed by both parties has to
      be presented to the tax authorities. The chief o cial of the tax
      administration o ce has to agree to the value of the transaction. If the tax
      authorities deem it necessary, an inspector may go to evaluate the property
      for tax purposes. Once the value of the transaction has been agreed to by
      the tax authorities, the Sisa tax will be applied to that value. The tax
      authorities will issue a receipt upon payment of the transfer tax (Sisa), which
      will be given to the notary public as part of Procedure 5. Typically, the
      transfer tax is only paid when the parties have agreed between them and
      with a notary public a xed date for the execution of the required notary
      deed.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

                                                       several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the        - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                    and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                        economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                       - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                       - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees                                     equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)             - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                       commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.
  Court structure and proceedings (-1-5)
                                                       - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                               - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                 - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                       movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
