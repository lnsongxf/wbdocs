Executive Summary
1.       There is no shortage of challenges for Romania today: developmen t needs
remain high, while funding for infrastructure projects continues to be in short supply,
even with the emergence of dedicated EU and state-budget investment programs. If the
vision is an accelerated path to full convergence with the EU, it becomes of paramount
importance to “do more with less” when deploying limited funding available for public
investments. This would require fulfilling a dual desideratum: first, minimize duplication
and inefficiencies across infrastructure projects; second, encourage integrated
interventions that reinforce and bolster each other’s impact. In this context, the
coordination of infrastructure strategies, investment programs, and projects, at both intra -
sectoral and inter-sectoral levels, promises to be an effective way to promote Romania’s
sustainable and inclusive development.

2.      This report provides a diagnostic and a set of recommendations for the
coordination of infrastructure investments in three main sectors in Romania: roads;
water and wastewater; and social infrastructure (education, health, culture, and sports).
The proposals formulated are targeted primarily at the main client of this work, the
Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA) and specifically at
the Directorate General for Regional Development and Infrastructure (DG RDI), which
manages the most important state-budget-funded program for local infrastructure
investments – the National Local Development Program (PNDL). Other key stakeholders
include the Center of Government (CoG), the Ministry of Public Finances, the Ministry of
European Funds, other central authorities in charge of EU and/or state-funded investment
programs, Regional Development Agencies, and county and local councils. While
customized for the PNDL, the recommendations that follow can be replicated across all
state-budget-funded investment programs.

3.       If the overarching goal of this work is to offer solutions for enhancing
coordination, the first key question to answer is: why coordinate? Coordination refers to
the capacity of different stakeholders to work together for achieving specific goals. There
are two reasons to coordinate public infrastructure interventions: to reduce costs and to
increase benefits. In resource-constrained environments, it has become vital to deliver the
most impact possible with the least funds. For example, if two or more authorities are
implementing investment programs that have the same goals and target the same
beneficiaries, they are likely duplicating their efforts and missing out on cost-saving
opportunities through consolidation of operations. The same goes for beneficiaries who,
for a variety of reasons, choose to finance their infrastructure projects through more
expensive funding sources (e.g., state budget funds instead of EU structural funds). By the
same token, lack of coordination implies failure to leverage synergies across different
investments. If a new school or hospital gets built, the road connecting to it should also be
rehabilitated. If a county finances a particular county road, the neighboring authorities may
want to consider financing a county road that connects to that investment. In some cases,
it may make better sense to connect to the next commune’s water and sanitation network
than to build a new system from scratch. The examples could go on and on, but the simple
point is that coordination makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts.



                                                                                           2
4.      In truth, the need to coordinate is inescapable in many ways – both vertically
(across administrative levels) and horizontally (across sectors and/or across jurisdictions).
Regarding the former dimension, very few local governments have the capacity to support
the investments they need entirely from their own funds, especially in countries that have
not decentralized fully. Based on prudent capital expenditure margins, more than three in
four communes in Romania can only afford to rehabilitate one road and one school during
the 2014-2020 programing cycle. 1 Local government units simply do not have the financial
and human resources needed to address the basic infrastructure needs of local
communities, so other actors need to intervene to fill the gaps – regional authorities (in
countries where regions have formal administrative powers, which is not yet the case in
Romania), the national government (through a variety of state-budget-funded programs),
or supranational authorities like the European Union. As for horizontal coordination, very
few investments depend on a single sector: roads cross railroads and power lines,
wastewater treatment plants influence the quality of water bodies, schools and hospitals
function well only if there is sufficient demand for their services and hence proper
connectivity with people in surrounding areas, etc. The simple but important point is that
proper coordination of public investments is a must in any policy context.

5.       This is not to say that coordination is a given – quite the contrary – and,
ultimately, there is only so much that central authorities can do to ensure it at lower
administrative levels without affecting the principle of subsidiarity. Coordination is
challenging, time consuming, and may require institutions giving up individual decision-
making power in favor of a collective forum of stakeholders. At the same time, counties,
cities, towns, and communes across Romania have their own mandates, carry out their
own attributions, and deliver their own services to constituents. Subsidiarity ensures that
decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizens. Particularly for smaller value
projects that local authorities can cover from their own budgets, it may not be possible for
the national government to influence how such investments are designed and
implemented. Even in the case of the PNDL and other similar programs, central-level
stakeholders are in fact financing functions and services that are in the local domain. It is
thus hard for higher-level strategies to translate directly into local and county projects.
They cannot be imposed; instead, special conditions and incentives are needed to make the
perceived benefits of coordination exceed the costs.

6.      At the same time, to paraphrase a local saying, Romania is too poor to afford not
to coordinate properly. With resources flowing from the central government and from the
EU, rather than from own resources through local taxation, there has been a tendency to
overinvest and invest sub-optimally into objectives that do not always generate the
appropriate economic returns (“cathedrals in the desert”). In Romania, over 80% of the
capital spending in the public sector is done by local authorities (including through EU
funds and central government transfers). There is little coordination across ministries: each
key ministry appears to have its own “investment program,” usually resembling simple
earmarked transfers for capital investments from the central to the local level. The MRDPA
manages the bulk of funding for supporting local-level investments. For its part, the

Ministry of Finance has its own role to play in managing fiscal risks and ensuring that
expenses committed to through various investment instruments can indeed be afforded
under national budget constraints.

7.       This report presents multiple instruments for promoting coordination: dedicated
platforms, harmonization of investment programs (design, financing criteria, producers),
and knowledge sharing of good practices at the local level. Dedicated platforms for
coordination include bodies specifically created for this purpose (e.g., inter-ministerial
committees) and usually require action from the Center of Government. The harmonization
of investment instruments, particularly across EU and state-funded sources, depends on
each Managing Authority (i.e., line ministry) responsible for program design and
implementation – including the MRDPA for the PNDL. Last but not least, as suggested
earlier, much of the coordination efforts need to be undertaken at and by the local/county
level. The central government can help disseminate good practices across local authorities.

Diagnostic
8.       There is broad consensus – in policy circles and beyond – that there are major
gaps in the coordination of public infrastructure investments in Romania, at all levels.
Perhaps the most often cited examples refer to the inefficient sequencing of investments,
whereby a newly rehabilitated road is damaged by subsequent public works related to the
rehabilitation of utility networks. Such situations often result in media articles and public
outrage regarding the inefficient spending of taxpayer money. In effect, this simple
example is indicative of the broader challenge of coordination faced by public authorities in



                                                                                                                    4
Romania, across all phases of an investment’s cycle: from the development of a s trategy to
the design of an investment program to the financing, implementation, and monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) of individual infrastructure projects.

9.       First, the cross-sectoral and sectoral strategies that should guide the allocation of
scarce public resources often demonstrate room for improvement. Coordination
challenges often originate in the large number of existing sectoral and cross-sectoral
strategies, with overlapping and unclear objectives. There are no clear standards for
developing such documents. Strategies are not easily accessible, so they are hard to refer
to and correlate with, and typically remain broad wish lists, without specifying: clear
priorities, budgets, implementation timeline and action steps, and M&E indicators. There is
no institution explicitly mandated to review all available strategies and decide how they
“fit” together and what their policy and budgetary implications are. Equally important,
there are no M&E procedures for the strategies developed to decide on whether they are
needed, whether they are appropriate, and whether their goals are fulfilled.

10.      Second, state-budget-funded investment programs like the PNDL are not always
properly designed, and a systematic effort to coordinate intervention areas is lacking.
Typically, state-funded programs have no strategic document at their foundation and they
are not guided by a clear operational framework. Much of the poor coordination,
duplication, and inefficiency can be traced back to the failure to clearly demarcate and
synergize types of interventions between and among EU and state-funded investments. In
addition, procedures are more lax under state-budget programs than those applicable to
EU funds (e.g., simpler applications, largely based on technical documentation only; quicker
disbursement of funds; fewer monitoring visits and audits; etc.). This generates the risk of
crowding out structural instruments, while Romania remains last in EU funds’ absorption
(52.59% at the end of January 2015, with less than one year to go to spend the balance). 2

11.      Third, the prioritization of state-budget-funded projects relies on financing
criteria that remain vague, subjective, and opaque, and project selection is much less
rigorous than under EU structural funds. There is usually no clear algorithm for deciding
among a variety of proposed investments. Moreover, state-budget-funded programs
operate on annual budgets, so there is a lot of instability and priorities may shift from year
to year, which discourages larger and more strategic investment programs. Instead, what
happens in practice is that there is a significant and ever-growing portfolio of new and
ongoing investment projects, in various phases. Without a defined budget for a
multiannual implementation period and without a list of investments that, once selected,
are guaranteed funding until completion, prioritization is essentially impossible.

12.    Fourth, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mechanisms at the level of state-
funded programs and projects are rudimentary. There is no systematic tracking of basic
key indicators of a program’s performance (number of completed projects, value of
ongoing projects vs. annual budgetary allocation, number of new projects, etc.) or, if such
data exist, they are not made public. No impact assessments are carried out, so it is

                                                                                            5
impossible to determine if state-budget-funded projects are reaching their objectives or if
they need to be adjusted in terms of design and/or implementation procedures.

13.      On top of everything, the overall environment in Romania is no t particularly
conducive to coordination, for a myriad of reasons. There is no solid history of
collaboration among public institutions. Coordination happens on an ad-hoc basis, if at all,
and there are few formal requirements for public actors to consult with each other and
work together to accomplish common goals. The infrastructure for sharing information and
collaborating efficiently and effectively (e.g., modern and interoperable IT platforms) is
largely missing, which means that coordination takes time. At the same time, public
employees are poorly paid; particularly those involved in the design and implementation of
infrastructure projects are very busy with operational tasks and various emergencies. This
leaves even less time for coordination efforts.


Fostering an Enabling Environment for Coordination
14.     There are four core principles of an enabling environment for effective
coordination of infrastructure investments: trust; accountability; capacity; and
information systems. These cross-themes influence the quality of the process of
coordination for all the dimensions discussed in this report: across administrative levels;
across players/programs; across sectors; across phases of a cycle of investment strategies/
programs/projects.
    Trust:
      o Coordination ultimately always occurs between people – not between amorphous
        institutions or sectors. This is why building a culture of collaboration is
        quintessential for instilling coordination in the DNA of any organization. A key
        corollary is the need to reduce turnover of critical staff and consolidate capacity.
      o The MRDPA should: i) organize special training programs for staff on how to
        enhance collaboration; and (ii) collect and disseminate good practices from around
        the country regarding internal (within an organization, across various units) and
        external (across organizations) coordination.
    Accountability :
      o Coordination should be included in the list of formal responsibilities corresponding
        to each authority in charge of designing and implementing public infrastructure
        investments. This would trickle down all the way to the Bylaws and the required
        individual staff competencies and performance matrix (“fișa postului”).
      o As the line ministry in charge of public administration, the MRDPA should
        spearhead the “coordination agenda” for Romania’s public sector and hold local
        authorities and other institutions accountable for their efforts.
    Capacity :
      o Who will do the challenging work of coordinating across departments/
        institutions/sectors/administrative levels? This is not a task that can be outsourced,
        but one that requires active involvement from insiders (experienced staff who
        knows the system and can navigate it across institutional and jurisdictional lines).




                                                                                            6
      o Particularly in the context of low-paid positions in Romania’s public administration,
        with monthly wages of around EUR 400 or lower, such specialists are very hard to
        come by and tend to be in very high demand.
      o The MRDPA’s role would be to lead the effort to enhance public authorities’ ability
        to manage human capital, reward/sanction employees, and raise salaries to
        competitive levels. This would help ensure lower turnover of critical staff and allow
        them to dedicate time to coordination.
    Information systems :
      o Effective coordination also depends on comprehensive, timely, and accurate
        information flows among all stakeholders involved. Information is power and one
        cannot manage what one does not measure.
      o Romania has not yet aligned databases across public institutions. Even units within
        the same ministry sometimes use incompatible systems.
      o The MRDPA’s role would be to develop (in-house or through outsourcing) a
        common database of public infrastructure investments in Romania to facilitate
        real-time information sharing and coordination.

Targeted Strategies and Action Steps for Enhanced Coordination of Strategies and Plans
15.      The first step is to develop, refine, and approve a set of coordinated strategies
underpinning investment programs to ensure proper demarcation of intervention areas.
The MRDPA cannot directly lead this effort, but it can support the Center of Government
(the Prime Minister’s Chancellery) – which sometimes maintains a relatively weak role vis-
à-vis line ministries – to supervise the development of strategies and their implementation
through a dedicated Strategy Unit (SU). The SU would be under the Prime Minister’s direct
coordination. Building on current legislation (Government Decisions 870/2006 and
775/2005), it would rationalize the number of strategies and adopt a set of common
standards for their development. The SU would also monitor how these strategies translate
into investment programs and further into projects. In particular, the unit would ensure
that investment programs are properly designed, with clear synergies among them,
following the example of EU funds. The SU would also play the main M&E role with respect
to the performance of investment programs, tracking key data like annual project
completion ratio, annual increase in ongoing investments, etc. The Prime Minister would
thus be able to recommend data-driven adjustments to current investment programs and,
as needed, their expansion/merger/termination, in line with their performance.

Targeted Strategies and Action Steps for Enhanced Coordination of Investment Programs
16.     Most coordination opportunities arise in the harmonization of frameworks and
procedures applicable to EU and state-funded investment programs. The former have
introduced a variety of new tools in the Romanian context (e.g., strategic and integrated
planning, rigorous public procurement, monitoring and evaluation of performance, etc.)
and have generated a true shift in the mindset of public sector staff. From hundreds of
interviews with local, regional, and central authorities, conducted since 2012 as part of the
World Bank’s technical assistance for Romania’s regional development, one conclusion
holds true at all levels: staff working on EU programs are more motivated, more creative,
and more rigorous in the design and implementation of public infrastructure investments.




                                                                                           7
Romania therefore faces a great opportunity to leverage the learnings from the
implementation of EU funds and replicate them in state-budget-funded programs.

17.      Indeed, EU-funded programmes have a much better track record than state-
funded programs, despite low overall absorption rates. As a point of comparison, in 1994,
the Romanian Government launched the National Program for the Modernization of
National Roads and Construction of Highways. The Program proposed the modernization of
11,300 km of national roads in 15 phases, by 2014. However, in the 20 years since its start,
only 20% of the planned length was completed, and only 3 of the 15 phases were closed. A
similar experience was registered with the Priority Program for the Development of
Highways, or the various state-budget-funded programs started over the years to finance
infrastructure investments at the local level. By contrast, the management of EU funds has
improved over the past few years (as did the absorption rates), and instruments like the
Regional Operational Programme (ROP), managed by the MRDPA, have been good
performers even when benchmarked against similar programs in other Member States. 3

18.      The suboptimal performance of state-budget-funded programs can be improved
through a number of key elements adapted from EU-financed interventions, with the
caveat that proposed measures should factor in capacity constraints. Indeed, the capacity
to process applications and oversee projects is much lower in departments responsible for
state-budget-funded programs versus Managing Authorities of EU structural funds (fewer
staff, lower wages, etc.). Compared to the ROP, for instance, a program like the PNDL is
characterized by a larger portfolio of smaller investments, on average – as shown in
chapter 2 – which calls for simpler yet equally rigorous procedures throughout the project
cycle. Equally important, previous assessments of EU funds, including by the World Bank, 4
have noted the signs of excessive bureaucratization in how the Romanian Government
implements EU regulations, so it is important to adopt only the elements that work well.

19.    The following action steps are defined primarily in relation to the PNDL in this
report, but effectively apply to all state-budget-funded programs, including other
programs managed by DG RDI:
     Anchor the PNDL in a rigorous and stable strategic framework over a longer
      programming cycle. To ensure that limited public funds are deployed to achieve the
      largest possible impact, it is important to strategize, plan, and identify clear priorities.
      Ideally, the programming period would be the same as for EU funds (seven years plus
      two-three years for finalization of investments). This will not only enable the possibility
      to finance more impactful projects, but it will also foster better coordination and
      harmonization of all programs – i.e., operational programs financing similar
      investments could draw on a joint strategy and would look to contribute toward the
      same goals. Once the strategic framework is agreed upon, the next step is to develop
      the operational document for state-funded programs – i.e., the Applicant Guide. This
      would explain the overall rules for implementing the program (e.g., the PNDL), offering
      in-depth descriptions of investment axes and eligible types of interventions, eligible

  expenditures, eligibility criteria (types of beneficiaries), and evaluation and selection
  criteria.
 Adopt multi-year budgeting to enable more strategic investments and finance new
  investments only when funds required by ongoing projects are fully covered. Without
  multi-year budgets, there is little predictability for beneficiaries (their projects may
  receive funding this year and none the next), there is a tendency to finance smaller
  and less impactful projects (investments financed through PNDL 2014 were on average
  three times smaller than similar projects financed through ROP 2007-2013 and PNDR
  2007-2013), and it is hard to do proper strategic planning (yearly investment programs
  can only finance the projects submitted for financing for that particular year).
  Especially for a program like the PNDL, which now has a portfolio of nearly 4,000
  projects (significantly larger than only a year ago), it is important to decide what
  budget can be expected year-on-year to finish (at least some of) the projects started.
  Multiple steps are required, including: rationalization of current portfolio; setting a
  budgetary baseline covering annual costs of all ongoing projects remaining in the
  portfolio; and allocation of funds for new investments only when/if excess resources
  exist – not just for the first year, but for future years’ baseline as well.
 Set a clear, fixed implementation timeline for completing projects . Beneficiaries of EU
  funds know that they have a clear deadline by which they have to use funds, i.e., they
  risk losing those funds if they do not complete the investment in due time. Under state-
  budget-funded programs there is no time restriction and many investments, even small
  ones, are continued for years on end, drawing funds from a limited pool to keep the
  investment going, often at a minimum effort level. Countless construction sites linger
  around Romania, without a push to complete such works before approving new ones.
 Harmonize eligibility and selection criteria. Beneficiaries of EU funds operate within a
  procedural framework that is clearly defined at the beginning of a program and stays
  relatively constant over the full programming period. In the case of state-budget-
  funded programs, rules are often unclear and, when they do exist, they change every
  year or even more frequently. This leaves room for interpretation and ad-hoc
  implementation, reducing predictability and transparency for program applicants and
  beneficiaries, for their service providers (e.g., contractors of infrastructure works), for
  the Ministry of Public Finances that needs to budget according to the money spent in a
  given year, etc. The eligibility of investments should be decided based on what can and
  should be covered along with EU funds – either to contribute to the same goals in
  sectors where needs are too high to rely only on structural instruments (the
  “equivalency” approach) or to fill gaps left unaddressed by EU funds (th e
  “complementarity” approach). T here should also be transparent, fair, and rigorously
  enforced selection criteria, along with harmonized contracting for all applicants.
 Direct interested applicants to EU financing first, but build a pipeline of proposals
  that can be channeled to either EU or state-budget funds . If a proposed project can be
  eligible for EU funding (i.e., in sectors where the “equivalency” approach holds), the
  MRDPA and other ministries managing state-budget-funded investments should first
  direct applicants to EU grants (i.e., the cheaper financing). This may be a question of
  awareness-raising or it may require a hard constraint to only accept an application if it
  proves that it is either ineligible for EU funds or that it is “eligible but not financeable”


                                                                                             9
      (because of EU funds running out under certain axes/intervention areas). In any case,
      the harmonization of rules and procedures will ensure that investments in the pipeline
      may be eligible for either EU funds or the state budget, which would help boost
      absorption of all available financing sources. The next final report focused specifically
      on prioritization criteria (due August 27, 2015) will elaborate on instruments for
      channeling projects to different instruments, drawing from draft/final programming
      and implementation documents for EU funds for 2014-2020. 5
     Implement stronger M&E mechanisms at the program level. First, the PNDL and other
      state-budget-funded programs should set performance indicators for the entire
      program (e.g., number of projects, total beneficiaries, absorption rates, etc.) and for
      each sector (length of rehabilitated roads, number of additional people with access to
      water and sanitation, etc.). Second, to enable the monitoring process to run smoothly,
      a Monitoring Committee should be established, including both staff of the MRDPA and
      representatives of the beneficiaries (e.g., one representative per county). Monitoring
      should also rely on Intermediate Bodies (County Councils, Regional Development
      Agencies, or another institution of choice) and on local communities themselves.
     Enforce stronger monitoring at the project level. Proper monitoring is the first step in
      enabling the MRDPA to correct issues promptly as they develop during the project
      implementation phase. For its part, the MRDPA should continue to have the overall
      program monitoring role, with specific project monitoring visits scheduled based on a
      defined methodology (e.g., as mentioned earlier, larger/more complex projects should
      be more carefully scrutinized). Also, the MRDPA should rely on a set of independent
      auditors and/or on more formal Intermediate Bodies for this task. There are two main
      options for fulfilling the IB role: County Councils or Regional Development Agencies
      (see section 5.3.1. for a discussion of pros and cons of the two scenarios).
     Harmonized post-implementation procedures. The first step in establishing a proper
      M&E system for the post-implementation phase is to define and agree on a set of
      performance indicators for each financed project. At a minimum, chosen indicators
      should abide by the “SMART” set of criteria: specific, measurable, attainable, relevant,
      and time-oriented. There is also a need to continue monitoring visits in the field for a
      number of years after the completion of the investment. Again, this can be done with
      the support of independent auditors and/or IBs. Last but not least, the MRDPA should
      leverage the experience of beneficiaries who successfully complete PNDL projects and
      involve them in dedicated knowledge-sharing mechanisms.

Targeted Strategies and Action Steps for Enhanced Coordination of Investment Projects
20.     At the level of projects, the key to effective coordination lies with the main
beneficiary of an investment grant – i.e., the county/local authority. For all the
aforementioned reasons, however, subnational governments lack the capacity to properly
coordinate investments’ planning, implementation, and M&E. The MRDPA should also
promote a set of good practices for local-level coordination, collected from authorities


5
 As of February 2015, there are no approved operational programmes for 2014-2020. Moreover,
there are no publicly available Applicant Guides for EU-funded programs (including eligibility and
selection criteria for various interventions)


                                                                                               10
around the country. For example, some mayors can propose to their local council a
sequenced, calculated approach to needed infrastructure investments – i.e., making sure
that they first invest in underground networks of utilities and only then move on to road
rehabilitation. Consultations with public service providers (electricity, gas, water,
wastewater, etc.) are equally critical to ensure that investment plans are fully correlated.

21.     In addition to capacity building and knowledge sharing activities, the MRDPA can
also encourage improved coordination across jurisdictions through specific
conditionalities/incentives. One idea worth exploring further is to specifically encourage
project proposals that involve multiple local authorities for added impact. This could be
done through explicit eligibility criteria or by awarding bonus points to such initiatives in
the evaluation process. Some legislative amendments are also needed to facilitate such
arrangements and simplify the current framework applicable to associations of local
governments (e.g., these entities should be considered public institutions; they should have
the power of credit holder; etc.). This would be in line with the EU’s approach – for
instance, through the Integrated Territorial Investment (ITI) and the Community-Led Local
Development (CLLD) instruments – as well as with the Regional Operational Programme
2014-2020, which has asked multiple counties to come together in each development
region and submit county road projects jointly.

Conclusions
22.      In sum, enhancing the coordination of public investments in Romania will require
both an enabling environment and targeted measures for harmonizing strategies,
investment programs, and projects. In addition to the recommendations summarized
above for the MRDPA specifically, positive results will also depend on supporting and
strengthening a number of existing mechanisms for the coordination of public
infrastructure investments. These include: (i) at the national level, the coordination
committees set up through the Partnership Agreement, the aforementioned SU under the
Prime Minister’s Office, and the Unit for Evaluating Public Investments (UEIP) under the
Ministry of Finance; (ii) at the regional level, Regional Development Councils (RDCs) and
Regional Development Agencies (RDAs); (iii) at the local level, integrated planning
instruments (i.e., Integrated Urban Development Plans – PIDUs), which were first
introduced for the 2007-2013 programming period and, despite some gaps (reviewed in a
2013 World Bank report on the topic), remain a step in the right direction.

23.     The following two tables summarize the targeted strategies and specific action
steps proposed for enhancing intra- and inter-sectoral coordination. In some cases, the
adoption of proposed measures depends primarily on the MRDPA; in other cases, the
involvement of other institutional stakeholders will be required. By adopting these
proposals, two key objectives will be fulfilled by strengthening the coordination of
strategies and plans for public investments: (i) state-budget-funded investments, including
those managed by DG RDI, will better complement and buttress infrastructure investments
made with EU funds, as well as other infrastructure investments made with public or
private funds; and (ii) investments managed by DG RDI will help attain the objectives
established by the regional operational program for the 2014-2020 programming period.

Introduction
24.     The Government of Romania (GOR) has asked the World Bank to support its
efforts to harmonize and optimize public investments financed by the European Union
and from the state budget. The objectives of this work are to encourage synergies, deliver
stronger impact, and promote Romania's sustainable and inclusive growth. At this point in
Romania’s development, basic infrastructure needs far exceed available funds, which
makes it critically important to prioritize and coordinate investments to maximize impact.
This engagement is a follow-up to the World Bank’s Regional Development Program in
Romania, implemented between November 2012 and March 2014, and continues to be
based on the January 2012 Memorandum of Understanding on Partnership and Support in
the Implementation of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds in Romania and Modernization of
Public Administration. This work includes the following four components:
       Component 1 – Assistance with the coordination of strategies and plans for EU and
        state-funded investments in infrastructure;
       Component 2 – Advisory services related to the existing portfolio of investment
        projects in MRDPA, including their optimal prioritization and preparation of
        potential EU-funded investments for the 2014-2020 programming period;
       Component 3 – Assistance with improving the use of efficient designs and
        technologies in investments managed by the MRDPA;
       Component 4 – Assistance with the design of a Housing and Infrastructure
        Development Strategy.

25.     The first component mentioned above further includes two sets of reports, as
follows:
            a. Analysis of infrastructure investment strategies, including ways to improve
               their coordination and correlation;
            b. Prioritization strategy for state-budget-funded projects, based on selection
               criteria harmonized with those used for EU-funded projects.
The current final report corresponds to the former sub-component (in italics) on the
harmonization of infrastructure investment strategies, with a strong focus on the three
sectors that are of particular importance for regional development in Romania: roads (at
local and county level); water and wastewater; and social infrastructure. The assessment
covers the full cycle – i.e., from defining an investment program through project selection,
implementation and post-implementation. At every stage, the main theme explored relates
to the need for a harmonized approach and for enhanced coordination to deliver stronger
impact through infrastructure investments. The other report prepared under this
component goes one step further in proposing very specific prioritization and selection
criteria and procedures.

26.     To understand current synergies and overlaps within and across sectors, this
report assesses investment strategies and programs, as well as institutional mechanisms
involved in the formulation, approval, and coordination of infrastructure projects. In



                                                                                         14
accordance with the agreement between the MRDPA and the World Bank, the following
are covered: (i) state-funded interventions carried out under the supervision of the
Directorate General for Regional Development and Infrastructure (DG RDI) under the
MRDPA, primarily through the National Local Development Program (PNDL) since 2012 and
other programs (before 2012); (ii) state-budget-funded interventions carried out by other
ministries (e.g., the Environment Fund under the Ministry of Environment and Climate
Change); and (iii) EU-funded instruments supporting infrastructure investments in relevant
sectors, most notably the Regional Operational Programme (ROP) 2007-2013 and 2014-
2020, the National Rural Development Programme (PNDR) 2007-2013 and 2014-2020, and
the Sectoral Operational Programme Environment (SOP Environment) 2007-2013 and the
Large Infrastructure Operational Programme (LI OP) 2014-2020.

27.      Based on this comprehensive assessment, this final report includes
recommendations for harmonizing investments in the MRDPA portfolio (mainly under
the PNDL) with other interventions financed from the state budget and from EU funds.
The main topic is the effective coordination of infrastructure investments at the local,
regional, and national level through enhanced policy, institutional, and financial
mechanisms. In addition, the proposed targeted strategies and specific action steps put
forth in this report provide answers to two critical, interrelated questions:
       How can DG RDI’s investments – i.e., the PNDL – complement and buttress EU-
        funded investments and other public/private interventions?
       How can DG RDI’s investments – i.e., the PNDL – help attain the objectives
        established by the 2014-2020 ROP?


Context
28.     Romania today displays a complex picture of great hopes and remarkable
development potential, in the context of persistent challenges in many vital sectors. It is
beyond any doubt that the country still has a long way to go in terms of providing its
citizens – all citizens, including the poor and the marginalized – the infrastructure and
public services they need to share and add to the benefits of development. Examples of
gaps abound and are hard to miss (e.g., deficient transport infrastructure, lack of access to
water and sanitation in certain rural areas, governance challenges, etc.), particularly in
comparison to the situation in other EU Member States. But it is also true that Romania has
taken important steps toward sustainable and inclusive growth. Positive results,
particularly in large urban centers – with Bucharest surpassing cities like Madrid, Lisbon,
and Athens in terms of GDP per capita (PPP) – confirm Romania’s growth potential,
provided that citizens become truly enabled to seek and reach opportunities.

29.      The World Bank’s 2013 “Competitive Cities” report argues that the key to
unlocking Romania’s growth potential involves interventions customized to the needs of
leading and lagging areas. The first priority is to invest in improved connectivity and
accessibility (both within leading areas and between leading and lagging regions), enabling
people to take advantage of opportunities in Romania and abroad. Second, particularly in
lagging areas, the government should invest in functioning institutions that ensure basic
living standards for communities – essentially, the same start in life for all citizens

  (including running water, sewage, electricity, good schooling, effective land and housing
  markets, healthcare, etc.). Finally, marginalized communities require targeted efforts to
  address the specific obstacles they face (e.g., discrimination, exclusion, etc.). The chart
  below is a snapshot of recommended types of interventions for leading and lagging areas.

  30.      The basic condition for addressing Romania’s development needs – required,
  though not sufficient – is access to financial resources for critical investments. In
  particular, infrastructure projects like roads and water and sewage networks are typically
  very costly and complex, putting a significant strain on local, county, and national budgets.
  Because of strict targets with respect to annual budget deficits, Romania does not have
  much leeway to significantly expand infrastructure development programs from its own
  budget sources. In this context, non-reimbursable funds from the European Union (EU),
  amounting to around EUR 40 billion for the 2014-2020 programming period, are an
  essential source of investment money. But past experience suggest that Romania faces
  significant constraints that have limited its capacity to absorb such funds, for a variety of
  reasons: incomplete alignment with EU legislation and best practices, particularly in the
  area of public procurement; lack of resources for co-financing and running costs of EU-



                                                                                                               16
funded projects; local public authorities’ weak capacity to prepare, implement, monitor,
and evaluate complex interventions; heavy bureaucracy and excessive audits, etc. 6 As of
January 31, 2015, Romania’s absorption rate – despite significant progress made in 2013
and 2014 – remained the lowest in the EU at 51.87%.

31.      The need for infrastructure investments in Romania is considerable and the
corresponding costs far exceed what EU funds alone can cover, even if the government
was successful at driving the absorption close to 100%. For example, in 2012, 34,000 km
of county and communal roads were made of gravel or stone and required modernization,
at a cost of around EUR 6-12 billion. Moreover, around 21,000 km of county and communal
roads may require rehabilitation, at an estimated cost of around EUR 3.5-5-7 billion. As a
point of comparison, only EUR 0.87 billion were allocated for the modernization/
rehabilitation/extension of county and urban roads under the ROP 2007-2013.
Furthermore, by 2018, around EUR 20 billion need to be invested in the water and
wastewater infrastructure to increase the share of Romanians with access to such
infrastructure to at least 70% (from 52% in 2004), in li ne with Romania’s commitments
made through the EU Accession Agreement upon joining in 2007. However, only around
EUR 3.3 billion have been allocated for such investments under the SOP Environment 2007-
2013.

32.     Looking ahead to 2014-2020, allocations from the EU continue to fill only part of
the financing gap. As the following table shows, to address all needs in the county and
communal roads, water and wastewater, and social infrastructure sectors, Romania would
need to contribute over EUR 30 billion through 2020 in addition to available EU funds. This
is a huge burden for the national budget.

33.      While the causes for current challenges may be complex, the overall message is
simple: Romania still faces great development needs and has limited financial resources,
making value for money a principle of paramount importance for its public investments.
Put differently, the government should pursue an agenda focused on maximizing impact
for the given funding available for investment programs, from the EU and/or from the state
budget. In this endeavor, it is critical to ensure that investment funding is allocated based
on clear, fair, and effective selection criteria and goes toward interventions that are
designed and implemented in a coordinated fashion. If such principles and procedures are
typically upheld in the disbursement of EU funds, including through the Regional
Operational Programme (ROP), 7 state-budget-funded interventions have shown
weaknesses in this respect in the past.

34.     This is where the issue of coordination of public investments comes into play, as
an essential ingredient to maximizing the development impact of every leu, euro, or
dollar spent on infrastructure. For one, lack of coordination means that EU and state-
budget-funded investment programs overlap and often “compete” for the same pool of
beneficiaries. This issue is not new to the current Romanian context. The 2011 World Bank
Functional Review of Romania’s regional development sector recommended that programs
funded 100% from the state budget “[should] avoid duplication with EU -supported
[interventions].”8 Moreover, to preserve a fair competitive setting, similar investment
programs should have similar implementation rules. In practice, however, state-budget-
funded programs are much less strict than EU structural instruments, as described in the
example below.
             Box 1. The PNDI showed clear gaps in coordination with EU funds

          The now-defunct National Program for Infrastructure Development (PNDI) , a EUR 4
          billion program supported by the GOR, could have effectively crowded out EU-funded
          structural instruments like the ROP, OP Environment, and the National Rural
          Development Programme (PNDR). First, the PNDI targeted similar types of infrastructure
          investments (e.g., county roads, water and sewage networks, etc.). Second, it lacked
          rigorous and transparent selection processes, and staff in the then Ministry of Regional
          Development and Tourism (MRDT) became quickly overwhelmed with funding requests
          and technical documentations (e.g., prefeasibility and feasibility studies, detailed
          technical designs, etc.) submitted by public beneficiaries from across the country. There
          was no system for the independent assessment of projects (unlike the requirement to
          have external evaluators of EU-funded projects) and a programming document defining
          eligibility and selection criteria was completely lacking (unlike the extensive
          programming documents corresponding to EU-funds, which are prepared by different
          OPs and approved by the European Commission). In the absence of clear selection
          criteria and prioritization measures, the state-budget-funded PNDI project portfolio
          expanded quickly. The change in government of July 2012 brought the PNDI to a
          complete halt, in recognition of the multiple issues that were plaguing the program.

35.    Other signs of current lack of coordination include inefficient planning of
investments , along with the public authorities’ inability to break silos and work together .

Indeed, it is a rare occurrence for public authorities to proactively collaborate in designing
and implementing joint projects or investments that reinforce each other ’s impact (e.g.,
rehabilitating roads that connect multiple counties). 9 Even at the level of a single authority,
coordination for proper sequencing of investments proves to be deficient: a newly
modernized road, for instance, is sometimes damaged when a water supply and/or
sanitation network is developed for that same community. The next chapter further details
such examples; in short, the dual objectives of reducing waste and boosting synergies
across investment projects highlight the need to design and adopt effective coordination
mechanisms.


Objective and Scope
36.     The objective of this engagement is to support the strategic coordination of
infrastructure strategies and investment projects financed by the EU and by the state
budget in regions, counties, and municipalities. This hopes to contribute to ensuring a
coherent, integrated, and impactful approach to public investment management, and to
increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of spending EU and state-budget funds for the
2014-2020 programming period. This report provides recommendations for aligning the
preparation and implementation processes applicable to non-EU-funded infrastructure
investments implemented or monitored by the MRDPA to the ones supported by different
EU-funded operational programs. This activity also contributes to harmonize these
processes with the ones used by other ministries and national agencies, which in the long
run can also contribute to maximizing absorption of EU funds: if investments follow the
same rules, a pipeline of projects can be created with state budget funding and then
transferred to EU-funded programs, as needed/as feasible. To the full extent possible, this
methodology will be distributed to all relevant stakeholders.

37.     The task of evaluating all aspects of coordination of infrastructure works in
Romania is daunting. There are many different potential angles to this endeavor: by sector;
by administrative level; by strategy/plan, investment program, and/or individual project ; by
phase (planning, implementation, and post-implementation); by type (policy, financial,
technical, etc.). The following paragraphs tackle the critical task of properly scoping the
current assignment as to remain within time and resource constraints and to contribute
with meaningful and actionable recommendations. Most proposals therefore address
actions that the MRDPA can take on directly as part of its mandate.

38.     As such, there are a number of important caveats and limitations to the current
report. Romania has a very large number of strategies adopted in recent years, which is
part of the coordination challenge. Some of them are required by the EU, others are
promoted by line ministries, and others are initiated by lower administrative levels. The
purpose is not to provide an in-depth evaluation of each strategy, which goes far beyond
the scope of this work, but rather to take a few critical strategies and understand their
main goals and whether they are somehow connected further to policy priorities, funding,
and specific projects. In addition, the report reviews infrastructure investment programs

9
 One positive example is the attempt by counties in the West region to submit a joint proposal
under the ROP 2007-2013 for rehabilitating county roads that connected multiple jurisdictions. Such
situations remain rare at the level of the entire country.


                                                                                                19
financed from the state budget by the MRDPA and by other ministries, and also structural
instruments supported by the EU (e.g., the Regional Operational Programme, OP Large
Infrastructure, the National Rural Development Program - PNDR, etc.). Again, this report is
not meant to provide an exhaustive assessment of all such programs (in fact, for structural
instruments in particular, a series of in-depth studies are required by the EU and many of
them are available publicly). Instead, the current assessment seeks to unveil the linkages,
overlaps, and synergies among different financing instruments and recommend ways for
improving their coordination. Soft investment strategies and programs are not covered by
this report.

39.     All in all, the scope of this work focuses on strategies, investment programs, and
projects in the three in three sectors targeted by the PNDL: roads, water supply,
wastewater, and social infrastructure. For these key areas, the current study covers
relevant and available sectoral and cross-sectoral strategies, at all levels (supranational,
national, regional, and local). Moreover, this assessment explores the institutional
mechanisms that shape different stages of an infrastructure project, from planning through
implementation and post-implementation monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The first
figure below summarizes the linkages between different levels covered in this report, while
the second figure defines what is within and beyond scope for the current work.

close linkages and the need to focus the current assessment on value-add areas. If a
particular topic has been covered by another recent analysis, this final report references it
and presents its recommendations in brief. It is important to place the current report in the
context of the current broader current engagement with the MRDPA, with the following
relevant deliverables:
        Component 1 – Assistance with the coordination of strategies and plans for EU and
         state-funded investments in infrastructure;
             o The other final report on PNDL prioritization criteria, due at the end of
                 August 2015, discusses program and project-level mechanisms to prioritize
                 investments. It includes recommendations on adopting evaluation and
                 selection criteria that will encourage coordination in the three sectors
                 (roads, water and wastewater, and water and sanitation) by defining lists
                 of priority projects to both sort through the current portfolio and evaluate
                 new proposals.
        Component 2 – Advisory services related to the existing portfolio of investment
         projects in MRDPA, including their optimal prioritization and preparation of

             budget and EU-funds, coordination is implicitly enhanced and projects
             prepared for national funding can potentially be transferred into the EU
             pipeline, if eligible.
           o The final report on the PNDL portfolio, due at the end of August 2015, will
             include a number of specific recommendations to improve proposals, along
             with the evaluation and selection procedures. Again, this would lead to a
             more coordinated process across state-budget-financed and EU-funded
             investment programs.
      Component 3 – Assistance with improving the use of efficient designs and
       technologies in investments managed by the MRDPA;
           o This final report, due at the end of June 2015, will suggest improved
              technologies that may also help with the coordination of projects during
              the implementation phase.

41.    In addition, a set of related assessments referenced by this report and highly
relevant to the topic of infrastructure investments’ coordination include the following:
      ROP 2.0: MA-IB Collaboration and Communication and Beneficiary Support
       Mechanisms for the Regional Operational Programme, 2014-2020 (World Bank,
       2014) includes two reports that discuss the regional framework for planning and
       implementing public infrastructure investments, particularly through the Regional
       Operational Programme (ROP). The reports include an assessment of Regional
       Development Agencies (RDAs) and offer recommendations for support
       mechanisms to local and county-level applicants and beneficiaries of EU funds,
       including assistance for improved coordination of investments.
      Enhanced Spatial Planning (World Bank, 2013) evaluates the spatial planning
       framework in Romania and recommends solutions for enhancing coordination
       among lower and higher-level plans.
      Strategic IDPs Assessment (World Bank, 2013) is an in-depth review of 2007-2013
       Integrated Development Plans (IDPs) in growth poles around Romania. IDPs are key
       tools for facilitating integrated planning at the level of localities. The study
       summarizes current gaps and proposes measures for improving the quality of such
       documents, and also assesses the role of Growth Pole Coordinators.
      Harmonizing Strategic Planning and Budgetary Programming in Romania (2015)
       reviews the national framework for developing, approving, and implementing
       strategies. The study is related to the potential establishment of a Strategy Unit
       (SU) at the Center of Government in Romania, a key proposal for ensuring
       coordination among strategies.
      World Bank reports on CLLD and ITI Danube Delta make a number of
       recommendations for facilitating integrated planning and project implementation
       through these two new instruments promoted by the EU for 2014-2020.
      Last but not least, the team working on the current engagement has coordinated
       closely with the World Bank team involved in the advisory services for the Ministry
       of Public Finance regarding public investment management . The two projects are



                                                                                       22
        fully complementary and have been developed in close coordination between the
        two task teams.



Audiences
42.     The primary audience of the current report includes the staff of the Directorate
General for Regional Development and Infrastructure (DG RDI) within the Ministry of
Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA). Other key stakeholders who
will benefit from this assessment include the following:
       At the national level:
            o Ministries and agencies in charge of planning and implementing state-
                budget-funded interventions;
            o Managing Authorities and Intermediate Bodies of EU-funded programs;

       At the regional level: Regional Development Agencies, which are in charge of
        regional-level planning and coordination, and could effectively play the role of
        liaison between the national and the county/local level;

       At the county and local level: public authorities who prepare projects and submit
        applications to EU- and state-funded programs.

       Finally, the European Commission (EC) may benefit from this study’s findings and
        replicate the recommendations in other Member States. The issue of effective
        coordination of infrastructure investments supported from different sources is
        present in other Member States too, as evidenced by the introduction of the
        community-led local development (CLLD) and integrated territorial investments
        (ITI) instruments for the 2014-2020 programming period, which are precisely
        meant to enable integrated projects with multi-fund financing.



Methodology and Report Structure
43.      Following this introduction, Chapter 1 defines the theoretical framework for
assessing the coordination of public infrastructure investments in Romania. The
specialized literature on this complex topic is relatively limited, despite the growing
importance of the subject. This report adapts to the Romanian context the framework
proposed by the OECD report on “Investing Together: Working Effectively across Levels of
Government,” arguably the most comprehensive resource currently available on the issue
of coordinating public infrastructure investments. The same chapter also reviews the
available literature to summarize the benefits, common obstacles, and risks related to the
coordination of public investments.

44.      In accordance with the Advisory Services Agreement, Chapter 2 assesses the main
types of investments managed by the MRDA through the Directorate General for
Regional Development and Infrastructure (DG RDI) in particular. The analysis in part one
of Chapter 2 describes the key phases of the project cycle and further focuses on the 2014
portfolio of projects under the National Local Development Program (PNDL), reviewing
their split by: size, sector, implementation status (ongoing vs. new), and geographic
location. The key point in assessing the PNDL is two-fold: (i) the program has expanded
significantly with a number of new projects, requiring over 15 years to complete all
investments currently in the portfolio (assuming no new ones enter the pipeline in that
interval); and (ii) there are significant opportunities to improve coordination between the
PNDL and other investment programs, particularly EU-funded instruments, both in terms of
strategic programming and with respect to adopting harmonized implementation
procedures. In addition, the PNDL is also the program that the MRDPA, as the main
audience of this report, can adjust directly and make the most immediate improvements to
the status quo. For all such reasons, the first part of Chapter II is dedicated to an in-depth
review of the PNDL. The second part includes a brief analysis of other investment programs
implemented by DG RDI: the program for thermal rehabilitation of apartment buildings;
the program for social housing development; and the program for housing for people
evacuated from nationalized homes.

45.     Chapter 3 provides an overview of the roads, water and wastewater, and social
infrastructure sectors in Romania, covering the following: key players, legal framework,


                                                                                                     24
strategies, and investment programs. This chapter also includes an analysis of
infrastructure investments implemented from the state budget by other ministries and/or
national agencies. The methodology is similar to the one used to summarize the World
Bank’s 2010-2011 functional reviews, including for the regional development sector. Much
like the chapter preceding it, this analysis is primarily descriptive and meant to offer
background information regarding the current framework governing infrastructure
investments in Romania (i.e., who is doing what and with what funds).

46.      In line with the Advisory Services Agreement, the team has chosen to focus on
the same main sectors as the ones targeted by the MRDPA through the state-budget-
funded PNDL. A large collection of materials was reviewed, from legislation to strategies
(cross-sectoral and sectoral), extensive documentation of investment programs, etc. Part of
the analysis entails an overview of what has already been done in the 2007-2013
programming period and attempts to determine to what extent investments have been
properly coordinated. For example, the National Rural Development Program (PNDR) has
financed water and wastewater investments that were not already covered under the SOP
Environment 2007-2013. Similarly, the Regional Operational Programme 2007-2013 has
financed Category A cultural heritage sites in rural areas, while the PNDR 2007-2013 has
focused on Category B sites. Such coordination, however, does not apply to all operational
programs and it is usually missing in the case of state-budget-funded programs.
Observations from this desk review were supplemented field interviews with stakeholders
at the central, regional, and local levels.

47.      Chapter 4 builds on the overview provided in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 to conduct
a full diagnostic of current mechanisms for coordinating public investments in Romania ,
in two parts: intra-sectoral and inter-sectoral coordination. Intra-sectoral coordination
further discusses: (i) vertical coordination (across levels of government) of strategies and
plans in the three sectors (roads, water and wastewater, and social infrastructure); and (ii)
horizontal coordination across investment programs (managed by different
units/ministries) – again, for each of the three aforementioned sectors. The second part,
covering the inter-sectoral dimension, is divided into three sections, corresponding to the
administrative levels where institutional mechanisms may exist or may need to be created
to encourage coordination: national level, regional level, and county/local level. Under
each of these, this report further covers: strategies and plans; investment programs; and
infrastructure projects. The following is a sample of the critical questions asked as part of
the Chapter 4 diagnostic:
       How does coordination happen in the current Romanian context, within and across
        sectors?
       What are the positive examples of coordination? How can they be replicated?
       What are the main challenges to effective coordination – across administrative
        levels (vertically), across different actors and investment programs (horizontally),
        and across different phases (strategies, investment programs, and projects)?
       What are the main strategies and plans and how do they fit together? How closely
        do various actors collaborate in the planning process?




                                                                                          25
       Are objectives and eligible investments properly and effectively correlated across
        investment programs?
       Who is accountable for (lack of) coordination?
       What are the differences between the national, regional, and local levels as far as
        coordination mechanisms go?
       Are investments properly and logically sequenced?
       What are the main monitoring and evaluation (M&E) tools?
       How are lessons learned collected, reviewed, and disseminated?

48.      Chapter 5 includes a list of targeted strategies and specific action steps for
improving the coordination of state-budget-funded and EU-funded investments. To keep
the scope of the analysis manageable and to ensure that suggestions made are actionable,
the report focuses primarily on: areas where significant gaps are observed; and measures
that fall under the direct purview of the MRDPA. The chapter first discusses four
fundamental conditions for coordination (the enabling environment) and then presents a
set of recommendations for coordination mechanisms within and across sectors, mirroring
the structure of the diagnostic, as presented above.

49.      Chapter 6 provides a snapshot of the main targeted strategies and specific action
steps for enhanced intra and inter-sectoral coordination. By adopting these proposals,
two key objectives will be fulfilled by strengthening the coordination of strategies and plans
for public investments: (i) state-budget-funded investments, including those managed by
DG RDI, will better complement and buttress infrastructure investments made with EU
funds, as well as other infrastructure investments made with public or private funds; and
(ii) investments managed by DG RDI will help attain the objectives established by the
regional operational program for the 2014-2020 programming period.

50.     This final report is the result of an extensive research and analytical effort,
involving a large variety of key sources and tools. In addition to public sources for all the
strategic documents cited, the team has relied extensively on data provided by the MRDPA
regarding the PNDL portfolio in 2014. Five missions were also organized in Romania at the
national, regional, and local levels, involving interviews with key stakeholders that shape
the coordination of public infrastructure investments. The following table summarizes the
main sources of information leveraged under each chapter of this current study:

51.      There are two caveats to the sources presented above. First, EU-funded
operational programs for 2014-2020 are still in draft form at the time of this report’s
writing. Until they are formally approved by the EU and then supplemented with Applicant
Guides, including actual eligibility and selection criteria for each investment axis, key
conditions may still change, including with respect to how these instruments coordinate
with one another and with state-budget funds. Second, despite an extensive effort, some
pieces of information were not successfully retrieved – particularly with respect to
investment programs financed 100% from the state budget. In this regard, there is very
little public information available (with the exception of PNDL), and some managers of
infrastructure departments in central ministries were not available for interviews. To the
extent possible, such gaps will be filled by the submission of the final report for Component
1 (due August 27, 2015).

52.      Before going further, it is important to remember that this assessment comes at a
particularly critical time: Romania is finalizing the framework that will guide how the
country will spend EUR 40 billion through 2022. The following chapters therefore have the
potential to contribute substantially to achieving greater impact through infrastructure
projects, provided that MRDPA leadership and other key stakeholders in Romania engage
deeply with this complex analysis, internalize it, and operationalize it. In that endeavor, two
fundamental premises are that: (i) Romania’s development needs are much greater than
available resources (as noted earlier); and (ii) enhanced coordination is critical to reduce
inefficiencies, finalize optimal investments (and cut off unfeasible projects), and truly
deliver sustainable and inclusive growth.




                                                                                            28
Chapter 1: The Theoretical Framework
53.     The coordination of public investments has become a popular desideratum,
particularly in recent years. Both scholars and policymakers agree that it is a good idea, for
many reasons: cost efficiencies, enhanced impact, standardized monitoring & evaluation
(M&E), etc. It is thus no surprise that the need to coordinate investments features
prominently in a number of key strategies. A 2013 OECD report on this issue argues that
“substantial coordination is necessary, and it is critical that subnational governments have
the capacity to work collaboratively in designing and implementing investment projects.” 10
In the case of Romania, the EC Partnership Agreement (PA) for 2014-2020, which draws the
overall directions for how available structural funds will be channeled over the next seven
years, specifically notes: “The complementarities identified among ESI Funds require
effective coordination during the planning and implementation of the ESI Funds in order to
avoid the overlaps between actions.” 11

54.      In general, however, the concept of coordination remains broadly stated and
insufficiently anchored in specific goals and actions steps for public investments. Several
important questions come to mind: What is coordination after all? Who is responsible for
coordinating with whom? What does coordination require? What are the benefits and
what are the costs? The current report cannot possibly address all these issues, so the
purpose of the current chapter is to narrow the scope of this assessment to the issues that
are truly critical for Romania at this point in its development, particularly with respect to
the linkages between EU and state-budget programs and investments.


1.1 What Is Coordination?
55.      Broadly speaking, coordination refers to the capacity of different stakeholders to
work together for achieving specific goals. Coordination is never an end in of itself, but
rather a means for reaching a specific purpose: in the context of this analysis, the aim is to
design and implement projects that deliver maximum impact on Romania’s sustainable and
inclusive development. As noted in the previous chapter, the focus is on basic
infrastructure investments – roads, water and wastewater, and social infrastructure – that
can create the conditions for all people to reach their productive potential and hence
generate economic growth. 12

56.     There are three core dimensions to coordination: vertical (across levels of
government), horizontal (across different units at the same administrative level), and
functional (across various phases). This typology can be further explained as follows:
        Vertical coordination covers the relationships among the national, regional, and
         local administrative levels. At a minimum, each level needs to know what the

and productivity), see “Competitive Cities: Reshaping Romania’s Economic Geography,” World

                                                                                              30
        others are doing or intend to do in terms of planned public investments. For
        example, the national level decides to build a highway that passes through a
        particular region, county, and commune; each of these actors should be informed
        and, ideally, actively engaged at each step.
       Horizontal coordination includes relationships among actors at the same level – for
        the purposes of the current work, this includes coordination among investment
        programs managed by different units within a Ministry (e.g., the National Local
        Development Program and the Regional Operational Programme) or across
        Ministries. There is also horizontal coordination across jurisdictions, when two or
        more subnational authorities come together to design and implement investments.
        This second subtype is not a main focus on the current report, as it has been
        addressed in a range of other rec ent reports, particularly on “Enhanced Spatial
        Planning” and “Growth Poles: The Next Phase” (World Bank, 2013 ).
       Functional coordination refers to the specific mechanisms required at each stage of
        a cycle: i.e., from planning through implementation (execution) and post-
        implementation. There is a cascade of planning steps that shape an investment,
        from national to sectoral strategies and to specific designs of investment programs.
        Further, the implementation phase involves the approval, financing, and
        completion of infrastructure projects. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
        procedures help assess program and project performance and also enable the
        collection and dissemination of lessons learned. It goes without saying that
        coordination mechanisms vary greatly at each step in the process.

The specialized literature and some policy circles may also consider other types of
coordination, including transversal coordination (i.e., when a public education department
in, say, a Ministry works together with a health unit under the purview of a local authority).
For the sake of simplicity, this report only covers only the three aforementioned types.


1.2 Main Coordination Mechanisms
57.     There is a long menu of coordination mechanisms deployed in countries around
the world, and it is safe to say that there is no perfect recipe to be replicated in Romania.
The following sections present various examples from established practices in OECD
countries. 13 This is only a preview for subsequent chapters; recommendations of which
types of mechanisms Romania could improve or adopt are only made in the final chapter.

58.   There are three main types of coordination mechanisms across levels of
government – i.e., vertically:
          Dedicated platforms: These are institutional structures, formal or informal, that
           explicitly target coordination and bring together multiple stakeholders from the
           national, regional, and local levels. Dedicated platforms include not only
           bodies/committees/organizations that have coordination at the core of their
           mission, but also specific events that share the same purpose of enabling
           coordination (fora, conferences, online competition of ideas).
          Co-financing mechanisms: Used widely for both EU-funded and state-funded
           programs, these tools ensure that multiple stakeholders have a stake in particular
           infrastructure projects. The presumption is that if a local authority contributes
           some of its own funds toward the completion of an investment, it will more likely
           coordinate with higher-level funders – be it the national government or the EU.
           Such requirements may also encourage subnational authorities to work with the
           private sector to fill the financing gap and coordinate actions in the completion of
           joint projects.
          Conditionalities: These include clear eligibility and/or scoring criteria applied to
           certain funding sources (i.e., investment programs). A common requirement is for a
           proposed (local) project to be included in a (higher-level) local/regional
           development strategy. In the water and wastewater sector, for instance, EU funds
           prioritize investments that are included in the Master Plans. This ensures that high-
           level policy goals are adopted by lower-level authorities and reflected in the
           projects they put forth. There is of course a tension between hard top-down
           conditionalities and the subsidiarity principle of allowing local governments to
           address the needs on the ground they are presumed to know best. But there is still
           value in ensuring that local investments contribute to national and regional-level
           objectives set by the government. This is why consultations are critical in designing
           investment programs, so that investment programs’ conditionalities reflect a mix of
           bottom-up inputs and top-down priorities.

                                                                                             32
59.     As for horizontal coordination across sectors , this typically happens through the
following mechanisms:
        Dedicated platforms: Similar to the concept under vertical coordination, these
         platforms can focus on multiple sectors. Obviously, the more sectors are covered,
         the more complicated coordination becomes. Many cross-sectoral bodies,
         including in Romania (e.g., the Interinstitutional Committee for the Partnership
         Agreement – CIAP) split into sector-based working groups. Such instruments are
         particularly useful for programming purposes, with the mission of ensuring
         complementarity of investments. There are also inter-ministerial committees for
         approving and coordination interventions.
        Conditionalities: As for vertical coordination, some investment programs are
         designed, ex-ante, to encourage integrated projects across multiple sectors. In
         Romania, the National Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 funded many
         proposals that included both water and sanitation systems and road rehabilitation.
         The new EU instruments on Integrated Territorial Investments (ITI) and
         Community-Led Local Development (CCLD) are dedicated coordination instruments
         meant to encourage complementarities across sectors. 14
        Local-level procedures and practices: At the project level, most of the coordination
         efforts need to happen under the leadership of the main “beneficiary” of
         investment funding – i.e., a local or county council in Romania. Different authorities
         have experienced with various coordination practices, some ad hoc (practices) and
         others systematic (procedures). An example is the mayor of a major city in the
         middle of Romania who brought around the table all providers of public utility
         services (gas, electricity, water, sewage, district heating) and established with a
         two year lead time a common program sequencing investments. Such practices and
         procedures can help avoid inefficiencies resulting from, say, utility providers
         damaging a newly rehabilitated road to work on their distribution networks.

60.      While it is not a key focus area for the current work, horizontal coordination
across jurisdictions can also rely on specific coordination mechanisms. These include:
conditionalities (e.g., investment programs rewarding projects submitted in partnership
between multiple authorities, fiscal incentives for coordination and/or merger of local
government units, etc.); and legal provisions (e.g., easiness of joining and/or merging into a
single association/unit).

61.     Last but not least, there is one instrument worth exploring in the future; it brings
together both vertical and horizontal coordination – i.e., territorial contracts between
national and subnational authorities. Different countries have different names for this:
contracts, agreements, pacts, etc. This is not to be confused with contracts for individual
projects between, say, a Ministry serving as the Managing Authority of an EU-Funded
program and a local authority as beneficiary of the grant. Territorial contracts involve
stakeholders from public, private, and nonprofit sectors, usually at a regional level. They
include a vision for that particular territory, with goals, activities (projects), and

applicability in Romania, this report does not cover ITI or CLLD in depth.


                                                                                            33
performance (output, outcome, and impact) indicators. They can be purely transactional,
driving financial allocations through a series of positive incentives and/or sanctions (e.g.,
the Netherlands); or relational, trust-based. Most importantly, territorial contracts have
the potential to account for both state-budget and EU funds, setting priority projects and
“dividing them up” between financing sources of various kinds. Annex F presents the Polish
experience with territorial contracts.

1.3 Why Coordinate Public Investments?
62.     There are two reasons for which governments should put coordination at the
core of their efforts to achieve complementarity in infrastructure investments: to reduce
costs and to increase benefits. In resource-constrained environments, particularly after the
financial crisis, it has become vital to deliver the most impact possible with the least funds
available. Especially when it comes to infrastructure projects, costs tend to run high – and,
often times, much higher than what the typical tools estimate (e.g., cost-benefit
analyses). 15 For example, if two or more different authorities are implementing investment


15
  See Bent Flyvberg, “Survival of the Unfittest: Why the Worst Infrastructure G ets Built and
What We Can Do about It,” Oxford Review of Economic Policy, Volume 25, Issue 3, pp. 344-
367.


                                                                                                             34
programs that have the same goals and target the same beneficiaries, it is likely that they
are duplicating their efforts and, hence, missing out on cost-saving opportunities through
consolidation of operations. The same goes for beneficiaries who, for a variety of reasons,
choose to finance their infrastructure projects through more expensive funding sources
(e.g., state budget funds instead of EU structural funds).

63.     By the same token, lack of coordination implies failure to leverage synergies
across different investments . For instance, if a new school or hospital gets built, the road
connecting to it should also be rehabilitated. If a county finances a particular county road,
the neighboring authorities may want to consider financing a county road that connects to
that investment. In some cases, it may make better sense to connect to the next
commune’s water and sanitation network than to build a new syste m from scratch.
Another common situation refers to utility companies destroying a newly paved road to
put in or replace different underground networks. The examples could go on and on, but
the simple point is that coordination makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts.
Put differently, any government that seeks to do more with less should strongly consider
placing coordination of public investments front and center on its policy agenda.

64.       The need to coordinate is inescapable in many ways – vertically and horizontally .
Regarding the former dimension, very few local governments have the capacity to support
the investments they need entirely from their own funds, especially in countries that have
not decentralized fully. Based on prudent capital expenditure margins, more than three in
four communes in Romania can only afford to rehabilitate one road and one school. 16 Local
government units (LGUs) simply do not have the financial and human resources needed to
fulfill the basic infrastructure needs of local communities, so other actors needs to
intervene to fill the gap – regional authorities (in countries where regions have formal
administrative powers, which is not yet the case in Romania), the national government
(through a variety of state-budget-funded programs), or supranational authorities like the
European Union. As for horizontal coordination, very few investments depend on a single
sector: roads cross railroads and power lines, wastewater treatment plants influence the
quality of water bodies, schools and hospitals function well only if there is sufficient
demand for their services and hence proper connectivity with people in surrounding areas,
etc. The simple but important point is that proper coordination of public investments is a
must in any policy context.

65.      This is not to say that coordination is a given – quite the contrary. Coordination is
challenging, time consuming, and potentially frustrating. In economic terms, coordination
implies transaction costs so, ceteris paribus, the beneficiary of a particular investment will
choose to coordinate only when the perceived benefits will exceed the costs. The figure
below makes precisely this point: the larger (and the more important) an investment (as a
percentage of the beneficiary’s budget), the more its successful completion will depend on
others, so the more necessary it will be to coordinate across administrative levels
(vertically) and across sectors (horizontally). It is also true that coordination is not always
possible. For example, when the value of a proposed investment is small and can be fully

covered from a local government’s budget, higher administrative levels may have no
options to incentivize coordination. For all other situations, however, the achievable goal
for the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration and the Government
of Romania is, therefore, to push to the left the upward sloping curve represented in the
figure, i.e., making it easier for stakeholders to coordinate with one another (regardless of
the value of the proposed investment).

1.4 Common Obstacles to Coordination
66.       If coordination was an easy task, everyone would be doing it perfectly; in
practice, there are many obstacles to effective coordination . By definition, coordination
involves multiple different actors, each with its own agenda and interests. There are often
silos within the same public authorities or even within sub-units of that authority, let alone
across public institutions or across public/private/nonprofit stakeholders. A review of the
literature, corroborated with insights from interviews and field visits, leads to the following
list of typical challenges to effective coordination, which will further inform the subsequent
analysis in Romania. There are four main interrelated gaps to consider:
           (1) Lack of trust : It is important to remember that coordination always occurs
            between people – not between amorphous institutions or sectors. This is why
            building a culture of collaboration is quintessential for instilling coordination as a
            purpose of individual and collective relationships. But public sector institutions are
            often dominated by mistrust, particularly in a context where every change in
            government leads to massive turnover not just at the top leadership level, but also
            at the technical level. Trust is hard to build and equally easy to erode.



                                                                                                                           36
   (2) Lack of accountability: Coordination is more likely to happen when it is part of
    an explicit mandate for an organization and for its staff. In the words of one expert
    interviewed, “to coordinate, one must first aim to coordinate . ” If nobody is
    accountable for lack of coordination and its results (e.g., inefficient investments,
    failed project implementation, etc.), it is not surprising that there is no significant
    progress toward improved collaboration.
    Box. 1. Coordination is likely to fail in the absence of real trust and ownership

     Government Decision (GD) 750/2005 aimed to substitute more than 100 inter-ministerial
     committees and working groups – organized on ad-hoc basis for specific, narrow issues –
     with a coherent system of a limited number of permanent inter-ministerial councils (e.g.,
     for Administration, Civil Service, Decentralization, and Local Communities; Strategic
     Planning; Regional Development, Territorial Planning, and Tourism, etc.). The structure
     was to enable coordination among coalition partners (usually in Romania there are
     multiple governing parties) and mirrored some of the EU-level bodies. The main
     motivation at the time was precisely to encourage coordination, stability, and
     predictability of policies.
     For all its good intentions, GD 750/2005 ultimately failed, as the newly established
     councils did not function properly. The reasons are complex, but have to do in large part
     with a lack of trust and ownership of individual ministries (the members sitting on the
     permanent councils). Traditionally, ministers and their representatives have preferred to
     maintain decision authority over certain legal acts and policy proposals, and hence do
     not wholeheartedly enter in a process of coordination and collective decision-making.
     To this day, ad-hoc committees in Romania continue to abound, though they do not
     typically produce substantial results. Even when different ministries agree to sit at the
     same table, a committee’s endorsement is never sufficient; each ministry has to issue its
     own endorsement of particular policies/projects (e.g., Inter-Ministerial Committee on
     investment projects over RON 30 million, established thr ough GD 150/2010).

   (3) Lack of capacity: This is a typical issue for many subnational authorities and
    goes hand in hand with lack of funding. The personnel is usually understaffed,
    underpaid, and overworked. Their work plan is dominated by urgent priorities like
    managing projects, responding to citizen requests, producing local development
    strategies and other key, time-sensitive documents, answering to audits, etc. Even
    where “coordination” is explicitly part of the mandate, staff can easily put it aside
    as a non-urgent priority; chances are that it never gets done under these
    circumstances, hence the need to have adequate human capital management
    policies.
   (4) Lack of information: The local level does not always know what the priorities are
    for the regional/national levels and vice versa. Information flows are weak, ad-hoc,
    or nonexistent. Authorities at different levels inform each other only when
    required to, usually late in the project cycle: for instance, a local council may
    inform a ministry of its plans only when it requires a permit for an investment that
    is ready to be implemented; by the same token, a national ministry may not
    properly engage or inform lower-level actors regarding its policy priorities and
    investment program. Information is also vital for effective M&E systems. As the old
    saying goes, one cannot manage what one does not measure.


                                                                                            37
In truth, such issues are not singular to Romania, as reflected in the figure below, which
summarizes the results of an OECD survey on public investment governance in 22 member
countries. As the next chapters show, however, the magnitude of the issue of lack of
coordination and its consequences are particularly noteworthy in the Romanian context .
This is ultimately the primary motivation for this in-depth report on coordination of public
infrastructure investments.

1.5 Potential Risks of “Over-Coordination”
67.      “Over-coordination” may be preferable to too litt le coordination, but there are
still some risks to this scenario, which policymakers should keep in mind before moving
forward with an aggressive “coordination agenda .” First, a strong push toward more
coordination may lead to excessive bureaucratization in the absence of clearly defined
goals and procedures. A common example is the establishment of committees on various
topics of interest, involving a variety of stakeholders (different ministries,
local/regional/national actors, etc.). In theory, such instruments can serve as an optimal
forum for ensuring collaboration and exchanges of ideas. In practice, however, they often
lack: a clear mandate, sufficient resources, and consistency over time. Usually one
authority is tasked with ensuring the secretariat for such bodies, though this additional
responsibility does not come with additional resources. The staff of the secretariat takes on
the new role halfheartedly, which then translates into poorly prepared meeting agendas,
insufficient follow-up, etc. Under such conditions, participants to meetings – if such
meetings do happen somewhat regularly and if participants actually attend – may quickly
come to believe that they are not using their time efficiently. They start delegating to lower
levels and, eventually, the committees lose their core raison d’etre . Such outcomes are
particularly likely in environments where there is no real sense of ownership behind
coordination efforts – i.e., they may be pursued halfheartedly to show that some
“coordination” is happening, but in reality there is not much substance to the process.



                                                                                            38
68.       Challenges also arise when a system is over-engineered to favor coordination. A
typical scenario involves an investment program managed by the national or regional level,
targeting local authorities. To encourage integrated planning, the program includes special
incentives (e.g., bonus points) for proposing projects that reinforce each other. For
example, one mayor submits for consideration a water supply project along with the
rehabilitation of the main roads in the commune. The proposal gets selected and receives
financing, but when it comes to implementation the two projects cannot be properly
correlated. Suppose the water project gets delayed at the public procurement phase, but
the road is ready for implementation. The mayor is then faced with a tough choice:
postpone the road project (and lose risking financing for it) until the water project is ready;
or rehabilitate the road and later damage it when putting in the water supply pipes. 17
Similarly, an investment program may wish to encourage local authorities to submit joint
proposals, but the supporting legislation may still have gaps that make implementation
difficult (e.g., lead beneficiary vs. partner obligations, audit and control procedures, etc.).

69.      In a famous book on public administration, “Extreme Government Makeover,”
Ken Miller uses the metaphor of an old house with a rusted, twisted, leaky system of
pipes. The “house” is a generic government agency, with a “plumbing system” that may
have once been functional but now can no longer properly circulate incoming water
(people’s requests for different services). The more twisted the pipes, the longer the water
has to flow through them, the more people have to wait for government services, as
opposed to submitting their request through a simple, straight-shooting pipe. As Miller
puts it, pipes get kinked up by multiple rounds of specialization, reorganizations, cost-
cutting, outsourcing, and the general fear of responsibility – “and now they’re so twisted
and slow, it makes a silly straw look efficient.” 18 The solution is neither blocking the water
from entering the pipes, nor having people wait for “deliverables” longer and longer. The
solution is to straighten the pipes so that more water flows through as quickly and
efficiently as possible. As they design coordination mechanisms, policymakers need to keep
in mind the risk of adding pipes or twisting existing ones, slowing down even further the
design and implementation of infrastructure projects in Romania.

70.      The aforementioned challenges are valid and real, but the key point is that they
have to more to do with the absence of an enabling environment than with coordination
itself. Again, ceteris paribus, coordination is inherently positive and desirable. But when
forced upon a policy context that misses any or all of the four key elements listed above –
capacity, information, procedures, and purpose – it may very well backfire and actually
undermine the ability of public institutions to properly plan and implement infrastructure
projects.

   Such situations have actually occurred in Romania under the National Rural Development
Program (PNDR), as explained in later chapters

Chapter 2: Investment Programs Managed by the
General Directorate for Regional Development and
Infrastructure
This chapter reviews the main investment programs managed by the General Directorate
for Regional Development and Infrastructure (DG RDI). The assessment focuses primarily
on the National Local Development Program (PNDL). The other programs managed by the
MRDPA are discussed in more detail under Component 4 of the current technical assistance
program: “Assisting in Housing and Infrastructure Development Strategy.”


The National Local Development Program (PNDL)
71.     In the endeavor to enhance the coordination of public infrastructure projects in
Romania, the National Local Development Program (PNDL) plays a critical role. The PNDL
is currently the largest source of state-budget investment financing for local and county
authorities’ infrastructure projects. Given that few subnational actors have sufficient own
resources to fully finance their basic needs – with the possible exception of Bucharest and
other major cities – local/county decision-makers that pursue infrastructure projects are
left with the choice of applying for EU funds or state-budget funds (primarily the PNDL,
although a few other separate programs like the Environment Fund continue to exist). It is
important to recognize from the beginning that the two sources of funding have very
different characteristics and show significant coordination gaps. This chapter provides an
analysis of the PNDL and the main types of investments carried out by the program. 19

72.      In April 2013, the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration
(MRDPA) initiated the National Local Development Program (PNDL) and, to this end,
promoted Government Emergency Ordinance (GEO) 28/2013. Along with its formal
justification (“notă de fundamentare”) and the Methodological Norms for its application
(Ministry Order 1851/2013), this act sets the PNDL’s design and implementation
framework. The Directorate General for Regional Development and Infrastructure (DG RDI)
within the MRDPA was tasked with managing the program.

73.    The need for improved coordination was at the core of the government’s
motivation for establishing the PNDL, which brought together under the MRDPA’s single
management three investment programs that had operated independently in the past:
        The infrastructure program based on Government Decision (GD) 577/1997 targeted
         the modernization of communal roads and connecting villages to water supply,
         sanitation systems, and electric and phone networks. Before its integration under
         PNDL, this program was managed by the MRDPA (formerly the MRDT) through the
         Public Works Directorate. County councils played a main role by centralizing


19
  Part of this analysis is also included in the intermediary and final reports for Component 2 of this
technical assistance with the MRDPA. It is featured here as background to the issue of coordination
among state-budget (PNDL) and EU funds.


                                                                                                    40
         funding requests from all potential beneficiaries in the county and communicating
         them to the MRDPA.
        The Rural Infrastructure Development Program, based on Government Ordinance
         (GO) 7/2006, also aimed at the “development and modernization of Romania’s
         rural areas, […] by connecting them to roads and water and waste water
         networks.”20 In its initial form, this program was managed by a Commission,
         presided by the Prime Minister and bringing together representatives of 6
         ministries, the Prime Minister’s Chancellery, and the Association of Romanian
         Communes. The Ministry of Transport was responsible for monitoring the
         program’s implementation.
        Multiannual Priority Programs for Water and the Environment, based on GO
         40/2006, defined specific intervention sectors in certain geographical areas (for
         example, “water and wastewater infrastructure for the Criș river basin, Vaslui
         County, and the municipality of Ploiești”). 21 Other projects targeted varied
         interventions, from increasing the safety of river dams to developing an integrated
         IT system for the environment sector and the sustainable development of the
         Danube Delta biosphere. 22
As noted by the government, this change was intended “to enable a more efficient use of
public funds through an integrated implementation of infrastructure development
programs in rural and urban are as.”23 Indeed, it makes sense that central government
programs with the same target intervention areas would be merged under a single design
and implementation unit – i.e., the MRDPA. As emphasized publicly by the MRDPA, the
PNDL was never meant as a successor to the now-closed PNDI, which was based on a
financing scheme whereby contractors would finance the cost of the project and get
reimbursed upon completion. Still, PNDL norms make it possible that other projects
previously started receive financing to finish the required works, provided that such
investments are aligned with PNDL priorities and eligibility rules.


2.1 The PNDL Project Cycle
74.     To begin with, there is no formal strategy specific to the PNDL. At the time of its
launch, the PNDL was an importa nt expression of the new cabinet’s commitment to the
development of rural infrastructure, as reflected in the 2013-2016 Governing Program (as
approved by Parliament through decision 45/2012). For example, one of the key objectives
for Romania’s regional development is defined as the financing of a basic package of
services for rural areas, including roads, drinking water, sanitation, social infrastructure etc.,
“for achieving [at least] minimum standards of living.” 24 The same document further

   See Article 3 of GO 7/2006
21
   See Article 2, letter (c) of GO 40/2006
22 Moreover, GEO 28/2013 establishing the PNDL also dismantled the “Program for the

Rehabilitation and Upgrade of 10,000km of County and Local Roads.” The reason mentioned by the
formal justification note is that the program had not received funding a nd thus had not financed any
investment projects since its establishment in 2010.
23 See the formal justification note to GEO 28/2013
24
   See 2013-2016 Governing Program, Chapter 10 on “Development and Administration”


                                                                                                  41
emphasizes the need to prioritize public infrastructure projects to contribute to Romania’s
sustainable, balanced development. 25 Other than these broad commitments, there are no
defined policy priorities and objectives for the PNDL. The program’s strategic framework is
broad enough to accommodate a variety of projects, without hard constraints around what
to finance and in what proportion.

75.      The PNDL focuses primarily on roads, water, and sewage projects, but other types
of investments (e.g., social infrastructure, cultural sites, sports centers, etc.) can also be
eligible for financing . Article 7 in the GEO describes the list of intervention areas (similar to
“axes” of EU-funded programs):
        Water supply systems and drinking water treatment plant;
        Sewage systems (networks) and wastewater treatment plant;
        Education units (kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, high schools, etc.);
        Healthcare units in rural areas (clinics, pharmacies, etc.);
        Public roads (i.e., county roads, local interest roads, commune roads and/or public
         roads within localities);
        Bridges, culverts, and/or footbridges;
        Local cultural facilities, such as libraries, museums, multi-functional cultural centers,
         and theaters;
        Landfills;
        Public, commercial markets, fairs, cattle fairs, as applicable;
        Sports facilities; and
        Headquarters of local public authorities and other subordinated public
         institutions. 26
The types of eligible works include construction of new infrastructure, as well as extension,
rehabilitation, and upgrading of existing infrastructure. Essentially, through such broad
conditions, the PNDL is able to cover the MRDPA’s entire vast portfolio of projects – both
previously-financed interventions (at various stages of completion) and brand new
investments, by all types of local public beneficiaries (from local councils in communes and
cities to county councils).

76.     Based on the budget allocation among ministries, as agreed at the government
level and approved by Parliament, the MRDPA establishes the PNDL’s total annual
budget. Next, the MRDPA allocates sums for each county, sub-program, and specific areas
of intervention, based on a Ministerial Order. The criteria for allocating sums across
counties are described in Annex 2 to the PNDL Methodological Norms. 27 In short, the three
main types of criteria that shape the allocation of PNDL funds from the national to the
county level are based on ongoing (unfinished) projects (number and funding needs),
demographic data (county population and surface area), and financial capacity.

77.     While the PNDL norms include some indicators to decide on the funding
allocation for each county, the methodology shows much room for improvement. For

   See Box 2

one, the law is not clear which of the three main criteria are factored into the funding
allocation, merely noting that “at least one of [them] should be considered.” 28 Second,
there are no defined weights for individual criteria or for sub-criteria within the main
categories (e.g., number of ongoing projects vs. their funding needs). Third, it is unclear
how certain indicators would be measured in practice, particularly the administrative-
territorial units’ capacity to co-finance investment projects. One proxy that could be used
would be non-earmarked revenues as a share of total revenues, 29 in the absence of clear
commitments (e.g., local/county council decisions to co-finance particular investments).
Finally, other potentially relevant indicators are missing. For example, the PNDL does not
seem to take into account a county’s development level, measured as GDP per capita (as
used for the Regional Operational Programme in deciding the split across Romania’s eight
planning regions).

78.       It is worth highlighting that final decisions regarding the PNDL’s allocation of
funding belong entirely to the MRDPA. In this process, it is presumed that the Ministry
makes use of county-level data, provided either directly by county/local authorities or by
other central bodies (e.g., the Ministry of Finance). Once it makes a decision on the
anticipated funding allocation, the MRDPA communicates it to county councils. Based on
these expectations, county councils further interact with local authorities to begin making a
list of investments that may be financed through the PNDL. Based on data available at this
point, it is unclear whether at this stage the MRDPA decides only on the funding allocation
per county or goes beyond that. Article 8 of GEO 28/2013 implies the latter: specifically,
“the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration shall prepare and
approve by order of the Minister of Regional Development and Public Administration the
distribution of the amounts intended to the Program, per counties, per each sub-program,
and per specific areas of intervention.” 30 It is equally unclear if the MRDPA pre-selects
investment projects to be included in the PNDL, as implied by Article 9 (3), as opposed to
putting together the list of investments based on inputs from local and county authorities,
as implied by Article 9 (4) and by the Methodological Norms.

79.      In any case, at the beginning of 2014, the funding allocation was roughly
equivalent across counties – around EUR 5 to EUR 5.7 million. On the one hand, this
demonstrates the MRPDA’s commitment to making the PNDL funds available to authorities
in all parts of Romania. On the other hand, the outcome may suggest that there is no clear
prioritization of investments based on counties’ different characteristics. By contrast, the
ROP 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 (in draft form, as of August 2014), for example, made
specific commitments to less developed areas, allocating significantly larger shares of
funding particularly to the North-East, South-East, and South Regions.

      “For the balanced distribution of funds to counties, at least one of the following
      indicators should be considered:

      (1) Weight of number of ongoing investment projects for each county, based on:
           The number of ongoing investment projects for each county as a share of total
              ongoing investments at the national level;
           The funding needs for completing the investment projects started and not
              completed as a share of the total funding needs for completing the investment
              projects started and not completed at national level.

      (2) Demographic and administrative-territorial data of counties, considering:
            The weight of the number of administrative-territorial units in the county as a
             share of the total number of administrative-territorial units at the national level;
            The weight of the county population as a percentage of the total population of
             the country;
            The weight of the county area as a percentage of the total area of the country.

80.     Once the MRDPA decides on the indicative PNDL funding allocation for each
county, county councils put together the list of projects proposed at the county and local
level – both new and ongoing/unfinished investments. 31 To this end, local authorities
submit their proposals to county councils or, “in justified circumstances,” directly to the
MRDPA, as recently mandated by Article 3 of GEO 30/2014 and MRDPA Minister Order
919/2014. It is unclear what situation would qualify as “justified.” The PNDL Methodological
Norms include a clear template for project proposals, which applies to both new and
ongoing investments. 32 This asks for: the name of the project; the name of the
applicant/local authority; the location of the project; main physical characteristics; total
value of the investment; total value of eligible costs to be financed from the PNDL; data
regarding the design contract (contract ID number, value, etc.); and, for ongoing
investments, the data regarding the construction works, the percentage of the project
completed to date, and the deadline for project completion.

81.      Next, county councils have 15 days to send to the MRDPA the list of proposed
investments, based on Annex 3 of the PNDL Methodological Norms. Essentially, this is a
table listing the projects proposed for financing through the program in a particular year,
divided up by new and ongoing investments, and further by sub-program (i.e., “the
modernization of the Romanian village,” “urban regeneration of municipalities and towns,”
and “county-level infrastructure”). The list of proposed investments has to be accompanied

31   See Article 9 (4).

     See Annex 2 of the PNDL Methodological Norms.


                                                                                                    44
by a justification note explaining how each county council decided to prioritize projects
submitted by local authorities.

82.     Under the current PNDL framework, county councils prioritize project proposals
from local authorities within their jurisdiction based on four possible criteria, out of which
“at least one should be used”:
          Signing date of the goods/work/service contract, as applicable;
          Physical status (% complete);
          Population benefitting from the investment; and
          Local budget’s percentage of co-financing.

83.      As with the PNDL’s criteria for allocating funds between counties, the current
prioritization criteria for selecting interventions within counties are broad and
ambiguous. This means that county councils have significant leverage to decide how to
prioritize investments in their jurisdiction. In their current form, the methodological norms
do not require county councils to use all four criteria, but merely to choose one out of the
four listed above. This may mean that a county could decide solely based on the number of
beneficiaries, while another could only look at the signing date of the contract. At the same
time, it is unclear how a particular criterion should be deployed: for example, would a
project with an older signing date take precedence over a newer one, or the other way
around? Also, how should a local authority measure the population benefitting from a
specific investment, say a local road that connects to a national road? It could be just the
population of a commune or the population of a much larger area (e.g., within 20, 40, or
even 60 minutes of the locality). Additionally, there are no defined weights among criteria.
Interviews with county council representatives revealed that there is no standard approach
to how investments are selected and prioritized.

84.    These findings suggest that there are significant opportunities to enhance
transparency and rigor by aligning PNDL procedures and criteria with those applicable to
EU-funded programs. Otherwise, there is a significant risk of crowding out EU investments,
as potential beneficiaries will choose the PNDL for its more “flexible” framework. A t a
minimum, the government should make sure that the same rules and procedures apply to
all PNDL applicants and that financing criteria are inclusively designed, transparently
communicated, and consistently adhered to.

85.      Based on the lists received from county councils across Romania, the MRDPA
makes the final selection of projects that receive PNDL funding in a given year. Once
again, the methodological norms do not define a clear, transparent selection process. The
final selection is to be based on the proposals received from county councils, as well as on
“[the Ministry’s] own data and specialized assessments.” 33 It is unclear what data are
deployed in such evaluations. The same document notes that the selection is done
exclusively by the MRDPA if county councils do not abide by the 15-day timeline or if they
fail to prioritize investments based on at least one of the four criteria specified in the law.
The finalized list of interventions is approved through the MRDPA’s Minister Order,

33
     PNDL Methodological Norms, Article 9 (8).


                                                                                           45
including an annex with the full set of projects (for each of them, the annex simply notes
the name of the administrative-territorial unit, the name of the project, and the sum
channeled from the state budget).

86.     There are slightly different requirements for applicants with ongoing vs. new
projects. For the former, local authorities need to send to the MRDPA the documents that
show the project’s current phase of completion, the updated value of remaining expenses
to be incurrent for the finalization of the intervention, and public procurement contracts
that have been signed previously, including addenda, if any. Upon verification of such
documents, the process can move forward to the contracting phase.

87.     For new investment projects, beneficiaries are required to submit to the MRDPA
the corresponding technical documentation. In most cases, this refers to feasibility studies
for new interventions or the documentation for approving intervention works (DALI 34 ) for
existing infrastructure. Feasibility studies and DALIs are not eligible for reimbursement
through the PNDL and have to have been developed through the applicant’s own resources,
in accordance with the regulations set by GD 28/2008. GEO 28/2013 also notes that the
documentation must prove that the proposed projects abide by the applicable cost
standards. However, cost standards are provided only for county roads, communal roads,
and for water projects. No cost standards are provided for wastewater projects, as these
are considered to require quite different technical solutions from case to case. 35

88.     It is worth noting that local authorities who seek to access PNDL funds do not
submit formal applications that are comparable to the complex documents required by
EU-funded programs. The bulk of an “application” is the technical documentation
corresponding to the proposed project – i.e., the feasibility study and/or the detailed
technical design. In field interviews, PNDL beneficiaries express satisfaction with the current
system’s simplicity and relatively quick processing of applications. In effect, under the
current system, requiring a formal form with categories similar to those included in
applications for EU funds – e.g., “project relevance for strategic objectives,” “economic
impact,” “technical features,” “social/environmental impact,” etc. – would not add much
value. This is because the actual prioritization and, essentially, the “preselection” of
projects happen at the level of county councils. The MRDPA only verifies that submitted
proposals are in accordance with a set of criteria – it is more of an eligibility check than a
thorough technical and financial evaluation. This is not to say that the technical-economic
data related to the project is not assessed by MRDPA evaluators, but only that projects that
make it thus far generally go through contracting. Even if a proposal initially fails the check,
MRDPA staff recommends the necessary improvements to beneficiaries, enabling projects
to move to the next phases (pending the successful resolution of suggested changes).

89.    Recently, changes were introduced to the PNDL’s methodological norms to
increase the efficiency of assessing and approving new project proposals. Until June 2014,

34 “Documentație de Avizare a Lucrărilor de I nterventii” (Documentation for the Approval of
Intervention Works).
35 In practice, MRDPA technical staff use a simple rule of thumb for benchmarking sanitation

projects, namely that they should not exceed 1.5 times the cost of equivalent water projects.


                                                                                                46
the technical documentation would be first assessed by DG RDI within the MRDPA and then
sent to the Ministry’s Technical-Economic Council (TEC). Without the TEC’s formal approval,
projects would not be eligible for financing. Citing the low capacity of the TEC to assess
proposals and the long delays incurred in the process, the MRDPA eliminated this step
through Ministry Order 1851/2013. Currently, new projects pre-approved for financing
through the PNDL only go through an assessment by the technical unit of the DG RDI, which
primarily evaluates the following:
       whether the technical documentation is complete and in accordance with GD
        28/2008;
       whether the applicant’s folder includes the local/county council’s decision for
        approving the project’s technical-economic indicators and for ensuring the required
        co-financing;
       whether the expenditures are properly presented and do not exceed current cost
        standards.

90.      Once the contract between the MRDPA and local authorities is signed, actual
project implementation can commence. The exact stages will depend on whether the
project is new or ongoing. In the former case, the beneficiary of PNDL funds will have to
organize public procurement procedures, in line with the applicable legislation (OUG
34/2006). In some cases, these procedures take a long time – due to challenges in court,
lack of offers, or other reasons specific to each project – which may aggravate the risk of
not using up the funds allocated for a particular year. This is because the PNDL is not a
multi-annual program like an EU-funded instrument, which creates inherent incentives for
applicants to submit for consideration smaller, easier projects that can be carried out in 1-2
years. If the project is ongoing and construction work has already begun in a previous year
(through the PNDL or a different program), depending on a case-by-case basis, the
beneficiary may continue previous engagement with service providers and contractors.

91.     Payments and reimbursements are critical factors for a smooth, successful
implementation. Based on the methodological norms (Articles 16-17), beneficiaries submit
reimbursement requests first to county councils, which then submit a consolidated request
for each county to the MRDPA. This system was then changed to allow beneficiaries to
request funds directly from the MRDPA, essentially simplifying the process by eliminating a
step. Some county councils report, however, that local city halls sometimes fail to send
them a copy of reimbursement requests sent to the Ministry, thus requiring repeated
requests to keep them in the loop. According to county council staff interviewed, they want
to remain involved to be able to coordinate and monitor the implementation process in
their respective jurisdiction, as required by the PNDL implementation norms. Once it
approves the requests received, the Ministry channels the funds – within the set annual
limits and based on the proofs/documents receive d (“situații de lucrări”) – directly to
beneficiaries. Finally, beneficiaries send back to the MRDPA the proof of payment of service
providers (i.e., showing that the funds received were used for the intended purpose).

92.      In addition, beneficiaries are responsible for monitoring work progress and
reporting updates to county councils and the MRDPA. The flow of reports is similar to the
initial one presented above for financing requests: local beneficiaries send all documents



                                                                                          47
corresponding to PNDL investments to county councils; every quarter, county councils send
to the MRDPA a consolidated update on the progress of construction works. Upon request,
beneficiaries are required to send to the MRDPA any document related to the financed
project. For its part, the MRDPA is responsible for the monitoring and controlling the
program’s implementation. In this capacity, the Ministry can appoint representatives who,
together with counterparts from the State Inspectorate for Constructions, verify the
accuracy of reported data and compare it to the reality on the ground.

93.      The current legal framework includes no details on requirements for the post -
implementation phase – i.e., tracking the project’s evolution upon completion. At least
based on the methodological norms, once the actual works are finished, the beneficiary
sends a copy of the completion report to the Ministry. If and when the warranty period
expires, the local authority again sends a copy of the formula documentation (“procesul
verbal de recepție final”) to the MRDPA. Beyond that, the two key post-implementation
functions for ay investment program – i.e., ex-post monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and
knowledge sharing – appear to be missing at this point in the PNDL’s evolution. Put
differently, there is no formal process for evaluating the impact of completed investments
and there are no institutionalized efforts for communicating good practices among past,
current, and future beneficiaries of PNDL funds. This is not surprising for a young program
like the PNDL; still, going forward, it would be important to set-up ex-post mechanisms to
ensure the continuous improvement of the instrument. Subsequent chapters provide more
in-depth suggestions for monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, including through
performance and impact indicators.


2.2 PNDL 2014 Portfolio Assessment
94.       The PNDL budget allocation in 2014 was substantial, transforming the program
(established only recently, in early 2013) into the main state-budget-financed source of
investment for local infrastructure. The total budget of PNDL in 2014 was RON 2.3 billion
(or about EURO 530 million). For 2013, the program was initially allocated RON 492.94
million. 36 The final data for the 2015 PNDL budget is not yet available at the time of writing
this intermediate report, though in 2013 the PNDL budget for 2015 was forecasted at a
lower level than in 2014 (only RON 800 million). 37 The final report will include a more
complete analysis of these year-on-year variations, including updated 2015 data.

95.     Moreover, it has not been uncommon to increase significantly the original budget
allocation for PNDL over the course of one year, as savings are realized in other parts of
the national budget. This happened in 2013 and again in 2014. In fact, in 2014 there were 3
substantial supplementary PNDL allocations added to the original base, despite the fact that
Romanian legislation only permits two such changes. The third one represented 43% of the
total 2014 allocation, while the initial one represented 32% of the final budget as per the
end of 2014. These figures indicate that most of the projects are not following the standard

application process via the county councils but are rather submitted directly to the MRDPA
all year long.

96.     The scale and timing of the three budgetary adjustments are worth noting with
some concern – they are substantial and have occurred including late in the fiscal year.
Such changes aggravate unpredictability and demonstrate weaknesses in budgetary
planning, with a variation between the initial and final allocation of over 200%. There are
also concerns regarding the type of projects targeted by substantial reallocations of the
budget as late as October/November 2014, when construction works tend to come to a halt
due to unfavorable weather: (i) projects that are just then getting started and receive
financing for initial technical documentation, hence aggravating the problem of an ever-
growing project portfolio with unfinished construction sites all across the country; and (ii)
projects that had incurred arrears that need to be paid off, which may create a moral
hazard issue and encourage future beneficiaries of state-budget investment financing to
postpone payments until the central government intervenes.

2.2.1 By Size
97.     The PNDL, as the main state-budget-funded program managed by the MRDPA
finances primarily small and lower-middle-sized investments. Following the methodology
used in the 2014 World Bank report on “Project Selection Models” and using the Ministry of
Finance’s definition for large projects, PNDL projects were sub -divided in the following
categories: large projects (more than RON 100 million); upper-middle-sized projects (RON
30 – 100 million); small/lower-middle-sized projects (RON 1.5 – 30 million); and very small
projects (less than RON 1.5 million). Very small projects (less than RON 1.5 million)
constitute 2.5% of the PNDL portfolio, while small/lower-middle sized projects represent
the bulk of projects, with an average value of around RON 6 million (~EUR 1.4 million). Both
very small and lower-middle sized projects fall under the category of “small projects”
according to the GEO 88/2013, i.e., they are under the threshold of RON 30 million.

98.      In 2014, most PNDL projects received relatively small allocations – on average,
close to RON 600,000. 47% were allocated under RON 300,000 and very few (4.5%)
received above RON 2 million. This result highlights the large difference in budgetary
allocations for projects financed by the PNDL. The highest allocation for an individual
project was RON 15 million, which went to modernizing a county road in Vrancea, DJ 205 D.
MRDPA data show that this particular county road is at the 35% completion level and has a
very large total value (RON 165 million). At the very other end of the spectrum, the Țepu
Commune in Galați County received only RON 2,436 to finish up the sewage system, which

required only a very small last payment.


2.2.2 By Sector
99.     The MRDPA provided the World Bank team with a database comprising the key
characteristics of all projects included in the PNDL for financing as of late November 2014 .
Roads (county and communal) represent by far the largest sector financed through PNLD in
2014, accounting for over 55% of the total program budget, followed by water and
wastewater (with over 22% and 16%, respectively). The table and figure below summarize
the PNDL’s allocation by sector for 2014, emphasizing that the core priorities have indeed
been aligned to the broader objective of the program – as also stated in the 2013-2016
Governing Program – namely the creation of a package of basic infrastructure for localities
around Romania (primarily in terms of roads, water, and sanitation).

2.2.3 By Implementation Status (Ongoing vs. New Investments)
100. Budgetary allocations among new and ongoing investments suggest that the
concerning tendency to begin numerous new works before completing ongoing ones has
continued in 2014. Indeed, the number of new projects is slightly higher than the number
of ongoing projects receiving PNDL allocations in 2014 (53% of the investments financed are
new). Ongoing projects received only 65% of the budget allocation. This is relatively low
given the typically large financial requirements of projects during the implementation phase
compared to the startup phase, which usually includes financing the detailed technical
design and possibly a limited first stage of works. However, the pattern is not homogenous
across sectors as can be seen in the table below.

101. This is indicative of one of the main issues with the current PNDL: in the absence
of clear and rigorous selection and prioritization criteria (not only for new projects, but
also for selection among ongoing and new projects), the project portfolio has continued
to expand. New projects enter the pipeline, while ongoing investments continue to
advance at a very slow pace due to lack of resources, facing the risk of degradation and
higher costs than initially estimated. The MRDPA and county-level authorities have
repeatedly stated that Romania should prioritize the completion of ongoing works, as
opposed to starting new ones. The number and value of ongoing projects are supposed to
factor into the MRDPA’s funding allocation across counties, while the projects’ percentage
completion rate is among the four possible criteria for prioritizing projects within a county
(though as the previous section noted the application of such criteria remains vague and
subjective). In practice, however, the PNDL has continued to finance new investments (over
2,100 projects have been started over the course of 2014), despite the very large portfolio
of ongoing projects. This situation risks creating an ever-growing backlog, and decision-
makers must strongly consider solutions for more impactful and efficient allocation of
funding.

                                                                                                                                                                                  54
102. A simple calculation goes a long way to show that it is vital to apply much more
rigor in the management of the PNDL portfolio going forward. Importantly, the total value
of the 3,952 PNDL projects (both new and ongoing) is roughly RON 22 billion (or EUR 5
billion). Assuming that the annual budget that PNDL will have at its disposal is similar to the
allocation received at the beginning of 2014 (i.e., around RON 1.5 billion in total, including
funds to pay for expenditures incurred during the previous year), at least 15 years will be
needed to finish the nearly 4,000 projects with financing contracts under the PNDL (or
about 10 years if the 2014 budget including all supplementary allocations was taken as a
basis). Obviously, this is neither an efficient, nor a realistic implementation timeline, yet
there is no clear evidence that the Government intends to “freeze” or at least slow down
the financing of new investments. Moreover, anecdotal evidence suggests that the 3,952
figure does not even include all ongoing projects previously financed by the MRDPA, so the
number of ongoing investments is likely to be even higher.

103. Moreover, of the ongoing projects, at least 1,188 (those for which data was
available) had a completion rate of less than 1%. In essence, this means that the large
majority of ongoing projects can also be considered to be de facto new projects, because
they had a very low completion rate. This can obviously create huge backlogs further down
the road.


2.2.4 By Geographic Location
104. The 2014 PNDL allocation for counties averages RON 57 million (roughly EUR 12.7
million), but there is variation across different areas of the country. The maps below show
such differences in terms of the number and, respectively, value of projects by county. The
smallest financial allocation went to Alba County (RON 32.6 million, or 1.39% of the total
PNDL budget), while Olt County received the highest allocation (RON 91 million, or 3.91% of
the total PNDL budget), nearly three times as high. It is true that Alba’s GDP/capita is 5,900
EUR/inhabitant, compared to 3,700 EUR/inhabitant for Olt, though this in of itself does not
justify allocating three times as much in funds for Olt. Despite such extreme examples, the
vast majority of county allocations (73%) are between 2-3% of the total PNDL allocation for
each county in total (i.e., including both new and ongoing investments).
105. Interestingly, there are significant differences across counties in the types of
projects they decided to finance, with some clearly expressing a preference for
completing ongoing investments as a matter of good practice. For instance, Vaslui County
received RON 50.4 million, investing RON 48.6 million in ongoing projects; similarly, Vâlcea
County received RON 78.7 million, of which RON 75.4 million (96%) went to ongoing
investments. By contrast, the counties with the largest shares of funds spent on completely
new projects include: Galați (75% of total funds allocated to new projects), Caraș-Severin
(68%), Alba (68%), Satu Mare (66%), and Tulcea (59%).

Analysis of Other Investment Programs Managed by DG RDI
106. The General Directorate for Regional Development and Infrastructure (DG RDI)
manages three other investment programs, in addition to the PNDL: 1) thermal
rehabilitation of apartment buildings; 2) social housing; and 3) housing for people
evacuated from nationalized housing. These three programs will be analyzed briefly in this
section. A more detailed assessment is included in Component 4 of the current technical
assistance program: “Assisting in Housing and Infrastructure Development Strategy.”

The Thermal Rehabilitation Program
107. The National Multiannual Program for Enhancing the Energy Efficiency of
Apartment Buildings (implemented according to GEO 18/2008) is one of the most
successful public investment programs in Romania. Before this program started, there had
been very few initiatives for rehabilitating apartment buildings in Romania, particularly
those dating from the communist era. Once the program was launched, however, thermal
rehabilitation efforts grew exponentially. The 2011 Census revealed that 22% of the total
number of 8.7 million apartments had been rehabilitated. Moreover, a large part of these
had been done with private funding. Of a total of 1.9 million thermally rehabilitated
apartments, only roughly 110,000 had been rehabilitated with funds from the state budget
through DG RDI (see table below). This means that the program has had a large multiplying
effect, mobilizing private sector resources in an area where its previous involvement had
been minimal.

108. The program’s key objective is to improve the energy efficienc y of housing built
between 1950 and 1990. The program wants to reduce heat consumption to under 100
Kwh/m2 , taking into account the fact that current consumption in buildings that have not
been rehabilitated is between 180-240 Kwh/m2 . The financing of these projects is according
to a financial scheme that has proven to be very efficient:
             - 50% of the funds come from the state budget, within the limits of the
                  annual allocations in the budget of the MRDPA;
             - 30% of the funds are from local budgets and/or other legal sources;
             - 20% of the funds are contributed by the re sidents’ associations and/or
                  other legal sources.
Under special circumstances (for social expenditures), local authorities could cover, within
the annual budgets approved, the co-financing share of the residents’ associations.


                                                                                                57
The Program for Development of Social Housing
109. The Program for Development of Social Housing intervenes where real estate
markets do not function properly, as mandated by Law 114/1996. The program targets
people in need, as defined by current legislation, to facilitate their access to a dwelling –
either to own or to rent. Promoting, implementing, and co-financing investment projects
fall under the mandate of local public authorities. The allocation of social housing units is
done by local councils, based on specific requests and based on specialized assessments by
a social commission. To get access to social housing, families and individuals must have an
average monthly income (for the last 12 months) that is lower than the average monthly
income. The nominal rent is subsidized by the local budget and the maximum level of the
rent for social housing cannot exceed 10% of the family’s average monthly income. Social
housing units can be designated in both new buildings and in rehabilitated buildings, but
they cannot be sold, as they are part of the public domain of the jurisdiction where they
are located. About 4,300 social housing units have been built through this program
between 2001 and 2014. The budget allocated for this type of investments exceeds RON
180 million for the same time period.

The Program for Developing Housing for Evacuated Persons
110. The program for social housing development for people who used to live in
nationalized homes (according to GEO 74/2007 and GEO 68/2006) also plays a key role in
a real estate market that has been heavily shaped by the retrocession process after 1989.
The aim of the program is to develop social housing for evacuated former renters of these
properties. The fund for housing for evacuated persons is managed by the local council in
those territorial administrative units where such beneficiaries reside and where they make
specific requests for such housing (these persons have to fulfill, cumulatively, the
requirements set by art. 1, paragraph (3), from GEO 74/2007):
            - they have a net monthly income, for the past 12 months, at least 20%
                 lower than the average monthly income determined annually by
                 Government Decision, as warranted by article 8, paragraph 2 in the
                 Housing Law 114/1996, republished, with subsequent adjustments and
                 additions;
            - they are disabled persons or retirees.
The social housing units belong to the public domain and cannot be sold. They can be
designated as such in new buildings or in rehabilitated existing buildings. The program is
approved annually and the budgetary allocations by the MRDPA are done according to the
requests sent by local public authorities.

Chapter 3: Key Infrastructure Sectors in Romania
111. As noted in the introduction to this report, this chapter is primarily meant to
provide a detailed background into the three main sectors that the PNDL targets: roads
(county and local); water and wastewater; and social infrastructure . The following
sections are primarily descriptive, but serve to anchor the analysis that follows in chapters
4 and 5, covering: an overview of each sector; main players and key legislation; strategies
and plans; and major investment programs funded by the EU or by the central government.


3.1 Roads
112. Roads – and connective infrastructure generally – are crucial for ensuring
people’s access to opportunitie s and represent critical investments for Romania’s
inclusive and sustainable development. As outlined in the draft National Territorial
Development Strategy and in the World Bank’s report on Competitive Cities: Reshaping the
Economic Geography of Romania, roads in particular are vital for a country’s future
development. Connective infrastructure enables one crucial desideratum: it eases people’s
access to places of opportunity, i.e., cities (in most countries). Cities benefit from
economies of scale and scope and are the places where most of the jobs are located, where
centers of culture can thrive, where higher education institutions and health-care units can
operate and perform properly, where art is generated and enjoyed. The bigger the city, the
more opportunities it usually offers. Consequently, the better these cities are connected to
their hinterland, the more people in peri-urban areas have access to these opportunities.
Moreover, the firms in the city have easier access to a larger labor pool. Connective
infrastructure also enables the formation of functional urban areas, a key objective of EU’s
regional development policy.

113. Romania has a poor endowment of roads infrastructure. As the graph below
indicates, it has one of the lowest road densities of any country in Europe and, within the
EU, Romania ranked last in terms of the overall quality of the roads infrastructure. 38 In fact,
when compared to its actual development level, Romania seems to require a road density
double the current number. Deficiencies are encountered for all types of road
infrastructure: highways, national roads, and county and communal roads. In 2012, out of a
network of 84,000 km, only around 0.6% represented motorways, with 20% national roads
and around 80% county and communal roads.

114. The highway network in Romania is underdeveloped and far from what
Romania’s economy could sustain. With 635 kilometers of highway completed in August
2014, Romania had a highway density of around 31 kilometers for 1,000,000 people. By
comparison, Hungary had a highway density of 137 per 1,000,000 people, while Portugal
had a highway density of 249. The second figure below highlights the proposed network of
highways for Romania, as laid out in the National Spatial Plan (Planul de Amenajare al
Teritoriului National). The total proposed highway network comprises 3,896 KM, while the
proposed expressway network totals 4,851 km.

115. The county and communal road network is generally in poor condition and
requires extensive upgrade and maintenance work. In 2012, around 34,000 km of county
and communal roads (55% of all county and communal roads) were made of gravel or earth
and required modernization. The costs required to modernize these roads are somewhere
between EUR 6 and 12 billion, according to the standard costs for county and communal
roads modernization used by the Ministry of Regional Development and Public
Administration (MRDPA). In addition, many county and communal roads require
rehabilitation. Around 21,000 km of county and communal roads had only a light cover and
only 12,000 were completely modernized. The map below indicates the counties with the
highest number of county and communal roads in need of modernization.

        Figure 17 . The road network’s length varies greatly across Romanian counties




116. The Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration has
acknowledged the need for investments in connective infrastructure and has prioritized
the allocation of funds in this area. For the 2014 fiscal year, the MRDPA has strategically
focused through the PNDL only on investments in county and communal roads and water
and wastewater infrastructure (although the range of investments that the MRDPA could
undertake through the PNDL is much wider). This way, limited resources can be used both
to achieve EU acquis targets in the water and wastewater sector and, more broadly, to
reach key development targets for Romania.

117. In order for PNDL investments to deliver maximum developmental impact, it is
critical to ensure proper coordination with other road development programs in
Romania. With this in mind, the following section will provide an overview of the sector,
describing key players and the legal framework in force, the result of norms at various
levels (supra-national, national, and subnational). The second sub-section further looks at


                                                                                        62
the design of strategies in the transport sector, assessing key steps in the elaboration of
key planning documents, stakeholders, and coordination mechanisms, particularly across
different sources of financing (i.e., state-budget vs. EU funds).

3.1.1 Sector Structure

Key Players

 Level           Key Players

                   The European Union
                      o The EU is not only the largest outside funder of transport infrastructure in
                        Romania, but it also shapes policy in the sector.
                      o Romania will continue to be able to access EU Funds for the 2014-2020
                        programming period for investments in the TEN-T network, which includes the
                        Core Network (roads considered to be the most important nodes and links of the
                        TEN-T) and the Comprehensive Network (a basic multi -modal network that lays
                        out all the transport modes).

                   The World Bank
                      o Since the 1990s, the World Bank has financed over 1,100 km of national roads,
                        road rehabilitation work and development of several city bypasses, in addition to
                        smaller-scale roads in rural areas.
                      o The national road segments financed by the Bank are part of the TEN-T Core and
                        Comprehensive Networks, and several road links are now slated to be upgraded
 Supranational
                        with EU funds.

                   The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
                      o Over the past couple of decades the EBRD has co-financed several road
                        rehabilitation and municipal infrastructure projects, in addition to development of
                        new objectives, such as Pitesti and the Constanta bypasses.
                      o The three-year strategy for Romania approved in 2012 has a strong component on
                        development of transport infrastructure.

                   The European Investment Bank (EIB)
                      o The EIB helps the Romanian Government with the co-financing of several TEN-T
                        investments through the SOP Transport 2007-2013, including bypasses, national
                        roads, and sections of highways.
                      o The financing provided by the bank to Romania in recent years for transport and
                        telecommunications sector amounts to EUR 1 billion.
                   Ministry of Transport (MoT)
                      o The Ministry of Transport has been the key national level player in the field of
                        transport, and is also responsible for elaborating policies regarding the transport
                        sector. The MoT was the Managing Authority for the EU-funded 2007-2013
                        Operational Program Transport.
 National
                   National Company for Highways and National Roads (CNADNR)
                      o The National Company for Highways and National Roads (CNADNR), an entity

                    modernization and for road upkeep and maintenance work, and invests in the
                    development of highways, expressways, bypasses, the modernization of national
                    roads, and the rehabilitation of bridges.
                  o As a direct beneficiary of EU funds, CNADNR is in charge of development of TEN-T
                    network and the modernization of national roads and development of bypasses.

               Ministry of European Funds (MEF)
                 o The MEF elaborates the Partnership Agreement with the EU that covers, among
                    other things, priorities in the transport sector (including road development).
                 o The MEF will serve as the Managing Authority for the Operational Programme
                    Large Infrastructure (LIOP) 2014-2020. The main beneficiary of LIOP will be the
                    CNADNR.

               Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA)
                 o The MRDPA develops county and communal road projects both from the state
                    budget and with EU funds. Regarding the former, it coordinates the National Local
                    Development Program (PNDL) through which it provides grants to county councils
                    and local authorities in towns and communes. As for EU-funded instruments, the
                    MRDPA is the Managing Authority for the Regional Operational Programme
                    through which Romania has contracted subnational road development projects
                    with a total value of EUR 1.4 billion during the 2007-2013 programming period.
                 o The Ministry also oversees the development of road projects financed through a
                    number of EU-funded Territorial Cooperation programs.

               Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD)
                 o The MARD finances communal road development projects through its EU-funded
                    National Rural Development Programme (PNDR) that focuses primarily on small
                    projects in rural areas. The PNDR is described separately later on.

               Ministry of Public Finance
                  o The Ministry assesses major public investment programs, including transport
                    infrastructure, in order to make sure that such investments are done within
                    expenditure limits and fall within given selection and prioritization criteria (see
                    GEO 88/2013).
               Regional Development Agencies (RDAs)
                  o RDAs are public purpose non-governmental organizations that also serve as
                    intermediate bodies for EU-funded programs – primarily for the Regional
                    Operational Programme (ROP).
                  o Although RDAs do not actually take on road investment projects, they play a key
                    role at the planning level – they develop the regional development plans (RDPs),
                    which summarize a region’s development strategy for a programming period.
Subnational
               County Councils
                  o The largest subnational administrative units in the country (41 units plus the
                    capital city), county councils are responsible for planning, managing, and financing
                    of county roads.
                  o They can finance county road investment projects from their own funds, from
                    state-budget programs, with the help of EU funds, or from loans provided by


                                                                                            64

                   Local authorities
                      o All investments developed at the local level are done by local authorities –
                        municipalities, towns, or communes.
                      o Subject to size and development level, some local authorities are more capable
                        than others in generating their own funds for road development/rehabilitation/
                        modernization.

                   National Spatial Plan
                      o All road investments in Romania have to take into consideration the National
                        Spatial Plan, a document that sets out the network of highways and expressways
                        to be developed in the coming years. The Plan is mandatory.
                      o The proposed TEN-T Network for Romania (both the Core Network and the
                        Comprehensive Network) has been incorporated in the blueprint provided by the
                        Plan. The document has to be considered also with regard to national roads,
National
                        county roads, communal roads, as to ensure that new road developments are
                        spatially coordinated with the proposed network of highways and expressways.
                      o The Plan needs to be adopted to take into consideration the new General
                        Transport Master Plan.

                     o Government Ordinance 16/1999 approving the Priority Program for the
                       Development of Highways - including București-Pitești and București -Constanța .
                     o Law 1/2002 approving Ordinance 16/1999 and for the completion of proposed
                       highways and expressways (including Bucuresti-Fetești -Cernavodă and Bucuresti -
                       Ploieș ti).

                 Cost standards for different types of roads used by CNADNR
                    o Different cost standards have been set for road investment projects and are
                      aimed at providing guidance for such projects under various geographic
                      conditions




3.1.2 Strategies and Plans

Level           Strategies and Plans

                 Europe 2020
                    o The strategy is the framework document that sets out EU priorities for the 2014-
                      2020 programming period and lays the foundation for how EU Structural Funds
                      and the Cohesion Fund will be used.
                    o With its three priorities resting on smart, sustainable, and inclusive gr owth, the
                      strategy’s main five targets focus on employment, research & development,
                      climate change and energy sustainability, education, and fighting poverty and
                      social exclusion.
                    o Although transport connectivity is not part of the strategy, the document
                      di scusses connectivity briefly under “Other tools for growth and jobs,” where it
                      indicates that a deepening of the single market requires that bottlenecks to cross-
                      border activity and insufficiently interconnected networks must be addressed.

                 TEN-T Policy
Supranational       o The Trans-European Network, commonly known as TEN-T, is based on the
                      subsidiarity principle, according to which Member States are responsible for
                      developing and maintaining infrastructure, with or without collaboration with the
                      private sector.
                    o It focuses more on rehabilitation and upgrade of existing roads, and it has a dual -
                      layer structure, namely the Core Network, which is of strategic importance for EU-
                      wide connectivity, and a Comprehensive Network, which ensures the accessibility
                      and connectivity of all the regions in the EU.
                    o Eligible road infrastructure projects include high-quality roads (such as highways,
                      expressways, and conventional strategic roads), parking and rest areas, and
                      connections between different modes of transport.
                    o High-quality roads of crossing and interchanges can be funded through EU funds,
                      thus allowing coordination of investments in the TEN-T network and the
                      national/subnational road network.
                    o Development of the network should focus on: (a) modal integration; (b)



                                                                                              66
Level      Strategies and Plans

                  interoperability; and (c) a coordinated development of infrastructure (with a focus
                  on cross-border sections and bottlenecks).

            European Union Strategy for the Danube Region (EUSDR)
                o The Strategy is an EU cooperation mechanism for the 14 EU and non-EU countries
                  that belong to the Ri ver Danube’s basin, aimed at promoting economic and social
                  development by enforcing and implementing EU policies and legislation.
                o The EUSDR aims to complete the existing TEN-T rail and road priority projects
                  crossing the Danube Region in order to improve mobility and multimodality in the
                  region by setting up a Joint Platform to coordinate the work as to accelerate the
                  implementation of the projects.
                o The Action Plan outlines activities covering the strategy’s four main priorities: a)
                  connecting the Danube region; b) protecting the environment in the region; c)
                  building prosperity; and d) strengthening the Danube region.
                o In Romania, the strategy is implemented by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with
                  support from the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration
                  and the Ministry of European Funds.
                o Romania coordinates the activities for inland waterway transport and
                  management of environmental risks. The strategy mentions the construction of
                  two new bridges over the Danube between Romania and Bulgaria, which would
                  link Bechet to Oriahovo and Călăraşi to Silistra.
                o Other actions include interventions focusing on sustainable metropolitan
                  transport systems through river-bus connections between urban centers along the
                  Danube River and public transport lines, small crossings, and bridges in order to
                  improve regional and local cross-border infrastructure and access to rural areas.

            The General Transport Master Plan (GTMP)
               o The Plan sets the main directions for developing the transport sector in Romania
                 with regard to major highways and national roads, rail, and maritime
                 infrastructure. After a lengthy process, it was published in draft form in late 2014
                 and approved through a Government Memorandum in early March 2015. At the
                 time of writing this report (early March), the GTMP does not have final EC
                 approval.
               o Main targets are as follows:
                   Road transportation: 1,300 kilometers of highways, worth 13.7 billion euros;
                      express roads — 925 kilometers, 9.9 billion euros; trans -regional roads —
                      2,870 kilometers, 1.6 billion euros, and trans -European roads — 343
National
                      kilometers, 190 million euros.
                   Rail: Rebuilding 2,800 kilometers of railway and electrification of 489
                      kilometers.
                   Maritime: 3 billion euros are going to be invested in the Constanta, Galati,
                      Drobeta Turnu Severin, and other harbors.
                   Also, by 2020, Romania plans to have seven international airports upgraded.

            The Governing Program 2013-2016
               o The key priorities in the Transport sector outlined in the program pertain to
                 highways and county and communal roads.
               o The program identifies six critical links for highway development, including



                                                                                          67
Level         Strategies and Plans

                    completion of the A1 and A3 Highways. The Large Infrastructure Projects Section
                    sets a different set of priorities for large road investments (e.g., the Comarnic -
                    Brașov Highway).
                  o Modernization of county roads should be a priority in order to improve
                    accessibility to the national and European road network.
                  o The document is less explicit when it comes to priorities for the development of
                    other types of road infrastructure.
               The National Territorial Development Strategy (SDTR) 2035 (draft)
                  o The SDTR 2035 is based on three concepts (Concentration, Connection, and
                    Cooperation) as the driving forces for the urbanization process by promoting
                    better access to and between urban centers and by increasing regional flows.
                  o The first key objective of the strategy is the development of an efficient and
                    diversified transport network, capable of managing the growing movement of
                    people and goods within and outside Romania. The main priorities include
                    integration into the EU’s highway network, the completion of the A1 and A3
                    Highways, in addition to improving connections to București.
                  o At the local and regional level, the strategy proposes improved transport
                    connections between the country’s main urban centers and their hinterland.

               The National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS) 2013-2020-2030
                  o The NSDS is one of the country’s long -term development strategies, aimed at
                    linking Romania to a new philosophy of development, more in-tune with EU
                    principles and with global best-practices on sustainable development.
                  o Sustainable Transport is one of the key objectives of the strategy, i.e., to improve
                    the transport network and adjust it to economic, social, and environmental needs,
                    while reducing negative economic, social, and environmental externalities.
                  o The strategy also targets modernization of the road infrastructure in order to
                    reduce traffic accidents, improve traffic flows, and diminish pollution in cities.

               The Romanian EU Partnership Agreement (PA) 2014-2020
                  o A document approved by the European Commission, the PA is perhaps one of the
                    most important planning documents in Romania with regard to actua l
                    investments, charting out how EUR 40 billion in EU grants will be spent between
                    2014 and 2020.
                  o The PA identifies the lack of proper transport infrastructure as one of the major
                    development challenges in Romania. Key priorities with regard to transport sector
                    include the completion of the missing links of the Rhine-Danube Corridor,
                    development of additional major transport links of the TEN-T Comprehensive
                    network and improvement of the secondary and tertiary connections to TEN-T.

               Regional Development Plans (RDPs)
                  o RDPs are prepared by the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs), with the
                    purpose of guiding investments at regional and county/local level. These include
                    projects financed under the Regional Operational Programme, but RDPs also cover
Subnational
                    needs beyond the ROP. Importantly, RDPs are not binding planning documents
                    (their implementation depends on each county/local authority).
                  o All RDPs include objectives related to the development and rehabilitation of
                    transport infrastructure.


                                                                                            68
Level   Strategies and Plans

         Regional Spatial Plans
            o The Regional Spatial Plans ( Plan de Amenajare al Teritoriului Zonal – PATZ) are
              binding documents for lower-level spatial plans and they are prepared either at
              the national or at the subnational level.
            o Such plans make a number of recommendations for new infrastructure needs,
              thus a clear claim on the territory in the region is made, which will then influence
              territorial decisions taken at a lower level.

         County Development Strategies
            o Prepared by county councils, County Development Strategies include proposals
              for investments in county road infrastructure with a list of road development
              projects. However, the projects included in such strategies are not prioritized –
              they are primarily a laundry list of desired investments, sometimes with potential
              sources of funding mentioned.
            o For development strategies to be effective they should be linked to clear
              operational programs and to reliable sources of funding, thus the documents
              should set clear priorities coupled with specific funding sources.

         County Spatial Plans
            o County spatial plans ( Planuri de Amenajare a Teritoriului Județean - PATJ) are
              normative documents that lay down development restrictions and guidelines, as
              well as the territorial interventions to be pursued within a given time period.
            o The Plans must be correlated with national and regional level spatial plans and
              strategies. Most county spatial plans simply include the new proposals for
              national road links, and proposals for the modernization/rehabilitation of county
              and local roads.

         Local Development Strategies
            o Many localities prepare development strategies. Such documents not only lay
              down key issues that a local administration should tackle, but are needed as a
              precondition to access certain funding sources (e.g., in the case of the ROP).
            o Often times, these strategies include projects that focus on the rehabilitation/
              modernization of the existent transport infrastructure and can include proposals
              for new infrastructure or for the extension of existing networks.

         General Urban Plans
            o General Urban Plans (Planuri Urbanistice Generale – PUG) are the key tools used
              by local authorities to direct spatial interventions, providing development
              restrictions and guidelines, in addition to laying down the infrastructure
              developments proposed for completion within the timeline covered by the
              document (usually 10 years).

3.1.3 Investment Programs

The Regional Operational Programme (ROP) 2014-202039
118. Road infrastructure is tackled under Priority Axis 6 designed to improve
infrastructure of regional importance in order to increase access to roads connecting to
the TEN-T network. The goal is to enhance accessibility of rural and urban areas located in
the proximity of the TEN-T network through modernization of the county roads by
increasing promotion of sustainable transport systems and removal of bottlenecks within
major infrastructure networks. The EUR 957 million Romania will receive from the EU
under this axis targets development and modernization of the regional transport network.
The development of the secondary transport network will help increase inter- and intra-
regional cooperation and will add to the competitiveness of enterprises and the labor
force.

119. The main investment priority focuses on stimulating regional mobility through
connection to secondary and tertiary nodes of the TEN-T, including multimodal nodes. To
this end, the types of actions supported by the ROP include a wide range of investments:
modernization of county road network allowing direct or indirect connection to the TEN-T
network; construction of new segments of county roads to connect to highways and
expressways; development and modernization of bypasses holding the status of county
roads; and construction of roundabouts aimed at increasing traffic safety. In addition, the
ROP will support the construction/modernization/rehabilitation of passages and road
nodes as to ensure connectivity of county roads to TEN-T highways, development of
pedestrian flyovers, in addition to construction or modernization of public transport stops
on county road routes. Other investments focus on improving traffic and road safety
(including pedestrian routes and bike lanes).

120. The transport infrastructure investments developed under the ROP will increase
the mobility of people and goods, ensuring better and rapid access to health, social
services, and education providers in large and small cities . At the same time, the
development of a sustainable transport system network will contribute to enhancing the
transport capacity on the TEN-T by reducing travel time and stimulating alternative routes
for transport of both passengers and goods. Proposals to be taken into consideration
should correlate with other relevant important documents (such as the strategic projects as
part of the Regional Development Plans, the General Transport Master Plan, the EU
Strategy for the Danube Region, etc.). It is unclear how and to what extent this correlation
will be evaluated and rewarded as part of the financing proposal evaluation process.


The Regional Operational Programme (ROP) 2007-2013
121. The stated objective of the ROP 2007-2013 relates to Romania’s regional
development. The ROP programmatic document notes that the program’s aim is
“supporting the economic, social, territorially balanced and sustainable development of the
Romanian Regions, according to their specific needs and resources, focusing on urban

     This is based on the January 2015 draft of the ROP 2014 -2020


                                                                                         70
growth poles, improving the business environment and basic infrastructure in order to
make the Romanian Regions, especially the ones lagging behind, more attractive places t o
live, visit, invest in, and work.” 40 To achieve these objectives, the ROP 2007-2013 was
organized around five priority axes, while at the same time acknowledging that it would not
be able to achieve these objectives alone, but would require the complementary inputs of
other investment programs, of key targeted policies, and of the private sector. Of particular
interest to this study is Axis 2: Improvement of regional and local transport infrastructure.

122. The ROP 2007-2013 Priority Axis 2 aims to “increase t he accessibility of the
Regions and the mobility of population, goods, and services, in order to foster
sustainable economic development.” 41 Around 150 projects have been contracted under
this axis, for a total value of over EUR 1.4 billion, with much of this going to the
rehabilitation of county roads. One of the key stated aims of this axis is to improve
connectivity to the TEN-T Network and to reduce the incidence of road accidents. These
stated aims have in turn informed the elaboration of the evaluation and selection grid for
this axis and have also impacted the way county roads have been rehabilitated. As the map
below indicates, the large majority of ROP 2007-2013 county road projects connect to the
TEN-T.

The Large Infrastructure Operational Programme (LIOP) 2014-202042
123. The LIOP 2014-2020 is a new operational program that tackles two major
development-related challenges in Romania, namely infrastructure and resources. The
program is designed to bring its contribution to fulfill the overall goal of reducing economic
and social development disparities between Romania and EU Member States. Priority Axis
1 of the LIOP promotes sustainable transport systems and removal of bottlenecks around
major infrastructure networks by increasing mobility through development and expansion
of the TEN-T road network. The EU support for this axis amounts to a total of EUR 3.4
billion through the Cohesion Fund (CF), of which EUR 1.59 billion is allocated for road
infrastructure. The money will finance works for roads segments that have been initiated
under the 2007-2013 programming period, as well as those that are included in the General
Transport Master Plan (approved in early March 2015). The development of such roads will
increase mobility by reducing the travel time along the TEN-T network for passengers and
goods not only within Romania and but also between the country and different regions in
Europe, with the ultimate goal of boosting economic competitiveness.

124. The instrument aims to ensure connectivity primarily between cities over 125,000
people and the border. To this end, the program will support construction and
modernization of highways, expressways and national roads along the TEN-T network. The
TEN-T network in Romania eligible for funding includes a number of segments, among
which are Timișoara -Drobeta Turnu Severin-Calafat; Bucureşti-Ploiești-Bacău-Suceava to
the border with Ukraine, and Sebeş-Turda-Târgu Mureş-Târgu Neamț-Iaşi-to the border
with the Republic of Moldova. One of the major objectives to be financed under the 2014-
2020 programming period is the completion of Nădlac-Constanța highway, crossing the
country from West to East.

125. Development of road infrastructure is also eligible under the Priority Axis 2 aimed
at developing an efficient and sustainable multimodal transport system along the TEN-T
network. The overall EU money available under this priority axis amounts to EUR 1.7
billion. Among other things, the axis focuses on the development of a single European
multimodal transport space through investments in the TEN-T corridors with the aim of
connecting main urban centers and secondary nodes to the EU-designated network.
Investments are provided through the European Regional Development Fund to
complement those designated to increase mobility of road infrastructure through the
Cohesion Fund, with the three-fold goals of ensuring high road standards, enhancing road
safety, and significantly reducing the travel time. Investments tackle modernization and
development of roads belonging to the TEN-T network, including construction of related
bypasses. Eligible proposals include multi-phase projects that have already been initiated
under the 2007-2013 Transport Operational Program, projects included in the list of
priorities of the General Transport Master Plan, and new projects that should begin after
2019. Another priority investment area under this axis supports improvement of regional
connectivity by linking poorly connected areas to the TEN-T network, hence linking people

living in these regions (e.g., North-East and North-West of the country) to opportunity
centers. To this end, priority should be given to projects that have been already started
under the 2007-2013 programming period with regard to development and modernization
of the road network.


The Sectoral Operational Program Transport 2007-2013
126. SOP-Transport 2007-2013 aims to help with the development of large transport
infrastructure in Romania and thus promote sustainable growth, competitiveness, and
employment. The SOP-T 2007-2013 is designed around four priority axes, of which Axis 1 –
Modernization and Development of the TEN-T Network and Axis 2 – Modernization and
Development of the National Road Network are of particular importance for the purposes
of this report. These two axes are also the ones that have received the most generous
funding – around 96% of the total EUR 5.4 billion allocation. The development of the
highway network totaled a budget (including non-eligible costs) of around EUR 3.9 billion;
the rehabilitation of the national road network and the development of new bypasses
totaled around EUR 1.4 billion.

The National Rural Development Programme (PNDR) 2014-202043
127. In terms of road infrastructure, the program will support proposals tackling
development, expansion, and modernization of rural roads of local interest. Local
authorities can apply to develop and modernize their communal and local roads, as well as
the streets within rural localities. Priority should be given to roads linking to the main roads
and other transportation ways, providing access to economic operators, tourism areas,
social infrastructure developments, and to other investments funded from EU money.
Again, it is unclear how this intended correlation with other EU investments will be
factored into the evaluation grid – final details are pending until the PNDR Applicant Guide
will be published later in 2015. Together with water supply and sanitation systems, a good
road infrastructure is crucial for the rural community as it should allow people to reach out
to opportunities, education facilities, health and social services, thus enhancing overall
their living conditions.

128. Currently, the road infrastructure in rural areas is still underdeveloped and
hinders economic development and employment. In 2011 less than half of the communal
roads were paved and almost one-third of the transport network in rural areas was made
up of dirt roads that hardly can be used during rainfalls. The support provided by the NRDP
for development of roads in rural communities will contribute to the decrease of social and
economic inequalities in rural areas. At the same time, a good local road infrastructure is
crucial to economic development; it can enable the development of businesses in the
respective communities, opening the way for a competitive rural economy by fostering
entrepreneurship and innovation.


The National Rural Development Programme (PNDR) 2007-2013
129. The PNDR 2007-2013 set out objectives for each of its four major priority axes.
Among these, the stated aim of Axis 3 is to “encourage the diversification of the rural
economy and, through this and otherwise, to improve the quality of life in the rural
environment.”44 The programmatic document also indicates, for example, that only half of
the communes in Romania had access to the road network in 2004. Moreover, 25% of
communes could not use the road network during unfavorable weather.

130. Axis 3 of the PNDR 2007-2013 targets three key objectives, each with a subset of
specific goals and measures. Of relevance to this report is the stated Strategic Objective to
“increase the attractiveness of rural areas.” 45 The Specific Objectives listed under this
Strategic Objective include: “Creating and modernizing the basic physical infrastructure in
rural areas”; “Improvement of the quality of the social, natural, and economic environment
in the rural areas”; “Protection and conservation of the rural cultural and natural heritage”;
and “Creation, improvement, and diversification of tourism facilities and attractions.” The
following Specific Measures are listed under these Specific Objectives: Measure 322:
“Village renewal and development, improvement of basic services for the economy and
rural population, conservation and upgrading the rural heritage”; Measure 313:

“Encouraging tourism activities.” Of these, it is Measure 322 that is of particular interest to
this work. For the 2007-2013 programming period, PNDR allocated EUR 1.6 billion for
Measure 322. The map below highlights the localities that have contracted PNDR 2007-
2013 funds for communal roads development.

State-Budget-Funded Programs
131. There are a number of programmatic documents that guide road development
projects in Romania. Three major road development programs have been started by the
Government of Romania. In 1990, the Government launched the National Program for the
Modernization of National Roads and Construction of Highways. The Prog ram started in
1994, initially with financing from the World Bank and the state-budget, and subsequently
with financing from the EBRD and from EU pre-accession funds. The Program proposed the
modernization of 11,300 km of national roads in 15 phases, from 1994 through 2014. Only
20% of the planned length was actually completed by August 2014, and only the first 3 of
the 15 phases were closed. Phases IV, V, and VI are now under implementation. In 1999,
the Government started the Priority Program for the Development of Highways, which was
extended in 2002. It is not fully clear how the decisions to finance the identified road links
were taken. There are no specific policy documents backing these investment programs.
For its part, the MRDPA finances through the PNDL county roads and communal roads at
the subnational level. This program was discussed in more detail under Chapter 2.


                                                                                            75
3.2 Water and Wastewater
132. Water and wastewater investments are crucial for ensuring people’s access to
opportunities and make a funda mental contribution to Romania’s sustainable and inclusive
development. Recognizing the importance of this sector and seeking to accelerate its
development, the EU has proposed tight deadlines for improving Member States’ water and
sanitation infrastructure. Starting from the premise that individual productivity is the bedrock of
economic growth, governments around the world should make every possible effort to ensure
the same start in life for their citizens, empowering them to maximize the impact of their
productive pursuits. In plain terms, people should not have to worry about fulfilling fundamental
needs like running water and adequate sanitation. But in many parts of Romania communities
continue to lack basic local infrastructure, forcing people to spend precious time and resources
to access nearby water sources or sanitation facilities. The repercussions are multifold and can
contribute to reinforcing the vicious cycle of poverty by taking time away from academic and
professional activities and placing communities without water and wastewater infrastructure at
a disadvantage compared to others across Romania.

133. Romania’s water sector has several key characteristics. Based on the World Bank’s
“Integrated Water Resources Rapid Assessment,” the average wate r availability in Romania is
roughly 2000 cubic meters per capita per year – above the threshold generally defined for water
stress (1700 cubic meter per capita per year), but much lower than the average value for Europe
(roughly 4500 cubic meters per capita per year). 46 In addition to significant capital investment
needs, Romania needs to carefully manage the water sector to ensure resource conservation
and sustainability. Water demand is segmented as follows: industry (67%), agriculture (18%),
and municipal (18%). Total demand figures show a marked decrease from 20 BCM/year in 1990
to only 6.5 BCM in 2012, for a variety of causes (lower industrial activity, reduction in irrigation
system use, increases in efficiency, etc.). Water availability also varies across river basins, with
the lowest levels in the Dobrogea-Litoral area, as shown in the figure below. As for water
quality, only 59% of the 3,399 bodies of water met the EU standards in 2009. 47 It is proposed to
increase this share to 65% by 2015.

134. Data on water and wastewater infrastructure from the last Census in 2011 reveals
multiple insights. First, there are still significant discrepancies persist across regions and
counties, with the East and the South – with the obvious exception of the capital of Bucharest –
clearly less developed than other regions in terms of both water supply and sanitation systems.
Second, even the most developed counties in Romania (e.g., Ilfov, Cluj, Timiș etc.) continue to
show gaps, so interventions cannot simply focus only on the poorest counties. Third, the
mapping of water and wastewater infrastructure endowment shows the polarization of
development: areas around Bucharest and the seven growth poles (i.e., Ploiești, Brașov, Craiova,
Timișoara, Cluj-Napoca, Iași, and Constanța), key engines of Romania’s economy, typically have
superior access to basic services. 48 This makes sense from a technical perspective, as it is easier
to first expand the existing network from urban centers to neighboring peri-urban and rural
areas, even if not always the most cost effective solution (in terms of costs, sustainability, and
environmental results). The same typically holds from an affordability perspective, as people
around large, dynamic cities are more likely to be able to cover the monthly cost of connecting
their households to water and sanitation networks.

135. Above all, the data clearly show that Romania still has huge needs with respect to
water and wastewater infrastructure. Just to conform to EU requirements in this sector,
described in more detail below, the required funds exceed EUR 12.6 billion. 49 When considering
the total need for ensuring full coverage for both water and wastewater services, the numbers
are even higher. Based on data gathered from county-level Master Plans drafted for the 2007-
2013 programming period, the total need for investments is estimated at EUR 31.1 billion, with
EUR 12.8 billion for water supply and EUR 18.3 billion for sanitation. This is based on adding up
all the investment costs estimated for each area covered by a regional operator, as reflected in
the corresponding Master Plans. These sums are very large – and some would say unaffordable
– in comparison to the country’s capacity to support such investments – for example, addressing
the full need of EUR 31 billion would be equivalent t o roughly 22% of the Romania’s annual
GDP. 50

136. In full recognition of the critical importance of local infrastructure, both the European
Union and the Government have prioritized interventions in water and wastewater systems to
address the pressing needs and ensure that Romania fulfills EU acquis requirements. Pre-
accession EU-funded programs like ISPA and PHARE have supported local authorities in creating
regional operators responsible for implementing projects in the water sector. The Operational

Programme (OP) for Environment 2007-2013 included a specific axis for supporting such
investments – Axis 1 for “Expansion and modernization of water supply and sanitation systems”
– with a budget of EUR 3.3 billion (including the national-level contribution) and 88.16% co-
financing from the EU. 51 For the 2014-2020 programming period, investments in water and
sanitation infrastructure will be continued under the Large Infrastructure OP (LIOP), which aims
to channel an additional EUR 5.5 billion (including the state budget co-financing) to the
environment sector, averaging about EUR 110-120 million per county. The proposed allocation
of LIOP 2014-2020 EU grants for water and wastewater infrastructure is around EUR 2 billion,
which is far from covering all needs and from fulfilling (on its own) the EU acquis requirements
on time. For its part, the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA)
has managed different state-budget-funded programs to support water and wastewater
projects – before 2012 through the now-defunct National Program for Infrastructure
Development (PNDI) and currently through the National Local Development Program (PNDL).
Preliminary observations suggest that investments in the water and wastewater sector are not
fully aligned across different financing sources, missing out on synergies and rendering
suboptimal outcomes. If the status quo persists, Romania risks missing the targets set by EU-
level legislation and incurring even greater delays in enabling all Romanians basic access to
essential services like drinking water and sanitation.

137. Keeping in mind the high stakes involved, the current chapter provides a review of the
water and wastewater sector on three core dimensions: (1) structure; (2) strategic planning;
and (3) implementation and post-implementation. The first sub-section provides an overview
of the sector, describing key players and the legal framework in force, the result of norms at
various levels (supra-national, national, and subnational). The second sub-section further looks
at the design of strategies in the water and wastewater sector, assessing key steps in the
elaboration of key planning documents, stakeholders, and coordination mechanisms,
particularly across different sources of financing (i.e., state-budget vs. EU funds). Finally, the
third section assesses the implementation and post-implementation of water and wastewater
projects, exploring in greater depth the question of harmonizing processes, procedures, and
timelines for enhanced impact, proper monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and consistent
knowledge sharing.


3.2.1 Sector Structure
138. The system of water and wastewater investments in Romania features multiple levels,
including supra-national, national, and subnational stakeholders. The next sub-sections review
the main players and the core legal framework that shape the evolution of Romania’s water and
wastewater sector. This is not a comprehensive stakeholder mapping, nor is it a full review of
the environment sector, concentrating instead on water and wastewater because such types of
investments are included under the PNDL.

Key Players

Level           Key Players

                 The European Union
                    o The EU fulfills three key functions in the sector: setting policy directions, developing
                      legally binding instruments, and supporting financing investments in the water and
                      sanitation systems of Member States. The Directorate General Environment leads
                      EU policies in the water and wastewater sector.
                    o Water and sanitation projects are funded through the Cohesion Fund and the ERDF.
                      For the 2007-2013 programming period, the EU has financed water and sanitation
                      projects in Romania through the OP Environment and through the PNDR. For 2014 -
                      2020, it will finance such investments through the OP Large Infrastructure and
                      through the PNDR.

                 The World Bank
                    o The World Bank has invested in rural communities’ water and sanitation systems
                      through the Social Inclusion Project, via in the Romanian Social Development Fund
                      (RSDF). The RSDF has financed roads primarily, but also 15 water supply projects
                      (worth a total of USD 1.64 million) and 6 sanitation projects (worth a total of USD
Supranational         719,000).
                    o Also, the Romania Integrated Nutrient Pollution Control Project has invested in 70
                      other localities, across the whole country, although it has only financed was tewater
                      projects only in a handful of localities.

                 Other International Financial Institutions
                    o Only in 2012, the EBRD signed projects in six Romanian counties, totaling close to
                      EUR 70 million.
                    o Similarly, the EIB has supported projects in the Cluj and Săla j Counties, with the
                      explicit aim of helping Romania achieve the targets set through the acquis
                      communautaire. The EIB has taken on a broad mandate in supporting investments in
                      the entire water cycle, from water resources and supply, to wastewater collecti on,
                      treatment and disposal, coastal erosion, and flood control and protection.
                    o Last not but least, the Development Bank of the Council of Europe has also financed
                      similar interventions, covering the rehabilitation of water and sewage systems in 17
                      communities across Romania in 2009

                 Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (MECC)
                   o The MECC oversees the water and sanitation sector from the perspective of
                      environmental regulation, and is responsible for elaborating national policies in the
                      environmental sector, including specific regulations and necessary measures for
                      implementing the National Sustainable Development Strategy.
                   o The Ministry supervises directly several key players in the sector (e.g., the National
National              Administration Romanian Waters) and has served as the Managing Authority for the
                      Operational Programme Environment 2007-2013. In 2015, this role is fulfilled by the
                      Ministry of European Funds.


                 The National Administration Romanian Waters
                    o The Administration is the water management body in Romania, designed to protect



                                                                                                      80
Level         Key Players

                    and promote the sustainable use of water resources .
                  o It is the only authorized operator of water resources, both surface and underground
                    waters, and of related infrastructure (such as dams, channels , etc.).

               Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA)
                 o An important player in financing investments in the water and wastewater
                    infrastructure, the MRDPA is the central authority responsible for coordinating,
                    monitoring, and planning of the public utility servi ces, as it develops relevant
                    national strategies, approves and coordinates allocation of government resources,
                    and evaluates performance indicators.
                 o The MRDPA is in charge with the coordination of infrastructure investment
                    programs in the sector, regardless of the source of financing.
                 o The Ministry’s main infrastructure development program is the National Local
                    Development Program, which has taken over previous investments in water and
                    wastewater investments in rural areas.

               The National Authority for Regulating Public Utility Community Services (ANRSC)
                  o The Authority is subordinated to the MRDPA and is responsible for the proper
                    delivery of public services, including water and sanitation.
                  o The ANRSC proposes the framework for setting tariffs and fees related to public
                    services delivery, grants licenses to operators, develops methodologies and
                    performance indicators, and monitors the delivery of public utility services.

               Intercommunity Development Associations (IDAs)
                  o IDAs are non-profit organizations that bring together local authorities interested in
                    delivering services jointly and/or seeking to undertake common investment projects.
                  o IDAs on water & sanitation have specific purposes including establishing, financing,
                    exploiting, and managing jointly the water and wastewater services for members
                    and completing public investment projects.
                  o IDAs are the legal owners of Regional Operators ( see below).

               Regional Operators (ROs)
                  o ROs are commercial entities comprising several shareholders (public authorities at
                    the city/commune/county level) established as a part of the “regionalization
                    process,” with the aim of creating more powerful and accountable entities that can
Subnational         design and implement investment projects and also deliver better services.
                  o There are 42 regional water operators in Romania, covering 90% of the country.
                    Most ROs serve the territory of a single county, but there are exceptions to this rule.
                    Most localities have ceded the operation of their water and wastewater systems to
                    the ROs.
                  o ROs charge single tariffs over the entire area they serve (the same tariff applies to
                    urban and rural communities).

               County Councils
                  o County councils can play a critical role at the county level, not just as shareholders of
                    the ROs and members of the IDAs, but also as key decision-makers and funders of
                    hard infrastructure investments.
                  o Under the PNDL, they help prioritize proposals from the local level and send them to


                                                                                                     81
Level           Key Players

                        the MDRPA, monitor the approved PNDL projects, and even co-finance (whenever
                        they choose to do so) water/sanitation projects for communes.

                   De-concentrated institutions
                      o De-concentrated institutions are regional/county-level branches of national bodies
                        (e.g., the County Environment Protection Agencies).
                      o These regional entities subordinated to the central government are responsible for
                        the coordination, development and monitoring of regional action plans for
                        environmental protection, and some of them act as Intermediate Bodies for the EU-
                        funded programs (e.g., the Regional Environment Protection Agency for the OP
                        Environment OP).

                   Local authorities
                      o Their main responsibilities is to deliver public services to citizens in their respective
                        communities, act as beneficiaries of investments, apply for public or EU funds, and
                        implement and manage the projects.
                      o Most local authorities cede operation and maintenance (along with corresponding
                        revenues) to the ROs, but by law they maintain ownership over the utility networks.



Legal Framework

Level           Legal Framework

                   The Drinking Water Directive
                      o The Drinking Water Directive (98/83/EEC) aims “to protect human health from
                        adverse effects of any contamination of water intended for human consumption by
                        ensuring that it is wholesome and clean”.
                      o Member states must monitor at least 48 parameters for distribution systems that
                        serve more than 50 people or supply more than 10 cubic meters per day, as well as
                        for all water supplied as part of an economic activity.
                      o In the case of Romania, as noted in the country’s EU Accession Treaty, the
                        derogations for achieving the Directive’s targets are as follows:
                                   Agglomerations with less than 10,000 inhabitants

                                                                                                         82
Level   Legal Framework


         The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive
            o The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC) seeks to “protect the
              environment from urban wastewater discharges and discharges from certain
              industrial sectors.”
            o It requires collection and treatment of wastewater in all agglomerations over 2,000
              population equivalent (p.e.), secondary treatment of all discharges from
              agglomerations of over 2,000 p.e., and more advanced treatment for those over
              10,000 p.e. in sensitive areas and their catchments.
            o Romania has the second-highest investment needs in urban water treatment
              systems, only surpassed by Poland, which covers, nonetheless, a larger area. The
              total sum needed to fully implement the directive in Romania exceeds EUR 10
              billion.
            o Article 3: All agglomerations over 2,000 p.e. provided with collecting systems for
              urban wastewater
                          By December 31, 2013: compliance for all agglomerations larger
                              than 10,000 p.e.
                          Min. overall population equivalent rates: By December 31, 2010:
                              61%; By December 31, 2013: 69%; By December 31, 2015: 80%
            o Article 4 & Article 5(2):
                         All agglomerations over 2,000 p.e. provided with secondary treatment
                            before discharge of urban wastewater entering collecting systems.
                         All agglomerations of more than 10,000 p.e. provided with stringent
                            (tertiary) treatment of urban wastewater entering collecting systems
                            before discharge into sensitive areas.
                         Min. overall population equivalent rates: By December 31, 2010: 51%;
                            By December 31, 2013: 61%; By December 31, 2015: 77%
            o As of 2011, only 57% of Romanian households were connected to public water
              supply and only 42% were connected to wastewater treatment plants (lowest and
              second-lowest figures, respectively, among all Member States). This means that
              Romania has already failed on reaching the intermediate target of 61% connection
              rate for urban wastewater treatment by the end of 2010 and it is bound to miss
              2018 targets too

         The Water Framework Directive
            o The Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) establishes an integrated framework
              “for the protection of inland surface waters, transitional waters, coastal waters, and
              groundwater .” It seeks to achieve good ecological status for all water bodies in the
              EU. The specific aims of the Directive are multi -fold: to prevent further
              deterioration; to promote sustainable water use; to progressively reduce discharges
              as well as the pollution of ground water; and to mitigate effects of floods and
              droughts.
            o Member states are required to identify individual river basins (article 3) and assign
              them to districts and corresponding competent authorities for the management of
              such districts. Member states also need to present for each river basin a programme
              of measures and a river basin management plan.
            o Romania must reach good state for 60% of the surface waters, groundwater, and


                                                                                            83
Level         Legal Framework

                    protected areas by December 2015, with a possible derogation until 2017.
               Transposition of the EU directives into the Romanian legislation
                  o Romania had adopted the EU provisions with regard to the EU main legislation
                    under Law 458/2005 on the quality of the drinking water and Government Decision
                    188/2002 (corresponding to Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive 91/271/EEC).

               Legal provisions on functioning of the water and sanitation sector
                  o Law 215/2001 on Public Administration mandates local public authorities to manage
                    the provision of public services to residents, including public utility community
                    services, such as water supply.
                  o Law 51/2006 for community services of public utility defines how such services
                    operate, including with regard to operators, users, financing.

               Law 241 on water and wastewater services
                  o It lays out a comprehensive framework for the establishment, functioning,
                    monitoring, and control of the water sector.
                  o Main aspects: principles of service provision, performance indicators, investment
                    programs, management and operations of the systems to responsibilities of
                    operators and of local authorities, users’ rights and obligations, and financing.
                  o On investments specifically: Deliberative bodies at the local level (i.e., Local Councils)
                    approve investment strategies and programs, in accordance with “local urban and
National
                    territorial development plans, development programs of the respective territorial
                    administrative unit, and international commitments in the area of environmental
                    protection.”
                  o On management of operations: There are two options available to local public
                    authorities: direct (self) or delegated management. The choice is based on a detailed
                    study and public consultations that take into account l ocal needs, size and
                    characteristics of localities, the status of existing water and sanitation systems, local
                    capacity to finance the operation and expansion of the infrastructure.

               Order 65/2007 of the President of the ANRSC describing the tariffs for water and
                sanitation services
                  o Sets the tariffs in pursuit of three main objectives: financial viability of operator, user
                    rights (including affordability), and environmental protection.

               Legal provisions corresponding to the infrastructure works on water ne twork
                  o These provisions comprise a number of legal regulations including Law 107/1996 on
                    Water, Government Decision 352/2005 regarding wastewater discharges, and
                    Government Decision 974/2004 regarding supervision, inspection, and monitoring of
                    water quality.

               Local authorities implement the national legislation through the local council decisions.
               Local authorities cannot deviate from the provisions set by the central level, though they
                do have some leeway in how they apply them. To cite an earl ier example, they could
Subnational     chose to run their own operator, without delegating this service to an IDA-contracted
                company. They can also influence level of tariffs and are responsible for major local
                capital investments.



                                                                                                      84
3.2.2 Strategies and Plans

Level           Strategies and Plans

                     o Compared to other sectors where synergies between Member States are critical
                       (e.g., connective infrastructure), there is less need for the EU to have an active role
                       in shaping and coordinating Member States ’ investments in water and sanitation
                       infrastructure. As such, there is no grand strategy at the EU level to cover this sector.
                       The Europe 2020 Strategy does not include a specific focus on water and sanitation
Supranational
                       among its key priorities and main targets.
(EU)
                     o The only flagship initiative that refers to this sector is “Resource-Efficient Europe,”
                       though this deals more with water quality and less with actual infrastructure
                       projects.

                 The Romania – EU Partnership Agreement 2014-2020
                    o The document notes that gaps in water and wastewater infrastructure are one of
                      the main challenges to Romania’s growth. The water and wastewater infrastructure
                      is discussed under the Thematic Objective 6 on preserving and protecting the
                      environment and promoting resource efficiency.
                    o The full implementation of the Water Framework Directive requires an additional
                      €4.236 billion for improving drinking water quality and €8.378 billion for wastewater
                      collection and treatment
                    o According to the agreement, prioritization of investments will be done based on
                      updated versions of Regional Master Plans in the water sector, while financing gaps
                      should be filled by national budget funds “[following] the same procedures,
                      indicators, and rules applied in the frame of European Structural and Investment
                      Funds.”

                 The National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS) 2013-2020-2030
                    o The NSDS is Romania’s main strategic document in the environment sector.
                    o The strategy outlines the national goals to “reduce the gap compared to other EU
National              Member States with respect to environment-related infrastructure, in terms of both
                      quantity and quality, by developing efficient public services”.
                    o The document explicitly correlates with EU policies and draws from EU-level
                      directives and targets, although it does not prioritize investments nor suggests
                      specific funding streams.

                 The Governing Program 2013-2016
                    o Investments in water and sanitation infrastructure needs are one of the priorities in
                      the short and medium run.
                    o The focus should stay on finalizing the investment projects for water supply, sewage,
                      and water treatment plants, thus improving people’s quality of life.
                    o The program also emphasizes the need to finish infrastructure projects that have
                      been started in the past, based on clear priorities and consultations with
                      beneficiaries.
                    o Previewing the National Program for Local Development, the program is calling for
                      “financing a minimum package of required public investments [in rural areas],”
                      which would include water and sanitation systems.



                                                                                                       85
Level         Strategies and Plans

               The National Territorial Development Strategy (SDTR) 2035 (draft )
                  o The strategy calls for critical investments to be made with regard to the delivery of
                    basic public services to enable similar living standards all across Romania, and for
                    prioritization of investments in the networks’ expansio n around main cities.
                  o Cities have a polarizing effect: peri -urban areas around București, Timișoara, Cluj,
                    Constanța, and Sibiu enjoy markedly better access to water and sanitation services
                    compared to areas that are more distant from urban centers. This suggests that new
                    investments around the main cities should be prioritized.
                  o Investment projects should take into account operations and maintenance costs,
                    especially regarding wastewater systems in rural areas.
                  o Investments in water and sanitation should be done both in urban and rural areas in
                    order to make them equally attractive, thus setting ambitious targets. The SDTR
                    proposes ambitious targets to be reached in the next 7 years: 100% of residents in
                    urban areas and 70% of residents in rural areas connected to water supply systems;
                    75% of all residents connect to sanitation systems.

               Regional Development Plans (RDPs)
                  o The RDPs present lists of potential investments in the water and sanitation sector for
                    each county, including estimated total budgets.
                  o The Plans also feature some indicative targets to be reached by the end of the 2014-
                    2020 programming period with regard to water connections and sanitation systems.
                  o What such documents usually lack is a correlation of project lists and available
                    budgets from various sources, and they typically focus only on EU-funded
                    instruments, with no or few references to state-budget funds.

               River Basin Management Plans
                  o The River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) are documents prepared at the level of
                    each river basin, with the aim of “balanced management and protection of water
                    resources in order to reach the proper status for both surface and underground
                    waters.” These are part of Romania’s EU Member State requirements.
                  o The territory of Romania is part of the wider Danube River Basin Management Plan
                    that includes 11 sub-plans. The National River Basin Management Plan (NRBMP)
Subnational
                    includes a synthesis of these 11 sub-plans, covering a wide range of topics, like
                    surface and underground water and lists of priority measures/actions.
                  o The NRBMP is useful for the prioritization of investments in urban wastewater
                    treatment that should take into account the current water quality status of different
                    water bodies and the main pressures identified through each NRBMP.
                  o The NRBMP also provides list of measures/investments needed to abide by EU and
                    national legislation.
                  o The national and subnational NRBMPs make direct references to Master Plans for
                    water and wastewater infrastructure investments.

               Regional Master Plans for Water and Waste Water
                  o Regional Master Plans (MPs) are the most important documents for determining
                    investment priorities in the water and sanitation sector at the county and local level
                    financed, at least for projects financed by EU structural funds. The aim of the MPs is
                    to propose an integrated long-term development strategy for water and wastewater
                    infrastructure, in a defined area covered by a Regional Operator, including cost



                                                                                                  86
Level   Strategies and Plans

               estimates for investments required as part of Romania’s EU commitments. In
               essence, each MP puts forth a list of priority investments, selected based on clear
               criteria and prioritized for different periods of time (e.g., through 2015, 2016-2018,
               and after 2018).
             o Each area covered by a Regional Operator has developed a MP for the Extension and
               Rehabilitation of Water and Wastewater Infrastructure. The MPs for 2014-2020 are
               in the process of getting updated (as of February 2015).
             o As far as selection and prioritization criteria go, MPs generally give precedence to
               projects that can be completed within specific timelines (e.g., by 2015 or 2018),
               which fit Romania’s broader EU acquis commitments. Beyond that, each MP includes
               a specific set of criteria, without a fully standardized approach. Some MPs leave
               these criteria at a broad level, merely indicating that they include institutional,
               technical, and impact indicators, while others present detailed scoring grids (e.g.,
               Brăila, Constanța, Ialomița, Ilfov, etc.). See Annex A for a detailed example of a
               scoring grid.
             o Another key element is the definition of areas and clusters by each MP, ensuring
               that water and sanitation services respectively can be delivered efficiently, at the
               lowest possible operational costs. For example, each MP considers some of these
               criteria in defining agglomerations: distance between a particular locality and
               existing networks; characteristics of the terrain and maximum levels of underground
               waters; risks of flooding; distance to major access roads/networks and other
               localities; the required and maximum capacity of treatment plants; other criteria
               (e.g., cost and availability of the land, feasibility of centralized vs. decentralized
               treatment, demographic projections, population density, etc.).

         Local-Level General Urban Plans & Development Strategies
            o Both types of documents often make references to planned water and sanitation
              infrastructure investments.
            o There are two main challenges with such documents. First, they do not typically
              include financing sources and available budgets. As such, they remain wish lists with
              desirable projects, without any connection to a locality’s actual resources for
              bringing these from the concept phase through project design and implementation.
              Second, sometimes such documents fail to correlate with other key documents in
              the sector, especially the regional master plans for water and wastewater. This can
              create overlaps and inefficiencies, leading to the financing of projects that are not
              among the agreed priorities.

         Local-Level Strategies for Development of Public Services
            o GD 246/2006 approved the National Strategy for Accelerating the Development of
              Public Services, including a corresponding multi -annual implementation plan.
            o Subsequently, such documents were developed at all levels, without a full
              understanding of the purpose they would serve. Some local authorities have
              invested real time and effort into such strategies, while others have not. The value
              add of these strategies and their correlation with higher-level documents remain
              questionable.




                                                                                            87
3.2.3 Investment Programs
139. There are three main investment programs that currently finance water and sanitation
infrastructure projects. Two of them are EU-funded: SOP Environment 2007-2013 / OP Large
Infrastructure 2014-2020 and the National Rural Development Programme (PNDR) 2007-2013
and 2014-2020. The third key program for financing water and wastewater investments is the
PNDL, which is entirely funded from the state budget and was covered under the previous
chapter. The current sub-section focuses on the strategic directions of these instruments (i.e.,
the thinking behind them).


The Large Infrastructure Operational Programme (LIOP) 2014-202052
140. Priority Axis 3 of the LIOP focuses on water and sanitation infrastructure under the
development of environment infrastructure necessary for an efficient management of
resources . Under this axis, Romania will receive over EUR 2.5 billion for projects on water and
wastewater in order to meet the EU acquis as to increase access of people to water supply and
enhance the level of wastewater collection and treatment. To this end, investments under the
2014-2020 programming period should enable Romania to provide wastewater collection and
treatment services to agglomerations larger than 2,000 people equivalent (p.e.) and drinking
water to localities over 50 people . Main eligible investments cover development and
rehabilitation of sewage networks for agglomerations larger than 2,000 p.e. (with priority to
those over 10,000 p.e.), rehabilitation and construction of wastewater treatment plants,
expanding on the existing water networks, and development of centralized water systems in
urban and rural localities.

141. Priority under LIOP should be given to proposals that made it to the lists of projects
included in the updated Regional Water and Wastewater Master Plans. Beneficiaries of the
LIOP funds are the Local Development Associations through the Regional Operators (ROs). In
order to meet the EU targets with regard to localities between 2,000 and 10,000 inhabitants in
rural areas, the investments through the LIOP will be complemented with EU money through
the National Rural Development Program (PNDR).

The Sectoral Operational Programme (SOP) Environment 2007-2013
142. The overall objective of SOP Environment 2007-2013 is to protect and improve the
quality of the environment and the standards of living in Romania, in pursuit of full
compliance with the environment acquis. 53 The total budget of the programme is €5.3 billion,
which Romania needs to spend by the end of 2015. Under the programme’s six specific
objectives, the first one listed targets the improvement of water and wastewater infrastructure
in most urban areas by 2015 and the establishment of regional structures for the management
of water/sanitation services. Accordingly, the programme was implemented based on six
priority axes and Axis 1 is for projects related to the expansion and modernization of water and
sanitation systems. More specifically, there are six sub-objectives under Axis 1: ensuring water
and wastewater services, at reasonable tariffs; ensuring adequate quality of drinking water;
improving quality of water streams; improving sludge management; and the creation of


52   This is based on version 1.0 of the draft programmatic document
53
     See “SOP Environment 2007 -2013” (Romanian version), p. 6


                                                                                             88
innovative and efficient water management structures (i.e., through the “regionalization” of
water services and the formation/consolidation of new Regional Operators).

143. Axis 1 is fully financed from the Cohesion Fund, at a total budget of €3.1 5 billion, of
which the EU contributes 88.16% of the funds. This is by far the largest axis under SOP
Environment, with nearly 60% of the total allocation, which is justified in the programmatic
document by referencing Romania’s significant financing needs in the water and wastewater
sector, along with the country’s clear commitments set in the EU Accession Agreement.
Figure 24. SOP Environment allocations of funds across regions




                      Data Source: Managing Authority of SOP Environment

144. The allocations vary by region, as the first map above shows, with comparatively
higher sums allocated for projects in the northeast and west of the country, along with some
of the larger areas like Constanța/Ialomița and Cluj -Sălaj. The allocation is not always
consistent with the total funding need (shown in the map below), though this does not
necessarily reflect an inadequate prioritization of investments. For instance, it may be that
certain counties have more needs concentrated in smaller towns and communes, which were
not prioritized for the 2007-2013 programming period. As the SOP Environment specifically
notes, it makes sense to first complete larger projects, for two main reasons: (1) to make
progress toward reaching targets set through the water and wastewater EU directives; and (2)
to address the urgent development needs of large communities, based on a long-term strategy.
SOP Environment further encouraged local authorities to join forces and enable economies of
scale in the delivery of public services by conditioning grants on the formation of
Intercommunity Development Associations (IDAs) and on the delegation of the management of
services to Regional Operators (ROs).

145. Even so, the aggregate numbers tell a nuanced story: there is still a sig nificant funding
gap in the water and wastewater sector. The next figure below highlights the fact that SOP


                                                                                            89
Environment 2007-2013 was only able to cover a relatively small proportion of total needs (per
the county-level Master Plans). The situation is particularly worrisome in counties like Suceava,
Mureș, Argeș, Teleorman, and Giurgiu, where the EU -funded instrument was only able to cover
up to 15% of the total investment needs. The gap remains to be financed from other sources
(e.g., PNDR, PNDL, etc.).

sanitation sector

The National Rural Development Programme (PNDR) 2014-202054
146. The PNDR shall invest in proposals targeting water supply and wastewater networks
for localities between 2,000 and 10,000 p.e. Priority will be given to proposals complementing
investments funded through the Large Infrastructure Operational Programme (LOIP). Money can
also be available to projects in localities below 2,000 p.e. only after Romania had met the EU
requirements in the water sector . Beneficiaries of both road and water infrastructure
interventions can be communes – on their own or in partnership through Intercommunity
Development Associations (IDAs). Eligible water proposals must be included in the updated
Water and Wastewater Master Plans. Interventions in water and sanitation infrastructure will
support the upgrading of drinking water quality in rural areas, as well as the reduction of
pollution triggered by the bio-degradable organic loads from rural communities.

The National Rural Development Programme (PNDR) 2007-2013
147. The PNDR targets rural areas across Romania and includes financing for the provision
of basic infrastructure – including in the water and sanitation sector. The programmatic


54
     This is based on the July 2014 version of the programme


                                                                                              90
document points to the pressing need to invest in such services in rural areas; for example, in
2004, only 33% and 10% of residents in rural areas had access to water supply and sanitation
systems, respectively. 55 The PNDR included Axis 3 for “improving quality of life in rural areas and
the diversification of rural economy,” with sub-axis (“priority measure”) 322 focusing specifically
on the development of villages and improvement of basic public services. The programmatic
document lists all eligible interventions (e.g., development of water supply and sanitation
systems, etc.), along with clear eligibility criteria. Interestingly, one criterion refers to the need
for local authorities (project beneficiaries) to present the list of signatures of residents from the
community, expressing their commitment to connect to the new networks upon completion of
the investments. 56 In terms of quantitative indicators, the PNDR 2007-2013 sought to develop
6,317 kilometers of water supply pipes (4,738km of new works and 1,579km of
expansion/modernization works) and 5,053 kilometers of sewage pipes (4,043km of new works
and 1,011km of expansion/modernization works). 57

148. In terms of budgets, the PNDR totals €10 billion for the 2007 -2013 programming
period, with an average co-financing rate (across axes) of 80.5%. For priority measure 322, the
total funding available has been €1.72 billion, roughly 17% of the PNDR budget. The two maps
below confirm that: (a) the value of PNDR investments in water and wastewater is typically
small, with most counties receiving a total of under €15 million; and (b) the % contribution of
PNDR to fulfilling the total investment needs is relatively minor, with the vast majority of
counties financing under 5% of their total needs through this instrument, between 2007-2013.

149. In addition, PNDR Axis 4 (LEADER) financed some smaller local development projects,
with a maximum public co-financing of EUR 200,000. The LEADER approach seeks to empower
communities to set their own priorities using bottom-up mechanisms. Local Action Groups
(LAGs) were established across Romania for this precise purpose, with each LAG appointing a
Project Selection Committee, including its own selection framework – i.e., LAGs are not required
to take onboard the criteria defined for the axis, but can set their own mechanisms for deciding
on projects that would receive financing. Due to the cap on the maximum investment and
possibly because of individual preferences at the level of each community, few water and
sanitation projects received financing under the PNDR’s LEADER axis, including a water project
in Buzău County and a sanitation project in Sibiu County. More localities chose to spend the
funds on roads (e.g., in Alba, Dâmbovița, Galați, Maramureș, Vrancea, etc.) and other types of
projects (e.g., cultural, sports-oriented, etc.).


The Regional Operational Programme (ROP) 2007-2013
150. In addition to the EU-funded instruments reviewed above, the ROP 2007-2013 also
financed water and wastewater works under Axis 1 for the sustainable development of
Romanian cities. This axis was not specifically dedicated to water/sanitation investments, but it
financed a list of priority projects, as decided by local authorities in their Integrated Urban
Development Plan (IUDP). In other words, some cities could rehabilitate certain streets and also
replace the water supply and sewage networks (e.g., the municipalities of Bacău and Onești in
the NE Region), while others focused on a completely different set of projects, depending on the
respective needs at the level of local communities. Because of such variation on a case by case
basis and because there are no centralized data on this issue, it is particularly challenging to


                                                                                                   92
estimate how much funds went toward ROP-funded water and sanitation investments. For the
purposes of the current report, however, it suffices to note that only localities with more than
10,000 residents were eligible to receive ROP 2007-2013 funding under Axis 1, which somewhat
limits – implicitly – overlaps with other MRDPA-managed instruments like the PNDL (focused on
rural areas primarily).


State-Budget-Funded Programs
151. The Environment Fund collects revenues from a range of related taxes (e.g., the
“environment tax”) and has its own investment pipeline. The EF was established through GEO
196/2005 and is managed by an Authority, under the coordination of the Ministry of
Environment and Climate Change. In practice, the MRDPA currently supervises EF investments,
which can also help coordinate PNDL and EF interventions going forward. According to Article 1
of GEO 196/2005, the EF aims to support environmental protection projects and is entirely self-
financed from various taxes, including on hazardous substances and other goods (oil and related
products, alcohol, wood, etc.). The same ordinance defines the list of potential eligible project
categories, including “the protection of water resources and water and wastewater treatment
plants for local communities.” 58 The EF implements a number of investment programs, such as
on awareness raising for environmental protection, support for renewable sources, modern
heating systems, improvements in the quality of the environment (e.g., through green areas),
subsidies for the purchase of newer vehicles, and the program for the protection of water
sources, integrated water supply systems, treatment plants, and sewage.

152. At the end of 2013, the EF had 179 ongoing water and sanitation projects worth nearly
RON 1 billion (as total contracted value), of which only RON 126 million had been expensed
that year. 59 This was by far the largest category of projects in the Fund’s 2013 budget – both as
a share of the total contracted value (65%) and as a share of expensed funds (48%). Some of the
projects started under the EF have been submitted for financing under the SOP Environment, to
be financed from the savings done on the ongoing SOP projects. The Applicant Guide for the EF
details a number of other useful facts:
     The total maximum financing for a project is up to 95% of eligible costs;
     The sum dedicated to a project can range between RON 4 million and RON 15 million,
         depending on the type of project (e.g., extension vs. new development, etc.) and
         depending on the size of the respective community (i.e., under 3.000 residents, 3.000-
         10.000, 10.000-20.000, and above 20.000);
     There is a detailed scoring grid and there are corresponding criteria, including the
         following main categories: the cost benefit analysis, the feasibi lity study, the project’s
         relevance, project type, level of financing for other similar projects, size of locality, own
         contribution to project costs (5-25%, with more points for a higher level of co-financing).
     Each criterion has a number of maximum possible points. If two projects earn the exact
         same number of points, then the selection criterion is first-in-first-out (FIFO).
     After each evaluation round, the list of approved projects is published on the EF
         Authority’s website, including the score obtained by each applicant. Importantly, the
         evaluation commission is internal, operating under the EF Authority. 60
     In recent years, it appears that EF investments have been constrained by the lack of
         funding. Field interviews with the Fund’s management have revea led that they have
         addressed such issues by preparing and submitting projects to be financed under OP
         Environment. Going forward, the hope is that the EF will operate on a multi-annual
         budget.

153. Last but not least, as reviewed in the previous chapter, the PNDL finances an
important number of water and sanitation investments. The 2014 allocation of PNDL funds for
such projects varied across counties, as shown in the map below. As in the case of PNDR, the
fact that these are mostly smaller projects, targeted at rural communities, implies that the total
contribution of the PNDL to addressing the total needs of the sector is quite small. The only
outlier may be Gorj County, where at least 30% of the total needs were covered through PNDL-
financed investments in 2014.

3.3 Social Infrastructure
154. Social infrastructure is crucial for addressing people’s needs for health care,
education, cultural, and youth/sporting activities. Therefore, governments should invest in
social infrastructure facilities to enable people’s access to proper schools, hospitals, cultural
centers, sport facilities, etc. This is important not only as a basic right to a decent living, but also
as a way of boosting individual productivity and, by implication, achieving sustainable and
inclusive growth. As argued in the 2013 World Bank Competitive Cities report, people can
maximize their productive potential if they are healthy, well-educated and trained for fulfilling
labor market demands. At the same time, they also benefit from a high quality of life, which
depends on fulfilling more sophisticated needs through cultural activities and leisure.

155. In rural areas in Romania, there are still many communities with poor or no access to
proper social infrastructure. People may sometimes need to travel for long distances to get to
the nearest doctor and receive the medical treatment they need. This is a serious problem
especially for the elderly and low-income, marginalized, and/or vulnerable groups, for whom
traveling to the nearest medical facility and pharmacy can be very challenging. As not all villages
and communes in Romania have their own schools, sometimes students must travel several
kilometers by foot to get the education they need. Getting to school is even more difficult
during the cold season or in areas like the Danube Delta, where accessibility is very low.
Although in recent years the government has made substantial financial efforts to purchase
school buses that transport students from rural areas to the nearest schools, these vehicles
cannot fully cover the transport needs for all.

156. Not all education and healthcare facilities are in good shape and many of these
facilities need rehabilitation or serious consolidation work. Many schools, especially in rural
areas, have not been rehabilitated since they were built during the communist era and,
therefore, may pose serious safety risks. Local governments and the central public ministries
should join efforts to improve the state of social infrastructure to ensure comfortable
environments with all that is required to address people’s needs (e.g., computers for schools,
basic medical equipment, etc.). Last but not least, investments in cultural centers in rural areas
are also needed to provide the community with places where people can enjoy activities at the
local level, without having to travel to far off places.

3.3.1 Sector Structure
157. The social infrastructure sector has a number of players at the supranational, national,
and subnational level. The section below presents the main stakeholders that play a role in
designing and managing social infrastructure investments, along with the main applicable

                        exclusive competencies over: the administration of the public and private domain
                        of the commune or city; the administration of the cultural institutions of local
                        interest; administration of public medical units of local interest; primary social
                        assistance services for the protection of children and for the elderly; and primary
                        and specialized social assistance services for the victims of family violence.
                      o Local public authorities share competencies with the central level in areas related
                        to social infrastructure that require both a national and local approach. These
                        areas include: building social housing and housing for young people; state pre-
                        university education (except for the education of students with special needs);
                        medical and social assistance services for individuals with social problems; and
                        primary social assistance services for persons with disabilities.
                      o As for the authorities at the county level, they also have exclusive competencies

            o The land and facilities of the pre-university education belong to the local public
              domain and are administered by the local councils, whereas those for students
              with special needs and educational assistance county centers are managed by the
              county authorities.
            o With respect to state or private universities, they have their own patrimony, which
              they can freely manage within the limits set by the law.

         Law 95/2006 on the health system reform
            o The law states that public hospitals are entirely financed from their own income
              and operate on the basis of the financial autonomy principle.
            o The income earned by medical units can be invested in infrastructure and medical
              equipment, upon covering their operational expenditures.
            o The funds received by public hospitals managed by local governments from the
              state and local budgets can cover investments for building new hospitals or for
              completing unfinished ones.
            o Local public hospitals may receive funds from the state budget and from the
              Ministry of Health to complete health infrastructure investments.

         Order 512/2014 approving the Methodology for elaborating the public investments
          program of the Ministry of Health and for allocating funds for capital expenditures to
          the MoH units
            o This legal provision establishes specific procedures for developing the Ministry of
              Health’s (MoH) public investments program for allocation of funds for capital
              expenditure toward public units attached to the MoH.
            o The MoH centralizes all investment projects and other capital expenditures that
              fulfill the necessary prerequisites for entering in the investments program. Still,
              the approval of investment projects, notwithstanding thei r value, does not
              automatically ensure the financing of capital expenditures.
            o This approval only represents the condition for them to be integrated in the


                                                                                       100

3.3.2 Strategies and Plans

Level            Strategies and Plans

                   Europe 2020 Strategy
                      o Romania is committed to the main two goals of the strategy with regard to the
                        education sector, namely reducing early school leaving below 10% and at least
                        40% of 30-40 year-olds completing third level education.
                      o Although the document does not include special provisions for social
                        infrastructure, strategic infrastructure investments can help achieve these targets.
Supranational
                   Investing in Health Strategy
                      o According to this document prepared in 2013, investments in the health sector
                        play an important role in achieving the objectives of smart, sustainable, and
                        inclusive growth from the Europe 2020 strategy.
                      o The EU makes the case for efficient spending in health, calling on Member States
                        to invest in programs for people’s health as a wa y of reducing economic and social
                        inequalities and fighting social exclusion.
                   The Governing Program 2013-2016
National
                      o In the education sector, the focus is on the modernization of pre-university



                                                                                                  101
Level   Strategies and Plans

               education infrastructure, whereas in the case of health the focal point should be
               on overhauling and modernizing the existing system (by investing in regional
               hospitals). In the case of cultural heritage, the focus is on a number of key
               objectives, such as the Dacian fortresses in the Orăștie Mountains, or the network
               of ethnographic museums.
             o Each Romanian village should benefit from a minimum package of investments,
               including: health clinic, pharmacy, library, and cultural center.

         The National Territorial Development Strategy (SDTR) 2035 (draft)
            o The strategy discusses the need to provide basic infrastructure to improve the
              quality of life in rural areas.
            o The proposed performance indicators discuss details pertaining to social
              infrastructure.
            o The strategy proposes the identification of rural localities with a polar ization
              potential in regions that lack an urban center with the aim of prioritizing strategic
              investments and improving their connectivity to surrounding areas.

         The Romania-EU Partnership Agreement 2014-2020
            o The document makes a distinct mention of the need to invest in social
              infrastructure, particularly with regard to rural small-scale infrastructure. It is also
              considered that social services and related infrastructure do not meet the needs
              of the population, affecting economic development potential. Moreover, cultural
              infrastructure, which is critical for preserving local identity, is deficient.
            o It also acknowledges that small-scale infrastructure plays a key role in improving
              the quality of life in rural areas and in making them more attractive.

         The National Health Strategy for 2014-2020
            o The strategy’s main goal is to reform the healthcare system in Romania and its
              related infrastructure in order to offer good and efficient healthcare services.
            o The document provides a number of measures aimed at improving health
              infrastructure at the national, regional, and local level. Such measures include
              rationalization and transformation of local healthcare facilities and converting
              them into ambulatory care units, development of community care services,
              rehabilitation and establishment of primary care facilities, and building three new
              regional hospitals.
            o No further details are provided on the prioritization of infras tructure projects in
              the sector, their proposed timeline, or financing sources.

         The Strategy on education and professional training for 2014-2020 (draft)
            o One of the main aspects related to educational infrastructure is the development
              and modernization of pre-university educational facilities in order to diminish
              disparities in the sector and to improve access to education.
            o The document calls for the development of school camps and transport facilities
              for students to improve access to education in poor regions.
            o Eventually, development of education-related infrastructure should help promote
              equal access to quality education, reduce the early dropout phenomena
              (particularly among Roma), improve tertiary education, boost access to quality
              education, and provide life-long training.


                                                                                            102
 Level             Strategies and Plans

                        o No further details are provided on the prioritization of infrastructure projects in
                          the sector, their proposed timeline, or financing sources.

                     The Sectoral Strategy on Culture and Cultural Patrimony for 2014-2020
                        o The strategy outlines a series of measures aimed at extending access to historical
                          monuments and development of integrated management plans for the cultural
                          objectives capable of generating economic development.
                        o Priority should be given to the rehabilitation of the objectives that had made it to
                          the list of cultural patrimony objectives of Classes A and B. By 2020, at least 10%
                          of the historical monuments of national importance (Class A) should be restored.
                        o No further details are provided on the prioritization of such projects, their
                          timeline, or financing sources.

                     Strategy for sports for 2013-2030 (draft)
                        o The strategy emphasizes the need to improve the overall sports infrastructure in
                          Romania.
                        o Among the measures recommended are the rehabilitation of the sports camps
                          that belong to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the development of sports
                          infrastructure for schools, and rehabilitation of the National Sports Complexes. No
                          further details are provided on the prioritization of such projects, their timeline, or
                          financing sources.

                     County Development Strategies
                        o County development strategies include the rehabilitation/development of social
                          infrastructure (e.g., county hospitals, centers for children with special needs, etc.)
                          that the counties are responsible for.

 Subnational         Local Development Strategies
                        o In the case of larger localities, usually local development strategies mention that
                          they can carry out the rehabilitation/modernization/development work of social
                          infrastructure, while smaller localities remain for the most part dependent on
                          transfers from the central government and on national investment programs.




3.3.3 Investment Programs
158. As for the other sectors, structural funds from the European Union are one of the
most important funding sources for investments in social infrastructure in Romania . During
the 2007-2013 programming period, the EU has provided funds to improve and modernize
education, healthcare, and social services facilities in both rural and urban areas, as well as for
works targeting the cultural heritage of the country.




                                                                                                       103
The Regional Operational Programme 2014-202061
159. Priority Axis 8 of the ROP 2014-2020 tackles health and social infrastructure,
benefitting from EUR 425.5 million in EU non-reimbursable financial support. The main priority
of this axis is promotion of investments focusing on national, regional, and local development as
to increase life expectancy through enhancing access to medical and social services and better
the quality of such services provided, thus reducing inequalities regarding health condition. The
ROP is furthering social inclusion through access to a number of social, cultural, and recreational
services, while shifting from institutionalized to community-operated services (in line with
broader international commitments and trends).

160. Investments pertaining to health infrastructure eligible for funding under the ROP
2014-2020 target a number of activities. These include rehabilitation/modernization/
expansion/endowment of community care centers, of ambulatories (including those deriving
from the reorganization or rationalization of small, inefficient hospitals), and of county hospitals
and their Emergency Care Units. In addition, construction and endowment of regional hospitals
will be also eligible for financing. Other projects eligible for EU funds are the
rehabilitation/modernization/expansion /endowment of social service infrastructure such as
daycare centers and ambulatory centers for neurological recovery, in addition to construction/
rehabilitation/modernization of family-type houses, apartments, and protected houses.

161. The investments pertaining to the ambulatory care infrastructure should lead the way
toward the development of a medical center network that should be able to provide primary
care, especially in rural areas. As for regional hospitals, these new medical facilities should be a
stepping stone to the development of a national strategic regional hospital network that should
ultimately take over major cases requiring complex medical intervention and special medical
care. This should be able to ensure uniform coverage of high quality medical services
throughout the country by giving access to people from all regions to high-standard medical
services, focusing mainly on economically deprived areas (such as the North East and South
West regions) and in places with a large number of people are vulnerable to poverty and social
exclusion (like in the North West).

162. Investments in social infrastructure services will stimulate and support the transition
from social services provided under the institutionalized system (residential social centers) to
those provided within the community. The construction of new family houses and other
protected facilities will not only provide better services to people, but should also create a more
friendly environment, in line with the needs of beneficiaries (especially women, children, Roma,
etc.).

163. In addition, Romania will receive under Priority Axis 5EUR 276.59 million for the
conservation, protection, and leveraging of sustainable cultural patrimony. The ROP will
finance objectives belonging to the UNESCO patrimony, national patrimony (regardless of
location, be rural or urban), and cultural patrimony from rural areas. Such investments will
target a number of activities, from restoration, consolidation, protection and conservation of
historical monuments, to restoration, protection, conservation and development of interior
paintings, frescos and of external mural paintings, and plastic restoration and remodeling of

     This is based on the January 2015 draft version of the programmatic document


                                                                                                104
facades. In addition, eligible proposals include endowment with heating or fire prevention
installations and with equipment needed to exhibit and protect the patrimony.

164. The education infrastructure is mainly tackled under Priority Axis 10 on Education
infrastructure with allocated EU funds of EUR 255.32 million. The investments are aimed to
provide education, training, and professional training in order to receive competencies and life
cycle through development of education and training infrastructures, with the main objective of
increasing active participation in the educational system. The main types of investments focus
on the construction/rehabilitation/modernization/expansion/endowment of daycares,
kindergartens, and mandatory education (grades 1 through 8), in addition to professional and
technical/technological high schools. Priority will be given to areas where school enrollment is
below the country average or the dropout rate is higher than the county/national level.
Development and rehabilitation of education infrastructure and endowment of school facilities,
along with proper sanitation conditions, should help contain the early dropout phenomenon.

165. Education infrastructure is also tackled under ROP’s Priority Axis 4 (Support for
Sustainable Urban Development), with an overall funding of EUR 1.17 billion. This includes
similar infrastructure investments as under Axis 10 (see above).


The Regional Operational Programme 2007-2013
166. The ROP 2007-2013 has been a key player for putting into practice the very important
task of improving education and healthcare infrastructure. Under Priority Axis 3 –
Improvement of social infrastructure, the ROP was designed to positively influence the quality of
the health, educational, social, and public safety for emergency situation services provided to
the population. This axis intended to set the ground for better access to essential services by
contributing to the achievement of the EU objectives with regard to economic and social
cohesion. Essentially, the ROP’s main goal was to address the poor and underdeveloped social
infrastructure in Romania, and provide support for facilitating better access for people living in
rural and urban areas to health care and social services.

167. The money allocated under this priority axis amounted to EUR 657.5 million, of which
EUR 558.9 was provided from the European Regional Development Fund, while the rest was
co-financed from national resources. The money was directed to investments aimed at
improving the quality of social infrastructure related services and upgrading them to European
standards, with the final outcome of bettering the health of the population, its education and
qualification level, as well as its participation to the labor market. The axis is structured on four
components, namely education, health services, social services, and infrastructure for
emergency situations. The analysis below focuses on the first three components.

168. The ROP targeted educational facilities under key intervention area 3.4
“Rehabilitation, modernization, development , and equipping of pre-university, university
education, and continuous vocational training infrastructure.” The aim has been to increase
the educational capacity in rural and urban areas as to create a direct link to the labor market
and respond to actual needs and fulfill some of the objectives outlined in Law 84/1995 on




                                                                                                 105
education (i.e., on improving and strengthening the education process throughout the country
by supporting investments in the physical endowment of schools).

169. The poor state of schools has required major investments in buildings and school
furniture. In the mid-2000s, only 28% of schools in rural areas were in adequate condition. 62
Overall, more than two-thirds of the primary education units in Romania needed rehabilitation
work, with the highest demand in the North-East region (over 90%) and the lowest in the
Bucharest - Ilfov area (“only” 33%). In 2004, according to the Ministry of Education, of the total
14,841 schools in the country, 11,137 education units needed rehabilitation work. At that time,
analyses indicated that half of the schools in Romania did not have the necessary furniture and
laboratory equipment. The situation was even worse in the rural areas, where education
infrastructure was far below standards, affecting the quality of education and the health
conditions of students and teachers.

170. In this context, EU funds came in at the right time to address these issues and
strengthen the primary education infrastructure in the country . The project selection process
under the ROP gave priority to proposals that were in line with the general objective of
enhancing the quality of education and development of human capital by reducing dropout
rates among marginalized communities (such as Roma, students in rural areas, and students
with special needs), as well as by integrating activities pertaining to the educational process
(e.g., teaching, practice, social activities, leisure, etc.). To this end, eligible projects could include
rehabilitation, modernization, and equipping educational infrastructure from pre-university and
university education, development of pre-university campuses, and rehabilitation,
modernization, and equipping of centers for continuous professional training.

171. EU funds also targeted the development of campuses for technical and professional
education, concentrating in one place all buildings needed to carry out the educ ational
process. Other proposals to be considered were related to modernization, expansion, and
consolidation of buildings for compulsory education and special schools, construction/
modernization/expansion of technical and professional education campus buildings,
endowment with teaching equipment, modernization/expansion of buildings from pre-
university education campuses (teaching facilities, dorms, etc.), as well as Continuous
Professional Training Centers.

172. Romania received EUR 284.9 million for education infrastructure projects. Of this, EUR
242.1 million came from the EU, while the rest was a contribution from the local and national
budget. Such projects financed by the ROP could be of minimum RON 500,000 and maximum
RON 67 million. As of May 2014, a number of 248 educational infrastructure projects were
completed, with an overall value of RON 1.9 billion (equivalent of EUR 452.2 million), which
would make for an average value of EUR 1.8 million per project. The beneficiaries were local
public authorities (city halls, county councils) from rural and urban areas.

173. Most local authorities have implemented projects amounting up to RON 25 million per
county, including some smaller schools in rural localities. More than one third of the counties
developed projects with an overall amount ranging from RON 25 million to RON 50 million per
county. Only four municipalities - Arad, Iași, București, and Dâmbovița - managed to implement
projects whose total value exceeded RON 50 million. Dolj is the only county in Romania where
the overall value of projects exceeded RON 100 million, with most of the funds concentrated in
the county capital of Craiova.

174. The ROP has also helped tackle the need for new pre-university school campuses, and
such facilities were developed to provide access to students, especially for those living in rural
areas, to education and training. Ten pre-university campuses have been financed, in addition
to four university campuses. Other projects targeted the rehabilitation and modernization of
schools in rural and urban areas, such as the education facility in Sotonga, Dâmbovița County
(RON 6.2 million), the schools in Valea Popii and Drăghici villages belonging to Mihăiești
commune in Argeș County (RON 3.7 million), and the rehabilitation and equipping of the Unirea
National College in Focșani, Vrancea County (RON 6.2 million). Other projects targeted the



                                                                                              107
thermal rehabilitation of school buildings, as in the case of School 19 in Pitesti, Argeş County
(RON 19.7 million) and the Mihai Eminescu School in Zalău, Sălaj County (RON 4.3 million).

175. The same Priority Axis 3 of the ROP also finances social services facilities. The Area of
Intervention 3.2 “Rehabilitation/modernization/development and endowment of social services
infrastructure” was designed to address the poor social services in Romania, with the primary
objective to improve the system throughout the country and set up minimum quality standards
for the residential social centers.

176. The social services infrastructure in the country is poor and in many regions it remains
underdeveloped. There are areas with no social services centers or, if facilities do exist, they are
usually ill-equipped. Often times, potential beneficiaries, especially those belonging to
disadvantaged groups, must travel for long distances to find a center. Social services
infrastructure in Romania requires significant rehabilitation and modernization work, in addition
to endowment of buildings where such services are delivered. The 2004 National Strategy for
Social Services set the ground to better satisfy the needs of disadvantaged groups by bringing in
the local level as the main actor to sort out the problems of vulnerable social groups in each
community. In order to achieve a better inclusion of the disadvantaged groups, the strategy
called for investments in hard infrastructure (buildings).

177. In particular, the ROP supports the development of multifunctional social centers that
cover a wide span of services for people in difficulty, helping solve their specific problems
(material, financial, cultural, legal, medical, etc.) temporarily or permanently. In addition, the
ROP has continued investments in existing residential centers that could be used as long-term
housing. The projects funded through the ROP have sought to develop the social services
infrastructure and related endowment for new leisure, education, social
integration/reintegration.

178. According to the applicant’s guide, the overall value of projects funded under this area
of intervention is EUR 99,506,701, of which EUR 84,580,694 comes in the form of structural
funds and EUR 14,926,007 comes from the national and local budgets. The value for each
project can vary between RON 350,000 and RON 3.5 million (between EUR 100,000 and EUR 1
million). Eligible projects include the modernization/expansion of multifunctional social centers,
and the rehabilitation, modernization, and endowment of residential social centers. Other
eligible activities considered under the ROP are the modernization/expansion of social centers
(residential, dining halls, bathrooms, etc.), the modernization/expansion of buildings to develop
new facilities, the modernization of general utilities related to the buildings, the development/
modernization of access areas for people with disabilities, equipping new workshop facilities
within social centers, etc. As of May 204, 209 social services projects were covered under ROP,
with an overall amount of RON 625 million (EUR 142 million). This would make for an average
allocation of EUR 680,000 per project.

179. Most of the counties have implemented projects with an overall amount not
exceeding RON 5 million . There are 10 counties where the total amount of projects is between
RON 10 million and RON 25 million. The largest investments developed under the ROP include
the modernization of the Center for Integration by Occupational Therapy i n Urlați, Prahova



                                                                                                108
County (RON 3.6 million), the Sf. Panciu Residential Center for Elderly in Panciu, Vrancea County
(nearly RON 4 million), the modernization of Casa Soarelui Social Services Center in Târgoviște,
Dâmbovița County (RON 3.8 million), the Soc ial Center for Children Aripi de Lumina in Craiova,
Dolj County (RON 3.6 million), and the rehabilitation and expansion of the “Sfântul Andrei”
Elderly Home Care Center in Alba Iulia (RON 3.9 million). A large number of projects were
implemented in rural areas. Among such projects were the multifunctional social services center
in Popești, Vrancea County (RON 1.2 million), the medical -social services center in Codăești,
Vaslui County (RON 3.7 million), the multifunctional social services center in Jupănești , Gorj
County (RON 1.3 million), and the Center for medical and social assistance in Mogoșești, Giurgiu
County (RON 3.6 million).

180. The ROP 2007-2013 also has allocated important amounts for the rehabilitation/
modernization of health infrastructure. Within Priority Axis 3, the area of intervention 3.1
Rehabilitation, modernization and equipping of the health services’ inf rastructure is seeks to
improve the medical facilities in Romania and provide people with better healthcare services.




                                                                                             109
181. With poor hospital infrastructure and lack of performant equipment in many regions
in the country, access to healthcare facilities is often challenging, as people must travel long
distances to get medical consultation and receive medical care. While the cost of health care
services outside the social insurance system had continuously increased, the quality of medical
service provided under social assistance system had deteriorated. The deterioration of both
hard and soft social infrastructure over the course of time had hindered access of people to
quality health services, and made it even more difficult for those living in rural areas. Besides,
most of the hospital structure in Romania is relatively old, between 50 and 100 years old,
requiring rehabilitation work. The Law for the reform in the health sector was set to tackle some
of these problems.

182. The main objective of the ROP in terms of healthcare infrastructure has been to help
Romania fulfill the main objectives of the national health policies. These are focusing toward
increasing the overall efficiency of the system and medical care in the country by achieving
better quality healthcare assistance along with a balanced territorial distribution of such
services. To this end, the ROP provided support for rehabilitation, modernization and equipping
the county hospitals as well as the outpatient hospitals and ambulatory care facilities.

183. Eligible projects under this area of intervention included a large number of activities .
They ranged from rehabilitation/modernization of county hospitals, rehabilitation/
modernization, development and endowment of ambulatory healthcare facilities and of hospital
and ambulatory buildings, to development and modernization of access areas for people with
disabilities in hospitals and outpatients units, and purchasing of equipment for medical units.
The project selection takes into consideration the fact that new medical services should be
made available to a large number of patients, which subsequently should lead to the reduction
in the number of beneficiaries that often times are redirected to other healthcare units due to
lack of capacity or medical endowment. The applicants should prove how the project should
support reducing the time for checking the patient and getting the right diagnostic and/or
treatment.

184. The minimum value of the project under the area of intervention 3.1 could be of RON
700,000, with a maximum of RON 85,000,000 (between EUR 200,000 and EUR 25 million). 93
projects in rural and urban areas have been implemented under the ROP 2007-2013, including
15 county hospitals in Vaslui, Buzau, Tulcea, Vrancea, Dâmboviţa, Ialomiţa, Teleorman, Gorj,
Vâlcea, Maramureş, Satu Mare, Sălaj, Covasna, Ilfov/ Bucuresti. By May 2014, the total money
spent for healthcare units under ROP amounted to RON 1.4 billion (EUR 319 million), with an
average of EUR 3.4 million per project.

185. Eight counties have developed large projects, between RON 50 million and RON 100
million each. Some of these projects included the rehabilitation, modernization and equipping
of the county hospital in Ilfov County / Bucuresti (nearly RON 88 million), and the rehabilitation
and modernization of the county emergency hospitals in Craiova, Dolj County (RON 83.4
million), Targoviste, Dimbovita County (RON 83.1 million), Ramnicu Valcea, Valcea County (RON
73 million), and Baia Mare, Maramures County (RON 70.6 million).




                                                                                              110
186. ROP was intended not only for large projects, but also for smaller-scale activities.
Among such projects covered by ROP are the modernization of a block from the ambulatory
clinic of the municipal hospital in Oradea (RON 4.4 million), equipping the ambulatory facility of
the lung diseases hospital in Braila (RON 2.9 million), the rehabilitation and modernization of the
hydrotherapy unit within the physical recovery hospital in Cluj-Napoca (RON 5.8 million), and
the modernization and equipping of the ambulatory care unit in Abrud, Alba County (RON 1.9
million).

187. Finally, preserving the cultural patrimony can contribute to the attractiveness of a
region; this was tackled by Priority Axis 5 – Sustainable development and promotion of
tourism. Under the area of intervention 5.1 Restoration and sustainable valorization of cultural
heritage, by setting up and modernizing the related infrastructure, has sought to capitalize the
cultural heritage and natural resources with significant tourism potential as to better the level
and quality of tourist infrastructure, both in terms of leisure and accommodation. This is
expected to boost the attractiveness of regions, which should translate into local development
and jobs.


                                                                                               111
188. During the 2007-2013 programming period, the ROP funds have been channeled to
projects covering the sites belonging to UNESCO, national, cultural, and urban patrimony . The
projects targeted under this area of intervention cover restoration, consolidation, rehabilitation
and protection of monuments and architectural infrastructure that are part of the national and
universal heritage, as well as of representative monuments for the local cultural patrimony in
rural and urban area, in accordance with Law 442/2001 on the protection of historical
monuments.

189. Restoration of the cultural heritage projects has aimed to increase the number of
tourists, extend the tourist season, and turn tourism and culture into stimulating elements for
economic development. Beneficiaries could be local public administration units, central
government bodies, cult institutions, non-profit organizations, territorial-administrative units
partnering with NGOs, etc. The value of the project could vary between RON 1.7 million and
RON 85 million. A number of 93 such projects have been developed under the ROP 2007-2013
with a total value of RON 1.9 billion (EUR 436 million), with an average value of EUR 4.6 million
per project.



                                                                                              112
190. ROP has funded both large and small projects. Some of the largest projects included
the restoration and consolidation of the Patriarchal Palace in Bucharest (RON 84.9 million), the
rehabilitation of the historical center of Câmpulung togeth er with the Krețulescu Park Complex
(RON 64 million), and the restoration and consolidation of the Capidava Fortress Archeological
site in Topalu, Constanta County (RON 74.2 million). Some of the smaller projects comprised the
rehabilitation of exhibiting places at the Olt County Museum in Slatina (RON 4.5 million),
restoration and painting of indoor frescos from the Sfântul Dumitru church in Potlogi,
Dâmboviţa County (RON 1.7 million), and the rehabilitation of the historical building “Casa
Argintarului” and creation of the German Center in Bistrița, Bistrița Năsăud County (RON 2.4
million).


The National Rural Development Programme (PNDR) 2014-202063
191. The investments in education infrastructure cover a wide range of activities aimed at
improving education in rural areas. Education in rural areas is very challenging as many
communities lack the necessary and appropriate infrastructure, especially with regard to ante-
pre-school and pre-school facilities. For example, in 2011 only one percent of the nurseries in
Romania were located in rural areas, and only 7.4% of the kindergartens in 2012 were registered
in rural communities. The interventions funded through the PNDR include development,
modernization, and endowment of schools, kindergartens, nurseries, after-schools, and
expansion of secondary agricultural schools. Leasing or purchasing of school vehicles for
providing transportation of students to schools can be also eligible. The main beneficiaries of
investments in education sector are communes, in addition to non-profit organizations (NGOs)
for projects related to kindergartens and after-schools.

192. The PNDR investments in health infrastructure will support improved access of people
to medical services in rural communities. The number of medical clinics in Romania has
decreased in recent years both in terms of units and human resources, with a negative impact
especially in rural areas. While at the national level the number of clinics diminished by 16%
between 2005 and 2011, in rural communities the percentage is much higher, with almost 39%
over the same period of time. The 2011 figures indicate that there was one doctor providing
medical services to 1,722 patients in rural areas, a number that is almost seven times higher
than in urban communities. Investments under the PNDR will help build and modernize the
healthcare facilities in rural communities. Over the next seven years, the program will provide
funds for the development and upgrading of medical clinics and community care centers in rural
areas. The main beneficiaries of health infrastructure investments will be the local authorities
(communes). Investments in healthcare facilities will enable people to get medical attention in
their communities, and thus will contribute to the improvement of overall living conditions in
rural areas.

193. The sub-measure tackling protection of cultural heritage focuses on local cultural
objectives. Such projects should have a good impact on local tourism and boost local
businesses. Preservation of local heritage and traditions should make rural regions more
attractive to tourists. Eligible investments target restoration and preservation of local cultural
heritage objectives of class B (comprising historical monuments representative for the local

     This is based on the July 2014 version of the programmatic document


                                                                                              113
cultural heritage) and monastic settlements, in addition to improving access to these sites. In the
case of class B objectives, priority is given to interventions in rural localities with tourism
development potential. Beneficiaries of cultural heritage investments can be communes and
their related IDAs, cult entities, as well as individuals and private entities in charge with the
management of cultural objectives. Upon completion, these objectives must be included in the
tourist circuit. Projects of up to half a million Euros that do not generate are fully funded by the
EU, while proposals up to EUR 20 million pertaining to protection of the cultural heritage site
that will generate income require 15% co-financing from the beneficiaries.


The National Rural Development Programme (PNDR) 2007-2013
194. The PNDR 2007-2013 has financed social infrastructure investments . The strategic
objective of the PNDR is to provide support to communes and villages in Romania as to increase
attractiveness of rural areas by improving the quality of life in rural places, diversifying the rural
local economy, promoting knowledge, and improving human potential. The two specific
objectives of the axis cover the creation, improvement and diversification of tourism facilities
and attraction, on one hand, and the creation and modernization of the rural basic physical
infrastructure, on the other hand.

195. Social infrastructure is tackled under Measure 322 “ Village renewal and development,
improvement of basic services for the economy and rural population and upgrading the r ural
heritage”. This measure has focused primarily on development of rural enterprises based on
local natural resources, tourism, village renewal and environmental initiatives with the main
target of adding to the on-farm measures and providing suitable jobs for people living in the
country side.

196. Activities targeting social infrastructure in rural areas could not be funded under PNDR
as independent projects . These activities had to be part of integrated projects that, in addition
to development/rehabilitation/expansion of basic infrastructure (such as roads, water, sewage),
could have a component aimed at improving living conditions by providing better access to
social services, education etc. in their communities.

197. The total value of the 802 projects developed under PNDR 2007-2013 Measure 322
amount to EUR 2.2 billion, of which 80% are EU grants, and 20% central budget contribution
The financial support could make up to 100% of the total eligible expenses for public utility
projects that do not generate profit, but it could not be more than EUR 2.5 million per
integrated project having the local council as the beneficiary. The public financial support could
go as high as EUR 6 million for an integrated project implemented by an IDA (partnership of
rural authorities). In the case of projects expected to generate profit the financial support has
been a maximum of 70%. The minimum value of the project funded under measure 322 is EUR
5,000. Beneficiaries of projects dealing with social infrastructure can be local public authorities
(communes), intercommunity development associations, non-profit organizations, cultural
establishments, cult institutions, and individuals and legal entities that own or administer
cultural patrimony objectives of local interest.




                                                                                                  114
198. Eligible activities with regard to social infrastructure focus on social services,
education, and cultural aspects, including cultural and natural patrimony. In terms of social
services and education, the program covers activities such as the establishment /development
and endowment of social services infrastructure and care centers for children, elderly and/or
people with special needs, and building and endowment of new kindergartens. It is important to
note that the establishment of the new social services infrastructure is possible only in areas
where such infrastructure is missing. At the same time, according to the PNDR applicant’s guide,
a new kindergarten can be built even if the commune/village already has such a facility, but the
existing building cannot be expanded.

199. One of the components of Measure 322 focuses on investments in cultural centers and
other types of local cultural facilities. Projects under this measure can cover renovation,
modernization, expansion and/or endowment of cultural houses (except for establishments that
had received funds or are about to become recipients of the national priority program for the
development of headquarter for cultural establishment, as per Law 143/2007), cultural centers,
and centers for conservation and promotion of traditional cultural.

200. Other projects focus on infrastructure related to different types of cultural facilities.
Such projects may cover renovation, modernization and endowment of cultural establishments,
including the first-time acquisition of books, audio materials, folk costumes, traditional musical
instruments that should promote the cultural patrimony, as well as purchasing of hardware and
software equipment. The list eligible activities regarding cultural patrimony are restoration,
consolidation, conservation, and protection of the objectives of cultural and natural patrimony
of local interest in rural areas.

201. In 2007-2013, the PNDR has dealt specifically with Class B patrimony in rural areas ,
while the ROP has financed Class A patrimony all over the country. Priority is being given to
projects developed in rural communities that had never benefited from EU funds and in rural
localities from regions with a high degree of poverty.


State-Budget-Funded Programs

Education
202. While local authorities own and remain responsible for the rehabilitation/
modernization/construction of educational facilities, the Ministry of Education still undertook
investments projects in such infrastructure in recent years. Some of these programs have been
executed with loans from International Financial Institutions and with co-financing from the
Romanian Government. Since 2009, and 2015 the Ministry of Education has run a large program
covering predominantly the pre-university education infrastructure. The program covers the
rehabilitation of 1,336 schools and high schools throughout the country, and of 16 student
dorms. The overall value of the program amounts to EUR 343.3 million, of which EUR 131 million
comes from the European Investment Bank and EUR 43.5 million from the Council of Europe
Development Bank (CEDB). The Romanian Government’s contribution is nearly EUR 169 million.
Although the contract was signed in 2002, the program began only three years later, as the




                                                                                              115
government did not have the necessary money to cover its share. So far, 1,264 facilities have
been rehabilitated, and funding is still pending to cover works to the remaining schools.

203. “Early Education Reform” is another program targeting education infrastructure with
co-financing from the state budget. The program focuses on investing EUR 105 million in pre-
school education infrastructure. It is developed with EUR 66.8 million from the CEDB and EUR
38.2 million from the national budget, and covers rehabilitation, consolidation, modernization,
and furniture endowment of 750 kindergartens between 2009 and 2016. The overall objective is
to improve the pre-school education infrastructure throughout the country and increase the
quality of education by ensuring appropriate teaching materials. As of now, rehabilitation works
were completed in only 168 kindergartens. It is expected that this program could make a
difference for more than 50,000 pre-school kids. Again, delays are caused by lack of funding
allocated by the Romanian Government – in the annual budget of the Ministry of Education –
despite the fact that the international loans are secured for a limited timeline. The situation is
not singular to 2015 and has happened repeatedly in the past.

204. Investments in educational infrastructure have been also supported by the World
Bank (WB). The WB joined efforts with the Romanian Government to improve overall condition
of schools in rural areas. The “Project for Rural Education” was developed between 2003 and
2009 with USD 90 million from the WB and co-financing from the Romanian Government and
local communities. The project included rehabilitation and modernization of over 1,000 schools
in rural communities in order to enable students to get access to better education, thus helping
them improve their performances and increase the graduation rate. The program proved to be
successful and achieved good results, and was given as an example of best practices among the
WB projects developed in Europe-Central Asia region. In recent years, anecdotal evidence
speaks of rehabilitated schools that have been forced to close down in the meantime because of
declining student population.

205. Another project financed with support from the WB was the “Early Inclusive Education
Program,” developed as part of the Social Inclusion Program (S IP). The program was executed
by the Ministry of Education between 2007 and 2011, and it amounted to EUR 7.8 million, of
which EUR 1.7 million was provided from the state budget. The money was used for the
rehabilitation and equipping of 50 kindergartens in economically and socially deprived
communities, including majority Roma, in addition to building 20 new pre-school facilities. The
project also included the construction of 10 “kindergartens in family” type units in Roma
communities, as well as the development of eight centers where parents could learn about early
education. The project is aimed at increasing access to early education for children between
ages 3 to 6 and at developing educational opportunities for those up to three years old from
poor communities.

206. Interventions were also undertaken with regard to university education infrastructure.
49 universities across the country benefited between 2009 and 2011 of financial support from
the state and local budgets to complete a number works intended to improve educational
facilities for students in the university campuses. They included primarily rehabilitation,
modernization, and endowment of university facilities, including halls, dorms, and sports halls,
and works aimed at improving the public utility services (water, sanitation, heating, etc.).



                                                                                              116
207. Beginning in 2015, the Ministry of Education will receive part of the money collected
through the gambling tax. The Government Emergency Ordinance 92/2014 regarding certain
fiscal changes made some revisions pertaining to the allocation of the funds collected in
connection to gambling activities (including licensing). According to these changes effective
2015, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Youth and Sports will receive 2% each from
the gambling tax, while 1% would go to the National Restoration Program. In the past, the
program tackling the restoration of historical monuments used to receive 3.5% of the tax, while
1.5% would go to the Cinematography Fund.

Health
208. Law 95/2006 on health sector reform enables the Ministry of Health (MoH) to provide
funding for infrastructure development of public healthcare facilities managed by local and
county authorities . The MoH should have a minimum financial contribution of 3% for work
interventions and 5% for equipment. The rest of the money should come from the local budgets.
Over the course of time, the funding requested by the local authorities exceeded the financial
capacity of the MoH. Most of the time, the Ministry is asked to provide the bulk of the funds for a
particular investment, as the local government complains that it does not have the money to
complete the intervention. Nevertheless, some local authorities have been able to contribute with
up to half of the funds needed for various projects.

209. The health tax, commonly known as the vice tax, was introduced in 2006 and was
specifically levied on cigarettes and alcohol in order to mitigate excessive smoking and drinking.
When it was enforced in 2006, the vice tax was set at 20 euro-cents per pack of cigarettes and EUR
200 per hectoliter of refined alcohol. The money collected through the tax was aimed at funding
the health sector, including development and modernization of health infrastructure. Between
2006 and 2012, approximately RON 7.5 billion was collected through the vice tax, with an estimate
of RON 1.3 billion per year.

210. The money was used to support, among other things, purchasing of ambulances and
equipment for primary care practitioners, but also preparation of feasibility studies for the
construction of 15 new county hospitals. Between 2006 and 2014, nearly RON 4 billion was spent
to support national healthcare programs, including RON 600 billion for medical equipment and
RON 400 million for hospital infrastructure repairs. It is estimated that the money collected
through the vice tax would account for approximately 10% of the annual public spending in the
health sector.

211. In addition to state funds, the health sector receives support from International
Financial Institutions. The World Bank (WB) is providing a loan of USD 250 million as part of a USD
338 million program called “Improving Health System Quality and Efficiency , ” which aims to
enhance the access to, quality, and efficiency of health public services in Romania. The WB
financial assistance is aimed at supporting the healthcare service delivery network through
strengthening the hospitals’ systems and services, increasing outpatient medical care services,
improving primary healthcare services at the community level, and enhancing governance across
the healthcare system. The program is managed by the MoH and it should be completed by 2020.
The money from the WB will be primarily used for the rationalization of hospitals by strengthening
key healthcare facilities that should become the backbone of national and regional health
networks. The loan is to cover a wide range of activities, such as: feasibility studies and detailed


                                                                                              117
technical designs; rehabilitation works of hospitals, ambulatory centers, emergency departments,
intensive-care units, palliative care units, and burn centers; and endowment of such facilities with
modern medical equipment. The WB program will support interventions listed in the Action Plan
in connection to the Strategy in the Health Sector 2014-2020, such as modernization of
infrastructure for diagnostic and treatment ambulatory centers (EUR 24.4 million) and
modernization of radio-therapy and oncology services infrastructure (EUR 40 million). The WB
funds will also contribute to the development and rationalization of hospitals at the national and
regional level, an ambitious program covered from several funding sources, including the EU
(through the ROP), the national budget, and the Romanian-Swiss Cooperation Program.

Cultural Patrimony
212. The most important state-funded program pertaining to the rehabilitation of the non-
mobile cultural patrimony in Romania is the National Restoration Program (NRP). The program
is managed by the National Patrimony Institute with public funds from the Ministry of Culture and
Cultural Pat rimony. The program’s investment priorities focus on restoration and conservation or
historical monuments included in the National Registry of Historical Monuments. Between 2007
and 2012, more than RON 200 million was allocated for the rehabilitation of over 1,100 historical
monuments of national importance (Class A). By 2012, only 86 historical monuments were
completely rehabilitated, as most of the time restoration works have incurred delays and, as in
other sectors, there are consistent fund shortages. Recently, as noted above, the percentage of
the money collected through the gambling tax channeled to the NRP went down from 3.5% to
only 1%.

213. State-funded interventions related to cultural infrastructure have also been promoted
under the programs managed by the National Investment Company (NIC). In recent years, the
NIC developed interventions aimed at improving cultural life in urban and rural communities,
increasing people’s access to cultural activities, and diversifying the cultural offering in their
respective communities. The program has focused on rehabilitation, modernization, and
endowment of cultural settlements in rural and small-scale urban communities, as well as on
construction of new facilities and completion of existing works. 45 such cultural facilities have
been completed so far.

214. The Ministry of Culture has also deployed some loans to fund key interventions. The
Council of Europe Development Bank has provided funding for investments in the rehabilitation of
cultural heritage in Romania in 2006, which also represented the most ambitious program in this
field, with 20 major projects undertaken. A total budget of around EUR 350 million was allocated
for this task. All of these investments were carried out in urban areas and targeted primarily large
and important cultural heritage sites. The Ministry has also started a EUR 16.5 million program
with EEA (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) grant funding.

Sports
215. A number of public investment programs targeting the sports infrastructure have been
previously financed by MRDPA through the NIC. One such program was dedicated to building
new sports halls and facilities in rural and urban areas. The program completed 1,040 sports halls
between 2002 and 2014, in addition to the rehabilitation of 45 sports facilities that had been built




                                                                                              118
before 2000. Other state-funded programs considered the construction of sports complexes and
swimming pools. 11 swimming pools have been finalized between 2009 and 2014.

216. “The Maintenance, Functioning and Development of Sports Equipment” program
managed by the Ministry of Youth and Sports (MYS) aims to ensure optimal conditions for
training activities and sports competitions, with a priority for national and Olympic teams. The
interventions include maintenance and modernization of the sports infrastructure and
development of sports facilities in urban and rural area. An agreement signed in early 2015
between the MRDPA and the MYS laid down the upcoming investments in the sports
infrastructure. To this end, the MRDPA will finance a number of projects included in the list of
priorities established by the MYS. The MDRPA will provide funding for the development of 34
sports facilities to be completed by the end of 2015. These include 28 sports halls, four swimming
pools for training, and two sports complexes in rural and urban areas. In addition, the MDRPA will
ensure the necessary funding to build by the end of 2016 a number of sports facilities for
professional athletes – i.e., five sports complexes, six multifunctional sports halls, four water-polo
swimming pools, four Olympic-size swimming pools, and an artificial skating rink. It is expected
that the MYS could use additional money to fund sports and youth infrastructure once it will get
2% of the money collected in connection to the gambling tax, starting in 2015. It is estimated that
the gambling tax will bring an additional EUR 14 million to the Ministry’s budget.

Chapter 4: Diagnostic of Coordination Mechanisms for
Infrastructure Investments in Romania
217. There is a broad consensus in Romania – in policy circles and beyond – that there are
significant gaps in the coordination of public infrastructure investments, at all levels. The
2014-2020 Partnership Agreement between Romania and the EU openly recognizes that “there
are clear deficiencies in coordination between ministries and entities that coordinate intra-
sectoral responsibilities, institutional overlapping in terms of competencies and attributions,
inefficient use of resources, [and] fragmented administration with too many expensive
structures.”64 The PA also emphasizes one of the main conclusions reached in the World Bank’s
2011 functional review regarding the risks of lack of coordination: “The implementation of the
operational programmes in 2007-2013 experienced situations when in parallel with the EU
funded schemes the Romanian Government run similar grant schemes with more favorable or
less demanding procedures competing in an counterproductive way, e.g. Environment Fund
Administration which managed schemes for water inf rastructure […].” For its part, the
Governing Program 2013-2016 also mentions repeatedly the need to coordinate among
different institutions, particularly in the implementation of EU funds. 65

218. In practice, however, gaps in the coordination of public investments are highly visible.
Perhaps the most often cited examples refer to the inefficient sequencing of investments,
whereby a newly rehabilitated road is damaged by subsequent public works related to the
rehabilitation of utility networks (gas lines, water and sewage pipes, etc.). Such situations often
result in media articles and public outrage regarding the inefficient spending of taxpayer money.
But who is really responsible for such suboptimal outcomes? In effect, this simple example is
indicative of a broader challenge of coordination faced by public authorities in Romania, across
all phases of an investment’s cycle: from the development of a strategy to the design of an
investment program to the financing, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of
individual infrastructure projects. At the same time, the need to coordinate has never been
greater, considering the demands for new and improved infrastructure and the significant gap
between what the government could finance and actual needs on the ground.



4.1 Intra-Sectoral Coordination
This section reviews current intra-sectoral coordination mechanisms. First, it evaluates vertical
coordination (across levels of government) of strategies and plans in the three sectors of
interest (roads, water and wastewater, and social infrastructure). Second, it assesses horizontal
coordination across investment programs (managed by different units/ministries) – again, for
each of the three aforementioned sectors. The following figure summarizes the main
dimensions of intra-sectoral coordination.

4.1.1 Vertical Coordination of Strategies and Plans
219. For this particular work, a key focus is on the coordination of strategies and plans (i.e.,
the strategic planning part), as agreed in the advisory services agreement between the Bank
and the MRDPA. The figure below depicts the interrelations between strategies at various levels
– variants of this were featured under each of the sector reviews in Chapter 3.



Roads
220. The guiding document for investments in the road sector is the National Spatial Plan
(Planul de Amenajare al Teritoriului Național – PATN). The PATN includes new major road links
(highways and expressways) considered for financing in future years. Figure 15 includes the
proposed network as it was developed in the 2006 version of the PATN. This has been the major
guiding document in the transport sector in Romania and it has also influenced the way TEN-T
corridors (both core and comprehensive segments) have been chosen. Basically, the TEN-T
network follows the PATN. The PATN is, however, a living document and should be updated
when new information becomes available.

221. In October 2014, a draft version of the General Transport Master Plan (GTMP) was
finally made available for public debate. This was followed on February 10, 2015 by a synthesis
presentation, with a few key updates. Since the document’s final form is not yet public, it is not
discussed in more detail here and will be covered in the final report on prioritization criteria for
PNDL (also under Component 1 and due on August 27, 2015). However, it is important to note


                                                                                                121
that the proposal made by the draft GTMP for the major road network in Romania differs
substantially from what is proposed in the PATN. For one, the length of the highway and the
expressway network is significantly reduced, as shown in the table below. The GTMP looks at
current traffic data and projected future demand, while at the same time taking cost of
construction into consideration. It was thus considered that many of the highway and
expressway links proposed in the PATN are not justified given the estimated cost of construction
and projected traffic data. Thus, road links that were previously proposed as highways in the
PATN have been downgraded to expressways or even transregional roads in the draft Master
Plan. Several PATN proposed expressways suffered the same fate and now appear as
downgraded to transregional roads or eurotrans roads.
Table 7. The length of major road infrastructure proposed in the Transport Master Plan is
smaller than what was previously proposed in the PATN

222. Moreover, the GTMP has put forth a slightly modified road network. Some new road
links have been proposed, such as the expressway linking Ploiești to Târgoviște and the A1

highway. Other road links were proposed on a different course, such as the road linking Brașov
to Miercurea Ciuc. The proposals made in the GTMP now warrant a revision and update of the
Transport Section of the PATN. Obviously, one will have to wait until the final version of the
Master Plan is completed and approved (including by the EC), but it is clear that these two
documents cannot exist in parallel in the current form, as they propose different major road
networks.

223. In fact, the National Spatial Plan should have originally been designed with such a
Master Plan at its foundation. As indicated in the figure below, for a variety of historical and
institutional reasons, the sequence of planning in the transport sector was in many respects
inverted, which has now led to intense debates. For example, the Pitești -Sibiu road link is part of
the TEN-T Core Network, and it should normally have highway status. However, in the GTMP
presented in October 2014 this segment was envisaged as an expressway, with a preference for
Brașov-Sibiu as a highway; this was changed in the January 2015 synthesis presentation of the
GTMP, where the Piteșt i-Sibiu segment was again features as a highway. While the Transport
Master Plan should have provided the planned network for the National Spatial Plan, which in
turn would have influenced the choice of the TEN-T corridors in Romania, in practice the
normative proposal in the PATN and the TEN-T proposal have influenced the draft Master Plan
proposal, and may influence the final version of that document. Obviously, this is not the ideal
course of action. It is hoped that once the GTMP is fully approved and the PATN is adapted
accordingly, future iterations will continue in the logical and predictable sequence.

                            Figure 37. Sequence of transport planning




224. At a lower level, investments in county and communal roads should take the PATN
and the TEN-T into consideration, though data show that this happens only when there are
special incentives to do so. For example, although most county development strategies mention
the PATN, there is little actual coordination with this normative document. Annex C provides a
thorough review of all county strategies in Romania. Since only 17% of the highways and 0% of
the expressways proposed in the PATN have actually been finalized, there is not much to
coordinate with and, as recently shown by the process of developing the GTMP, key aspects of
the road network (type of roads, preferred routes, etc.) can still change significantly. When it
comes to actual investments, a look at the map below indicates that there is little de facto
coordination between the PATN and county road investments done through the National Local
Development Program (PNDL). In fact, with a few exceptions (e.g., the counties of Teleorman,
Arad, Bihor, and Satu Mare) there seems to be no real strategic thinking in the way PNDL county
road investments have been selected; more commonly, these investments have financed short



                                                                                                123
road links that have been rehabilitated where the need was assessed to be largest or based on
other unknown criteria.

Figure 38. There is sometimes a weak correlation between PNDL County Road Investments
and the PATN




                                        Data Source: MRDPA

225. The story is very different when it comes to investments in county roads done from EU
funds – specifically, from the Regional Operational Programme (ROP) 2007-2013. Clearer rules,
stricter regulations, and better defined evaluation and selection criteria apply in this case, and,
as was shown in Figure 17, a large majority of ROP-funded county roads (between 2007 and
2013) connect to the TEN-T Network. More precisely, the ROP’s technical and financial
evaluation grid – included in the Applicant Guide – rewarded projects connecting to the TEN-T
with 6 points (maximum) versus 3 or fewer points for other projects. This helped motivate
potential beneficiaries to select for rehabilitation roads connecting to the TEN-T network. This is
an example of direct targeting of investments in an attempt to achieve a higher impact with
limited funds, while at the same time coordinating lower-level investments with higher-level
investments.

226. Going even lower to the local level, there is anecdotal evidence of coordination gaps
between key communal and corresponding county roads. Communal roads play a critical role
in Romania by linking multiple villages within a commune. In an optimal scenario, the mayor of a
commune should coordinate with the county authorities to see if and when the county road


                                                                                               124
passing through the commune (through its core center) will be rehabilitated, and further ensure
that related communal roads linking the other villages to the core are also rehabilitated.
Otherwise, the mayor may rehabilitate the communal roads through own funds or through
programs like the PNDL, but if the main county road that connects the commune to other larger
urban centers in the area is in bad shape the connectivity of the locality will remain poor. Put
differently, in such a scenario, the mayor should probably hold off on investing in the communal
roads and allocate money to other priorities until the county road is rehabilitated.


Water and Wastewater
227. Compared to the roads sector, there is – by design – a more limited need to ensure
vertical coordination of water/sanitation investment strategies, i.e., from the national level
down to the regional, county, and local level. As such, there is no normative “national plan” for
such investments. The document that comes closest to this is the National Management Plan for
the Danube River Basin, which is essentially a synthesis of the 11 sub-plans for Romania’s main
river basins. As described earlier, these plans were developed as part of Romania’s
commitments under the EU Water Framework Directive and cover a range of topics, focusing on
the general characteristics and trends in the quality and quantity of different types of water.

228. When it comes to the development of water and sanitation infrastructure, the guiding
documents that should ensure coordination in the sector are the Water and Wastewater
Master Plans . As noted in the previous chapter (under the water and wastewater section), the
River Basin Plans actually coordinate with and cite the Master Plans. The latter were developed
for the 2007-2013 programming period by each Regional Operator and are currently getting
updated to reflect priorities for 2014-2020. Each Master Plan estimates total investment needs
at the level of each covered area (typically, a county), and draws up investment plans through
and beyond 2018, the deadline for fulfilling the commitments included in Romania’s EU
Accession Treaty. Essentially, each Master Plan features a full list of investments and prioritizes
them ex-ante, top-down, based on a set of criteria. As the map below shows, investment needs
vary across different counties in Romania, with Suceava, Iași, and Prahova requiring a lot more
funds than counties like Mehedinți, Călărași, or Tulcea. The funds go toward both rehabilitation
of existing networks and new projects for expanding current coverage of water and sanitation
services.

229. In an ideal scenario, the Water and Wastewater Master Plans would be sufficient to
ensure efficient coordination of strategies and plans in the sector. After all, they prioritize in a
top-down manner all needed investments; all one has to do is see how much funding is available
and support the projects one by one, gradually covering the full list from whatever sources are
available. There are several challenges in practice, however, based on data obtained during field
interviews and based on other recent observations. For example, some stakeholders question
the validity of analyses included in the Master Plans. Mayors of some communes that were “left
out” of the list of localities eligible for financing through 2018 argue that there are cheaper
technical solutions (e.g., modular systems) that would be appropriate for their communities and
financially sustainable even in the medium-to-long run. Perhaps as a result of such pressures,
some counties are now redefining their Water and Wastewater Master Plans to include all
localities (even remote ones) in various clusters/agglomerations. It is unclear whether such
amendments will stand in the final versions of the plans for 2014-2020. Moreover, state-budget-


                                                                                                125
funded investment programs did not adopt inclusion in the Master Plan as a hard eligibility
requirement; particularly communes that were not eligible for EU funds submitted projects and
received funding, even though they were not considered a priority in the Master Plans. This
clearly undermines coordination and, ultimately, the role of the Master Plans as the ultimate
reference for what needs to be done in the sector – and in what timeframe.

Social Infrastructure
230. This is perhaps the sector that poses the greatest challenges when it comes to
ensuring effective vertical coordination, for multiple reasons. Several iterations of
decentralization and local public administration laws gave subnational authorities (local and
county councils) formal ownership over most social infrastructure physical assets in their
respective jurisdictions, with a few exceptions deemed “of national importance” (university
hospitals, the most prominent cultural monuments, public universities, etc.). The review of
county-level development strategies (see Annex C) suggests that sectoral strategies are rarely
cited by these lower-level planning documents. The conclusion likely holds for development
strategies at the level of localities.

231. The straightforward insight is that each “owner” of social infrastructure coordinates
its own efforts in this regard, primarily through a corresponding local or county development
strategy. Investments in this infrastructure are driven primarily by needs on the ground and
local/county political preferences – ideally, the two are aligned – and less by national-level
strategies and their priorities. It is good that sector-wide visions exist (primarily as a EU pre-


                                                                                                     126
requirement) and the strategies reviewed are generally stronger than the average in Romania.
They get into specific priorities and actions, and some (e.g., in health) even note financing
sources potentially available. Despite such strengths, there is only so much that the national
level can do to influence infrastructure investment decisions regarding assets that belong to
local/county authorities. The next section on coordination of investment programs elaborates
this point. For now, it suffices to note that there is room for improved vertical coordination in
the social infrastructure sectors.

232. The following sections present an overall picture of vertical coordination mechanisms
in social infrastructure, focusing on strategies available for the health, education, culture, and
sports sectors. The diagnostic is primarily descriptive and limited to whatever data were made
available as part of the desk review and interview processes. Each of the four sectors is complex
and would merit a more in-depth treatment, but for the purposes of this report it suffices to
restate the aforementioned conclusion that vertical coordination of social infrastructure
investments shows significant room for improvement.

Health
233. First, for the health sector, the main goal of the National Health Strategy for the 2014-
2020 programming period is to reform the healthcare system in Romania and the related
infrastructure in order to offer good and efficient healthcare services. This can be achieved by
developing new services in the form of community care services that should respond to the
needs of vulnerable communities, strengthen the primary care, ambulatory care, and elderly
care facilities, and invest in e-health technologies, infrastructure, and human resources. The
Strategy is supported by an Action Plan that outlines a number of measures and interventions
for each of the priority areas.

234. One of the main priorities is the rationalization and transformation of local healthcare
facilities from large and small-scale urban areas by converting them into ambulatory care
facilities or adult day care centers in order to cater for chronically ill patients . After
rehabilitation, some of these facilities would be taken over by local authorities. Another area of
intervention deals with the rationalization and development of hospitals at the national and
regional level by diminishing the number of buildings and integrating them into new or
rehabilitated units within new regional hospitals. New buildings in connection to existing
regional hospitals in areas that lack such medical services should be developed and equipped. In
addition, a number of healthcare facilities that act like regional hospitals will be modernized and
equipped throughout the country. Non-performing hospitals should be transformed into
multifunctional ambulatory centers or into hospitals designed for long-time recovery. Special
attention will be given for the upgrading of the emergency care units within the county
hospitals.

235. The strategy also aims to increase the quality of healthcare services provided in
ambulatory systems. To this end, interventions should focus on community care, primary care,
and special ambulatory care facilities. The investments target new construction of ambulatory
care centers or rehabilitation of the existing ones as to enable the gradual establishment of
community health services centers at the national level. In addition, the action plan refers to the
modernization and endowment of existing ambulatory care facilities for diagnostic and
treatment.


                                                                                               127
236. The Action Plan mentions the actors responsible for the interventions and the funding
sources – this is already an improvement compared to most strategies in Romania, which
remain at the level of broadly stated desiderata. Investments should be covered from various
resources, such as the national budget, EU funds, financial support from the Norwegian and
Swiss governments, and the World Bank. For example, the activities related to the
rationalization and transformation of hospitals should be covered from EU funds, national and
local budgets; the construction of three new regional hospitals with the overall cost of EUR 450
million should be covered from EU funds, the World Bank, and the Romanian-Swiss Cooperation
Fund. Others mention the exact source of EU funding – it is the case of the investments related
to primary care services, which requires EUR 125 million through the Regional Operational
Programme for building, rehabilitation, and endowment of facilities.

Education
237. The 2013 draft of the Strategy on education and professional training fo r 2014-2020
has a chapter on the development of educational infrastructure and professional training. The
main goal in this respect is to diminish the existing disparities among pre-university educational
facilities (such as old, improper buildings, lack of sanitation). To this end, development of
education-related infrastructure should help enable equal access to education and reduce the
early dropout phenomenon, improve tertiary education, enable access to quality education, and
provide life-long training. At the same time, the document highlights the need to modernize and
develop new school infrastructure and higher-education facilities, especially in rural areas, as
well as to provide access to required amenities (e.g., labs, workshops) in order to enhance the
quality of education and professional training. The development of education infrastructure
should contribute to three main achievements by 2020: the school dropout rate should go down
by 11.3%, participation to tertiary education of people age 30 to 40 should go up by 26.7%, and
involvement in life-long training should be increased by 10%.

Culture
238. The Sectoral Strategy on Culture and Cultural Patrimony for the period 2014-2020
highlights steps to be taken regarding non-mobile patrimony (historical monuments). One of
the targets in this respect is to improve and extend access to historical monuments and develop
integrated management plans for those objectives capable of generating economic growth (by
introducing them into tourist circuits). According to the strategy, priority should be given to the
rehabilitation of Class A monuments by national authorities and of patrimony objectives of Class
B by local authorities. Class A includes monuments of national importance that are managed
directly by the Ministry of Culture, whereas Class B comprises monuments of local importance
under the local authorities. Monuments included in Class B should be part of social-economical
integrated programs. There are close to 30,000 historical monuments in Romania included in
the list of historical monuments, of which nearly 7,000 are of national importance and the rest
belong to Class B.

239. Priority for restoration and conservation of works should be correlated with a number
of factors . These include the significance of the historical monument for the respective
community, its potential economic development and tourist potential, and, not in the least, the
available transport infrastructure to this cultural objective. These are encouraging signs of



                                                                                               128
attempts to coordinate – not only within the culture sector, but also across sectors. In the next
few years, the Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony plans to start off pilot projects to
establish integrated spatial plans that should incorporate cultural aspects and management
plans for historical monuments. By 2020, at least 10% of the historical monuments in the
country that made it to the Class A list should be restored and should have their own
management plans.

240. However, the strategy emphasizes the shortfalls of the 2007-2013 programming
period, when EU funds dedicated for growth poles tackled more the restoration and
rehabilitation of historical buildings, rather than urban regeneration interventions. For
example, the rehabilitation of the old city in Bistrița was actu ally the only genuine urban
regeneration project funded under the Regional Operational Program in the North-West region.
The strategy claims that there is still a lack of understanding at the level of local authorities on
the development potential of historical monuments. The document also draws attention on the
local governments’ poor knowledge of the EU programs that are not dealing directly with the
cultural sector.

Sports
241. The draft strategy in the sports sector was prepared in 2013 for the EU-Romania
Partnership Agreement, and it refers to a few actions to be considered with regard to the
sports infrastructure. The strategy emphasizes on the overall need to improve the sports
infrastructure in Romania. Thus, the document focuses on the rehabilitation of the sports camps
that belong to the Ministry of Youth and Sports and the development of sports infrastructure for
schools. At the same time, other measures target the rehabilitation of existing National Sports
Complexes and enhancing the number of such facilities. Changes in the future regarding the
sports sector should tackle the legal framework with regard to the private-public partnership.
This should enable additional funding sources for building and improving new sports facilities in
order to improve the activities and performances of athletes in the country. The strategy also
notes that sports camps of local interests should be transferred to the local and county
authorities, and a decentralization project to this effect is currently pending.


4.1.2 Horizontal Coordination of Investment Programs

Roads
242. At the national level, horizontal coordination across investment programs is facilitated
by the fact that all major road investments (highways, expressways, and major roads) are
managed by the CNADNR, with funds from the national budget and from SOP Transport.
Although some of the key decisions on how investments will be prioritized are made by different
entities (i.e., by the General Government Secretariat through its Department for Infrastructure
Projects or by the Managing Authority for Large Infrastructure for 2014-2020), the de facto
“beneficiary” of allocated funds for major road infrastructure is still the CNADNR. Thus, the
Company can ensure that investments in rehabilitation/upgrade of major roads are properly
coordinated with planned investments in major highways and expressways. This is a typical
example of institutional “centralization, ” whereby coordination is made easier by the fact that a
single actor handles an investment program. On a similar note, the CNADNR also manages the



                                                                                                129
operation and maintenance of all highways and national roads, which again makes it easier to
coordinate based on annual and multiannual action plans.

243. At a lower level, for county roads, investments appear harder to coordinate in
practice, although the two major programs focusing on such types of investments – the EU-
funded ROP and the state-budget-funded PNDL – are both managed by the MRDPA. What
would coordination involve exactly? Within a county, rehabilitation of county roads should
prioritize investments based on some clear priorities, ensuring above all that they are useful and
that they connect point A to point B, where A and B should be localities of some significance
(e.g., with higher urban mass, hence requiring improved connectivity). At a more sophisticated
level, coordination can also involve multiple counties working together in planning road
investments – i.e., rehabilitating road segments that connect with each other, thereby ensuring
truly regional impact, in the context of Romania still lacking administrative regions.

244. In general, projects financed under the PNDL have very different characteristics
compared to ROP-financed investments. The main cause is related to the discrepant time
horizons of the two programs: the ROP follows the EU programming cycle of seven years, plus
an additional 2-3 years for finalizing implementation; the PNDL is an annual program, with
priorities and funding possibly shifting from one year to the next. The main implication is tha t
PNDL applicants submit for consideration smaller projects that they can realistically finish in a
few years or less. This means shorter road segments (under the PNDL) that are, by definition,
less strategic than longer, more expensive interventions (under the ROP). As the table below
indicates, the average value of an ROP project was almost 3 times larger than that of a PNDL
investment. Thus, the investments done by county councils on county roads with ROP funds
follow a different pattern than investments done with PNDL funds.

Table 8. PNDL and ROP County Roads Commitments
                                 Number of projects             Value of Projects   Average Project Value
 PNDL 2014                                     122                € 482,844,533              € 3,957,742
 ROP 2007-2013                                 142              € 1,407,141,416              € 9,909,447
                                           Data Source: MRDPA

245. Similar observations hold as far as inter-jurisdictional coordination is concerned, with
the ROP faring much better than the PNDL, particularly going forward . Given the compressed
timing, it is no wonder that PNDL beneficiaries rush to submit projects on their own, even
though Intercommunity Development Associations (IDAs) – partnerships among multiple
local/county authorities – are also eligible for funding under the program. Even outside the de
jure framework of a partnership, there is little de facto coordination among counties when it
comes to PNDL projects, as can be seen from Figure 39 below. The situation is different when it
comes to the ROP 2007-2013 and even more different when compared to the ROP 2014-2020.
Regarding the former, Axis 2 dedicated to county roads selected projects based on the First-In-
First-Out (FIFO) rule, which placed at a disadvantage larger, more strategic, cross-county
projects. 67 Even so, some counties were able to coordinate their investments in county roads,

67There is a well-known example in the West Development Region of a road connecting multiple counties
that did not make the funding cut because it required longer preparation time. For an in-depth discussion


                                                                                                      130
particularly in the South-West, South, and North-East. Moreover, under the 2014-2020 ROP,
“projects completed in partnership among two/more counties will be financed with priority.” 68

246. Indeed, the ROP 2014-2020 (still in draft form as of late February 2015) features
several innovations for incentivizing coordination. By defining from this early stage in the
programming process an explicit goal to prioritize truly regional investments, the MRDPA –
through the Managing Authority of the ROP (MA ROP) – has mobilized lower-level stakeholders
to plan investments jointly. Regional Development Agencies (RDAs), public utility NGOs that
serve as Intermediate Bodies for the ROP, and Regional Development Councils, which bring
together local and county authorities in each development region, are already working on
proposals for truly regional road projects for 2014-2020. There are positive signals that county
authorities have agreed several cross-county projects to fund in each region under the ROP. The
programmatic document also specifically notes among the list of general principles for selecting
projects “the level of coordination with investments completed from other financing sources
(LIOP, PNDR, and PNDL).”69 Importantly, the ROP programmatic document specifically mentions
the PNDL; it remains to be seen in the Applicant Guides (to be finalized later in 2015) how this
principle will be factored into evaluation and selection criteria. The point is that, once again,
conditionality proves that it can work to facilitate coordination.

247. As for the current portfolio of ROP and PNDL projects, data deployed by the Bank
team show that there is indeed little coordination among the two programs ( see first map
below). Also, as indicated earlier, ROP-funded roads have a strong focus on improving access to
the TEN-T Network, while PNDL-funded county roads do not seem to follow a clear pattern and
the decision on what to finance is left at the discretion of county councils. There are some
counties where an evident effort was made to coordinate PNDL and ROP investments (e.g., the
counties of Arad and Satu Mare), where parts of the same road or parts of a larger network have
been financed from both the ROP and the PNDL. In other parts of the country, however, such
good practices were not followed, which is a direct consequence of the lack of formal
mechanisms and conditions for enabling this harmonization of investments.

248. At an even lower level, several communes have undertaken investments in communal
roads with both PNDL and PNDR funds. The second map below indicates that there are many
communes that have tapped both sources of funding to cover investment needs (represented in
red). Overall, it is also evident that the PNDL is a premier funding source for communal roads
rehabilitation/upgrade, with investments all over the country and wider coverage than the
PNDR. This confirms qualitative data regarding differences between the two programs: again, it
is generally much harder to obtain EU funds, so few communes – especially among small
localities, with little capacity – manage to succeed in this endeavor.

249. Interestingly, localities in some counties seem to have a preference for PNDL or PNDR,
while in other counties there seems to be little appetite for either. For example, the counties
of Hunedoara, Argeș, and Suceava seem to prefer PNDR funds. In Giurgiu, Călărași, or Brăila,
there seems to be a bigger appetite for PNDL funds. Some counties, like Bacău, Sălaj, Satu Mare,
Maramureș, Bihor, Arad, or Cluj, have been pro-active in accessing both PNDL and PNDR funds,
with most of their localities having at least a communal road under works. It is worth
mentioning that, to a large extent, the way PNDL funds are distributed to localities (within and
across counties) depends on how county councils prioritize projects and on the MRDPA’s final
decision.

250. A key observation is that PNDL is the more accessible source of financing for
authorities in rural areas looking to invest in communal roads, and the program’s
characteristics pose fewer problems for such projects than for county roads. Indeed,
communal road investments are usually small and can be completed relatively quickly, making
the PNDL a good candidate for such funding requests. Put differently, when the targeted
intervention is small, the PNDL appears to have a competitive edge over the PNDR. Data show
that the PNDL has financed more communal road projects, with an average value of those
interventions significantly smaller than that of PNDR investments.

251. While the discussion above has compared EU and state-budget instruments, it is
worth noting that coordination among EU programs only is much clearer, better defined, and
followed in practice. The programmatic documents reviewed (in draft form, as of early March
2015) have entire sections dedicated to coordination and define ex-ante what each instrument
will focus on, minimizing overlaps to the full extent possible. Specifically, road infrastructure
financed under the PNDR is supplemented by the two other OPs (Large Infrastructure
Operational Programme and the Regional Operational Programme). PNDR investments should
link up to: county roads rehabilitated and/or modernized through the ROP (county roads that
connect directly or indirectly to the TEN-T network, on the one hand; and to LIOP-funded
national roads under the Cohesion Fund (CF), on the other hand. As the LIOP programmatic
document notes, the program’s road infrastructure proposals will coordinate with the priorities
established under the General Transport Master Plan and also with activities funded under the
Regional Operational Programme and the PNDR. Similarly, the ROP points out the need to
correlate with the two other instruments. At this point in the process, without having the final
Applicant Guides for each program and axis, it is difficult to envision how each fund will
coordinate with the others. For example, they may each reward projects that describe in the
financing proposal how they benefit and integrate with other EU-funded investments. The final
mechanism remains to be seen later in 2015, but the programmatic documents provide
sufficient reason for hope, as does the 2007-2013 experience.




                                                                                                           133
Water and Wastewater
252. In the water and wastewater sector, horizontal coordination across different funding
programs (EU and state-budget funded) is also important to avoid overlaps and leverage
synergies through economies of scale. At a basic level, it is easy to understand that expanding a
water supply or sanitation system to neighboring localities can be much cheaper – and more
sustainable in the long run, due to scale economies – than building separate networks for each
locality. In fact, county-level Master Plans for the water and wastewater sector have drawn
agglomerations and clusters precisely to encourage integrated planning and implementation of
investments. If all investments programs followed these documents and the prioritization they
propose, coordination opportunities would be maximized.

253. But coordination is particularly challenging in this sector because multiple programs
are involved. On the EU side, there are the OP Large Infrastructure 2014-2020 (and OP
Environment 2007-2013) and the PNDR; on the state budget side, there are the PNDL (and its
predecessors) and the Environment Fund, which essentially target the same types of
investments, and also overlap with the aforementioned EU instruments. What is clear is that
Romania’s water and sanitation sector has huge needs that could not be covered by any single
investment program (assuming that current budgets would be maintained). Even adding up all
major sources – i.e., OP Environment, PNDR, PNDL, and the Environment Fund – there are still
significant gaps between total needs and available funds. The gap is largest in the counties of
Suceava, Iași, Mureș, Bacău, Brașov, Prahova, and Argeș, while Gorj and the Târnave area have
already addressed most of their investment needs (see map below).

(thousands of EUR)

                                                                                                       134
254. As for roads, when it comes to EU-funded instruments only, proper coordination and a
harmonized approach with other investment programmes are part of their stated and
required objectives – this has been true even for the previous programming period. Before
these programmes are approved by the European Commission, they have to show that they are
complementary in nature and do not duplicate investments. For 2007-2013, SOP Environment
focused on large investments, primarily in urban areas, while the PNDR took on comparatively
smaller projects, only in rural areas. The criterion was simple enough: SOP Environment covered
localities with over 10,000 residents, while PNDR took on the rest, with a few exceptions (SOP
Environment did target a few rural communities related to the main investments in urban
areas). Similarly, tourist resorts rehabilitated with ROP funds through integrated projects – that
included the modernization of water/sanitation networks – have been identified ex-ante to
avoid duplication with other EU-funded programs.

255. For 2014-2020, coordination across LIOP and PNDR appears somewhat more
challenging than previously, as they both target localities between 2,000 and 10,000 p.e. for
wastewater investments. The programmatic documents for LIOP and for PNDR acknowledge
this potential issue and note several measures to address it: (i) the Water and Wastewater
Master Plans and their lists of priorities will help draw the line between these two programs,
with LIOP taking on larger projects in primarily urban areas and the PNDR serving rural areas; (ii)
a coordination mechanism among these two OPs would be enforced through a protocol signed
between their respective Management Authorities (it is unclear at this point what the protocol
would involve); and finally (iii) PNDR may finance investments under 2,000 p.e., but only after
Romania has met its EU commitments in the sector. Similar to the 2007-2013 arrangement, the
beneficiaries of the LIOP will be the Regional Operators (ROs), whereas in the case of the PNDR
the beneficiaries will be local authorities that should ultimately cede operation of their
water/sanitation systems to the ROs. The LIOP programmatic document also calls for an
integrated management system for investments in the water and sanitation sector to be
established with support from the ROs. The ROs should also be involved in the early stages of
the project – such as preparation and approval of the technical documentation, including for
PNDR beneficiaries.

256. The coordination of investments between EU and state-budget-funded programs, and
between different state-budget-funded programs, has been much harder and often
nonexistent. At the level of programs, there are no conditions/criteria for enabling proper
harmonization. The Environment Fund has been open to all types of interventions, with a fairly
generous upper threshold, thereby possibly competing with SOP Environment and certainly with
the PNDR. Similarly, there are no mechanisms to ensure that the PNDL focuses on investments
complementary to EU-funded projects. The maps below identify overlaps between PNDL and
PNDR interventions in the water and wastewater sector and, respectively, between the PNDL
and the Environment Fund.




                                                                                               135

257. Without data at the level of villages it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions from
these maps, since multiple villages can be part of the same territorial administrative unit (i.e.,
the commune). For example, overlaps could indicate duplication of funding or, quite the
contrary, complementarity of investments – e.g., PNDR funding for one village and the


                                                                                              137
expansion of the intervention with PNDR funds to the next village, under the same jurisdiction
of a commune. Qualitative data from field interviews reveal, however, that there are some
localities that have applied and received funding from multiple state-budget-funded programs,
though seem to be rare exceptions (and have been explicitly forbidden under EU funded
programs, whereby an applicant formally declares that it did not benefit from another financing
for a particular intervention). Technical solutions can also vary from case to case; a good
designer may propose expansion of a PNDR system with PNDL funding in one commune, while
in another a mayor may obtain financing for building a wastewater treatment plant to serve a
single village (of under 2,000 p.e.).

258. As far as the correlation of EF projects and other similar investments goes, there are
no specific guidelines to determine optimal financing sources for particular project proposals .
Put differently, there are no institutionalized mechanisms for ensuring that there are no
overlaps and that a project eligible for EU funds is first submitted to an EU-funded instrument
like OP Environment/ OP Large Infrastructure or PNDR. It also appears that investments of any
size are eligible under the EF, even localities with over 20.000 people (though in the scoring grid
the largest number of points is granted to localities with fewer than 3.000 people). Moreover,
there is only one specific mention of Regional Master Plans in the Water and Wastewater in the
evaluation and selection grid, with projects conforming to the predefined strategy eligible to
receive a maximum score of 5 points under the “project relevance” category. This is clearly not
an absolute requirement – i.e., even investments that are not included in the Master Plans can
be eligible for financing from the EF.

259. The crux of the issue – not just for the EF, but for the entire sector – relates to the
accuracy and use of priority lists defined in the Regional Water and Wastewater Master Plans.
If these were properly developed and fully respected in practice, investment needs would be
covered one by one, from whatever funding source possible, in the set order of priority. But less
rigid rules under the PNDL and the Environment Fund have allowed certain local authorities to
obtain funds ahead of higher-priority localities. Why was this possible? One line of argument
expressed in interviews at the local level is that Master Plans were not properly developed;
certain draft versions prepared for 2014-2020, with some counties vastly expanding clusters to
include all or nearly all localities, raises concerns regarding the accuracy of these analyses. If one
allows that the assessment behind the Master Plans is flawed, then it may make sense to not
always follow the priority order established therein. Another line of argument is that small
localities that can afford water/wastewater systems but are not eligible for EU funds (i.e., they
are under the threshold of 50 people and 2,000 p.e. respectively) should not have to wait until
their turn is up many years down the line. Political pressures also come into play and there are
certainly some mayors of smaller communes who successfully attract state-budget funding for
their projects despite questionable feasibility in the long run.

260. In practice, there are plenty of examples of unsustainable investments in water and
wastewater, precisely because of this issue of lack of coordination. In one commune in the
West region, the mayor applied for PNDL financing and completed a wastewater treatment
plant for a village of fewer than 700 people that was lacking industrial activity. Now the system
is at risk of breaking down due to underuse (i.e., there is simply not enough demand for the
service, which makes the systems run under capacity, at high cost and at high risk of needing
repairs). Not only are there not enough people in some of these communities, but connection

rates are often below expectations – residents are simply not used to paying for water and
sanitation services, so they either do not connect or choose to disconnect after the first few bills
come in. Sector experts note that there are technical solutions for small localities, but clearly
these are not adopted everywhere.

261. If local authorities had proper information about costs and benefits, they may think
twice about investments that can become unsustainable. Even if they do finally receive the
funds to complete an investment, they then have to operate the service because Regional
Operators will often refuse to take over unprofitable systems. This can put a heavy burden on
the local budget, which is usually insufficient anyway, particularly in smaller rural localities. The
next chapter offers some recommendations for how suboptimal, unsustainable investments can
be avoided in the future.


Social Infrastructure
262. The same pattern as for the other two sectors holds in this case: correlation among EU
funds happens at the programming phase, while state-budget-funds likely show severe gaps in
coordination. Regarding the former, complementarities also emerge from the different sources
of EU funding (i.e., ERDF vs. ESF vs. EARDF). For health infrastructure, investments under the
PNDR go hand in hand with proposals under the ERDF tackling construction, rehabilitation, and
modernization of health services infrastructure in rural areas (such as outpatient and integrated
intervention center). They also supplement projects pertaining to development of human capital
aimed at improving the capacity of the health system funded through the ESF. For education,
PNDR projects targeting modernization and endowment of secondary education institutions
with an agricultural profile and development of early childhood and preschool facilities are
complemented by investments through the ROP in urban early-childhood and university
education infrastructure, urban and rural preschool and school facilities, and vocational schools
in urban and rural areas (except for dedicated agricultural profile facilities in rural areas). Finally,
the cultural heritage projects in rural areas under the PNDR are correlated with investments
under the ROP (financed from the ERDF). The ROP-funded projects target the UNESCO heritage,
national heritage monuments of national importance in rural and urban areas (Class A), and
cultural heritage monuments of local importance in urban areas (Class B). The ROP covers only
cultural heritage monuments of local importance in rural areas (Class B).

263. With respect to state-budget-funded programs, publicly available information is very
sparse and there is no evidence that they are coordinating their actions amongst each other or
with EU structural instruments. It is unclear what criteria justify the selection of particular
investments through state-budget-funded programs, whether targeted projects are eligible for
EU funds and applicants have first tried to attract grant funding, or whether there is a clear
strategy underpinning all these instruments. While it is logical and expected for central-level
ministries to want to supplement from their annual budgets the insufficient local/county
allocations for investments in social infrastructure, the entire process should be transparent,
fair, predictable, and effectively coordinated with similar investment programs.

264. All in all, as noted under the previous section on vertical coordination, the social
infrastructure sector poses special challenges, primarily related to the ownership status and
relatively smaller size of investments. Local and county authorities own most of the social


                                                                                                   139
infrastructure in their respective jurisdiction. Under the law, they can in principle invest
whatever resources they have and can attract for assets they seek to develop or rehabilitate,
without formally coordinating with higher-level sectoral strategies for health, education, culture,
and youth and sports. Particularly in larger cities with more generous shares of own revenues in
their budgets, such social infrastructure does often get rehabilitated/developed only with
local/county funding. In such instances, there is nothing stopping a subnational government
from carrying out a planned investment, even if it may not correlate with higher-level goals. In
theory, the situation changes when the financing has to come from an EU fund or from a
national program. Particularly for structural instruments, investments need to abide by certain
criteria. A simple example concerns the rehabilitation of a school in a commune with very few
children left (Romania’s negative de mographic trends are well known, so this is based on a true
story). The mayor may be free to do it on her own budget, but not if she wants to attract EU
grants or central-level financing – in that case, conditionalities should apply to ensure proper
coordination.



4.2 Inter-Sectoral Coordination
265. In principle, effective inter-sectoral coordination is much harder to achieve than intra-
sectoral coordination. The main task at hand is not duplication of funding, since by definition
this particular type of coordination involves multiple players or a single player (e.g., a City Hall)
and multiple investment programs across different sectors. The desirable outcome is to: (i)
ensure that a project in one area does not impede the development of a project in another area
(e.g., delays in rehabilitating a road hinder access to a newly built regional hospital); and (ii)
design projects in an integrated manner so that investments enhance each other’s impact (e.g.,
a medieval monastery is rehabilitated, a new tourist information center is built nearby, the road
connecting them is modernized, and there is also a new wastewater system for nearby inns to
accommodate tourists). If stakeholders within a single sector do not communicate much,
despite sharing the same goals and interests, and sometimes even the same headquarters, it is
that much harder to promote collaboration across sectors, where opportunities to collaborate
are, by default, harder and more limited.

266. This section explores the current status and mechanisms of inter-sectoral coordination
of infrastructure works in Romania, at three levels: national, regional, and county/local. The
national level cross-sectoral coordination would need to happen at the Center of Government –
in Romania’s case, through the General Secre tariat of the Government (SGG). At the next level,
Regional Development Agencies are responsible for developing Regional Development Plans
(RDPs), which are supposed to guide development within a particular region. Last but not least,
most of the coordination of actual infrastructure projects needs to happen at the local level –
i.e., through county and local councils. These actors have visibility into what is happening in
their jurisdiction, they know the actual needs on the ground, and they can deploy mechanisms
to fulfill such needs. It is both easier and harder to coordinate at the local level: easier because
there is a single entity that manages the various investments across sectors; and harder because
local authorities often lack the capacity for effectively coordinating projects in their portfolio
and, moreover, still depend on higher-level authorities for various approvals. The figure below
summarizes the main dimensions of this approach, and the next sections discuss each of these
levels in depth.

4.2.1 National Level

Strategies and Plans
267. With respect to national-level strategies in different sectors, there is no systematic
effort to coordinate them in terms of objectives or action steps, and there are no common
standards for developing and implementing them. In principle, the National Spatial Plan (PATN)
– managed by the MRDPA – should ensure territorial coordination at a basic level, though some
of its sections are still pending, including on education and rural development, while others
appear to be outdated (e.g., on water, which dates from 1997). 70 The deeper issue is that there
are too many national sectoral and cross-sectoral strategies in Romania, without clear links
between them. In fact, there is no centralized inventory of all strategies available, their status
(e.g., drafted, approved, outdated, etc.), or their practical applicability. Such documents also
usually lack clear priorities, and policy and cost implications, so it is hard to decide on budgetary
allocations across sectors or to develop lists of projects to be financed within a given time
horizon (usually one year, given Romania’s annual budgetary framework). Such documents
remain at the level of wish lists and continuity from one government to the next is quite rare,

                                                                                                      141
unless the set goals are part of Romania’s international commitments. At the same time,
coordination is particularly challenging because there are both EU and national-level
requirements, and these may not always align properly.

268. A 2015 report prepared for the Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Romania provides
an informative diagnostic of the current framework for establishing cross-sectoral priorities. 71
The key instrument should be the Fiscal and Budgetary Strategy, which covers three years and
serves to describe the government’s policy priorities. But this too remains an instrument with
serious gaps in terms of its practical use, largely because the inputs that go into it are not
properly collected, assessed, and prioritized. In the words of the aforementioned report, “[there
is] an absence of a political decision-making process to reconcile the multiplicity of policy
demands from high-level strategies and EU-driven commitments.”72 While policy demands are
many from all sectors, actual costing of such needs is very rare. The Ministry of Finance is thus in
a position of surveying ministries every year regarding their investment needs and other funds
they may require, but there is no transparent, consultative process for deciding which sectors
and investment projects are a priority.

269. For all the reasons covered above, Romania currently lacks mechanisms to ensure the
national-level coordination of investment strategies across different sectors. There is no
institution explicitly mandated to review all available strategies and decide how they “fit”
together and what their policy and budgetary implications are. Equally important, there are no
monitoring and evaluation procedures for the strategies developed to decide on whether they
are needed, whether they are appropriate, and whether their goals are fulfilled. This is partly
because there is no independent actor explicitly assigned to do this and held accountable for it.
That said, even if someone was put in charge with monitoring and evaluating strategies, it would
be an impossible task in the absence of strategies with clear targets and performance indicators,
and effective data reporting – otherwise, how would one measure what cannot and is not
measured? The next chapter proposes some measures to address these gaps, though it should
be noted that many of these proposals hinge on action by the Center of Government. The
MRDPA can only do so much to promote nation-wide, cross-sectoral coordination.

Investment Programs
270. The following table summarizes the main priority axes and eligible investments under
each of the key EU and state-budget-funded programs reviewed as part of this final report.
Two straightforward conclusions can be drawn by looking at this snapshot: (1) EU funds are
defined in a complementary manner, with a conscious effort to coordinate interventions; (2)
state-budget-funded programs make no attempt to coordinate among themselves and with
other EU instruments, but rather finance a long list of investments, causing significant overlaps
with other programs. As noted in the previous chapter, this creates a competitive dynamic
among funds, with state-budget-funded instruments typically crowding out EU investments
because they finance the same types of interventions under more flexible rules and monitoring.

271. Before focusing on the current gaps between EU and state-funded programs, it is
useful to first review what works well: i.e., the key elements that ensure a coordinated
planning and implementation process among EU structural instruments only :
        A purposeful focus on coordination from the beginning: The EC has recognized from the
         start that it needs to ensure complementarity among funds and integrated investments.
                o Explicit requirements: Each Member State is required to explain how it will
                    ensure complementarities across structural funds. Specifically, each
                    Partnership Agreement (PA) has a dedicated section on the topic of
                    coordination. The Romanian PA clearly notes: “The complementarities
                    identified among European Structural and Investment Funds require an
                    effective coordination during the planning and implementation of the ESI
                    Funds in order to avoid the overlaps between actions.”73
                  o Dedicated instruments: One way to accomplish coordination in the 2014-2020
                    programming period was to devise two instruments that would essentially
                    give potential beneficiaries the necessary tools to ensure coordination on
                    their own. The Integrated Territorial Investment (ITI) and the Community-Led
                    Local Development (CLLD) tools allow local authorities and other eligible
                    actors to design their own integrated interventions from the beginning,
                    drawing from multiple sources of EU funding to fulfill their projects’
                    objectives.

        A predictable and stable timeline : The seven year programming cycle (e.g., 2007-2013,
         2014-2020) maintains the same strategic objectives, planning documents, and
         implementation procedures throughout. Even if political power alternates between
         different parties within that timeframe, no changes occur to the EU operational
         programmes, once these are agreed in the beginning between a national government
         and the EC.

        A common legal and procedural framework: This is ensured by the Common Provisions
         Regulation No. 1303/2013, which describes how to all 5 European Structural and
         Investment Funds (ESIF) are to be designed, implemented, and monitored and
         evaluated. Common regulations were adopted in order to: establish a clear link with the
         Europe 2020 strategy (i.e., ensure coordination between the overall strategy and the
         financing instruments designed to accomplish it); improve coordination; ensure
         consistent implementation; and make access to the funds as straightforward as possible
         for those who may benefit from them. 74

        Systems to ensure information flows: Partly due to the need to report consistently and
          periodically to the EC regarding the results of ESIF implementation, there is a functional
          system for collecting and reviewing information on projects at all phases (applied,
          approved/selected, contracted, implemented, and completed). The database for all EU-
          funded interventions in Romania is the Single Management Information System (SMIS).
          SMIS includes a set of six subsystems: programming (information of NSRF); project

        management (main data on projects, including contracts); monitoring (progress against
        targets); audit and control (main audit findings and reports); and funds flow
        management (payment forecast, project revenues, etc.). The much expected upgrade
        to mySMIS, which will allow direct user (applicant/beneficiary) inputs, is slated to be
        introduced for the 2014-2020 programming period. 75

      Institutional mechanisms for coordination:
               o The planning of the 2014-2020 programming period was done in a joint
                  manner through the Interinstitutional Committee for the Partnership
                  Agreement (CIAP). The CIPA brought together all stakeholders involved in the
                  ESIF framework in Romania: public authorities at all levels, intermediate
                  bodies (including Regional Development Agencies), civil society groups, and
                  private sector representatives.
               o As for the implementation phase, there are clear coordination mechanisms
                 set through the Romania-EU Partnership Agreement. The document notes:
                 “Based on the lessons learned in 2007-2013 and the new challenges raised by
                 the ESI Funds architecture in Romania, a coordination mechanism with
                 structures on three levels (strategic committee, thematic inter-institutional,
                 operational), will be set up in order to ensure the coherence of the
                 interventions, complementarities and synergies in the programming and
                 implementation stages.” 76 These mechanisms are not operational as of
                 February 2015, but they are set to begin functioning as soon as the
                 operational programs are set up and approved.
               o The first level is the Management of the Partnership Agreement Steering
                 Committee (MPASC), including all line ministries responsible for ESIF
                 implementation. The MPASC will meet twice a year during the 2014-2020
                 programming period and it is supposed to ensure the coordination of ESIF
                 programs. The PA does note that the MPASC “will have a key role in ensuring
                 the coherence with other Union’s policy instruments and [at] the same time
                 with the Romanian national investments programs.” 77 Unlike in the Polish
                 PA, 78 there are no further details on what such coordination should or could
                 entail.

               o The second level includes five thematic steering sub-committees (TSC), under
                 the coordination of the Ministry of European Funds (Directorate General for
                 Analysis, Programming, and Evaluation) – including one for “Developing
                 modern infrastructure for growth and jobs.” This would likely cover all three
                 main sectors discussed in this report, i.e., roads, water and wastewater, and

75
   There are also a number of shortcomings to the SMIS system, including lack of automated reporting,
lack of continuous updating and assistance, misalignment with some MA requirements, etc. For an
extensive discussion of these gaps, see the report on “ROP 2.0: MA-IB Collaboration for the Regional
Operational Programme, 2014-2 020,” World Bank, 2014.

                     social infrastructure. The TSC would include line ministries, Managing
                     Authorities, Ministry of Public Finance and IFI representatives, etc. These
                     would meet twice per year and operate through a secretary under the
                     Ministry of European Funds. Among their tasks is precisely to: “ensure
                     complementarity and [an] integrated approach among ESI funds […] [and]
                     ensure coherence with other EU and national instruments.”79 This sub-
                     committee would further report to the MPASC. As of February 2015, the MEF
                     is in the process of drafting the TSC’s bylaw s.
                  o The third level includes four functional working groups, also under the MEF,
                    on various specific areas of interest: operations (including simplification, data
                    exchange, public procurement, etc.); performance assessment; territorial
                    coherence, including European territorial cooperation; and new approaches
                    (including ITI, CLLD, etc.).
                  o On a different but related note, coordination of EU-funded instruments is also
                    enabled by Intermediate Bodies specifically appointed to provide a link
                    between program applicants and beneficiaries (e.g., local authorities) and
                    central-level Managing Authorities. In the case of the Regional Operational
                    Programme, Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) have performed well as
                    IBs, often ensuring coordination by getting applicants/beneficiaries to talk to
                    each other and design/implement projects in an integrated manner. The
                    World Bank report on “ROP 2.0: MA-IB Collaboration and Communication for
                    the ROP 2014-2020” discusses in depth the advantages of relying on RDAs as
                    IBs. For example, RDAs are public utility NGOs with much more flexible human
                    capital policies, which allow them to recruit and retain talent more easily. IBs
                    allow Managing Authorities to focus on really critical, strategic tasks by taking
                    on the burden of more mundane operational activities.

In short, coordination among EU-funded programs, although far from perfect, has a number of
ley strengths: it is clearly defined as an objective; benefits from relatively effective information
flows; relies on common procedures; and leverages institutional fora for collaboration.

272. Very few, if any, of such good practices are present when it comes to national
programs funded 100% from the state budget. There is no conscious effort to coordinate such
interventions, which is evident from the way they are planned through implementation and
post-implementation. There are no standards for how to develop an infrastructure investment
program. In the past, ministries have taken the liberty to propose such instruments through
more or less elaborate government ordinances, some with criteria for allocating funding, and
others without. Compared to EU-funded instruments:
     There is no mandate to coordinate across infrastructure projects, in none of the national
        cross-sectoral strategies (e.g., Governing Program, the Territorial Development Strategy,
        the Fiscal Budgetary Strategy, etc.).
          The programming and implementation timeline is annual. There is a high level of
           unpredictability from one year to the next. Usually the list of financed projects is

                                                                                                 151
        adopted every year through a Minister’s order, as in the case of the PNDL. Priorities may
        change without warning along with political changes.
       There are no common procedures across programs for approving, selecting, and
        implementing projects. There are no monitoring and evaluation systems, and there is no
        independent stakeholder charged with looking at how these programs are performing.
       There are no IT systems for collecting, reviewing, and reporting information of state-
        budget-funded investments. Each ministry has its own database and, even within a
        single ministry units do not have interoperable systems. This is the case with the PNDL
        and the ROP, managed by two different Directorate Generals in the MRDPA. There is no
        systematic data exchange between the two programs, despite the fact that they both
        finance county roads and social infrastructure.
       There are no formal institutional mechanisms for ensuring coordination across
        investment programs, and there are no “intermediate bodies” for such instruments to
        ensure enhanced support for applicants/beneficiaries.


Infrastructure Projects
273. Established through GD 150/2010, the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Approval of
Public Works of National Interest and Housing is responsible for analyzing and approving the
technical documentations for public investments larger than RON 30 million. The committee
comprises representatives from several ministries, including the MRDPA, Public Finances,
Transportation, and Economy. The head of the committee is the Minister of Regional
Development and Public Administration (MRDPA), while vice-presidents are the ministers of
Transportation and of Public Finances. The secretariat sits with the MDRPA. The committee
meets every month or whenever necessary. In 2014, it went through 27 proposals, most of them
submitted by local authorities.

274. The committee assesses the projects whose “beneficiaries ” are the central
government, county, and local authorities, and is interested primarily in whether a proposal is
“complete” – i.e., it performs primarily a basic conformity and eligibility check. Projects may
include new investments, works in connection to existing investments, and interventions that
have already been approved by the Government or by local authorities with new technical-
economic indicators. The analysis is performed by consulting a number of documents, including
feasibility studies, the projects’ presentation, the design, the general estimate, the list of
economic indicators, the approval from the authority responsible for the implementation of the
project, and the memorandum for financing, if applicable. Sometimes the committee may
require additional documents and clarifications. The applicant may respond to clarifications and
keep bringing additional documents until the committee eventually gets all information needed
in order to sit down and approve the project. Usually, the project analysis takes two business
days. The committee has never actually rejected a project proposal.

275. It is important to note that the role of the committee is inherently limited by two
factors: its low capacity; and the relatively advanced stage of the projects presented. The
committee does not have any permanent, full-time staff members; it “shares” the time of
technical experts with the ministries that hire them. It does not have the capacity to assess the



                                                                                             152
substance of technical documentations submitted – for example, to question the results of a
cost-benefit analysis would require a lot of time and resources. Similarly, the committee could
not ensure the policy-level coordination of proposed projects, i.e., to check whether they are in
line with certain strategies, whether they may be financed through different funding sources,
such as EU money, or how they could complement each other. Even if the committee had the
required capacity for a full technical and financial evaluation, by the time the projects are
submitted, it is in many ways too late to make substantial changes to them. The committee is
the last decision-level body before the projects are approved by the Government and move to
implementation. All projects that reach the committee’s desk have been already endorsed by
the authorities responsible for the implementation, and more importantly, they have already
been assigned the necessary funding. Where the committee adds value is in bringing together
various ministries and enabling them to cooperate in issuing permits and in sharing information
about proposed investments. For instance, a road may require joint action by the MRDPA, the
Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Finance, etc.

276. Last but not least, the committee does not have a clearly defined, independent role
and mandate beyond its members’ individual decisions. Put differently, the committee’s
endorsement is required for all investment projects over RON 30 million, but this does not
substitute individual endorsements by each of the ministries represented on the committee.
This is a typical example of organizations unwilling to give up decision-making power in favor of
a collective body, which is not singular to the Romanian case, but points to the challenges of
making coordination work in the absence of a solid foundation based on trust and ownership
among different public institutions.

277. Recognizing the need to engage more substantially in evaluating large public projects,
the Romanian Government promoted GEO 88/2013 regarding the prioritization of major
investments (of over 100 million RON).80 This legal provision established within the Ministry of
Public Finance a new Unit for Evaluating Public Investments (Unitatea de Evaluare a Invest ițiilor
Publice – UEIP), responsible for assessing annual proposals for major investments by line
ministries. According to GEO 88/2013, the unit should act like a secretariat for the MFP in
prioritizing public investments larger than RON 100 million. The unit is responsible for assessing
the pre-feasibility studies or background notes corresponding to the projects in order to analyze
their suitability. If the proposal passes this preliminary evaluation, then the authorities
responsible for the implementation of the project can move to the feasibility study. In practice,
pre-feasibility studies are rarely used, while background notes tend to be superficial and poorly
argued (there are no standard forms and they usually justify why the feasibility study is needed,
rather than the investment itself).

278. After the feasibility study is approved, the ministries must evaluate the project with
regard to its relevance, its economic, social, environmental impact, and credible management
engagements. The evaluation is sent to the UEIP for the final assessment. However, the unit
cannot perform a proper evaluation as it does not receive the full cost-benefit analysis, but only
the final result of such analyses – obviously, all submitted projects pass the test. As a result, the
unit current cannot actually decide on investment priorities, as its role is more to confirm the list
of priorities prepared by the ministries and main release credit authorities. The unit should

                                                                                                 153
provide inputs and finalize a cross-sectoral list of priority investments, which should be
approved through a formal memorandum. The idea behind this is that the list would provide
more stability and predictability from year to year regarding the government’s top infrastructure
objectives. In practice, however, there is nothing stopping ministries from submitting markedly
different lists of priorities every year. Again, the UEIP cannot – and probably should not –
intervene in sectoral prioritization of projects, but its task of combining priorities into a single
list, based on the set of agreed criteria, becomes less effective if sectoral lists received from line
ministries can change every year.

279. Equally important, it is unclear what happens to new vs. ongoing projects featured on
the priority lists (i.e., can/should a new project enter the list before an ongoing project
previously identified as a priority is completed?). It is important that the priorities remain the
same for a certain period of time and not change every year. For example, if a project was
tagged as a priority investment, it should remain as such until its implementation is completed.
To this end, the UEIP should have the leverage to approve new proposals sent by the ministries
only after existing investments are carried out. If implementation of existing investments is still
pending, then the unit should reject proposals for new interventions, within budgetary
constraints. Otherwise, Romania will continue to accumulate a very significant backlog of
ongoing investments, many of them in the very early phases of development and, given budget
limitations, with very slim chances of being completed in a reasonable timeline.

280. To conclude, the UEIP has faced significant challenges since its establishment. If it had
stronger capacity and if the legislation was made clearer, the unit could truly play a critical role
in the coordination of national-level (major) investments. In this context, “coordination” refers
primarily to: prioritizing investments based on a set of criteria; 81 and proper sequencing of these
priority investments, including ensuring that commitments are followed through every year and
from year to year. Beyond this, the UEIP should not be expected to coordinate the projects at
the level of policies – i.e., decide to finance a major research center and the road connecting it
to Bucharest. This would exceed both the capacity and the mandate of the unit. Indeed, it
makes sense for the prioritization exercise to be carried out by each line ministry (with support
from the UEIP in validating the order of priorities based on applying the criteria in GEO 88/2013
and GD 225/2104), and the cross-sectoral prioritization to be done at the level of the Center of
Government (Prime Minister’s Chancellery), in line with the high-level political commitments.


4.2.2 Regional level
281. As noted before, Romania does not have formal administrative regions, which
severely limits opportunities for coordination at the regional level, i.e., across counties.
Romania’s current eight regions are for planning and statistical purposes only, so various
workarounds have had to be found to deliver truly regional impact. The aforementioned
example of the Regional Operational Programme 2014-2020 asking potential beneficiaries
(counties) to design and apply with road projects that are regional in scope is a telling one. But
what are the current regional mechanisms that could lie at the foundation of improved
coordination? Do they fulfil their current mission and could they do more?


81
     See Annex D


                                                                                                  154
282. In principle, two positive things can happen at the regional level when it comes to
coordination of infrastructure investments. First, a coherent and inclusive planning process can
bring stakeholders at the same table and help them design and implement joint projects, i.e.,
across multiple jurisdictions. This is easier said than done, particularly when it comes to the level
of communes, which are many and hard to coordinate. Second, regional institutions can serve as
applicant/beneficiary support mechanisms, including for deciding on which projects are
appropriate for which funds (e.g., ROP vs. PNDL, PNDR vs. PNDL, etc.), and generally serving as
de facto and/or de jure Intermediate Bodies for various EU and state-budget-funded investment
programs.

283. Regional Development Agencies (RDAs). 82 Law 151/1998 granted RDAs non-profit,
public-utility status as regional technical bodies in charge of territorial programming.
Specifically, RDAs are responsible for developing Regional Development Plans (RDPs) and also
serve as Intermediate Bodies (IBs) for the Regional Operational Programme (ROP). The following
sections discuss the two attributes separately:
        Strategic planning function: As for the preparation of the 2007-2013 programming
         period, there are eight Regional Committees for Elaborating the RDPs (RCRs). They
         maintain consultative roles and are coordinated by the region’s respective RDA, bringing
         together a wide range of stakeholders, including key future beneficiaries. As before,
         each RCR and RDP draws from the work of several working groups (WGs) at the level of
         each region. RDAs organize debates and consultations on RDPs, request inputs from
         local authorities, and often elaborate very strong regional documents. But, again,
         because the regional level is missing in Romania’s administrative structure RDPs remain
         toothless documents: there are no special sanctions for failing to accomplish their goals,
         and there are no special rewards for fulfilling them. Additionally, as the 2013 World
         Bank report on Enhanced Spatial Planning points out: “The RDPs are insular in their
         approach, as they are specifically designed for the accession of structural funds. Even
         when the plans themselves go beyond the scope of what can be funded through the
         ROP there is no administrative tier that could take such regional projects on.” 83
         Moreover, part of an RDA’s budget is supplied by local authorities in its region, so there
         is little leverage that an Agency can exert over local/county councils. To ensure proper
         coordination, the RDPs would obviously need to cover both EU and state-budget-funded
         programs and rely on a viable mechanism for holding stakeholders accountable for the
         progress toward the implementation of RDPs.

          Investment program design and implementation: The RDAs have fulfilled the role of
           Intermediate Bodies (IBs) for the ROP based on a contract with the MA ROP since 2007,
           and they are bound to continue serving in this capacity at least through 2020. As such,
           they play a key role in both the planning of the ROP and in its implementation. The
           World Bank report “ROP 2.0: MA-IB Collaboration and Communication for the Regional
           Operational Programme 2014-2020” includes an in-depth analyses of RDA functions,
           particularly in relationship to supporting program applicants and beneficiaries. RDAs
           also help out with the administrative conformity and eligibility check of ROP projects, as
           well as with monitoring and evaluating the program’s progress and results. If RDAs can
           try to help coordinate ROP investments, they are powerless with respect to state-
           budget-funded programs like the PNDL. Another shortcoming is that they focus mainly
           on urban settlements and do not have a strong presence in rural areas targeted by
           programs like the PNDL.

284. Regional Development Councils (RDCs). RDCs function as a partnership between
authorities at different levels within a region (county, city, communes). The RDC’s mandate, as
defined by law 315/2004, 84 covers precisely the coordination of regional development policies
and programs, both those funded from EU sources and those financed through the state budget.
In relation to the ROP, the RDC of each region oversees the RDA’s activities, making sure that all
counties within a region receive a fair and equal treatment. The RDC funds parts of RDAs’
budgets through the county budgets. Its membership includes the presidents of counties in each
region and three representatives of local administrations in the county (one for each level of
local councils – municipalities or major cities, towns, and communes). The RDC is led by a
president and vice-president, positions that rotate among counties in a particular region, and its
secretariat is provided by the RDA.

285. The other significant player at the regional level was the Regional Committee for
Strategic Evaluation and Correlation (RCSEC), which had a key role in prioritizing investment
projects to be financed through the ROP. The RCSEC was established through Government
Decision 764/2007 and was mandated: (a) to assess how proposed projects fulfilled needs at the
regional level; and (b) to prioritize strategic projects at the level of the eight development
regions. The RCSEC membership included four representatives of each county in a particular
region, two from the local public administration and two from civil society organizations in the
socio-economic sphere. In principle, the RCSEC had an important mission in terms of aligning
ROP investments with regional needs, but in practice this system generated significant delays
and a range of other issues (e.g., lack of transparency regarding prioritization criteria; potential
conflict of interest between local authorities as RCSEC members and potential ROP
beneficiaries; duplication of evaluation criteria, etc.). 85 As a result, Government Decision
1383/2008 revised the RCSEC’s role, limiting its attributions to recommendations and purely
consultative opinions on regional investments. Based on field research observations, the RCSEC
has stopped functioning de facto, as its decisions no longer have an impact on decisions related
to ROP investments.


4.2.3 Local level
286. When it comes to infrastructure investments in roads, water and wastewater, and
social infrastructure, most of the required coordination efforts need to happen at the local
level – in county councils and town halls across Romania. This is because these are the
institutions that plan, implement, and complete public investments for the benefits of their
communities. It is at the local level where one finds the highest infrastructure density and, as
such, the highest need for inter-sectoral coordination. County and local councils must therefore
bear the burden of coordinating infrastructure projects both within their own institution and
with other stakeholders. The challenge is both easier and harder than for other levels: easier,
because there is often a single applicant/beneficiary/implementing entity – i.e., the county
council for counties and the local council for cities, towns, and communes; harder, because this
level struggles with specific capacity limitations at the level of human resources required for
effective coordination.

Strategies and Plans
287. With respect to strategies and plans, local authorities have a number of tools at their
disposal to ensure an integrated process. First, the key document for territorial coordination is
the General Urban Plan (PUG), defined in Law 350/2001 on Spatial and Urban Planning. Article
44 of this act notes that “Planning documents transpose at the level of urban and ru ral localities
the proposals contained in national, regional, and county spatial plans.” 86 In other words, this
local-level plan needs to coordinate closely with higher-level plans and reflect their priorities.
Territorial coordination is indeed critical to avoid spatial conflicts when projects are
implemented. For example, in Cluj, plans were made for the extension of the Regional Airport
runway (to be implemented by the County Council) and for developing a northern bypass for the

                                                                                                157
city (to be implemented by CNADNR). Unfortunately, the two plans were not properly
coordinated and authorities found themselves in a situation where the proposed bypass was
running through the airport extension. The World Bank report on Enhanced Spatial Planning
cautions that “the correlation between plans is made hard because of poor sequencing (i.e.,
lower- level plans are drafted before higher-level ones), because of the difficulty of referencing
higher-level plans (county spatial plans in particular tend to include a long list of data and
information, which are often irrelevant), and because of the variation in quality of different
plans.”87 It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss the correlation of plans among local,
county, regional, and national levels; this was the topic of the aforementioned World Bank
report, which includes a number of key recommendations on how to improve the status quo.

288. In parallel, county and local authorities author development strategies for their
communities, oriented to assessing needs and proposing projects to address them. The Bank
team has completed an extensive analysis of county-level strategies for all counties in Romania;
the results are synthesized in Annex C and include a description of coordination mechanisms
stipulated by each county authority. In general, the following observations hold in reference to
county development strategies:
     There is no clear single standard for developing such documents, which means that
        some counties’ strategies are lacking key sections (in the case of Car aș Severin, the
        strategy lacks a list of proposed projects, indicative budget, an action plan with a
        timeline, etc.).
        There is no set list of documents that these county strategies should take into account.
         Some of them correlate only with Europe 2020; ot hers (as in Argeș or in Bistrița Năsăud)
         draw from a much wider set of strategic documents.
        There is no standard approach regarding the list of projects included, sources of
         financing, and the monitoring and evaluation of the strategies’ implementation. So me
         counties define new bodies (Working Groups) to monitor and coordinate actions
         defined in the strategy, while others make no mention of such mechanisms.
        Most strategies include long lists of projects without any anchoring in realistic budget
         limitations and without a discussion of potential financing sources. Without budgets it is
         hard to prioritize, and without prioritization it is hard to coordinate.

289. The main gaps encountered at the level of county strategies are also present in local
development strategies for cities, towns, and communes, though there are also a number of
good practices. For example, the Cluj-Napoca development strategy focuses predominantly on
integrated development, particularly with respect to infrastructure for transport and public
utilities. The Satu Mare strategy explicitly notes which projects should coordinate with other
interventions. 88 The Ploiesti development strategy for 2007-2025 features three integrated
projects, including a detailed timeline that shows when each intervention would be
implemented. 89 The development strategy for Piatra Neamț also features some integrated
interventions, including a project to increase quality of life in the Dărmănești neighborhood by

rehabilitating water and wastewater networks and modernizing public spaces (roads, sidewalks,
bike paths, etc.). Such good practice examples remain exceptions, unfortunately, in a context
dominated by local development strategies lacking clearly defined objectives, projects,
timelines, budgets and financing sources, and especially a prioritization of planned investments.

290. Finally, there are also Integrated Development Plans (IDPs) developed by certain
localities that have attracted EU funds during the 2007-2013 programming cycle. The idea
behind IDPs is precisely that cities face complex challenges that often require integrated
solutions and close coordination among a variety of sectors and even among jurisdictions (i.e.,
core cities and neighboring localities within metropolitan areas). As such, designing projects as
part of integrated whole – rather than as disparate interventions – can help deliver a more
significant impact. It is not always entirely clear how IDPs correlate with local development
strategies, and in some cases the two documents appear to be duplicative. Most IDPs appear to
have been developed solely to fulfill requirements for accessing EU funds and, as in the case of
development strategies, they do not include extensive data on budgetary constraints and
priority projects. A 2013 World Bank report on “Strategic IDPs Assessment” features a number
of detailed recommendations for improving these documents, including: (i) better sectoral
integration of projects as well as integration at territorial level; (ii) better use of evidence; (iii)
adoption of best practices in sustainable urban development; (iv) monitoring and evaluation
mechanisms; and (v) common guidelines and methodologies.


Investment Programs
291. The PNDR 2007-2013, through Measure 322, encouraged integrated projects, offering
both a higher score and more funding to such investments. Thus, the vast majority of projects
submitted for funding under Measure 322 include at least two types of investments, often
more. For example, 159 out of a total of 802 projects include roads, water, wastewater, a nd
social infrastructure. The rest are permutations of these four types of investments. There are
only 77 projects that focus only on a single sector – all of these are road development projects.
Out of 623 PNDR road projects, 311 also included a water and/or wastewater project. Of these
311 projects, 204 were integrated projects that included all three types of investments. As the
map below indicates, localities in some counties (e.g., Caraș-Severin, Vaslui, Neamț, Bistrița -
Năsăud) have been more proactive in obtaining funding for integrated PNDR projects.

292. In the case of the PNDL, since there is no higher score offered for integrated projects,
such interventions are rare. Although the number of projects financed under PNDL is 3 times
higher than the number of projects financed under PNDR (around 2,400 as opposed to around
800), there are relatively few integrated projects. Moreover, there are even fewer projects that
cover roads, water, and wastewater investments. The vast majority of integrated investments
are roads-water projects.

293. It is worth noting, however, that the Managing Authority for the PNDR will likely not
use the integrated approach for the 2014-2020 Programming Period. An analysis of the
programme’s performance has revealed that the implementat ion of integrated projects has
been much delayed by cumbersome public procurement procedures and the need to sequence
investments. Thus, road rehabilitation work could not start until the water and/or wastewater



                                                                                                  159
project was finished. This meant, however, that delays in the implementation of the
water/wastewater project would translate into delays for the roads project.

294. With respect to the coordination between programs, there is no purposeful attempt
for joint planning between the PNDL and PNDR. For one, the former makes no provisions for
coordination with other operational programs. As the maps below show, there are relatively few
localities where road projects under one program were doubled by water and/or wastewater
projects under the other program.

295. Neither PNDL nor PNDR make a specific mention for cross-program/cross-sectoral
coordination. As such, there are few instances where integrated projects have been started
with allocations from multiple funds. Even where there seems to be an overlap, it is not clear
whether projects are in fact coordinated (e.g., water and wastewater funded from one program,
and the rehabilitation of the road funded from another program), or they represent investments
done within a commune but in different villages. Given that the PNDR provides the opportunity
for an integrated approach, it is more likely that there are few overlaps and actual coordination
exists between PNDL and PNDR. It is also true that in practice such harmonization efforts
happen purely on an ad-hoc basis, as there are no institutional mechanisms for identifying and
leveraging synergies across programs and across sectors.

296. One may hypothesize about indirect coordination between PNDL and PNDR given the
relatively few overlaps. More specifically, one could say that one program fulfills needs that the
other program did not manage to cover. In fact, interviews with beneficiaries of both programs
indicate that local authorities are quite astute at accessing different pots of money, although
some seem to have a preference for PNDL, while others choose the PNDR. PNDL requires less
bureaucracy and funds are transferred much faster, but projects implemented under this
program are usually smaller than PNDR projects because funding is only guaranteed for one year
at a time. Conversely, local authorities can implement larger and more complex projects under
PNDR, which comes with predictable year-to-year funding, but they have to go through more
cumbersome bureaucratic procedures. Also, beneficiaries have indicated that PNDR
reimbursements of expenses may sometimes take a long time.


Infrastructure Projects
297. Individual projects offer many opportunities for coordination, with two goals in mind:
(i) avoid inefficient overlaps resulting from sequence of investments (e.g., roads rebuilt before
water/wastewater networks); and (ii) leverage synergies across projects. Achieving the latter
goal will depend on conditions specific to each situation at hand. In general, if the planning and
strategic documents are properly developed, local authorities that have the best interests of
communities at heart will pursue interventions that reinforce and augment each other’s impact.
As for the first aforementioned goal – avoiding overlaps and properly sequencing investments –
local authorities again hold the key to proper coordination. According to the law, the Mayor
requests the development of technical-economic documentation (i.e., pre-feasibility and



                                                                                              162
feasibility studies) and also endorses the Zoning Permit and the Building Permit. In other words,
the Mayor does control to a great extent the timing of various planned investments.

298. Interviews with PNDL and PNDR beneficiaries also indicate that local authorities make
a concerted effort aimed at inter-sectoral coordination. For example, they noted that they
postponed the rehabilitation/modernization of communal roads until the water/wastewater
projects were finished. When road investments where finished first, local authorities usually left
enough room on the sides of the road for water and/or wastewater pipes (see image below).
The next chapter will present a summary of good practices in the coordination of investment
projects at the local level.

4.3 Diagnostic Conclusions
299. The current framework for coordinating infrastructure strategies, investment
programs, and projects in Romania is complex and features both strong points and gaps.
Before moving on to the next chapter on recommendations, it is useful to review the main
conclusions of this extensive diagnostic:

       Intra-Sectoral Coordination
             o Vertical coordination across administrative levels:
                    In general, the system for developing strategies with the involvement of
                       players at different levels (national, regional, and county/local) is
                       functional. There are finalized national strategies in most of the sectors
                       reviewed, and only in a few cases they are still pending. These strategies
                       are usually coordinated with supranational priorities.




                                                                                              163
                  Higher-level strategies do not always transpose goals effectively into
                   local/county projects, particularly in the roads and water/ wastewater
                   sector. This is because: (i) strategies are not clear enough, they keep
                   changing, or they are not yet finalized; and/or (ii) authorities who
                   develop projects do not take higher-level strategies into account, but
                   they still receive national funding (usually not EU funding) for their
                   projects.

       o Horizontal coordination across sectoral investment programs:
                  Particularly in sectors where there are many financing sources, there
                   tend to be overlaps and inefficiencies in the way state-budget-funded
                   investment programs target interventions. This can create negative
                   competitive dynamics among investment programs, and state-budget
                   funds may crowd out EU financing.
                  By contrast, EU structural funds are designed to be complementary – an
                   explicit requirement monitored by the EC.


   Inter-Sectoral Coordination
       o National level:
              Strategies: There is no systematic effort to coordinate strategies in
                terms of objectives or action steps, and there are no common standards
                for developing and implementing them. There is no institution explicitly
                mandated to review all available strategies and decide how they “fit”
                together and what their policy and budgetary implications are. Equally
                important, there are no monitoring and evaluation procedures for the
                strategies developed to decide on whether they are needed, whether
                they are appropriate, and whether their goals are fulfilled.
                  Investment programs: There are significant discrepancies in the
                   procedures applicable to state-budget-funded vs. EU-funded investment
                   programs, across the entire project cycle. State-budget-funded
                   programs lack transparency, predictability, and rigor in selecting
                   interventions.
                  Projects: Emerging national mechanisms for the coordination of large
                   projects are starting to function, but require strengthening (e.g.,
                   Evaluation Unit within Ministry of Public Finance).

       o Regional level:
             Romania does not have formal administrative regions.
                  Given their currently limited role, Regional Development Agencies and
                   Regional Development Councils perform well in terms of regional
                   planning and coordination of investments.
                  The effective planning for the ROP 2014-2020 (including strategic road
                   projects across counties) is a testimony to the fact that properly



                                                                                      164
           designed investment programs can leverage regional institutions for
           enhanced coordination of infrastructure investments.

o Local level:
          The bulk of the coordination effort across sectors happens at the local
           level. Here the main gap is related to the capacity of subnational
           governments to apply good practices in planning, implementing, and
           monitoring and evaluating their infrastructure investments. There are
           examples of positive coordination across the country, but there is no
           systematic effort to collect and disseminate lessons learned.
          Strategies: Spatial planning can be enhanced at the local level to ensure
           proper territorial coordination. Integrated Urban Development Plans
           (PIDUs) have been a positive development over 2007-2013. Some
           development strategies are very well developed, others less so;
           common standards are lacking.
          Investment Programs: Quantitative data do not reveal clear trends.
           Qualitative data from field visits suggests that local authorities do try to
           coordinate, ad hoc, across different financing sources. Few have
           strategic plans for leveraging specific funds for specific projects.
          Infrastructure Projects: Experiences with project-level coordination
           across sectors vary greatly. Some local authorities have developed their
           own procedures for ensuring a proper sequence of investments.

Chapter 5: Targeted Strategies and Specific Action Steps
for Enhanced Coordination of Infrastructure Investments
300. Taking into account the diagnostic above, this fin al chapter proposes a series of
targeted strategies and specific action steps for enhancing intra- and inter-sectoral
coordination of public infrastructure investments in Romania. In this endeavor, a basic
principle is “first, do no harm.” Over -engineered coordination measures entail the risks
described in the final section of Chapter 1, including excessive bureaucratization and an added
burden on beneficiaries, with no real value add. This is why this chapter prioritizes
recommendations that do not alter the current system substantially, but hold potential for
enhancing coordination. In a few instances, new mechanisms are proposed, with the cautionary
note that before they are launched they need to be thoroughly assessed. Related World Bank
work is referenced whenever possible and Annex B includes a collection of useful case studies
from 5 other EU Member States (Italy, Germany, Poland, Spain, and Sweden).

301. Before presenting the list of specific recommendations for improving the status quo, it
is useful to consider a scenario that involves a more significant departure from the current
framework: the consolidation of (most) budget-funded programs into EU structural funds. This
would be a relatively quick “fix” to current lack of coordination, particularly noticeable in the
discrepant approaches and procedures of EU vs. state-budget-funded programs. Specifically,
investment programs that are 100% financed from the state budget would redirect all funding
through EU-funded instruments. Romania’s overall contribution to structural instruments would
increase and co-financing rates will go up, but more projects would be covered by the EU-funds
framework. 90 This is not to say that the Romanian government would need to cut down its
current level of funding. But by choosing this “consolidation option” the government would
leverage a financing mechanism that is for the most part carefully planned, well-coordinated,
and rigorously implemented, monitored, and evaluated. The example of Poland is often cited as
featuring effective coordination, particularly in the implementation of EU funds. Indeed, the
country chose to channel the vast majority of its resources through EU structural instruments,
including for roads, water and wastewater, and social infrastructure.

302. The downside to following the Polish example and incorporating state-budget
programs under EU instruments would be that the government would then focus almost
entirely on EU-level policy priorities and corresponding proportions of funding allocations.
Consolidation would achieve coordination and even complementarity through the specific
mechanisms designed for EU funds (as shown earlier, programmatic documents describe how
instruments correlate with one another). This would come with a price, however, namely the
diminished ability of the Romanian government to fill in, as needed, the gaps resulting from how
EU funds address infrastructure needs. 91 Also, it is unclear what would happen with all the
investments that have been started under programs like the PNDL and cannot continue with EU

90
   This may require amendments to the Partnership Agreement. Exact implications need to be further
explored, though in principle there is nothing stopping a member state from channeling more of its own
funds through EU-funded instruments
91 In Romania, many local public authorities suggest in interviews that basic infrastructure needs should

take priority and receive even more funding than currently (compared to soft interventions).


                                                                                                     166
funding because they do not fit eligibility and/or selection criteria. Because this scenario, while
seemingly simple, is practically unlikely, this report will not dwell on it further beyond noting it
as an option for enhancing coordination. In the long term, when this possibility becomes
feasible and desirable in the context of ever-deeper European integration, “consolidation” of
investment programs under the EU ESIF framework would be a natural step forward toward
better and simpler coordination.

303. In the meantime, state-budget-funded programs have a critical role to play and can
truly contribute to Romania’s sustainable and inclusive growth, provided they are properly
coordinated with each other and with EU funds. In fact, the recent World Bank report on
“Improved Criteria for PNDL Projects,” developed under Component 2 of the current
engagement with the MRDPA, offers a simple answer to the question of whether a program like
the PNDL should exist: “yes.” As noted in the introduction to this report, Romania faces huge
needs in basic infrastructure, and the gaps cannot possibly be fulfilled only by EU funds – both
because they are insufficient and because they do not cover the wide range of infrastructure
needs at the local level. This chapter refers to the PNDL specifically most of the time, though the
same conclusions may generally apply to other state-budget-funded investment programs.
Whether in the driver’s seat or as an active supporter, the MRDPA can and should spearhead
the coordination of public infrastructure investments, both within and across sectors. The figure
below summarizes “the what,” “the how,” and “the why” of coordinating public infrastructure
investments in Romania.

5.1 Enabling Environment
304. There are four core principles of an enabling environment for effective coordination of
infrastructure investments: trust; accountability; capacity; and information sys tems. These
cross-themes influence the quality of the process of coordination for all the dimensions of
coordination (across administrative levels; across players/programs; across sectors; across
phases of strategies/investment programs/projects).

5.1.1 Trust
305. A basic precondition to effective coordination is to establish and develop a trust-based
relationship in the first place. It is important to remember that coordination ultimately always
occurs between people – not between amorphous institutions or sectors. This is why building a
culture of collaboration is quintessential for instilling coordination in the DNA of any
organization. A corollary is the need to reduce turnover of critical staff ( see also below the sub-
section on “capacity”). To facilitate these processes and as the leader of the public
administration policy framework in Romania, the MRDPA can spearhead an outreach effort to
other public institutions at national and subnational levels in Romania with the dual goals of: (i)
organizing special training programs for staff on how to enhance collaboration; and (ii) collecting
and disseminating good practices from around the country regarding internal (within an
organization, across various units) and external (across organizations) coordination. There are
significant EU funds available for 2014-2020 precisely for such purposes (i.e., the Administrative
Capacity Operational Programme, technical assistance funding). In the medium-to-long term,
the MRDPA could build its own internal “coordination taskforce,” essentially training trainers
who could then go and assist other public agencies in their efforts to encourage and enhance
collaboration among staff. Building trust-based relationships will require a change in culture
across the Romanian public sector, which will surely take time and patience. But without this
solid foundation, it is unlikely that coordination efforts will be sustainable and effective.

5.1.2 Accountability
306. Coordination of public investments occurs more easily when a sense of accountability
is present among the stakeholders involved. A key step to facilitating enhanced coordination is
to establish this as a clear objective, as follows:
       Coordination with other authorities should be included in the list of legal responsibilities
        corresponding to each authority in charge of defining and implementing public
        infrastructure investments. For instance, each ministry has a law defining its mandate;
        there is also a Law of Local Public Administration that defines the tasks of county and
        local authorities. Both political and technical positions should assume the goal of
        coordination.
       Based on adjustments to the relevant legislative acts, coordination should further be
        adopted as a key goal in the bylaws (Regulamentul de Organizare și Funcționare – ROF)
        of each authority. Mission and internal strategy documents should also be adapted to
        reflect this renewed focus on coordination.
       Further, this should trickle down to the terms of reference ( fișa postului) of each staff.
        For example, a planner in a city hall would be evaluated on whether she reached to
        counterparts in neighboring jurisdictions for projects that can be implemented across
        administrative boundaries or whose influence goes beyond the respective city. Similarly,


                                                                                                168
         a Chief Information Officer in a Ministry would be penalized if she developed a database
         of projects that does not “communicate” with other institutions.
        In addition, the MRDPA centrally and regional/county/local authorities at their
         respective level may consider appointing an informal point person responsible for
         monitoring coordination tasks, disseminating best practices, and generally keeping the
         issue prominent on their institution’s agenda.

307. Such measures are meant to complement each other: on the one hand, explicitly ask
staff to coordinate their actions and hold them accountable; on the other hand, offer them
the knowledge and build the culture required to collaborate. This would help address one of
the key gaps of the current system, which does not track coordination efforts – or lack thereof.
As the main ministry in charge with supporting subnational authorities (i.e., Romania’s public
administration), the MRDPA can promote these initiatives at the level of county and local
councils.

308. On a related but separate note, accountability goes hand in hand with legislative
clarity: if the overall framework is confusing, it is impossible to ask stakeholders to coordinate
effectively. One example is GEO 88/2013, mentioned before as a key step forward in ensuring
the prioritization and coordination of major projects. For all its good intentions, the ordinance
left some key questions unanswered, and its application requires further clarifications. For
instance, it is unclear if the provisions of the act also apply to EU-funded projects exceeding RON
100 million. If so, an applicant would have to seek approval from the Ministry of Public Finances
before proceeding to developing the feasibility study – this would require operational
programmes to ask applicants for proof of such approval as part of the application process (as
an eligibility criterion). Another issue that creates confusions is that even though the act refers
mainly to large projects (over RON 100 million), it stipulates that the principles and the selection
criteria may also be applied to the medium-sized projects (between RON 30 million and RON
100 million) if the evaluation of the Ministry of Public Finances revealed risks in achieving
results/objectives. The simple point is that formal legal mechanisms can be useful for boosting
accountability to coordinate better, provided that they are clearly defined and rigorously
implemented.

5.1.3 Capacity
309. It is common in Romania – and elsewhere, for that matter – to face opposition from
subnational governments when discussing additional tasks that they would need to perform
(i.e., vertical and/or horizontal coordination). The reason is seemingly always the same: lack of
capacity. Field interviews carried out as part of this work and as part of previous World Bank
engagements with the MRDPA since 201192 reveal that there is truth to such concerns at the
local and county levels. It is easy to make the argument that any serious effort to enhance
coordination of public investments needs to take into account the “who” – Who will do the
actual work of coordinating across departments/institutions/ sectors/administrative levels? This
is not a task that can be outsourced, but one that requires active involvement from insiders,
experienced staff members who know the system and can navigate it across institutional and


92These include the 2011 Functional Review of the regional development sector and the first phase of the
Romania Regional Development Program (2012-2014)


                                                                                                   169
jurisdictional lines. Particularly in the context of low-paid positions in Romania’s public
administration, with high turnover and monthly wages of around EUR 400 or lower, such
specialists are very hard to come by and, even where they still exist, they tend to be in very high
demand.

310. In a context of high time pressures and low capacity, coordination tasks risk falling at
the bottom of the list of priorities, even when they are explicitly part of an institution’s and/or
a staff member’s mandate. This is true not only in the case of Romania, but generally in
organizations in public and private sectors. Infrastructure investment units in subnational
governments around the country are charged with the critical and pressing task of applying for
and implementing EU-funded projects. This is particularly the case in the recent period, when
teams have had to both accelerate the implementation of ongoing projects to complete them
before the 2015 deadline and also prepare new projects for the 2014-2020 budgeting cycle. This
comes with a lot of work and responsibility, but also with many controls, audits, and monitoring
visits from various organizations (IBs, the MA, the National Audit Authority, the National Court
of Accounts, etc.). In this environment, it is unlikely that key staff will have any time to dedicate
to coordination activities, which can seem less urgent and time-consuming.

311. The solution is to ensure that local and county authorities have at their disposal the
resources and mechanisms to perform human capital management functions, motivate staff
to coordinate within and across institutions, and reduce turnover. Based on desk review and
field visits data, this report reinforces the recommendations presented in the 2014 World Bank
report on “ROP 2.0: Facilitation of Proactive and Direct Support for Applicants and Beneficiaries
of the Regional Operational Programme 2014-2020.” Specifically, the MRDPA should spearhead
the following policy and legislative efforts aimed at improving the working environment of
public sector employees:
        Increase the salary base in line with performance and consider rewarding coordination
         efforts in particular. The MRDPA can lead the effort to revamp criteria for evaluating the
         performance of public sector employees working on infrastructure investments,
         reflecting the importance of such tasks. One of the process criteria can be related to
         effectiveness of coordination. 93
        Expand the bonus scheme applicable to EU projects (Law 284/2010 allowed for awarding
         bonuses of up to 25 classes, equivalent to 62.5% increase in the base salary) to cover all
         types of infrastructure projects and all phases of infrastructure projects (planning,
         implementation, and post-implementation monitoring and evaluation activities). This is
         needed to remain competitive with private sector wages; experienced practitioners that
         design and manage investment projects tend to be in high demand.
        Improve the hiring system to put the right people into the right positions , with adequate,
         meritocratic hiring practices that bring much needed skills from key areas (economics,
         civil engineering, and legal affairs). In parallel, reduce turnover of critical staff by
         enabling access to proper reward mechanisms.

5.1.4 Information systems
312. Effective coordination also depends on comprehensive, timely, and accurate
information flows among all stakeholders involved – both vertically (among national and
subnational actors) and horizontally (across sectors and across jurisdictions). As the previous
chapter noted, the entrenched lack of collaboration is doubled by a lack of information across
different administrative levels, across ministries, and even across units within departments
within ministries. Romania has not gone through the effort of aligning all databases of
information pertaining to its public institutions, and now it is very challenging to get systems to
“talk to one another.” No matter how tough the challenge is, there can be no effective
coordination of public investments without a proper database of these interventions – across
sectors, across levels (national and subnational), across sources of funding (both EU and state-
budget funds).

313. Several recent examples suggest that developing a common database of all
infrastructure investments in Romania is ultimately possible. Despite all its issues, the Single
Management Information System (SMIS) does the job of collecting in one place information
regarding EU-funded investments across all operational programmes, regardless of which
ministry serves as the managing authority. Based on SMIS information and its own effort to
synthesize it and report it in an effective way, the MA ROP within the MRDPA developed a GIS
map of all interventions financed by the program in 2007-2013. 94 The map allows users to
search by project, locality, county, and region. When the user clicks on a locality on the map, a
pop-up of all projects displays, including project status, total budget, and even pictures (if
available). Data from field interviews suggest that there is recent interest by the DG RDI to
develop a similar tool for PNDL projects and, hopefully, merge the two databases to show
projects financed through both programs.

infrastructure across the entire country, recently developed and launched at the initiative of
the MRDPA and with support from PODCA 2007-2013. 95 There are several important elements
about this database. For one, it is the first mapping of the entire national school network,
allowing interactive snapshots of various key statistics (e.g., number of rehabilitated units,
number of students per unit, etc.). Second, each unit includes detailed information about
organization structure, location and contact data, staff data, the physical state of buildings (i.e.,
overall state, roof, windows, and doors) and utilities (i.e., running water, sanitation systems,
heating, gas electricity). For example, the second figure below shows data on the school in
Dochia commune, Neamț County, but similar data are available for most localities in the
country. Finally and perhaps most importantly, the data collected are primarily based on user
inputs – specifically, a point person for each school unit enters all the required information onto
a portal. The data then allows the Ministry of Education and the MRDPA to understand real-time
infrastructure needs for the entire school network, and couple them with other useful
information (number of students, number of staff, number of classes, number of students at
each academic level, etc.).

Figure 54. The database on school units in Romania offers detailed information for each unit




315. The MRDPA should replicate these good practices for the PNDL and beyond. Most
immediately and directly, the ministry can map out the investments in the 2014 PNDL portfolio,
including the key data that it already has on these interventions (e.g., project name, locality,
project status, total budget, remaining expenditures, start date, proposed end date, etc.). As a
second step, DG RDI should continue the collaboration with the MA ROP and develop a joint
database of information regarding projects supported by the two programs. Third, the MRPDA
should assume a leadership role in developing a single database covering all public
infrastructure investments – at least for roads, water and wastewater, and social infrastructure.
Throughout all these efforts, the Ministry should keep in mind the following principles:

95
     The database is available at https://www.siiir.edu.ro/carto/


                                                                                                 172
   There should be a clear leader who takes responsibility for centralizing the information,
    reviewing it, standardizing it, and publishing it. The MRDPA can effectively take on this
    task and leverage EU funding to develop the IT infrastructure, much like the Ministry of
    Education did with the aforementioned database. The MRDPA is the ministry
    responsible with overseeing public investments, manages arguably the most important
    programs financing local infrastructure projects (PNDL, ROP), and also has the most
    direct link with local and county-level authorities, so it can naturally assume this
    leadership position.
   The database should rely primarily on user inputs. This would help minimize the
    workload required of the coordinator (the MRDPA), and also ensure that the
    information presented is updated in real time. For this to happen regularly, the platform
    should be as user-friendly as possible.
   Local authorities should be held accountable for inputting required data, but it should
    also be easy for them to do so. Put differently, this task should not add much to their
    workload. The optimal solution is to have an integrated electronic system for issuing
    zoning and construction permits; every time a zoning and/or construction permit is
    issued by a main credit release authority (e.g., local or county council), a system would
    collect all the data related to the investment (location of investment, beneficiary,
    characteristics of the investment, etc.).
         o Specifically, zoning permits (issued before feasibility studies) would enable the
            integrated system to map what authorities would intend to invest in; data from
            construction permits would map what authorities will invest in. The earlier the
            system collects the data and integrates it, the easier it is to coordinate across
            projects.
         o For example, commune A may realize through the online platform that a nearby
            commune (commune B) is about to invest in a new school. Suppose for the sake
            of argument that commune A is facing a declining student population and an
            increasing elderly population, while in commune B it just so happens that the
            reverse is true. By sharing data from zoning permits – what they intend to do –
            the two authorities can join forces: A can rehabilitate the cultural center and
            add to it an elderly care facility, while B can rehabilitate the local school. The
            two communes can share buses to move students and/or elderly people to the
            two respective locations.
         o Local authorities would also be asked to monitor data inputs corresponding to
            their localities and also add to them or adjust them, as necessary. Even if the
            automated data collection system is not operationalized, it would still be
            relatively easy for each local authority to plug into an online portal key data
            regarding planned and ongoing investments. The education infrastructure portal
            proves that databases with user-based inputs are possible in Romania too.
         o As an added incentive, the MRDPA could make data entry an eligibility criterion
            for PNDL funds. Authorities that fail to input and/or update their data regularly
            would no longer be eligible to receive annual PNDL allocations and/or
            reimbursements for payment requests – this provision would have to be
            included in the financing agreements between the MRDPA and beneficiaries of
            PNDL funds.



                                                                                          173
       Information in the database of infrastructure projects should be transparent, accurate,
        timely, and relevant. County Councils could play a supporting role to the MRPDA – as
        they do under the current PNDL framework – to ensure that data reporting
        arrangements are followed by local authorities in their jurisdiction. All the data should
        also be accessible to the public, in a form that is easy to comprehend quickly. The figure
        below presents a good practice example developed by KMPG for the United Kingdom –
        the data can be sorted by region and type of infrastructure, and each projects includes a
        number of key details (sponsor, location, cost, date).

316. It is beyond the purposes of this report to describe how the full system of data
collection would operate, but the simple point is that with a relatively modest investment the
MRPDA could truly catalyze data sharing on infrastructure projects. The benefits of the system
would be noticeable at all levels: key stakeholders in the government, civil society, the media,
and the private sector would have, at the click of a button, the full picture of planned and
ongoing infrastructure investments in a locality, in a county, in a region, and nationally. The data
should be made available to decision-makers in a position to evaluate the performance of an
investment program, such as t he Prime Minister’s Chancellery and the Ministry of Public
Finance. The later section of monitoring and evaluation elaborates this point.




                                                                                                174
5.2 Intra-Sectoral Coordination
5.2.1 Vertical Coordination of Strategies and Plans
317. The main factor that hinders intra-sectoral coordination of strategies and plans is the
poor timing and low quality of such documents. The strategies themselves make it hard or
impossible to coordinate planned infrastructure projects with higher-level goals because they
are either developed too late or because they are too vague to allow for anchoring projects in
their stated goals and priority interventions. What is there to be done – in general by the
Romanian Government, by line ministries, and, in particular, by the MRDPA?

318. First, sectoral strategies should be finalized and made publicly available. Without this
basic step, there can be no effective coordination across administrative levels. For each sector,
the process is to be led by the corresponding line ministry. The MRDPA has limited leverage in
this respect, but it can work with the Prime Minister’s Chancellery to ensure that all sectors
targeted by the PNDL benefit from high-quality sectoral strategies (see section 5.3.1 on inter-
sectoral coordination for a series of proposals regarding the establishment of a formal Strategy
Unit at the Center of Government). In the roads sector, this involves securing the final approval
by the EC for the General Transport Master Plan and updating the National Spatial Plan (PATN),
the normative document for the sector, to reflect the new priorities. In the water and
wastewater sector, the Regional Master Plans for 2014-2020 should be finalized, upholding with
rigor the principles and criteria for determining agglomerations, clusters, and priority projects.
In the social infrastructure sector, the next step is to have approved sectoral strategies for all
key areas (including the strategy for education infrastructure). Once these high-level documents
are in place, lower-level strategies at the regional, county, and local levels will need to be
amended to ensure full alignment of goals, priorities, and projects. The related point is that
there should be a clear calendar for developing such documents; otherwise, local, county, and
regional strategies, and project proposals, will continue to be generated in the absence of
updated and relevant sectoral strategies, as it has typically happened for the 2014-2020 cycle.

319. Second, there should be clear quality standards for sectoral strategies and plans , in
accordance with existing legislation (e.g., GD 870/2006, GD 775/2005). These standards should
include, at a minimum, a vision, clear goals, activities, and indicators to track progress. Section
5.3.1 on cross-sectoral strategies elaborates further on these basic requirements and also
describes a new institutional mechanism that can be deployed to ensure coordination in this
respect (i.e., a Strategy Unit under the Prime Minister).

320. Third, the MRDPA and other key stakeholders involved in the management of state-
budget-funded programs should include stronger conditionalities to support vertical
coordination. As part of the eligibility check phase, each proposed project should be tested for
fit with the corresponding sectoral strategies (“project relevance”). Thes e would be simple
yes/no checks. If a wastewater investment is not included in the Master Plan, for instance, it
should not receive any funding. If a school is set to be rehabilitated but the student population
in the community is low or nonexistent, the requested funds should go to a school in a locality
that actually needs the infrastructure (i.e., young and growing student population, marginalized
groups, etc.). This is also related to the next recommendation on horizontal coordination of
programs.




                                                                                               175
5.2.2 Horizontal Coordination of Investment Programs
321. Eligibility and selection criteria should be harmonized across EU and state-budget-
funded investments in each sector targeted. But what does harmonization imply in this
context? The answer is dual-fold:
     On the one hand, harmonized criteria can be equivalent across investment programs.
       This is appropriate particularly when the needs in the sector far outweigh the supply of
       funds and there are also clear requirements to fund particular investments.
       On the other hand, harmonized criteria can be complementary across investment
        programs. That means that in a given sector one may define from the start of a
        programming period the list of eligible types of investments for each fund. Together,
        these lists would be “MECE” – mutually exclusive, comprehensively exhaustive. In other
        words, there would be no overlaps and as a whole the funds would serve all the needs
        in the sector.

322. As hinted above, the optimal approach varies by sector, as there is no one-size-fits-all
answer: in some sectors, the first approach (“equivalency ”) is optimal; in others, the second
approach (“complementarity”) is needed. For example, in the roads sector, the ROP 2014-2020
will focus on county roads connecting to the TEN-T network; the PNDL could take on county
roads that do not connect directly to TEN-T, but remain a priority based on a number of other
criteria (e.g., located in the area of a major urban center, high number of beneficiaries, etc.). By
contrast, for the water and sanitation sector, the PNDL should maintain the EU requirements of
focusing on localities over 50 people for water and over 2,000 p.e. for sewage systems, in
accordance with Water and Wastewater Master Plans. Why not focus on localities that are not
eligible for EU funds through the Large Infrastructure OP or the PNDR 2014-2020? The answer is
simple: the priority lists have already been established by the Master Plans based on clear
criteria, and Romania still needs to fulfill EU-level commitments in the water and wastewater
sector, as explained in Chapter 3. This is why it is best to go down the list of priority projects
from the Master Plans, covering as many beneficiaries as possible with the limited funds
available. Finally, for the social infrastructure, the PNDL should make sure that it evaluates and
prioritizes investments based on a set of criteria that are similar to those used by EU funds –
these are sensible measures for making sure that the investments have the desired impact (e.g.,
sufficient number of students/patients, etc.).

323. One aim of harmonization is to avoid investments that are duplicative or unfeasible,
and channel the money instead to projects that deserve to be prioritized based on a set of
clear, transparent, and rigorous criteria. The final report submitted in December 2014 to the
MRDPA as part of the work under Component 2 of this engagement and the upcoming final
report for Component 1 (due on August 27, 2015) focus precisely on designing better criteria for
PNDL projects. In fact, the relevant proposed criteria could also apply to other state-budget-
funded programs. Based on a number of indicators, detailed maps are produced at the level of
each county to reveal which projects should be a priority for county/local authorities. The key
point is that an effective project selection model depends on fulfilling four core objectives:
disbursement, impact, legitimacy, and feasibility.

324. Another aim of harmonization is to ensure that budget-funded programs do not crowd
out EU structural instruments, which is a real risk particularly for smaller projects that fit


                                                                                                176
better the PNDL’s year-to-year budgeting and more flexible implementation framework. The
solution is to guide or even require applicants interested in the PNDL to apply first to EU
programs, if their projects are eligible for such funding. This would ensure a more consistent
pipeline of projects for EU structural instruments, boosting Romania’s absorption rate in the
long term. Again, the aim is to “do more with less,” which is certainly the case wi th EU grants vs.
funds from the state budget.

325. In particular for the MRDPA, there are significant opportunities to improve
coordination across EU and state-budget-funded programs – the Regional Operational
Programme and the PNDL, respectively. Both target county roads and some types of social
infrastructure (e.g., schools). As two different departments within the ministry handle the two
instruments, it is critical to enhance cooperation among them, across all phases of the
programs: from planning through post-implementation. Even within a single institution, the
same four core elements of an enabling environment still apply: trust, accountability, capacity,
and systems for information exchange.

326. In short, the proposed approach for selecting local PNDL investments for financing
would involve multiple steps and criteria, as summarized below for each key sector.96

5.3 Inter-Sectoral Coordination
5.3.1 National Level

Strategies and Plans
327. The first phase of cross-sectoral strategic programming is to develop, refine, and
approve the strategy or strategies underpinning a particular investment program. As noted in
the previous chapter, a critical challenge is to collect, review, and refine all current strategies at
the Center of Government in the Prime Minister’s Chancellery. While it is true that the MRDPA
cannot take a leading role in this effort, the current report cannot ignore the fact that
coordination challenges often originate in the large number of existing sectoral and cross-
sectoral strategies, with overlapping and unclear objectives and with insufficient grounding in
specific investment priorities and budget ceilings. The space of strategic planning in Romania is
oversaturated with these outputs and, quite simply, there is a pressing need to bring some order
to the status quo.

328. This report concurs with the list of measures proposed in the report on “Harmonizing
Strategic Planning and Budgetary Programming in Romania,” developed as part of a potential
effort to set up a Strategy Unit (SU) under the Prime Minister’s coordina tion . The following
recommendations are particularly noteworthy and can be taken on by the MRDPA – in this case,
not as a leader, but as a strong and proactive enabler:
       Make an inventory of all high-level strategies that are currently in force and assess them
        for relevance based on: alignment with current policy agenda; fulfillment of EU or other
        international obligations; and fit with current directions of institutions responsible for
        operationalizing the respective strategy.
       Adopt a set of preconditions and common standards for developing new strategies, with
        the aims of limiting the number of such documents and ensuring a standardized
        approach. A Strategic Planning Committee would evaluate each strategy in depth before
        formal adoption by the Cabinet and by Parliament to determine the need for the
        document and the fulfilment of required standards (e.g., timeline, objectives, results,
        implementation plan, M&E, etc.). It should be noted that a number of regulations (GD
        870/2006 and GD 775/2005 particularly) have attempted to adopt common standards
        for the development of public policies, including strategies, with a key role played by
        Public Policy Units (PPUs) in each ministry. But the role and attributions of the PPUs
        have diminished over the years and the role of the General Secretariat of the
        Government – which was to assist, alongside the Ministry of Finance, other ministries in
        setting their strategic priorities and plans, in accordance with the Government Program
        and other key documents – has also significantly reduced. As such, the Strategic
        Planning Committee under the Prime Minister should take current legislation as a
        starting point and further build on it.
       Establish and implement a priority-setting process through a Strategic Planning
        Committee (SPC) chaired by the Prime Minister . As noted in the aforementioned report,
        the vast number of strategies has generated “a backlog of uncosted policy commitments
        that, cumulatively, place unaffordable demands on the government.” Setting priorities




                                                                                                 187
         across sectors is intrinsically a political process, determined by commitments at the
         highest level.

 Box. 2. The Polish experience of creating a Strategy Unit

  In Poland, the task of coordinating various national strategies has been located under
  the Chancellery of the Prime Minister. A Minister – with the rank of Secretary of State
  – is responsible for coordinating legislative work of the Council of Ministers. Among
  its tasks, the Minister is also responsible for coordinating development of strategies
  and programs, including multi-annual programs.

  In 2009 the Polish Government prepared and adopted a document entitled
  “Development strategy arrangement plan,” as one of the elements of organizing and
  streamlining existing strategic documents. The main aim was to optimize (i.e., reduce)
  the number of development strategies.

  The plan proposed to reduce the number of development strategies and policies from
  42 down to 9 new development strategies, implementing the medium- and long-term
  development strategy of the country. That concept aimed at, among other things,
  constructing a coherent hierarchy of strategic documents and determining their
  mutual dependence.

  According to the amended Act on principles of development policy there are 3
  categories of development strategies:

     -    Long-term development strategy with at least a 15-year term (horizontal,
          comprehensive document);

     -    Mid-term development strategy for a 4-10-year term (currently it is the
          National Development Strategy 2007-2015) – also a complex, horizontal
          document. The mid-term strategy takes into account the findings of the long-
          term strategy;

     -    Other development strategies - documents relating to the areas indicated in
          the mid-term strategy; these also have a 4-10-year term, unless a longer time
          horizon is due to the specific nature of development in the area.

  The Government has decided to develop nine “other development strategies.” For
  each a coordinator has been appointed. The primary role of the coordinator is to
  direct the work on the document and on its organization, in cooperation with other
  relevant ministries to capture all relevant views.
329. The same SU should also take up – upon proper alignment of capacity with needs –
the role of monitoring and evaluating investment programs financed from the state budget.
This would be an appropriate function for the unit, which would be able to issue more neutral
assessments of how programs are going. For that to happen, however, programs like the PNDL
need to set clear performance targets. The easiest indicators to report and monitor/assess are
process-related. The table below is an example of what could be tracked under this category for
programs like the PNDL:

These process indicators can provide the Government with a quick snapshot of the PNDL ’s
entire portfolio (and other state-budget-funded programs) and they can prompt a potential
intervention if needed. In addition to these basic indicators, impact indicators may be collected,
which could show the extent to which these instruments helps achieve the respective programs’
own targets and broader governmental priorities. All these data should also be made available
to the Ministry of Public Finances, which manages the overall state budget and should be made
aware of programs’ performance. If a program cannot hit project completion targets or
demonstrates other serious gaps in performance, for instance, it should not receive additional
funds within the same calendar year. Last but not least, all data should be easily accessible by
the media and by the general public to enhance both transparency and accountability for
results.

Investment Programs
330. For the MRDPA, in addition to supporting and enabling the SU’s efforts, the main
implication of the recommendations above is to anchor the PNDL in a strategic framework
through a programmatic document that reflects high-level government priorities. While EU-
funded programs are firmly linked to strategies like Europe 2020 and the Romania -EU
Partnership Agreement, there is no strategy as the backbone of the PNDL. This is not to say that
the MRDPA should invent a new strategy just for the program, but there should be a proper
programmatic document that sets clear and measurable development objectives drawn from
one or more strategic documents (e.g., the Territorial Development Strategy of Romania –
SDTR). The programmatic frameworks corresponding to EU funds like the ROP 2014-2020 or the
PNDR 2014-2020 can serve as models to be replicated by the PNDL. Moreover, the process for
developing the PNDL’s programmatic document should also be adopted to ensure that all
stakeholders involved have a say in how the program is designed and implemented. At the same
time, budgetary allocations across the program’s axes should reflect the government’s highest-
level commitments and remain stable for the entire duration of the program ( see below) – if,
say, the government makes education its top priority, the PNDL should orient the bulk of its
resources to that sector.



                                                                                              189
331. At the same time, the question of scale is important to keep in mind: the PNDL’s
budget for 2014-2020, keeping constant the 2014 allocation of EUR 340 million, would be EUR
2.4 billion, less than a third of the EUR 7.9 billion allocated through the ROP. The capacity to
design and implement the two programs is also markedly different. For example, the Regional
Operational Programme has a staff of over 500 working in the Managing Authority and the
Regional Development Agencies. By comparison, the PNDL has a staff of less than 40. The
average value of PNDL projects is also much smaller than ROP projects. All this points to an
approach adapted to the capacity of the program – i.e., a simpler framework than for the ROP
may be both sufficient and feasible.

332. The PNDL Planning Committee (PC) would have a clear mission of designing the
program within a simple but inclusive structure, under the leadership of the MRDPA’s DG RDI,
which would also serve as its permanent secretariat. The PC would bring to the same table
public authorities at the national and subnational levels, along with key interest groups from the
private sector and from civil society, organized into three working groups (WGs) corresponding
to the sectors targeted: roads; water and wastewater; and social infrastructure (including
education, health, culture, and youth and sports). This committee – through its WGs – would
design a multi-year program harmonized with EU structural instruments, with at least the
following common elements: 97
        Defined priorities over a programming cycle (e.g., 2014-2020). Strategic priorities
         should not change from year to year – and programming should not be an annual
         exercise. Ideally, the programming period would be the same as for EU funds, namely
         seven years. This will not only ensure a more rigorous approach and the possibility to
         finance more impactful projects, but it will also enable better coordination and
         harmonization of all operational and investment programs – i.e., operational programs
         financing similar investments could draw on a joint strategy and would look to
         contribute toward the same goals. If the process proposed here would not be ready
         until 2015, the first cycle may have – as an exception – only six years, until fully
         correlated with EU investments in 2020. As noted earlier, these priorities, along with
         their corresponding funding allocations, would have to match the order determined by
         high-level political commitments (through the proposed Strategic Planning Committee
         under the Prime Minister’s coordination). It would also be important to clearly explain
         the needs between development needs – priorities – financing criteria. For instance,
         unlike the ROP, the PNDL does not appear to take into account differences among
         development regions; proposed recommendations in this report and in the report on
         selection criteria (Component 2) would be steps in the right direction.
        Clear, fixed implementation timeline, synchronized with the EU programming cycle .
         Beneficiaries of EU funds know that they have a clear deadline by which they have to
         use accessed funds, and they risk losing those funds if they do not complete the
         investment in the set timeline. Under state-budget-funded programs there is no time
         restriction and many investments, even small ones, are continued for years on end,
         drawing funds from a limited pool to keep the investment going, often at a minimum
         effort level. Countless construction sites are started around the country, without any

                                                                                              190
         substantial push to complete such works before approving new ones. Especially for a
         program like the PNDL, which now has a portfolio of nearly 4,000 projects, it is
         important to decide what budget can reasonably be expected year-on-year to finish (at
         least some of) the projects started in a reasonable timeline.
        Multi-year budgeting. Without multi-year budgets, there is little predictability for
         beneficiaries (their projects may receive funding this year and receive none the next),
         there is an incentive to finance smaller and less impactful projects (the investments
         financed through the PNDL 2014 were on average three times smaller than similar
         projects financed through the ROP 2007-2013 and the PNDR 2007-2013), and it is hard
         to do proper strategic planning (yearly investment programs can only finance the
         projects submitted for financing for that particular year).

Box 3. Main steps to a potential multi-annual budgetary framework for the PNDL

   Step 1: Rationalize the PNDL portfolio based on budget constraints. The current portfolio would take
   over 15 years to complete, assuming that 2014 funding levels would hold going forward. The
   rationalization should therefore be done for each sector by: (i) deploying the sector-specific criteria
   listed in the previous section on horizontal coordination of investment programs (section 5.2.2); and
   (ii) considering project completion status, with more advanced works taking priority.

   Step 2: Set the PNDL baseline (for the budgeted year and for the programming period). This would
   cover all ongoing investments that passed the test (i.e., remained in the portfolio) in the previous
   step. All these projects should be finalized according to their implementation timeline (without
   intervening on the portfolio of ongoing investments to exclude some projects and/or introduce new
   ones).

   Step 3: Consider new investments separately from ongoing projects and only when allowed by the
   available budget envelope. New investment projects should be funded exclusively by the difference
   between the total PNDL budgetary allocation (budgeted year and programming period) and the
   PNDL Baseline (as is defined above). These projects would be prioritized according to the sector -
   specific criteria in this report (section 5.2.2). For all new projects accepted, the corresponding
   planned budget allocations must be included in the PNDL baseline for future years.

   Step 4: Design a clear legal procedure to follow if the PNDL budgetary allocation is smaller than the
   PNDL baseline. This may happen for different reasons: e.g., budgetary austerity, change in
   government priorities, etc. There are mainly two alternatives under this scenario: (i) a proportional
   cut for all investment projects included in the baseline, with the price of delaying the completion
   date for all; (ii) allocation of the available funds to investment projects according to their
   evaluation/selection scores or based on costs required for conserving ongoing works (ongoing
   projects would thus be classified as “in implementation ” and “paused”). Whatever the ultimate
   solution, if the allocation is smaller than the baseline then the new investment project submission
   would be suspended until there are funds to cover all ongoing projects (including “paused” ones)
   and any excess could be allocated to brand new investments.

   Note: The monitoring of the system is critical but relatively straightforward. Indicators on project
   completion rates and overall portfolio evolution should be made available to the general public to
   enhance oversight and accountability. See subsections on monitoring below.

    Ultimately, even EU-funded interventions currently “run through” the national budget
    and expenditures get subsequently reimbursed; this suggests that it is possible to have
    multi-year infrastructure investment projects even under the status quo constraints of
    annual budgeting, provided that there is firm commitment to a clear annual budget
    allocation. Implicitly, adopting a rolling multi-year budgetary framework for the PNDL
    would require rationalization of the current portfolio of around 4,000 ongoing projects,
    and defining procedures for allocating funds to new vs. ongoing investments. The box
    above presents a potential system for multi-year budgeting for the PNDL.

   Dedicated applicant guide. Once the strategic framework is agreed upon, the next
    step is to develop the operational document for the PNDL – i.e., the Applicant Guide.
    This draws the overall rules for implementing the program, offering in-depth
    descriptions of investment axes and eligible types of interventions, eligible
    expenditures, eligibility criteria (types of beneficiaries), and evaluation and selection
    criteria. For effective coordination, this too should be carefully aligned with EU-funded
    instruments.
   Transparent, fair, and rigorously enforced eligibility and selection criteria. The criteria
    described above can be relatively easily adopted for each of the target sectors. The
    approach – described in full in the final report on “Improved Prioritization Criteria for
    PNDL Projects” (December 2014) – relies on a set of objective measures. This should
    ensure enhanced credibility with potential beneficiaries, as well as funding allocations
    (across and within counties) that can be grounded in actual needs on the ground, as
    evidenced by hard data. The added benefit is that the methodology can be implemented
    even with limited staff capacity, as is the case for DG RDI. It would be recommended to
    invest in an IT system that would process the data and the results of the analyses.
   Harmonized evaluation and contracting procedures for all applicants.
       o There should be a single system for applying for funds. The current PNDL
          framework notes that applicants may submit applications directly to the MRDPA
          under “special circumstances.” The law leaves room for interpretation regarding
          “special circumstances” in which a local authority may bypass the corresponding
          county council and submit the documentation directly to the Ministry. This
          alternative was presumably introduced to allow local authorities that have
          divergent positions (politically) from a County Council to apply directly to the
          MRDPA. But this runs the risk of introducing double standards. All applicants
          should go through the same process: if the ministry does not think that county
          councils can treat all applications equally, then it should centralize all
          submissions to ensure a level playing field, along with measures to increase the
          transparency of the process. An appeal system may be considered, to enable
          applicants to contest certain decisions.
        o The PNDL should include a technical and financial evaluation (TFE) of proposed
          projects that are deemed to be eligible for funding. Projects that are not in full
          conformity with program rules should not make it to the TFE phase. EU-funded
          programs like the ROP and the PNDR provide good examples of what the TFE
          should consist of. Evaluation grids should be published along with Applicant
          Guides to ensure that there is full transparency regarding how proposed projects
          are reviewed. Importantly, this step in the process can be iterative: evaluators


                                                                                           192
             should ask for clarifications and applicants – with the help of their consultants
             and designers – should be allowed the opportunity to improve the submitted
             documentation. A maximum number of clarification rounds can be set to two, as
             is typical for the EU-funded programs. It may make sense to also explore the
             option of hiring external evaluators for this stage.
           o For particularly large and/or complex projects, the MRDPA should conduct field
             visits to check the conditions on the ground for completing proposed works. This
             can also be done on a random sampling basis. The idea is not only to sanction
             applicants whose documents do not reflect the reality on the ground, but
             especially to assist them by drawing attention to particular technical and
             financial aspects. To maintain the objectivity of the process and also keeping in
             mind the limited internal resources at the MRDPA level, this phase could also be
             carried out with the help of external support.
      Stronger monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mechanisms at program level.
           o First, the PNDL should set performance indicators for the entire program (e.g.,
              number of projects, total beneficiaries, absorption rates, etc.) and for each
              sector (length of rehabilitated roads, number of additional people with access to
              water and sanitation, etc.)
           o Second, to enable the monitoring process to run smoothly, a Monitoring
             Committee could be established, including both staff of the MRDPA and
             representatives of the beneficiaries (e.g., one representative per county).
             Monitoring could also rely on County Councils or Regional Development
             Agencies (as PNDL Intermediate Bodies) and on local communities themselves.

                                                                                          193
        o As for program evaluations, the government should conduct independent
          impact assessments of completed projects. It is recommended that these tools
          be deployed by third-party auditors – one option would be to have the Prime
          Minister’s Chancellery deploy a core team of in-house or hired experts to
          evaluate whether programs – through a sample of projects – have indeed
          generated positive development effects through output and outcome indicators.
          Some simple indicators such as, in the case of running water projects, the
          number of people connected or the number of people connected who are
          regularly paying their bills, could tell a lot about the quality of the design of
          some programs and their opportunity cost. The impact assessments could then
          be used to further refine the policy framework for relevant investment programs
          and should be made public. Currently, there are no systematic efforts to carry
          out impact assessments of state-budget-funded investment programs and there
          are no public, transparent evaluations of such instruments.


   Stronger monitoring at the project level.
        o A proper monitoring is the first step in enabling the MRDPA to correct issues
           promptly as they develop during the project implementation phase. Currently,
           the system is based on simple desk reviews of submitted documents, as there
           are no continuous mechanisms for verifying the works on the ground. This is
           critical in terms of providing a constant flow of information regarding how
           projects are advancing, how much funds they would require at different stages
           in their implementation, where delays are accumulating and why, etc.
        o For its part, the MRDPA should continue to have the overall program monitoring
           role, with specific project monitoring visits scheduled based on a defined
           methodology (e.g., as mentioned earlier, larger/more complex projects should
           be more carefully scrutinized). In addition, the MRDPA could rely on a more
           active involvement by county council representatives, as well as on independent
           auditors. It is highly recommended to implement a standard electronic reporting
           system, easily accessible by all local authorities, who should be incentivized to
           gradually move away from hard-copy report submissions. This would enable
           faster processing and real-time monitoring of progress.


   Adoption of harmonized procedures for the post-implementation phase, following the
    example of EU funds, including through targeted impact assessments.
       o The first step in establishing a proper M&E system for the post-implementation
           phase is to define and agree on a set of performance indicators for each
           financed project. Based on Romania’s experience with EU funds, PNDL applicants
           should be encouraged to select from a pre-defined list, customized based on
           type of investment, which would be easy to implement particularly through an
           e-application form. At a minimum, chosen indicators should abide by the
           “SMART” set of criteria: specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time -
           oriented. As an alternative, applicants could be free to choose their own targets,
           but evaluators should be allowed and instructed to correct these based on the
           principles enunciated above. These solutions would avoid instances of



                                                                                        194
              beneficiaries over-promising on the impact of their projects and would also save
              time when preparing the monitoring reports.
            o There is also a need to continue monitoring visits in the field for a number of
              years after the completion of the investment. Again, this can be done with the
              support of county councils, independent auditors, or Regional Development
              Agencies. The purpose is to see how the project is performing, if the indicators
              have been reached, and if there are any issues worth signaling in terms of
              operations and maintenance.
            o Finally, the MRDPA should leverage the experience of beneficiaries who
              successfully complete PNDL projects and involve them in dedicated knowledge-
              sharing mechanisms. One simple option is to add to the ex-post monitoring
              reports submitted by beneficiaries a number of questions asking for suggestions
              for future beneficiaries. It should be easy to receive and collect this feedback at
              the level of each county in electronic form, and then send it to the MRDPA for
              further processing and analysis. Another option is to host in-person workshops
              with successful PNDL “graduates” acting as trainers and mentors for new
              beneficiaries. In some regions, successful EU-funded projects are featured in
              promotional materials and project managers are sometimes asked to give talks
              to various audiences, but this practice has not been institutionalized for all
              programs. The PNDL can replicate and improve these mechanisms.

333. To help with the implementation of the measures proposed above, the MRDPA should
consider a revamped institutional structure for the implementation of the PNDL, taking on
higher-level strategic tasks and delegating day-to-day operations to an “intermediate body. ”
IBs would perform activities where they would enjoy a comparative advantage compared to the
central level, primarily resulting from a “shorter distance” to program applicants/beneficiaries:
for example, advertising financing opportunities, conducting trainings, completing initial
eligibility and conformity checks of applications, monitoring project implementation and
reimbursement requests, etc. This “division of labor” would enable the MRDPA (i.e., the
Managing Authority) to focus on critical tasks, including coordination with other investment
programs and relevant institutions, addressing the significant constraint faced by DG RDI in
terms of insufficient staffing to handle all PNDL applications. The costs of the IBs’ functioning
could be covered through a specific technical assistance axis under the PNDL – much like for the
ROP – reflecting the program’s implementation costs. This would also be a step toward
performance budgeting and a first in the management of state-budget-funded investment
programs.

334. There are two primary options for selecting an optimal institutional structure, i.e.,
answering the question of who should serve as the PNDL’s IBs: County Councils or Regional
Development Agencies. There are pros and cons to each scenario. On the one hand, County
Councils have been a de facto IB for the program already, particularly before some of the more
recent changes were introduced – they used to centralize all applications and decide on the list
of proposals for financing, and were also key link in the process chain for reimbursement
requests. On the other hand, this system can generate conflicts of interest whereby County
Councils both evaluate financing requests from local authorities and enter their own projects
(i.e., county roads) in the pool of projects to be supported by the PNDL in a given year. This



                                                                                             195
could be resolved by separating the two streams of funding – pre-allocating some funds
specifically for county roads (to be selected directly by County Councils) and providing a
separate “axis” for local-level financing requests. The other scenario would rely on RDAs as
Intermediate Bodies – this is discussed further under the sub-section focusing on the “regional
level (section 5.3.2 in this report). Whatever the ultimate choice, the key message remains that
the MRDPA should strongly consider designating formal Intermediate Bodies for the PNDL to
ensure a more optimal division of labor between strategic and operational tasks. Much like for
EU-funded instruments, there should be a contract signed between DG RDI (as the PNDL’s MA)
and the IBs of choice, spelling out what each party is responsible for and how performance is
assessed.

335. Last but not least, the MRDPA should be an actively involved stakeholder in the
coordination mechanisms that are already planned for the 2014-2020 programming period
and that explicitly aim to enhance coordination among EU- and state-funded instruments .
Through MA ROP 2014-2020, the MRDPA will be present in both the Management of the
Partnership Agreement Steering Committee (MPASC) and in the thematic sub-committee for
“Developing modern infrastructure for growth and jobs.” Its tasks include to: “ensure
complementarity and [an] integrated approach among ESI funds […] [and] ensure coherence
with other EU and national instruments.”98 DG RDI within the MRDPA should collaborate closely
with MA ROP and also seek to get involved as early as possible in how the MPASC and especially
the thematic sub-committee will be run, they types of issues they will address, etc. As the
manager of two critical sources of investment financing for local authorities – the EU-funded
ROP and the state-budget-funded PNDL – the MRDPA has sufficient leverage to ensure that the

topic of harmonizing the two different types of instruments remains front and center on the
agenda.

Projects
336. With respect to the coordination of projects of national scale and importance (over
RON 100 million), the MRDPA should support and help strengthen the two mechanisms that
are already operational at this level. First, the MRDPA should continue to ensure the leadership
and functionality of the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Approval of Public Works of National
Interest and Housing. At the same time, expectations need to be realistic with respect to what
the committee can accomplish given its capacity and given legal constraints: it successfully
brings different stakeholders to the same table and ensures that proposed projects have
everyone’s buy-in (including formally through permits and the like), but it cannot possibly play
an active role in the coordination of policies, programs, or even projects.

337. For its part, the UEIP has faced significant challenges since its establishment. If it had
stronger capacity and if the legislation was made clearer, the unit could truly play a critical role
in the coordination of national-level (major) investments. In this context, “coordination” refers
primarily to: prioritizing investments based on a set of criteria; 99 and proper sequencing of these
priority investments, including ensuring that commitments are followed through every year and
from year to year. Beyond this, the UEIP should not be expected to coordinate the projects at
the level of policies – i.e., decide to finance a major research center and the road connecting it
to Bucharest. This would exceed both the capacity and the mandate of the unit. Indeed, it
makes sense for the prioritization exercise to be carried out by each line ministry (with support
from the UEIP in validating the order of priorities based on applying the criteria in GEO 88/2013
and GD 225/2104), and the cross-sectoral prioritization to be done at the level of the Center of
Government (Prime Minister’s Chancellery), in line with the high-level political commitments.


5.3.2 Regional Level
338. Since Romania does not yet have administrative regions, coordination mechanisms at
this level will continue to depend on somewhat imperfect arrangements. For one, the Regional
Development Plans, although typically strong in terms of the data provided and the policy
priorities they set, are not normative for authorities within a region. Coordination can still
happen, however, through program conditionalities. As noted earlier, the ROP 2014-2020 will
seek to finance truly regional county road projects; to this end, the program has already
mobilized Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) and, through RDAs, Regional Development
Councils (RDCs), who have convened and agreed to put forth for financing county roads that
cross the jurisdictions of multiple counties. Similar mechanisms can be designed for the water
and wastewater sector and for social infrastructure too.

339. The MRDPA can also explore the possibility of relying more on Regional Developmen t
Agencies to communicate with county and local-level beneficiaries of PNDL. In several
interviews, the idea of signing a contract with the RDAs and appointing them as IBs for the PNDL
was welcomed. This would be one way to coordinate regional-level interventions by
consolidating operational programs under the RDAs as IBs. On the positive side, RDAs know the

                                                                                                197
beneficiaries of funds very well, particularly in urban areas, and have dealt extensively with
project management issues through the implementation of the ROP. That said, RDAs have a
more limited knowledge of rural-area authorities and projects, as their ROP experiences have
been largely centered on urban environments. In short, despite legislative constraints on the
regional level, the current mechanisms for coordination across sectors – namely, the RDAs and
the RDCs – function well. The MRDPA can support them further and work with them to develop
their coordination capacity.



5.3.3 Local Level
340. Last but not least, the MRDPA should contribute to the dissemination of good
practices in coordination at the local level. With respect to plans, local authorities are now
more experienced with the design and implementation of PIDUs – Integrated Urban
Development Plans – and, despite some gaps in these documents (reviewed in a 2013 World
Bank report on the topic – overall this has been a step in the right direction toward more
integrated planning across jurisdictions (within metropolitan areas).

341. As for the implementation of projects across sectors, local authorities have multiple
ways to accomplish this, particularly upon approving an intervention and subsequently during
its implementation. The Mayor can propose to the local council a gradual, calculated approach
to needed infrastructure investments – i.e., making sure that they first invest in underground
networks of utilities and only then move on to road rehabilitation. Specifically, each subnational
authority has an annual investment plan. Some actors at this level begin developing this
document far in advance, which allows them sufficient leeway to coordinate planned
investments with a variety of stakeholders. Consultations with public service providers
(electricity, gas, water, wastewater, etc.) are critical to ensure that investment plans are fully
correlated. For example, the gas operator plans to repair the network on Street A in year 1 and
on street B in year 2 – the mayor can persuade the company to start with street B if that is a
priority for road rehabilitation.

342. Another option for cross-sectoral coordination is for local authorities to require
designers the use of technologies that permit a proper sequencing of investments – or rather,
that reduce the need for staggered implementation. For example, building roads with sufficient
room on the sides for developing or repairing utility networks can be a feasible option in some
circumstances. While such solutions may seem more expensive than traditional designs in the
short run, in the long run they save money by requiring fewer repairs.

343. During the project implementation phase, delays may occur as a result of public
procurement procedures. For example, a road project may be quickly attributed, while a more
expensive water/sewage project may face a challenge in court regarding the contract’s
attribution. The road must then be placed on hold until the other project is completed. It is a
good idea to hold public tenders with “suspension clauses,” whereby the beneficiary of an
investment program (e.g., a city hall) will control the start date of a project, conditioned upon
fulfilling a set of requirements. If more than one investment enters the implementation phase at
the same time, the engineer, together with the beneficiary of the funding, can work together to
develop a feasible plan for the completion of construction works through all concomitant
projects.


                                                                                              198
344. The role of the MRDPA should be to collect, review, and disseminate good practices
for coordination of investments at the local level. Often times, local authorities do not have the
capacity (i.e., time, resources, etc.) to learn about and adopt these tools, despite their best
intentions, so having a central-level coordinator would be tremendously helpful in the effort to
improve local-level coordination across sectors.

Annex A: Detailed Sector Assessments

Roads
Key Players
345. Investments in transport infrastructure are done by a number of key players at the
supra-national, national, regional, and local level. All these actors need to communicate with
each other or at least be informed about what the others are doing. Proper coordination of
investment projects would at the very least require that lower level plans/programs/
investments take into consideration higher-level ones. In other words, key players at lower
administrative levels should be aware of what players at higher administrative levels are doing.
In what follows, this report discusses the relevant actors in the transport sector, at different
levels.

A. Supranational level

The European Union
346. There are several supra-national actors that play a role in the transport sector in
Romania. Of them, by far the most important is the European Union. The EU is not only the
largest outside funder of transport infrastructure in Romania, but it also shapes policy in the
sector. Before joining the EU in 2007, Romania had to adopt the EU acquis communautaire ,
including key directives on transport. The transport chapter of the accession negotiations was
closed in December 2004 and included several policies related to the sector. These cover a wide
range of issues, such as mandatory rest stops for truck drivers, road safety issues, speed limits,
vehicle size, and emission standards.

347. In terms of investments in the transport sector, the most important EU-level
framework is the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) Policy. The TEN-T Policy was set
up at the beginning of 1990, as a way of enabling better functioning of the internal EU market
through key investments in transport, energy, and telecommunications infrastructure. A first
master plan for an EU-wide transport network was established in 1996, following the adoption
of the Community Guidelines for the development of a trans-European network. These
guidelines, modified in 1999 (EC No 1655/1999), determined the eligibility for transport
investment projects with EC/EU funding. In 2009, an overhaul of the TEN-T was undertaken with
an eye for the preparation of the 2014-2020 programming period. The aim of this policy is to
“close the gaps between Member States’ transport networks, remove bottlenecks that still
hamper the smooth functioning of the internal market and overcome technical barriers such as
incompatible standards for railway traffic.” 100 EUR 26 billion have been allocated in support of
this policy.

                                                                                              202
The TEN-T for Romania includes Core and Comprehensive Network segments




348. Romania will continue to be able to access EU Funds for the 2014-2020 programming
period for investments in the TEN-T network for Romania. The TEN-T network builds on
existing and planned infrastructure in Romania and is identified following an existing
methodology (that lays out common requirements/standards). 101 The TEN-T network includes a
Comprehensive Network and a Core Network. The former is a basic multi-modal network that
lays out all the transport modes (rail, road, inland waterway, air, and maritime) eligible for EU
funding. The Core Network is a subset of the Comprehensive Network and it represents what
are considered to be the most important nodes and links of the TEN-T. The Core Network is
identified in two steps: first, the main nodes of the network; second, the multimodal links
between these primary nodes. Investments in the Core Network can be completed from the EU
Cohesion Fund (and around 3 billion have been allocated for the 2014-2020 programming
period), while investments in the Comprehensive Network can be financed through the
European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). The Core Network and Comprehensive Network
for Romania are included in the map above. Overall, the Comprehensive Network has a length
of 4,598 kilometers, of which the Core Network comprises 2,485 km. Co-financing rates for the
two networks can also vary, with the EU shouldering more of the costs associated with projects
for developing the Core Network, considered to be higher-priority than the Comprehensive
Network.

The World Bank
349. The World Bank is an International Financial Institution (IFI) that, among other things,
helps finance Government investment projects in a variety of fields – including transport. In
the 1990s, the Bank has financed the rehabilitation of over 1,100 km of national road in
Romania. In the first decade of the new millennium, the Bank has financed further road
rehabilitation work and the development of several city bypasses. To determine what type of
projects it will focus on, the World Bank elaborates together with the Client Government a
Country Partnership Strategy – usually for a four year period. The Country Partnership Strategy
2014-2017 for Romania does not include any transport investment projects, but does make a
provision for a strengthening of administrative capacity, including in the transport sector.

350. The map below includes all the major road projects financed by the Bank after 1995.
Interestingly, all road segments financed are part of the TEN-T Core and Comprehensive
Networks. Several of the road links financed by the World Bank are now slated to be upgraded
with EU funds, including Craiova-Pitești, Alexandria -București, Câmpina -Comarnic, and Buzău-
Râmnicu Sărat. In addition, through the Romanian Social Development Fund (RSDF), the Bank
has also financed a range of smaller-scale road projects in rural areas, improving marginalized
communities’ access to opportunities.

The World Bank has financed multiple major road projects in Romania after 1995




351. The World Bank has also undertaken road development projects at the local level,
primarily through the Romania Social Development Fund. The map below indicates the
localities where such investments have been financed.


                                                                                           204
RSDF investments in local roads




The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
352. The EBRD is another IFI that has helped the Romanian Government finance transpo rt
investment projects in Romania. For example, in the 1990s, the EBRD has financed the
rehabilitation of 224 km of national roads. Part of this transport investment program was co-
financed by the World Bank, the European Investment Bank, and through EU PHARE funds. In
the new millennium, EBRD has financed two major transport projects that are part of the TEN-T
Network development – the Pitesti and the Constanta bypasses, and also a number of municipal
infrastructure projects. At the end of 2011, the EBRD had transport projects worth EUR 1.7
billion in Romania. 102 In February 2012, the EBRD devised a new Strategy for Romania, covering
three years and with a specific focus on the development of transport infrastructure. A special
emphasis is put on the involvement of the private sector in road infrastructure (e.g., concessions
or Private-Public Partnerships), with a potential involvement of the EBRD in the financing of the
Comarnic-Brașov highway, under a PPP arrangement.

The European Investment Bank (EIB)
353. The EIB is the EU’s bank, owned by the EU Member States, and works closely with
European institutions to promote EU policy. The EIB does lending (including for the private
sector), blending, and provides advisory services – e.g., through the JASPERS (Joint Assistance to
Support Projects in European Regions) Program. The EIB also provides financing for SMEs
through the European Investment Fund (EIF). In Romania, the EIB helps with the co-financing of
several TEN-T investments done by the Romanian Government through the SOP Transport 2007-
2013. Some of the projects include the Lugoj-Dumbrava section of the Lugoj-Deva Highway, the

                                                                                              205
Timișoara-Lugoj Highway and bypass, the Orăștie -Sibiu Highway, and the Nădlac -Arad Highway.
There are also a number of national road rehabilitation projects, part of the TEN-T
comprehensive network, where EIB provides assistance for co-financing – e.g., the National
Road 1H from Zalău to Aleșd or the National Road 6 between Alexandria and Craiova. Between
2009 and 2013, the EIB provided financing of around EUR 1 billion for transport and
telecommunications. The EIB is also considering providing assistance for finalizing the PPP
arrangement for the Comarnic-Brașov Highway.


B. National level
354. There are a number of institutions that undertake road investments at the national
level. Most of these focus on national roads, expressways, and highways. Investments in county
and communal roads are done by subnational authorities (i.e., county councils and local
councils), either with their own funds or with assistance from the Central Government (e.g.,
funds from the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration).
The Ministry of Transport
355. The Ministry of Transport has been the key national level player in the field of
transport. Most of the road investments in Romania were managed, up to July 2014, by the
Ministry of Transport through the National Company for Highways and National Roads (CNADNR
– Compania Națională de Autostrăzi și Drumuri Naționale din România). The Ministry of
Transport was also responsible for elaborating key policies in the road sector. Starting with July
9, 2014, most of the attributions pertaining to national road and highway development have
been passed to the Department for Infrastructure Projects, Foreign Investment, Public Private
Partnership and Export Promotion. As of August 2014, the Ministry of Transport had no more
investment responsibilities in the road sector. It merely took on investments pertaining to air,
rail, and naval infrastructure.

356. The Ministry of Transport has also acted as the Managing Authority for the Sectorial
Operational Programme Transport (SOP-T) 2007-2013. However, for the 2014-2020
programming period, the Large Infrastructure OP (LIOP), which will undertake transport
investments with EU funding, will function under the Ministry of European Funds. This will mean
that, at a de facto level, the Ministry of Transport will have no responsibilities in the field of road
development.
The Department for Infrastructure Projects, Foreign Investment, Public-Private Partnership, and
Export Promotion (henceforth Department for Infrastructure Projects)
357. The Department for Infrastructure Projects (DIP) was set-up through Government
Decision 7/2013 as a specialized body of the General Secretariat of the Government, under
the Prime Minister’s Office. The DIP ensures “the coordination of infrastructure projects of
national interest, the preparation, execution, and implementation of infrastructure projects and
the uniform application of policy coordination in the area of stimulating, promoting, and
implementing foreign investment and public-private partnerships.” In essence, this department
has taken over all policymaking and investment responsibilities in the roads sector.

358. Actual investments in the roads sector are carried out by CNADNR, wh ich now sits
under the DIP. CNADNR is responsible for both road development/rehabilitation/modernization
and for road upkeep and maintenance work. The Company invests in the development of


                                                                                                  206
highways, expressways, bypasses, the modernization of national roads, and the rehabilitation of
bridges. It is the direct beneficiary of EU funds (from the Cohesion Fund and from the ERDF) for
the development of the TEN-T network and for the modernization of national roads and
development of bypasses, mainly outside the TEN-T network. All the investments done with EU
funds follow the provisions of SOP-T 2007-2013 Programmatic Document.

359. In terms of the development of expressways, CNADNR is considering 11 projects. It is
not clear at this point, however, whether these projects will be taken on or whether they will be
completed as highways. For example, on its website, CNADNR indicates that it is considering the
development of the Craiova-Pitesti Expressway and the development of the Sebeș-Turda
Expressway. However, these road links are now considered highway links – the Sebeș-Turda
Highway is actually slated to be completed by the end of 2015.

360. The development of new bypasses is another key priority of CNADNR. Bypasses are
considered to represent critical investments as they help to decongest traffic in cities, increase
traffic capacity, reduce maintenance and repair costs for urban roads, reduce emissions through
increased travel speeds, and facilitate flows for the transport of goods. A number of bypasses
have already been completed and several are under implementation (e.g., București North, Cluj
East, Oradea, Iași, Arad, Pitesti, Sibiu, Lugoj, Alexandria, Brasov, Craiova South, Suceava,
Timisoara North-East) or are planned (e.g., Caransebeș, Bacău, Bistrița, Dej, Huedin, Ma ngalia,
Mediaș, Miercurea Ciuc, Reghin, Târgu Mureş, Târgu Jiu, Timișoara South).

361. The modernization of the national road system is undertaken under a long -term
strategy, commenced in 1994. This proposed 15 phases, from 1994 through 2014. Through
2014, 11,300 km of roads were to be rehabilitated/modernized – several with financing from IFIs
(e.g., the World Bank, EBRD) or with EU pre-accession funds (e.g., PHARE) or post-accession
funds (e.g., ERDF). By 2014 only 3 phases were completed and the total length of
rehabilitated/modernized national roads amounted to only 2,275 km – a mere 20% of the total
proposed initially. Phases IV, V, and VI are now under implementation.

362. Future investments in road development will be subject to strategic planning. The
Romanian Government has been developing the General Transport Master Plan for Romania
(approved on March 3, 2015). 103 The team developing the document has devised a model that
will be used to prioritize key investments in the transport sector for the 2014-2020
programming period. A total of 227 road projects have been proposed for testing and the full list
is available on the MA POS-T website. 104 This means that all future investments to be
undertaken by CNADNR have to come directly from the Transport Master Plan.

The Ministry of European Funds
363. The Ministry of European Funds (MEF) plays two key roles in road development: it
elaborates the Partnership Agreement with the EU and it will serve as the Managing Authority
for the SOP Large Infrastructure 2014-2020. The Partnership Agreement is completed with the
input of responsible Managing Authorities and of relevant line ministries and agencies.
However, the MEF plays a key integrating role for the elaboration of the final document, and
also a key role in the allocation of funds for individual operational programmes. For the 2014-
2020 programming period, the MEF will manage major EU-funded infrastructure investments
through the MA for the LIOP. The beneficiary of most of these road development projects will
be CNADNR.


The Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA)
364. The MRDPA finances county and communal road development projects – both from
the state budget and with EU funds. Through the PNDL, the MRDPA provides grants to county
councils and local authorities of towns and communes. For the 2014 fiscal year, a total of
around EUR 300 million have been allocated for the continuation of ongoing road development
projects and for the commencement of new investments (i.e., projects at the stage of feasibility
study or, less frequently, with detailed technical designs). Road projects represent around 56%
of the total PNDL allocation for 2014, with much of the rest of the allocation going to water and
wastewater investments. The maps below indicate the county road links and the localities
where communal roads have been financed in 2014.
PNDL 2014 funds have been committed for county roads in all of Romania’s regions

365. The MRDPA also houses a number of Managing Authorities that provide financing for
subnational road development projects. The most important of these managing authorities is
the MA for the Regional Operational Programme (MA ROP). For the 2007-2013 programming
period, the MA-ROP has contracted road projects with a value of EUR 1.4 billion – primarily
county roads, urban bypasses, and urban roads. Projects are selected on a first-come, first-
served basis, but they have to first pass an evaluation stage and receive a passing grade (i.e., at
least 3.5 out of 6 total points). The map above indicates the county road links and the urban


                                                                                               209
areas where ROP 2007-2013 projects have been contracted. Road projects are also financed
through a number of Territorial Cooperation Programmes, which primarily finance cross-border
road links.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD)
366. The MARD finances communal road development projects through its EU-funded
National Rural Development Programme (PNDR). The PNDR focuses primarily on small projects
(less than EUR 1.5 million) in rural areas and projects are selected on a competitive basis using
an evaluation and selection grid. The projects that receive EU funds are those with the highest
score within one call for proposal. Out of a total of around 13,000 villages in Romania, 623 have
benefited from PNDR funds in 2007-2013.


The Ministry of Public Finance
The Ministry of Public Finance is an important player with regard to transport infrastructure in
Romania. One of the main roles of the Ministry is to manage the public goods that are in the
public or private property of the state. The Ministry centralizes the inventories of the public
goods belonging to the public and private domain of the state and/or the local territorial
administrative units, as well as of the goods under the central administrations and other public
structures. Also, the Ministry assesses the public investment programs in order to make sure
that such investments are done within some expenditure limits and that they fall within the
given selection and prioritization criteria. The Ministry keeps an eye on the overall process
pertaining to local investments and asks local or central authorities to release relevant
documents. Also, it establishes the methodological norms for designing the evaluation and
selection criteria for public investment programs/projects.

C. Regional level
367. There are two types of players at the regional level – Regional Development Agencies
(RDAs) and County Councils. Both undertake road planning activities, but only County Councils
actually invest in roads’ development.


Regional Development Agencies (RDAs)
368. RDAs are public purpose non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that also serve as
intermediate bodies for EU-funded programs – primarily for the Regional Operational
Programme. Since there is no regional administrative level, RDAs do not actually take on road
investment projects. However, they do play a key role at the planning level. In the Project
Selection Models for the Regional Operational Programme project, the World Bank has
recommended that RDAs include in the Regional Development Plans a number of regional
priorities, including potentially regional connective infrastructure. These are projects with
regional impact, which could be undertaken either by one public authority, or by an
Intercommunity Development Association (ADI).


County Councils
369. Counties are currently the largest subnational administrative units. There are 41
counties and the City of Bucharest – in the case of the capital, the local council also fulfills
attributions typically associated with county councils. County councils have a number of


                                                                                             210
responsibilities, including the planning, managing, and financing of county roads. County
councils can finance county road investment projects from their own funds, from state-budget
programs, with the help of EU funds, or by relying on a loan (either from a private institution or
from an IFI). Between 2010 and 2012, around 60% of capital investments done by county
councils were done with EU funds. In the roads sector specifically, the most important structural
instrument has been the Regional Operational Programme 2007-2013, which has included a
priority axis specifically dedicated to the development of county roads.

D. Local level
370. All investments done at the local level are done by local authorities – municipalities,
towns, or communes . Depending on their size and development level, some local authorities
are more adept than others at generating their own funds for road development/rehabilitation/
modernization. Usually, larger municipalities generate more funds for road investment projects,
while most of the communes depend on state-budget-funded programs (e.g., the PNDL), on EU-
funded programs (e.g., the PNDR), or on governmental transfers to complete such projects.
Between 2010 and 2012, around 30% of capital investments completed by the 40 county
residences in Romania (Ilfov county does not have a county residence) were done with EU
funds.


Legal Framework
371. To enable a proper coordination of investments in the road sector, it is important to
be aware of the legal framework governing the sector in Romania. The following sub-sections
address both EU and national-level legislation.

A. Supranational level
372. The EU Policy on the trans-European networks (transport, energy, and
communication) has come into effect in 1993, based on Title XVI, Articles 170-172, of the
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union . The overall aims of this policy are to improve
the efficiency of internal markets and their connectivity to external markets. The main
motivation of the TENs Policy is to enable Member Countries to interconnect national
infrastructure networks and ensure their interoperability.

373. The two key instruments of the TENs Policy are the Union Guidelines and the EU
infrastructure fund. The Union Guidelines lay out the objectives, priorities, and measures for
identifying projects. The first set of guidelines for the TENs were adopted by the European
Parliament and the Council in 1996. Over the years, the TEN-T Policy has grown in importance,
following the three major enlargement waves. A major policy review was started in 2009,
culminating with a new legislative framework that came into force in 2014. The infrastructure
fund helps Member States develop the TENs, with the first regulation for EU funding adopted in
1995.


TEN-T Policy
374. EC Regulation No. 473/2014, which has amended Regulation No. 1315/2013, provides
the Guidelines for the Development of the TEN-T Network. Several key issues are addressed:




                                                                                              211
      The subsidiarity principle: Member States are responsible for developing and
       maintaining infrastructure, but they may choose to enter into PPP arrangements or
       concessions to private companies
      Focus on rehabilitation and upgrade: the TEN-T consists to a large extent of existent
       infrastructure and the focus is on rehabilitation and upgrades, rather than the
       development of new infrastructure.
      Dual-layer structure: each Member State can develop a Core Network, which is of
       strategic importance for EU-wide connectivity, and a Comprehensive Network, which
       ensures the accessibility and connectivity of all the regions in the EU, including insular
       and remote regions.
      Focus on convergence: there are substantial infrastructure endowment differences
       between the West and the East of the EU and these differences need to be tackled.
      The Core Network is the backbone: Priority should be given to the development of the
       Core Network by 2030. The Comprehensive Network should be finalized by 2050.
      Obligation of Cost-Benefit Analysis: all TEN-T projects that receive EU funding should use
       a recognized socio-economic cost-benefit analysis methodology.
      Reduce green-house gas emissions by 60% by 2050, compared to the 1990 baseline.
      Cooperation with neighboring and third countries.
      TEN-T should ensure efficient multimodality.

375. Section 3 of the TEN-T Guidelines deals directly with road transport infrastructure.
Article 17 notes that EU-funding for eligible road transport infrastructure comprises: (a) high-
quality roads (including bridges, tunnels, junctions, crossings, interchanges, hard shoulders); (b)
parking and rest areas; (c) associated equipment; (d) telematics applications; (e) freight
terminals and logistic platforms; (f) connections between different modes of transport; (g) coach
stations. High-quality roads can include highways (motorways), express roads, or conventional
strategic roads. Of particular importance is the fact that investments in crossings, interchanges,
and crossings are eligible for EU funding, which is a key incentive for coordinated investments in
the TEN-T infrastructure and the national and subnational road network.
376. The Core Network’s development should focus on: (a) modal integration; (b)
interoperability; and (c) a coordinated development of infrastructure (with a focus on cross -
border sections and bottlenecks). The Guidelines set out that core network corridors are
multimodal, cross at least two borders, and, if possible, involve at least three transport modes.
The map above provides a full representation of the network.


European Structural and Investment (ESI) Funds Regulations 2014-2020
377. Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that the
EU should strive to strengthen its economic, social, and territorial cohesion, and reduce
disparities between regions – with particular attention to be paid to rural areas. With this aim
in mind, several funds have been established in the EU, and these provide resources to Member
Countries for a variety of development projects. The most important funds are the European
Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the European Territorial
Cooperation (ETC) fund, the Cohesion Fund (CF), the European Grouping of Territorial
Cooperation (EGTC), and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). Road
development works can primarily be financed using the ERDF, the CF, and the EAFRD.

378. EU Regulation No. 1303/2013 sets forth the Common Provision Regulation for all ESI
Funds for the 2014-2020 programming period. Among other things, it stipulates that the key
investments to be financed from ESI funds need to be laid out in the Partnership Agreement.
The Partnership Agreement is a document prepared by each Member State, which “sets out that
Member State’s strategy, priorities, and arrangements for using ESI Funds in an effe ctive and
efficient way so as to pursue the Union strategy for smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth,
and which is approved by the Commission following assessment and dialogue with the Member
State concerned.” The Romania -EU Partnership Agreement was approved by the European
Commission on August 6, 2014.

379. The Common Provision Regulation, under Article 9, sets out the key Thematic
Objectives that ESI Funds should be used for. Thematic Objective 7 focuses on “promoting
sustainable transport and removing bottlenecks in key network infrastructure.” Each of the ESI
Funds makes provisions for how Thematic Objective 7 is addressed. For example, the ERDF
allows the following type of road investments: (a) development of the Comprehensive TEN-T
Network; (b) development of secondary and tertiary connections to the TEN-T Network,
including multi-modal nodes; (c) development and improvement of environmentally-friendly
and low-carbon transport systems; (d) development and rehabilitation of the railway system; (e)



                                                                                               213
improving energy efficiency and security of supply. 105 The CF allows for the following type of
road investments: (a) development of the TEN-T (with a focus on the Core TEN-T); (b)
development and improvement of environmentally-friendly and low-carbon transport; (c)
development and rehabilitation of comprehensive high quality and interoperable railway
system. The EAFRD sets out to promote social inclusion, poverty reduction, and economic
development in rural areas, allowing, among others, investments in communal roa d
development/rehabilitation/upgrade.

380. Some of the ESI Funds also provide thresholds for how allocated grants should be
used. For example, the ERDF indicates that at least 50% of resources should be allocated to two
or more of the thematic objectives 1,2,3, and 4, and at least 12% of resources should be
allocated to thematic objective 4. 106 This restriction on the use of ERDF resources may make
sense in many of the older EU Member States, but it is not necessarily optimal for Romania,
which still has substantial infrastructure deficiencies, including in the road sector. These
restrictions will also affect the way Operational Programs are structured.

B. National level
381. The national legislation is less straightforward than EU regulation . There are a number
of legislative measures that guide road investments, but these are not always properly
correlated. There is nonetheless a legislative hierarchy that at least guides development at the
national scale.

382. The most important normative document at the national level is the National Spatial
Plan and particularly Section 1 on the National Transport Network (approved through Law
363/2006). The National Spatial Plan sets out the network of highways and expressways to be
developed in Romania in the coming years. All road investments have to take this plan into
consideration. The proposed TEN-T Network for Romania (both the Core Network and the
Comprehensive Network) has been incorporated in the blueprint provided by the national
spatial plan. All other road investments (national roads, county roads, communal roads) have to
take this plan into consideration and ensure that new road developments are spatially
coordinated with the proposed network of highways and expressways. A map of the National
Spatial Plan network of highways and expressways is provided in Figure 4 above. As can be seen
in that figure, all the links of the TEN-T Core and Comprehensive Networks are part of the larger
National Spatial Plan network.

383. There are no other major legislative provisions to guide investments in the road
network, apart from those that approve major investment programs. 107 Government Decision
947/1990 approved the National Program for the Modernization of National Roads and
Construction of Highways. Government Ordinance 16/1999 approved the Priority Program for

105
    See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32013R1301&from=EN
106
    The thematic objectives are as follows: (1) strengthening research, technological development
and innovation; (2) enhancing access to, and use and quality of, ICT; (3) enhancing the
competitiveness of SMEs; (4) supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy.
107
    The new General Transport Master Plan for Romania was very recently approved by the
Government. The revised draft Final Report was presented to Romanian Government by AECOM in
October and commented by the World Bank on November 3, 2014


                                                                                                    214
the Development of Highways. Four major highways were planned to be developed or
rehabilitated under this program: 1) București -Pitești (96 km); 2) București-Constanța (201 km);
3) the București South Bypass (57 km); 4) Pitești-Nădlac (460 km); 5) București-Buzău-Focșani-
Albița (380 km). Of these, the first two have been completed. The fourth is under construction
with EU funds (it basically is part of the TEN-T Corridor IV). The fifth is under consideration for
the 2014-2020 programming period. Law 1/2002 approved Ordinance 16/1999 and completes it
with the addition of a number of proposed highways and expressways. The additional highways
include: 1) București-Fetești-Cernavodă (151 km); 2) the București North Bypass (50 km); 3)
București-Ploiești (70 km); 4) Ploiești-Comarnic (36 km); 5) Comarnic-Brașov 65 km); 6) Borș-
Oradea-Cluj (167 km). The additional expressways include: 1) București -Giurgiu (49 km); 2)
Brașov-Sibiu (110 km); 3) Cernavodă -Constanța (61 km). Several of these proje cts have been
completed (e.g., București-Cernavodă, București-Ploiești), while others have been started but
have not been finished yet (e.g., the Transylvania Highway).

384. CNADNR has a number of cost standards for different types of roads and these
provide guidance for road investment projects. The following cost standards are applied:
     Highway on a plane surface: 3,802,000 EUR/km
     Highway on hilly terrain: 4,980,000 EUR/km
     Highway on mountainous terrain: 5,992,000 EUR/km
     Development of National Road – Technical Class III: 1,271,800 EUR/km
     Rehabilitation of National Road – Technical Class III: 764,700 EUR/km
     Tunnel for two lane road: 19,000 EUR/m
     Tunnel for two lane road plus emergency lane: 27,500 EUR/m

385. If the lowest cost standard for highways is applied to the entire Core TEN-T Network,
then the required funds for completing this network come up to around 9.5 billion Euro, which
is more or less the entire allocation for OP Large Infrastructure 2014-2020. Thus, it is clear that
only a portion of the Core TEN-T can be finalized in the next programming period with the help
of EU funds.



Strategies and Plans

A. Supranational level
The Europe 2020 Strategy
386. The Europe 2020 Strategy is the framework document that sets out the EU priorities
for the 2014-2020 programming period and lays the foundation for how EU Structural Funds
and the Cohesion Fund will be used. For Romania this strategy is of critical importance, as many
of the necessary infrastructure investments, particularly in transport, are funded with the help
of EU funds. The main thrust of the strategy is to help the EU overcome the challenges of the
2008/2009 economic crisis, encourage a more competitive economy, and boost employment.

387. The three major priorities of the Europe 2020 Strategy are smart, sustain able, and
inclusive growth. Smart growth entails more effective investments in education, research, and
innovation. Sustainable growth envisages a more decisive move to a low-carbon economy.


                                                                                               215
Inclusive growth puts a stronger emphasis on the creation of jobs and poverty reduction. These
three key priorities are then translated into 5 key targets to be achieved by 2020:
    1. Employment: 75% of the 20-64 year-olds to be employed;
    2. R&D: 3% of the EU’s GDP to be invested in R&D;
    3. Climate change and energy sustainability: greenhouse gas emissions 20% lower than
         1990; 20% of energy from renewables; 20% increase in energy efficiency;
    4. Education: reducing the rates of early school leaving below 10%; at least 40% of 30-34-
         year-olds completing third level education;
    5. Fighting poverty and social exclusion: at least 20 million fewer people in or at risk of
         poverty and social exclusion.

388. The fact that the Europe 2020 Strategy is quite focused may make it more efficient – it
misses, however, the wide diversity across the EU space. Among other things, Romania is one
of the countries that continue to have, even after the 2007-2013 programming period,
significant infrastructure shortages. The highway network needs to be expanded, while the
national, regional, and local road networks require rehabilitation and modernization. Improved
connectivity is not identified outright as a key priority for the EU in 2014-2020, but it is one of
the most important priorities for Romania – as discussed in some detail in the World Bank
report Competitive Cities: Reshaping the Economic Geography of Romania. The Europe 2020
Strategy discusses connectivity only under “Other tools for growth and jobs,” where it indicates
that a deepening of the single market requires that several obstacles be dealt with, including:
bottlenecks to cross-border activity; and insufficiently interconnected networks.


TEN-T Policy
389. The TEN-T Policy is the EU’s major planning document for pan -European transport
infrastructure. The Policy was discussed in more detail in this report’s previous section. It draws
out the Core TEN-T Network and the Comprehensive TEN-T Network, and conditions for the use
of EU funds for investments in the TEN-T. In Romania, investments in the Core TEN-T Network
(primarily the Rhine-Danube Corridor – the former Corridor IV, and the Orient/East-Med
Corridor) are financed from the Cohesion Fund, while investments in the Comprehensive
Network are financed from the ERDF.

390. The regulations for the use of ESI Funds also shape strategic planning at the national
and subnational level. For example, the ROP 2007-2013 awarded a higher score in the
evaluation and selection process for county roads that connect to the TEN-T network.
Consequently, most of the county roads projects submitted and accepted for financing under
the ROP connect to the TEN-T.


B. National level
391. There are several overarching strategies/plans/programs at the national level, which
impact how investments in the transport sector are done. The most important ones will be
discussed in what follows. Interestingly, there is no national overarching development strategy,
similar to the National Development Plan 2007-2013, which outlined the key directions of
development for the country, in preparation for that programming period.




                                                                                               216
392. It is important to reemphasize that the General Transport Master Plan (GTMP) is not
available publicly as of early March 2015, and will only be discussed in depth for the upcoming
final report (also under Component 1 of the current work). As noted earlier, the GTMP sets the
main directions for developing the transport sector in Romania and, although it is based on
nationwide traffic data, it only covers national roads, which remain outside the purview of the
state-budget-funded PNDL. Indeed, county and local roads (including communal roads in rural
areas) are the main focus of this analysis, in line with the agreed scope of the engagement.


The Governing Program 2013-2016
393. The Governing Program 2013-2016 outlines the key priorities for the current
Government, including those for the Transport sector. The Transport section of the Program
indicates that many national road links register traffic figures of over 11,000 vehicles per day.
This in itself would indicate the need for the extension of the highway and expressway network
in Romania. Also, only 35% of national roads and only 15% of county roads are in a very good or
good condition, which indicates that there is a very high need for the rehabilitation of these
transport corridors.

394. In terms of highway development, the Governing Program identifies 6 critical links.
The first is the completion of the A1 (Corridor IV) Highway and of the A3 Highway. Other
priorities include: the completion of the Comarnic-Brașov Highway (part of the A3 Highway); the
commencement of the East-West Highway from Iași-Ungheni to Târgu Mureș; the development
of the București-Ploiești-Focșani-Bacău-Pașcani Highway; the commencement of the South
Highway linking București to Alexandria, Craiova, Drobeta -Turnu Severin, and Timișoara; and the
finalization of the București beltway.

395. Interestingly, under the section Large Infrastructure Projects, there is a different set of
priorities for large road investments. Thus there are two large highway links listed as priorities:
the Comarnic-Brașov Highway and the Sibiu-Râmnicu Vâlcea Highway (the remaining link
required to complete Corridor IV on Romania’s territory, i.e., from Constanța to Nădlac).

396. The section on Development and Administration outlines a number of priorities for
county and communal roads. Thus, it is indicated that the modernization of county roads be
continued to improve accessibility to the national and European road network. Also, the
“Romanian Village” Program indicates that a minimum required package of public investments
will have to be implemented in Romanian villages to raise living standards and the quality of life.
Thus, every village should have, among others, at least the following: good communal roads, a
school, a church, a pharmacy and dispensary, water and wastewater, public lighting, solid waste
management, a fire truck, an ambulance, and a communal market.

397. The Governing Program is less explicit when it comes to priorities for the development
of other types of road infrastructure. It merely states that an extended expressway network will
help improve connectivity between the different highway links and between important urban
centers, that another 50 bypasses will be constructed, and that 75% of the national roads and
55% of the county roads will be brought to a good or very good state. Interestingly, the Program
indicates that the Ministry of Transport will be actively involved in the



                                                                                               217
modernization/rehabilitation of county roads by taking those under its administration during
the actual construction period.

The National Territorial Development Strategy (SDTR) 2035
398. The SDTR 2035 was still in draft form at the time of the writing of this report, but it
provided some key lines of actions, including proposals for the development of road
infrastructure. The Strategy puts forth three major concepts: CONCENTRATION-CONNECTION-
COOPERATION. In essence, this presupposes an encouragement of the urbanization process and
enabling cities to enlarge their demographic and economic mass. It promotes better access to
and between these urban centers. And it encourages increased regional flows, particularly with
neighboring countries that are non-EU Members and with which there still are a number of
trade barriers.

399. The Strategy starts with a diagnostic of the current connective infrastructure. It
indicates that Romania occupies a peripheral position within the EU and is bypassed by the 5
major transnational axes defined by the European Commission. Moreover, the TEN-T Network,
with its current design, leaves large areas of the county (e.g., the North) uncovered by ma jor
transport infrastructure (see Figure 7). Moreover, there are a number of natural barriers (e.g.,
the Carpathians and several large rivers) that create transport bottlenecks. For example, if the
Olt Valley road is jammed, for whatever reason, the only way around the Carpathian Mountains
is a couple of hundred kilometers away. Similarly, between Giurgiu and Calafat (covering a
distance of around 300 km) there is no bridge crossing the Danube. The only other bridge
between Romania and Bulgaria, crossing from Calafat to Vidin, was only recently completed
with the help of EU funds.

400. The first key objective of the SDTR 2035 is to develop an efficient and diversified
transport network, capable of managing the growing movement of people and goods within
and outside Romania. In fact, the overall vision of the Strategy is to have by 2035 “a country
with a functional territory, managed efficiently, which ensures attractive living conditions for its
citizens, playing an important role in South-Eastern Europe.” One of the key hurdles to
overcome in terms of development of transport infrastructure relates to improved connections
over the Carpathians. The East and the South of the country are less developed than the rest of
also because of their poor connectivity to rich markets in Western Europe. Also, there are only a
few connections through the Carpathians, such as Olt Valley, Prahova Valley, or the Oituz Pass,
which often struggle with traffic jams, delays, and poor accessibility.

401. The Strategy also proposes a series of measures in the transport sector at different
territorial dimensions. One of the first priorities identified by the SDTR 2035 is the integration
into the EU’s highway network (70% of Romanian exports flow through the Western border),
prioritizing the completion of the A1 Highway (Rhine-Danube Corridor, formerly Corridor IV) and
the A3 Highway (București-Brașov-Cluj-Oradea). Another priority concerns improved
connections to București – the largest market in Romania. As such, the Moldova Highway
(connecting Suceava and Botoșani to Bucharest) and the Craiova -Pitești Highway are considered
to be key investments for spurring growth in the East and South of Romania. Also of importance
are improved connections over the Carpathian arch, particularly for the East of the country. Two
major road links are proposed in this respect: 1) Satu Mare – Baia Mare – Mireșu Mare – Dej –


                                                                                                218
Bistrița – Vatra Dornei – Suceava; 2) Târgu Mureș – Piatra Neamț – Roman – Târgu Frumos – Iași
– Sculeni. Of these two options, the first would also contribute to improved connections in the
North of the country, which now is largely bypassed by the TEN-T Network, and not considered
for priority transport investments by the Government.

402. At the local and regional level, the strategy proposes improved transport connections
between the country’s main urban centers and their hinterland . On the one hand, this allows
firms an easier access to a larger pool of people; on the other hand, it enables more people
easier access to key opportunities offered by these urban centers (e.g., jobs, education,
healthcare, culture, entertainment, etc.). Also important are considered the transport
connections between urban centers that form urban systems – e.g., Brăila -Galați, Timișoara -
Arad, Suceava-Botoșani, Piatra Neamț-Bacău, Satu Mare-Baia Mare, or Deva-Hunedoara-Orăștie.

The National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS) 2013-2020-2030
403. The NSDS is one the country’s long -term development strategies published shortly
after Romania’s accession to the EU. The scope of this strategy is to link Romania to a new
philosophy of development, more in-tune with EU principles and with global best-practices on
sustainable development. Three major strategic objectives are set: 1) By 2013: Incorporate in an
organic fashion the principles and practices of sustainable development within the programs
and public policies developed by Romania; 2) By 2020: Reach the EU average on key sustainable
development indicators; 3) By 2030: Reach the EU average on a larger set of sustainable
development indicators.

404. One of the key objectives to be achieved is Sustainable Transport. The idea is to
improve the transport network and adjust it to economic, social, and environmental needs,
while at the same time reducing potential negative economic, social, and environmental
externalities. For the road network, the strategy recommends a modernization of the
infrastructure to reduce traffic accidents by 50% by 2030, improve traffic flows, and reduce
pollution in cities.


The Romania EU Partnership Agreement (PA) 2014-2020
405. With regards to actual investments, the PA is probably one of the most important
planning documents in Romania. The PA, which was approved by the European Commission in
August 2014, charts out how EUR 40 billion in EU grants will be spent between 2014 and 2020,
and as such it is one of the most referenced documents in Romania. Public authorities, private
companies, NGOs, and private individuals all have an interest in looking at this document and
determining how they could access EU funds for the projects they are developing. The
Partnership Agreement 2014-2020 plays the same role that The National Strategic Reference
Framework 2007-2013 played in the previous programming period.

406. The PA clearly identifies the lack of proper transport infrastructure as one of the major
development challenges in Romania. A total of five development challenges are identified: 1)
competitiveness and local development; 2) people and society; 3) infrastructure; 4) resources;
and, 5) administration and government. Under the infrastructure challenge, the document
indicates that “[a]lthough Romania sits on important routes connecting Central Europe with the
Black Sea and the Caucasus, its transport infrastructure is underdeveloped relative to the


                                                                                            219
volume of goods and passengers that transit Romanian territory [sic], and accessibility remains a
major barrier to regional growth.” Similar to the SDTR 2035, the PA 2014 -2020 indicates that the
TEN-T proposed network does leave large areas of the country uncovered (e.g., the North) and
that the Carpathians obstruct connectivity for the East and South of the country. The document
also notes that Romania ranks last in the EU in terms of the overall quality of its transport
infrastructure.

407.    A number of key priorities in the road sector are identified by the PA:
       the missing links of the Rhine-Danube Corridor (former Corridor IV) will need to be
        completed by 2020;
       additional major transport links of the TEN-T Comprehensive would need to be taken
        on, as outlined in the General Transport Master Plan for Transport 2020-2030;
       the continued construction of ring roads for town and villages will be necessary, to
        improve travel time, reduce fuel consumption, and decrease pollution levels;
       investments in Customs infrastructure to reduce waiting times and delays at border-
        crossing areas;
       modernization and development of inter-modal transport;
       improved accessibility to the TEN-T network by developing/rehabilitating/ modernizing
        the secondary and tertiary connections to the network.


C. Regional level
Regional Development Plans
408. Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) prepare Regional Development Plans (RDPs),
which guide investments at the county and at the locality level. Since RDAs are public utility
NGOs, and since there is no formal regional administrative tier, the proposals made in the RDPs
serve as guiding tools for subnational authorities. For example, if the RDA proposes that an
inter-county road be financed, it is up to the respective county councils to decide whether they
will undertake such a project. All RDAs have started to draft updated RDPs for the 2014-2020
programming period, but these will only be finalized when the Regional Operational Programme
2014-2020, as well as the other operational programmes, are finalized (i.e., when they have the
final approval of the European Commission). All regional development plans include objectives
related to the development and rehabilitation of transport infrastructure.

Regional Spatial Plans
409. Regional Spatial Plans (Plan de Amenajare al Teritoriului Zonal – PATZ) are binding
documents for lower-level spatial plans and they are prepared either at the national or at the
subnational level. For example, the MRDPA may prepare a PATZ for a region that may face
specific economic, social, or environmental challenges. Similarly, a county, or an associations of
counties and/or localities may prepare a PATZ to address key issues. For example, a PATZ may
be put in place to address key spatial dynamics at the metropolitan level (e.g., the need for
additional connective infrastructure).

410. A PATZ may make a number of clear recommendations for new infrastructure needs.
When this happens, a clear claim on the territory in the region is made, which will influence



                                                                                              220
territorial decisions taken at a lower level. For example, plans may be hashed out for future road
links. When these plans are not carried through though, they may negatively affect decisions at
the lower level. For example, a private investor will not be able to build a new factory on land
that has been zoned for transport infrastructure, even though the development of that
transport infrastructure is uncertain (e.g., because of the lack of appropriate sources of
funding).

County Development Strategies
411. Since the maintenance/rehabilitation/modernization of county roads is one of the key
responsibilities of county councils, virtually all county development strategies include
proposals for investments in road infrastructure. County councils know best the state of the
existing road network, they identify potential bottlenecks, and they can measure the impact of
an investment once it has been finalized. For example, discussions with a number of county
council representatives have revealed that the rehabilitation of some county roads has led to an
increase in traffic well above what was estimated before the work started. This can affect the
warranty period for the respective road and reduce the time by when new rehabilitation work
may be required.

412. While country development strategies include a list of road dev elopment projects,
they rarely include a list of priority investments. More often than not, these documents include
primarily a laundry list of potential projects, with potential sources of funding, and no clear
priorities. This approach unfortunately leads to a haphazard implementation cycle, poor
coordination, and often to lack of investments (despite available resources), as local authorities
wait for the “proper” time to start or continue an investment.

413. For development strategies to be effective, they should ideally be linked to clear
operational programs and to specific and reliable sources of funding. As was shown in the
World Bank’s Project Selection Models report, around 60% of county councils’ capital
investments between 2010 and 2012 were done with the help of EU funds. This is a considerable
amount and points to the fact that county councils have a reduced budgetary capacity to cover
all the needs of the communities they represent. It is therefore that much more imperative that
clear priorities are set and these should be coupled with defined sources of funding.


County Spatial Plans
414. County spatial plans (Planuri de Amenajare a Teritoriului Județean – PATJ) are
normative documents that lay down development restrictions and guidelines, as well as th e
territorial interventions to be taken within a given time period. As was discussed in the World
Bank’s Enhanced Spatial Planning report, there is often a disjointed approach between the PATJ
and the County Development Strategy. In essence, the PATJ, while it has its own socio-economic
section, should draw on the existing development strategy. This does not always happen and
often the list of proposed projects in the PATJ does not coincide with the list of proposed
projects in the development strategy.

415. The PATJ has to be correlated with higher-level spatial plans (national and regional)
and strategies. Thus, if a new road development (e.g., highway or expressway) is proposed at



                                                                                              221
the national level, the PATJ has to link its own list of intended projects to these higher-level
proposals.

416. The instances where new roads are proposed in a PATJ are relatively limited given the
mounting need for rehabilitating and modernizing the existing infrastructure. Most county
spatial plans simply include the new proposals for national road links, and possibly proposals for
the modernization/rehabilitation of county and local roads. The example below, from Brăila
County, is illuminating in this respect.

The Brăila PATJ includes several transport proposals

D. Local level
Local Development Strategies
417. Many localities prepare development strategies. Sometimes, such strategies are
needed as a precondition to access certain funding sources (e.g., as is the case of Integrated
Development Plans, which are used to get funding under Axis 1 of the Regional Operational
Programme 2007-2013), but most often they are prepared to lay down key issues that a local
administration hopes to tackle. Most often, these strategies include projects that focus on the
rehabilitation/modernization of the existent transport infrastructure and in cities with a vibrant
real estate market they can also include proposals for new infrastructure or for the extension of
existing networks.




                                                                                              222
General Urban Plans
418. General Urban Plans (Planuri Urbanistice Generale – PUG-uri) are the key tools used
by local authorities to direct spatial interventions. By law, as in the case of counties, each
locality has to have such a plan in place. The PUG provides development restrictions and
guidelines (e.g., what can and cannot be developed in each area) and also lays down the
infrastructure developments proposed for completion within the timeline covered by the PUG
(usually 10 years). Below is an example from the Cluj-Napoca PUG, which includes the existent
infrastructure network and new road infrastructure interventions proposed for the future.

The Cluj-Napoca PUG includes current (up) and proposed (down) road networks

Water and Wastewater
Key Players

A. Supranational level
The European Union
419. The main player at the supra-national level is the European Union, which fulfills two
key functions: setting policy directions, developing legally binding instruments, and
supporting financing investments in the water and sanitation systems of Member States. As in
other sectors, the EU’s role is limited by the nature of its supra -national mandate, since the
provision of water and wastewater services are part of a Member State’s responsibilities and, in
actuality, are often carried out at the subnational/local level. In the 2003 Green Paper on
Services of General Interest, there is a recognition that “i t is primarily for the competent
national, regional and local authorities to define, organize, finance, and monitor services of
general interest .”108 Of course, subsidiarity allows Member States to choose how they can fulfill
standards set at the supranational level, not whether to respect such regulations. The EC also
defines a set of principles and standards applicable to such services, including water a nd
sanitation: universal service, continuity, quality of service, affordability, and user/consumer
protection.

420. In addition, the EU has adopted certain policies to regulate the quality of the services
provided. In the water and sanitation sector, the main policies set by the EU include the
following: the EC Directive 98/83/EEC relating to the quality of water intended for human
consumption, the EU Directive 91/271/EEC concerning the urban wastewater treatment, and
the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC. The Directorate General (DG) Environment leads
EU policies in the water and wastewater sector, covering a variety of topics: river basin
management, flood risk management, water scarcity and droughts, drinking water, bathing
water, water pollution (including urban wastewater), etc. DG Environment is active in
monitoring the implementation of EU-level legislation, but also produces key reports on the
status of reforms and public opinion surveys (e.g., the Water Eurobarometer).

421. On the financing side, the EU makes available significant funds for the rehabilitation of
existing water and sanitation systems and for the development of new systems. There are two
main options for financing such projects: the Cohesion Fund (CF), with an 85% maximum EU co-
financing rate, and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), with a 75-85% maximum
EU co-financing rate. In 2007-2013, the Romanian authorities chose to create a specific OP for
the sector, OP Environment, in recognition of the need to invest massively in the co untry’s
water and sanitation infrastructure, as reflected also in the accession commitments made under
Chapter 22 (Environment) of the negotiations for joining the EU. OP Environment 2007-2013
received both CF and ERDF funding, though water and wastewater investments only drew funds
from the CF, with an 88.16% co-financing from the EU. 109 The policy sub-section below details
the main directives and respective targets for Romania. OP Environment had a total budget of
EUR 5.6 billion, with EUR 4.5 billion coming from the EU, and 60% of all funds available were

                                                                                                224
allocated to Axis 1, dedicated to water and wastewater infrastructure investments. With respect
to actual absorption, as of October 31, 2014, OP Environment registered the second poorest
performance, with only 38.7% (total reimbursement requests sent to the EU divided by the total
allocation available to the program).

422. EU financing for interventions in the water and sanitation sector was also made
available through the EU-funded National Rural Development Program (PNDR). This applied
particularly for rural areas. The coordination between OP Environment and the PNDR is
supposed to take place through the long-term investment plans prepared through the county-
level Master Plans on Water and Wastewater. As shown later on in this chapter, there are also
several state-budget-funded programs that support water and wastewater projects.

423. In short, the EU acts as a partner to the Romanian Government, offering assistance in
defining an EU-wide approach to water sector challenges and solutions, as well providing the
financial means to make progress toward set goals. As detailed later in the sub-sections
covering national and subnational players, the EU has had a tremendous impact on all
dimensions related to the development of Romania’s water and wastewater infrastructure:
policy and vision-setting; institutional mechanisms, including the set-up of regional operators
and the pursuit of projects involving substantial economies of scale; and direct funding.
The World Bank
424. In addition, there are multiple global actors that play a role in the water sector,
through a variety of functions, such as the World Bank.

The World Bank has financed projects through the RSDF all over the country




Note: The map illustrates all types of projects financed by the RSDF, i.e., not only water and wastewater projects, but
also investments in roads and social infrastructure.




                                                                                                                  225
The Bank has financed a variety of infrastructure projects, including in roads, water supply,
sanitation systems, and social infrastructure, with total financing since 1993 exceeding USD 1
billion. For example, the Bank has invested in rural communities’ water and sanitation systems
through the Social Inclusion Project, via in the Romanian Social Development Fund (RSDF). The
RSDF has financed roads primarily, but also 15 water supply projects (worth a total of USD 1.64
million) and 6 sanitation projects (worth a total of USD 719,000). Also, the Romania Integrated
Nutrient Pollution Control Project has invested in 70 other localities, across the whole country,
although it has only financed wastewater projects only in a handful of localities.


Other IFIs
425. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European
Investment Bank (EIB), and the Development Bank of the Council of Europe have also supported
this sector in Romania. The EBRD finances water and wastewater projects throughout the
region, with the aims of increasing the number of people with access to basic services,
decreasing water losses, increasing energy efficiency, and improving public actors’ capacity to
manage the sector. Only in 2012, the EBRD signed projects in six Romanian counties, totaling
close to EUR 70 million. 110 Similarly, the EIB has supported projects in the Cluj and Sălaj
Counties, with the explicit aim of helping Romania achieve the targets set through the acquis
communautaire. The EIB has taken on a broad mandate in supporting investments in the entire
water cycle, from water resources and supply, to wastewater collection, treatment and disposal,
coastal erosion, and flood control and protection. The EIB also notes that it has been “the
largest source of loan financing to the global water sector to date as compared to other
international financing institutions.” 111 Indeed, between 2008 and 2012, the EIB channeled EUR
17 billion to the sector, with 89% of the funds going to EU Member States. Last not but least, the
Development Bank of the Council of Europe has also financed similar interventions, covering the
rehabilitation of water and sewage systems in 17 communities across Romania in 2009. 112


B. National level
The Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (MECC)
426. At the national level, the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (MECC)
oversees the water and sanitation sector, particularly from the perspective of environmental
regulation. At a de jure level, the ministry is responsible for elaborating the national policies in
the environmental sector, including specific regulations and all required measures for
implementing the National Sustainable Development Strategy. The MECC covers a wide range of
key topics: sustainable development, climate change, environmental protection, protected
areas, pollution control, environmental impact assessments, soil, water, and forestry
management, fisheries, etc. As such, the main functions of the MECC are policy development,
coordination (at the national and supranational levels), regulation, financing, and monitoring
and control. At the same time, the MECC supervises directly several key players in the sector,
including the National Administration Romanian Waters (NARW), the National Environment
Protection Agency (with its subordinate regional and local bodies), the Danube Delta Reserve

Administration, the National Agency for Fishing and Aquaculture, the National Administration
for the Environment Fund, the National Forest Administration, the National Weather
Administration, and several research institutes. The Ministry also serves as the Managing
Authority for the OP Environment for the 2007-2013 programming period.


The National Administration Romanian Waters (NARW)
427. The National Administration Romanian Waters (NARW) is the water management
body in Romania, under the direct authority of the Ministry of Environment. NARW was
established through Government Decision (GD) 107/2002 and aims to “research, protect, value,
and promote the sustainable use of water resources, natural monopoly of strategic interest.” 113
It includes 11 subordinated Water Directorates, based on the location of the main rive rs: Someș-
Tisa, Crișuri, Mureș, Banat, Jiu, Olt, Argeș-Vedea, Buzău-Ialomița, Siret, Prut, and Dobrogea -
Litoral. The NARW applies the national strategy in the area of quantitative and qualitative
management of water resources, including specific knowledge, conservation, rational use,
environmental protection, and implementation of relevant EU legislation. The Administration is
also the only authorized operator of water resources, both surface and underground waters,
and of related infrastructure, such as dams, channels, and water monitoring systems. The NARW
can decide to grant to other actors, under specific conditions, the right to use certain water
resources.

The Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA)
428. Also at the national level, the Ministry of Regional Development and Public
Administration (MRDPA) has played the main role in financing investments in the water and
wastewater infrastructure. Law 51/2006 on public services, Article 12, identifies the MRDPA as
specialty central authority in charge of “analyses, syntheses, decision-making, coordination,
monitoring, and planning at the central level for public utility community services” – including
water and wastewater. The same act lists the main responsibilities of the MRDPA in this sector,
which include:
     Development and promotion of the national strategy for community public utility
        services;
     Development and promotion of relevant sectoral strategies;
     Justification, approval, and coordination of priority-setting in the allocation of central
        government resources ;
     Monitoring, centralization, and evaluation of performance indicators;
     Coordination and monitoring of governmental investment programs in the sector,
        including programs implemented with external assistance from the EU or IFIs;
     Collaboration with local authorities in the area of public services.

429. It is particularly noteworthy that the MRDPA is formally assigned the coordination
role for infrastructure investment programs, regardless of the source of financing. For one, the
Ministry has implemented its own programs. Through 2012, the MRDPA – at that time, the
Ministry of Regional Development and Tourism (MRDT) – implemented the Program for the
Rehabilitation of Water Supply, Wastewater, and Water/Wastewater Treatment Systems, which
targeted localities with fewer than 50,000 residents. Mainly through two rounds of financing

113
      See http://www.rowater.ro/Descrierea%20activitatii/Forms/AllItems.aspx


                                                                                             227
from the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB), the program aimed to contribute to
Romania’s fulfillment of EU requirements (particularly Directives 98/83 a nd 921/271). The total
value of the program was EUR 208 million for phase 1 (2007-2009) and EUR 232.9 million for
phase 2 (post 2009). For the first phase, the selection criteria include a long list of options, from
“fulfillment of Romania’s obligations under the acquis communautaire ” to improvement in
water quality, lack of other available financing, reduction in water losses, lower O&M costs, etc.
For the second phase, the program explicitly mentioned the need to correlate the selection and
prioritization of investments with regional water and wastewater master plans. The program
also noted that localities were chosen in close cooperation with the Ministry of the
Environment, County Councils, and Local Councils to avoid financing overlaps and
inefficiencies. 114 Through 2012, 37 projects had been finished. 115

430. The main infrastructure development program currently led by the MRDPA is the
National Local Development Program (PNDL). As noted elsewhere, the PNDL includes several
programs that had previously operated as separate initiatives. For the water and wastewater
sector, the predecessor of PNDL was the GD 577/1997 program, which targeted investments in
Romanian villages. 116 Much like the PNDL, the GD 577/1997 included a list of relatively vague
selection criteria, such as infrastructure gaps, balanced regional development, number of
residents and households, sustainable development, social and economic cohesion, and the
status of technical-economic documentation (e.g., feasibility study, detailed technical design,
etc.). Given the lack of clarity around such criteria, the choice of investments was largely left to
county councils, though the final formal decision belonged to the Ministry, as the primary
stakeholder responsible for the program’s implementation ( ordonator principal de credite ). As
for the PNDL, its implementation framework is described in detail in an earlier chapter.
Nevertheless, through the PNDL, the MRDPA continues to play the main role in developing the
water and wastewater infrastructure across Romania, aside from the funds allocated by the EU.

The National Authority for Regulating Public Utility Community Services (ANRSC)
431. Last but not least, the National Authority for Regulating Public Utility Community
Services (ANRSC), subordinated to the MRDPA, is responsible for the proper delivery of public
services, including water and sanitation. The ANRSC proposes the framework for setting tariffs
and fees related to public services delivery (according to GD 1591/2002), grants licenses to
operators, develops methodologies and performance indicators, and monitors the delivery of
public utility services. Based on Law 241/2006 from February 2013, which regulates the
provision of water and wastewater services, the Authority is also in charge with disseminating
best practices among public authorities and developing an integrated database to continuously
monitor and compare the performance of various licensed operators.

432. On tariffs specifically, an issue worth noting is the practice of single rates, regardless
of location. This means that, for the same quantity of water consumed in the network
corresponding to a single regional operator, a resident of a rural village may pay as much as one

in a large city. The high rates have reduced the appetite of the rural population to connect to
water supply and sanitation networks, which further reduces the sustainability of the entire
system in rural localities. In reality, however, all regional companies use a form of cross-subsidy
on tariffs. Usually the tariffs that can be charged in cities are much lower than the tariffs that
can be charged in less dense rural areas, because of economies of scale. Consequently, the tariff
is brought up in cities and down in rural areas for a single tariff. Most rural areas consequently
pay less than they normally should. In addition, by law, public authorities can provide their own
subsidies for water and wastewater if they think this is necessary, particularly for special cases
(e.g., where household income is below a certain threshold). At the same time, keeping in mind
mid and long-term sustainability, in low-density areas, alternative individual systems (compared
to extensions of existing networks) should be analyzed to identify the most cost-effective
solutions.

C. Regional level
433. There are three key players at the level of each county, as warranted by the OP
Environment 2007-2013: an Intercommunity Development Association (IDA), a Regional
Operator, and a Delegation Contract for the Services, signed between the IDA and the
operator. Put differently, if local authorities wanted to access funds through the Environment
OP – essentially, the main source of investment funding for water and sanitation infrastructure
for the 2007-2013 programming period – they had to create the conditions for establishing all
three aforementioned components. This has dramatically changed the institutional framework
of Romania’s water and sanitation sector, encouraging cooperation among local authorities,
encouraging more effective knowledge sharing, and facilitating economies of scale and lower
standard and maximum costs in the delivery of basic public services.


Intercommunity Development Associations (IDAs)
434. The county-level Intercommunity Development Association (IDA) brings together local
authorities interested in delivering services jointly and/or seeking to undertake common
investment projects. Membership in an IDA is usually open to all localities that seek to join (e.g.,
the county council, the local council of the county residence, and the local councils of other
towns and communes). IDAs are non-profit organization, regulated by Ordinance 26/2000 for
NGOs and Foundations. The mission, objectives, and activities of IDAs are roughly similar across
all counties. For example, IDA Water and Sanitation (ADIAC) A rad was established “with the aim
of regulating, establishing, organizing, financing, exploiting, monitoring, and managing jointly
the water and wastewater services for members and for completing certain public investment
projects […] based on the relevant development strategy.”117 In practice, more and more
localities have decided to join IDAs in recent years, as the benefits of increased access to
financing for infrastructure projects and improved quality of service have become more obvious.


Regional Operators (ROs)
435. Equally important, 42 “regional operators” (ROs) have been established since before
2009, as part of a “regionalization process” sparked by the conditionalities of accessing OP
Environment funds. Local authorities received pre-accession funding to support the
development of ROs, as an attempt to address the pressing issues of the water and sanitation

sector: high degree of fragmentation, lack of economies of scale, low profitability or even
significant losses, mounting debt, decaying infrastructure and lack of funding for investment
projects, low coverage rates (compared to EU averages) for water supply and especially
sanitation, etc. The idea was to create more powerful and accountable entities that could design
and implement investment projects and also deliver better services to consumers. To this day,
around 10% of the country – according to unofficial ANRSC estimates – is covered not by ROs,
but by other smaller companies. Data from these smaller players is often hard to get, so it may
be that Romania is actually somewhat closer to the 2018 targets than typically believed in
reference only to data from the 42 ROs.

436. Currently, each of the 42 ROs is a commercial entity and includes multiple
shareholders, i.e., public authorities at the city/commune and county level, though county
councils typically hold the vast majority of shares. For cost-efficiency reasons and, most
localities have opted to cede the operation of water and wastewater systems to one of the ROs
– typically, the same operator covers an entire county – but there are also exceptions to this
rule. For example, there are some localities that have decided to manage and operate their own
systems, while others have decided to cede the operation to companies from other counties
(e.g., RAJA Constanța serves over 1 million customers across seven counties, namely Constanța,
Ialomița, Ilfov, Călărași, Dâmbovița, Brașov, and Prahova). Still, overall, the coverage of the RO
has expanded: between 2009 and 2010, for instance, the total number of localities covered
increased by 5.4%, from 955 to 1007. 118 That said, a number of large municipalities, including
București and Ploiești, continue to prefer to have their own dedicated operators.
Regional Operators typically encompass the territory of a single county

437. Available data on the 2010 revenues and expenditures of ROs show that most of them
appear to be profitable, though obviously this is only a snapshot in time . The only exceptions
are the ROs in Târgu Mureș and Bistrița Năsăud, but even these incurred relatively low losses
(RON 1 million and RON 143,000, respectively). From this perspective, the regionalization effort
appears to have been a success in the short term, at least with respect to the balancing of
current revenues and expenditures at the level of each RO. This is particularly important given
the limited budgetary envelope of local authorities. By contrast, if ROs were operating at a loss –
as before the regionalization reforms that allowed for cost efficiencies and economies of scale –
this would have put significant strain on local budgets. The important caveat is that additional
expenses may be incurred going forward, as an increasing number of projects will need to be
finalized to come close to the EU acquis targets. It will be interesting to track how the
profitability and affordability data may change as the systems continue to grow.

438. In the absence of a more complete review, it is harder to make definitive statements
about the ability of ROs to make investments in new or upgraded water supply and sanitation
infrastructure. The tariffs are supposed to cover both O&M and needed capital expenditures,
and in practice most operators have tried to obtain grant funding or non-commercial loans to
support capital investments – it remains to be seen if the evolution of tariffs will still cover the
higher O&M costs of the expanded system going forward. Despite the sector’s significant needs
in essentially every county, some ROs have had very poor results in absorbing EU grants
available through OP Environment, as shown in the table below. Moreover, the funds available
for the 2007-2013 programming period appear highly insufficient compared to the total
investment needs for water and sanitation infrastructure in each county. This situation will not
change for the 2014-2020 budgeting cycle; EU funds can only cover so much of Romania’s needs
in the sector, so alternative sources of funding – state budget, PPPs, etc. – will need to be
identified if the country is to fulfill its obligations under the EU acquis by 2018.

County Councils
439. Last but not least, County Councils can play a critical role at the county level, not just
as shareholders of the RO and members of the IDA, but also as a key decision -maker and
funder of hard infrastructure investments. As noted elsewhere, County Councils are entrusted
under the PNDL to prioritize proposals from the local level and forward them to the Ministry,
which ultimately has the last word on selecting the investments that receive financing in a given
calendar year. In practice, county councils’ list of proposals is typically approved as is by the


                                                                                                     234
MRDPA, in recognition of the principle of subsidiarity and of the fact that local needs are better
understood at the county level. County councils also play a role in monitoring approved PNDL
projects and are supposed to be informed of all payment requests going from the local level to
the Ministry. In practice, in some cases, evidence gathered through field visits suggests that
certain county councils co-finance investments in water and sanitation infrastructure at the level
of communes. For example, if a commune allocates part of its local budget to finish up a project
started under a program financed by the central government, the county council will contribute
some of its own funds to help the local authority complete the investment.


Other regional players
440. For one, Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) are responsible for drafting Regional
Development Plans (RDPs) corresponding to seven-year programming periods (e.g., 2007-
2013, 2014-2020, etc.). While this document is not mandatory per se, it draws the main
investment priorities in a region, based on inputs gathered from local and county authorities. As
such, together with the master plans for water and wastewater, RDPs can guide the selection of
particular projects for upgrades/extensions/new developments of water supply and sanitation
systems.

441. At the level of each county, there are a range of deconcentrated institutions,
essentially county-level branches of national bodies. These include: County Environment
Protection Agencies, County Environmental Commissariats (under the National and Regional
Environmental Agency), subunits of the Romanian Waters National Administration (Water
Directorates, Water Management Systems), etc. Essentially, these bodies apply the mandate of
the national-level organizations that they represent at the county level. There are also Regional
Environment Protection Agencies – under the National Environment Protection Agency,
subordinated to the MECC – that coordinate the development and monitoring of regional action
plans for environmental protection, track progress toward fulfilling EU-level commitments, and
also act as Intermediate Bodies for the 2007-2013 Environment OP.


D. Local level
442. Local stakeholders include local councils and Mayors, as the elected decision -making
authorities at the level of cities, towns, and communes. They are responsible for delivering
public services to citizens in their respective communities and act as beneficiaries of
investments, regardless of the source of financing (i.e., EU structural funds or the state budget).
Local councils play the main role especially in the early stages of an investment: they initiate the
project and the development of technical documentation, often from their own local budget
(e.g., pre-feasibility and feasibility studies); they apply for funding, typically for PNDL, PNDR, or
OP Environment/ OP Large Infrastructure funds; once grated financing, they are fully responsible
for managing and implementing the project, running all the required public procurement
procedures, handling the relationship with service providers and contractors, and monitoring
progress on the ground; depending on requirements specific to each source of financing, local
authorities also need to oversee ex-post monitoring and evaluation and ensure that project
indicators are fulfilled.




                                                                                                 235
443. Once the investment is completed, most local authorities cede operation and
maintenance (O&M), along with corresponding revenues, to the RO. This is a requirement for
accessing funds under OP Environment, going along with the effort to reduce the sector’s
fragmentation and improve its profitability. Under PNDR, local authorities have the option to
run the systems themselves, but they need to prove as part of the application process that this
is a feasible option – e.g., sufficient own resources to cover O&M expenditures, sufficient
number of customers to enable the systems’ proper operation, etc. The PNDL does not
specifically address the issue, leaving the choice entirely up to local authorities. In practice, as
revealed during field visits, there are examples of local councils that decide to transfer to ROs
the operation and maintenance of completed projects.


Legal Framework

A. European level
444. As an EU member since January 2007, Romania has committed to abiding by the full
body of European laws, including directives that concern the water and sanitation sector and
set clear quantitative targets for what Member States need to accomplish.


The Drinking Water Directive
445. First, the Drinking Water Directive (98/83/EEC) aims “to protect human health from
adverse effects of any contamination of water intended for human consumption by ensuring
that it is wholesome and clean.” 119 For this purpose, Member States are to monitor at least 48
parameters for all distribution systems that serve more than 50 people or supply more than 10
cubic meters per day, as well as all for all water supplied as part of an economic activity. 120 The
directive further lays out provisions for proper planning, regulation, monitoring, and reporting.
The same directive notes that derogations from its provisions are possible, as follows: the first
two, each limited to a maximum of three years, are the responsibility of Member States; a third
“exceptional” derogation can be granted by the EC. In the case of Romania, as noted in the
country’s EU Accession Treaty, the derogations for achieving the Directive’s targets are as
follows:
          Agglomerations with less than 10,000 inhabitants
              — Oxidisability: December 31, 2010
              — Ammonium, nitrates, turbidity, aluminums, iron, lead, cadmium, and pesticides:
                 December 31, 2015

          Agglomerations with 10,000-100,000 inhabitants
              — Oxidisability and turbidity: December 31, 2010
              — Ammonium, nitrates, aluminum, iron, lead, cadmium, pesticides, and
                 manganese: December 31, 2015

          Agglomerations with more than 100,000 inhabitants

               — Oxidisability, ammonium, aluminum, pesticides, iron, and manganese:
                 December 31, 2010
In the June 2014 EC report on “The Quality of Drinking Water in the EU,” Romania’s
performance is good with respect to large water supplies (95-99% compliant with the directive)
and less so for small water supplies (under 90% compliant). Romania is also last when it comes
to the percentage of the population connected to the public water supply network, with only
56.5% connection rate (2011 data) and way behind the second to last Member State, Latvia, at
75%.


The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive
446. Second, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC) seeks to “protect
the environment from urban wastewater discharges and discharges from certain industrial
sectors.”121 In short, the Directive mandates: the Collection and treatment of wastewater in all
agglomerations of more than 2,000 population equivalent (p.e.); secondary treatment of all
discharges from agglomerations of over 2,000 p.e. and more advanced treatment for
agglomerations of over 10,000 population equivalent in sensitive areas and their catchments;
pre-authorization of all discharges of urban wastewater, of discharges from the food-processing
industry, and of industrial discharges into urban wastewater collection systems; monitoring of
the performance of treatment plants and receiving waters; and controls of sewage sludge
disposal and reuse, and treated wastewater reuse when possible. The text of the Directive was
formally adopted in 1993, with an implementation timeline of up to the end of 2005. For
Romania and other new EU Member States, however, a different timetable was set at the time
of accession.

447. Interestingly, Romania has the second-highest investment needs in urban water
treatment systems, only surpassed by Poland, which covers, nonetheless, a larger area. The
total sum needed to fully implement the directive in Romania exceeds EUR 10 billion, as shown
in the chart below, based on estimates done at the time of the country’s accession. Recognizing
the fact that this requires a substantial financial effort, the EC agreed through the Treaty of
Accession to an implementation timeline adjusted to Romania’s specific needs and capacity. In
hindsight, it appears that even the adjusted schedule was overly ambitious and the country is
facing a high risk of breaking the commitments it made for the water and sanitation sector
through the EU Accession Agreement.

448. The requirements of the Urban Waste Water Directive will apply fully to Romania
starting on December 31, 2018, but there is also a schedule of intermediate targets, as
presented in the table below.
Key requirements of the Urban Waste Water Directive
                     Article                                   Timetable
 Article 3: All agglomerations over 2,000 p.e.  By December 31, 2013: compliance for all
 provided with collecting systems for urban      agglomerations of more than 10,000 p.e.
 wastewater
                                                Minimum overall population equivalent
                                                 rates:
                                                    o By December 31, 2010: 61%
                                                    o By December 31, 2013: 69%
                                                    o By December 31, 2015: 80%
 Article 4: All agglomerations over 2,000 p.e.  Minimum overall population equivalent
 provided with secondary treatment before        rates:
 discharge of urban wastewater entering             o By December 31, 2010: 51%

 Article 5 (2): All agglomerations of more          o By December 31, 2015: 77%
 than 10,000 p.e. provided with stringent
 (tertiary) treatment of urban wastewater
 entering collecting systems before discharge
 into sensitive areas



                                                                                      238
Essentially, by December 31, 2018, Romania needs to provide all agglomerations (i.e.,
settlements) with more than 2,000 p.e. with proper infrastructure for the collection and
treatment of urban wastewater. The Directive does allow for some exceptions to this rule,
where particular contextual elements do not justify investments in such systems, though any
such cases need to be properly justified by in-depth studies. What happens if Romania misses
the intermediate targets? It is unclear if the EC would launch any sanctions and, in practice,
there do not appear to be any current assessments of Romania’s progress in reaching set goals:
the latest synthesis reports available from the Commission, published in 2013, use 2009 dat a
and specifically recognize that Romania’s first compliance deadlines were only in 2010 (i.e., after
the data collected).

449. As of 2011, only 57% of households were connected to public water supply and only
42% were connected to wastewater treatment plants (lowest and second-lowest figures,
respectively, among all Member States). 122 This means that Romania has already failed on
reaching the intermediate target of 61% connection rate for urban wastewater treatment by the
end of 2010 and it is bound to miss 2018 targets too. The substantial gap of nearly 20% between
realized and target values questions the likelihood of reaching set goals by 2013, 2015, and 2018
respectively. At the same time, the experience of other Member States like Greece, Spain, and
Italy teaches that Romania does risk sanctions if it fails to reach the 2018 targets.


The Water Framework Directive
450. Third, in October 2000, the EU Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) was adopted
with the aim of establishing an integrated framework “for the pr otection of inland surface
waters, transitional waters, coastal waters, and groundwater.” 123 In short, the directive seeks
to achieve good ecological status for all water bodies in the EU. The specific aims of the
Directive are multifold: to prevent further deterioration; to promote sustainable water use; to
progressively reduce discharges as well as the pollution of ground water; and to mitigate effects
of floods and droughts. Member states are required to identify individual river basins (article 3)
and assign them to districts and corresponding competent authorities for the management of
such districts. Member states also need to present for each river basin a programme of
measures and a river basin management plan including the following: general characteristics;
mapping of locations, boundaries, ecoregions, etc.; summary of impact of human activity on
surface water and groundwater; a register of protected areas that require special attention for
the conservation of habitats and species; mapping of monitoring networks; list of environmental
objectives; economic analysis of water use; summary of programme of measures, taking into
account the principle of recovery of costs; register of detailed programmes and management
plans for particular sub-basins/sectors; summary of public consultations; list of competent
authorities; monitoring and control data and procedures.

451. Romania has made progress in implementing the EU Water Framework Directive
(WFD), both with respect to the development of river and sub-river basin management plans
and in terms of putting in place the institutional architecture required for the implementation
of measures. The legislative framework was set in place by mid-2004, followed by an analysis of

                                                                                               239
the main characteristics of Romania’s water basins by the end of 2004. Romania has a single
river basin district for the Danube River, sharing courses with Serbia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Ukraine,
and Moldova (there are a total of 19 countries in the entire river basin). The river basin district
of Romania is further divided into 11 sub-river basin management plans: Someș-Tisa, Crișuri,
Mureș, Banat, Jiu, Olt, Argeș Vedea, Buzău Ialomița, Siret, Prut, and Dobrogea Litoral. By the end
of 2006, Romania developed required monitoring mechanisms and also published the draft
programme of measures. The management plan was finalized in December 2009. Romania has
committed to reaching a good state for 60% of the surface waters, groundwater, and protected
areas by December 2015 (i.e., fifteen years after the adoption of the directive), with potential
derogations through December 2021/2027 under justified circumstances, based on Article 4 (4)
and 4 (5). Annex V of the WFD 2000/60/EC provides detailed indicators for assessing the status
of a particular body of water. As for the institutional framework designed to implement the
WFD, the National Administration Romanian Waters (NARW) plays the central role in overseeing
the directorates of 11 sub-basins and in liaising with other stakeholders at the national and
supranational level.
Romania features a complex institutional structure for the implementation of the Water
Framework Directive

Other EU policies
452. Finally, the EU has a number of other policies, communications, and positions related
to the water sector, though less relevant for water and sanitation infrastructure per se. These
cover topics such as bathing water quality, industrial emissions, agriculture/ nitrates, chemical
status, water scarcity and droughts, flood risk management, water eurobarometers for
quantifying customer satisfaction with water services, etc.


B. National level
453. As an EU Member State, Romania is required to transpose into national legislation the
requirements of the acquis communautaire, including the key directives referenced above.
This was accomplished mainly through the following legal acts: Law 458/2002 on the quality of
drinking water (enacting the Drinking Water Directive 98/83/EEC) and Government Decision
(GD) 188/2002 (corresponding to the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive 91/271/EEC).

454. In addition, the national legal framework includes a number of important provisions
that shape the functioning of the water and sanitation sector. The Law on Local Public
Administration (Law 215/2001) mandates local public authorities to manage the provision of
public services to residents, including public utility community services such as water supply,
natural gas, sanitation, waste collection, district heating, public lig hting, and local public
transport” (article 36). Further, Law 51/2006 for community services of public utility defines the
main services and principles of their provision, relevant public authorities, management
procedures, operators, users, financing of services, and applicable sanctions for breaches of the
legal provisions in the sector. Article 8 specifically mentions that the establishment,
organization, coordination, and functioning of public services are exclusively under the mandate
of local public authorities, while regulation, monitoring, and control are competences shared
with the national government.

455. The main law applicable to water and wastewater services was adopted in 2006 (Law
241/2006) and defines a comprehensive framework for the establish ment, functioning,
monitoring, and control of the sector. The law defines several important aspects, as
summarized below:
     Principles of service provision (Article 7): safety; equitable tariffs; profitability, quality,
       and efficiency; transparency and public ownership, including public consultations with
       associations, labor unions, users, etc.; continuity (quantity and quality); adaptability to
       user preferences; equal accessibility, on a contractual basis; and adherence to formal
       water management, environmental, and health regulations.

       Performance indicators (Article 8): The services provided must meet a set of
        performance indicators, as defined in the framework agreement for service provision
        (proposed by the National Authority for Regulating Public Utility Community Services –
        ANRSC and approved by local authorities).

       Investment programs (Articles 9-12): Deliberative bodies at the local level (i.e., Local
        Councils) approve investment strategies and programs, in accordance with “local urban
        and territorial development plans, development programs of the respective territorial
        administrative unit, and international commitments in the area of environmental


                                                                                                 241
           protection.”125 Local development strategies are supposed to promote investments into
           the expansion and modernization of current water and sanitation systems and ensure
           equal access for community members. The Law encourages local authorities and
           Intercommunity Development Associations (IDAs) to design, implement, and
           continuously monitor investment programs, based on multiannual strategic planning.
           Local authorities also play the main role in approving such investment programs, at all
           stages (technical documentation, financing, implementation of contracted works,
           direct/delegated operation and maintenance).

          Management and operations of existing systems (Articles 17-25): There are two options
           available to local public authorities: direct (self) or delegated management. The choice is
           based on a detailed study and public consultations that take into account local needs,
           size and characteristics of localities, the status of existing water and sanitation systems,
           local capacity to finance the operation and expansion of the infrastructure. Under direct
           management, an operator established by a particular local authority is responsible for
           operating the system, and any profits carry over to the next fiscal year as earmarked
           funds that are to be used by the same operator. For delegated management, the option
           preferred by most local authorities, a separate operator is hired – by a local authority of
           by the IDA – based on a framework delegation contract. Specific procurement law
           provisions apply, though direct (non-competitive) concession of operations is possible in
           the case of a Regional Operator established by the same local authorities.
          Responsibilities of local authorities (Article 24): The law clearly notes that a delegation
           contract does not void the responsibilities of local authorities in the provision of water
           and wastewater services. They must also constantly monitor how the operators are
           fulfilling their contractual obligations, including clear performance standards. Local
           authorities also verify the operators’ management of assets, including completion of
           maintenance work, expansions, etc.

          Responsibilities of operators (Article 27): Most of the tasks assigned to operators
           concern the actual operation and maintenance of the system, including strict monitoring
           of the quality of services provided. There are no clear provisions requiring operators to
           make investments in new or upgraded infrastructure.

          User rights and obligations (Articles 28-31): Users can be individual households or
           institutions/organizations (public or private) and have a guaranteed right to
           nondiscriminatory access, under their specific contractual conditions. The law also
           defines a set of sanctions applicable to users who break agreed standards (e.g., unlawful
           discharges, etc.). Importantly, it is the right of every user to have an individual meter,
           and the costs for the equipment and its installation are supposed to be reimbursed by
           the operator.

          Financing (Articles 35-37): ANRSC is responsible for setting the procedures for setting,
           adjusting, or changing tariffs. Local authorities – directly in the case of self-management
           or indirectly in the case of delegated management, through an IDA – approve tariffs and
           any changes in the tariff structure. For operators participating in programs financed by

125
      See Law 241/2006, Article 11


                                                                                                   242
           external partners, ANRSC is responsible for approving tariffs. Article 37 clarifies another
           critical point: “The financing of investments for establishing, developing, rehabilitating,
           and modernizing water and sanitation system is under the mandate of local public
           authorities. Depending on specific contractual clauses, the responsibility of financing
           investments can be transferred to the operator.” 126 Under delegated management, any
           subsidies grated to the operator are supposed to lead to a reduction of the tariff and/or
           an improvement in service quality, proportional to the subsidy granted.

          Sanctions: The same act describes the main sanctions for various unlawful acts (e.g.,
           pollution, destruction of infrastructure, operating with required licenses, etc.).

456. In addition, there are a number of other laws and norms that influence the provision
of water and sanitation services. It is beyond the scope of this report to provide a full and
comprehensive review of such legislation. The following are some of the more important acts
that guide the sector’s functioning:
     Minister Order 88/2007 for approving the framework for the water and sanitation public
        service includes: provisions on safety (e.g., technical requirements for pipes, recording
        of potential irregularities, operator obligations, etc.); water supply services (e.g.,
        catchment, treatment, transport of drinkable/industrial water, storage, distribution and
        losses, etc.); sanitation services (e.g., collection, transport, and evacuation of
        wastewater, maintenance work, wastewater treatment, management of sludge, etc.);
        performance indicators; etc.
          Minister Orders 89 and 90/2007 define the template for the contract between local
           authorities or Intercommunity Development Associations (IDAs) and operators,
           providing a standard form to be used during tendering procedures. This includes a
           number of minimum requirements for both water supply and sanitation services,
           helping to ensure that whichever companies are eventually selected abide by a set of
           common required norms. Neither act makes a clear mention of operators’
           responsibilities when it comes to making investments from its own budget for the
           upgrade and/or expansion of networks. This maintains clauses expressed in other laws,
           whereby local authorities have full responsibility over infrastructure investments, unless
           otherwise agreed with particular operators, on a case by case basis. However,
           operations and maintenance work is clearly under an operator’s mandate.
          Minister Order 140/2003 establishes the procedure and requirements for obtaining a
           license to perform a number of services in the water and sanitation sector. Some of the
           criteria deployed in deciding on the licensing of a particular applicant include:
           completeness of the application; managerial capacity; financial capacity; potential to
           ensure quality services; energy efficiency, etc.
          Minister Order 65/2007 describes how tariffs for water and sanitation services are to be
           set, in pursuit of three main objectives: financial viability of operator, user rights
           (including affordability), and environmental protection. Tariffs are supposed to include
           production and operation costs (including potential water losses, justified according to
           the technical state of the network), maintenance and repairs, and a “development
           quota” (DQ). The DQ is optional and can be proposed by the RO, though ultimately its

126
      See Law 241/2006 (Article 37)


                                                                                                  243
          approval is at the discretion of local authorities. The sums collected as such go into a
          separate fund meant to support additional investments for improving service quality. 127
          Interestingly, Article 10 requires ROs that benefit from external grants (e.g., EU funds) to
          charge a single tariff for the entire area that they cover. The same act also stipulates the
          specific conditions that have to be met before tariffs can be adjusted – for example, if a
          new component of the network is launched and the quality of water delivered increases
          substantially, there are sufficient grounds for increasing tariffs after the new component
          is operational. 128
         GEO 198/2005 sets the parameters of for the “establishment, financing, and use of the
          Fund for Maintenance, Replacement, and Development (II D).”129 The IID provisions only
          apply to operators that have benefited from EU or other form of external grants and/or
          loans. IID funds are held in a separate account, financed from sources such as a share of
          the operators’ net profits, local authorities’ budgets, income from leased goods, interest
          earned on IID funds, VAT, etc. The purpose of the IID is to act as a backup fund for
          covering various expenses, in the following order of priority: loans and other associated
          fees incurred as part of co-financing EU-funded investment projects; ineligible
          expenditures resulting from the implementation of such projects; funds (including VAT)
          for maintenance, replacement, and development of leased assets, based on an annual
          investment program proposed by the operator and approved by the corresponding local
          authorities. It remains to be determined if the IID funds available are generally sufficient
          to cover needed investments.

457. Finally, a range of other legal provisions help regulate the water and sanitation sector
and the corresponding infrastructure works for expanding/modernizing the current network.
For example, there are numerous environmental provisions per se, including on the Law on
Water (Law 107/1996, with subsequent adjustments), the Law on Wastewater Discharge (GD
352/2005), norms on supervision, inspection, and monitoring of water quality (GD 974/2004),
the Environmental Protection Law 265/2006, regulations on environmental assessments (GD
1076/2004, GD 1213/2006, etc.), protected areas (GD 930/2005), environmental audits
(Minister Order 184/1997), environmental licensing (MO 1798/2007), public consultations in the
environmental sector (GD 564/2006), pollution prevention law (GEO 152/2005), bathing water
quality (GD 459/2002), etc. There are also key provisions in Romania’s administrative law,
defining what local authorities can and cannot do (e.g., GEO 34/2006 on public procurement,
Law 215/2001 on local public administration, GEO 54/2006 on leasing public assets, etc.). Last
but not least, actual infrastructure works are governed by the fundamental Law 10/1995 on
quality in construction, along with a range of specific norms and standards.


C. Local level
458. The Local level implements the national legislation in the water and sanitation sector
through Local Council Decisions. Local authorities cannot deviate from the provisions set by the
central level, though, as noted above, they do have some leeway in how they apply them. To
cite an earlier example, they could chose to run their own operator, without delegating t his

service to an IDA-contracted company. They can also influence the level of tariffs and are the
ones responsible for major capital expenses.

459. All in all, while this section cannot cover the full body of laws that govern Romania’s
public infrastructure investments in the water and wastewater sector, it provides a clear
indication regarding the system’s complexity . In no small part, the current laws are influenced
by EU-level directives, as mentioned earlier. Based on this foundation, the next section turns to
the various strategies that guide the sector’s development, from the supra -national down to the
national, regional, and local level.



Strategies and Plans

A. EU level
460. Compared to other sectors where synergies between Member States are critical (e.g.,
connective infrastructure), there is less need for the EU to have an active role in shaping and
coordinating Member States ’ investments in water and sanitation infrastructure. As such,
there is no grand strategy at the EU level to cover this sector. Moreover, the Europe 2020
strategy, which is meant to guide the EU’s development for the 2014 -2020 programming period,
does not include a specific focus on water and sanitation among its key priorities (smart,
sustainable, and inclusive growth) and main targets (employment, R&D, climate change and
energy sustainability, education, and fighting poverty and social exclusion). In part, this is
because the strategy is forward-thinking and less focused on basic needs like water supply and
wastewater systems. Indeed, most EU members have largely addressed such issues and can
focus on more “sophisticated” growth measures. The only flagship initiative related to the
Europe 2020 strategy that mentions something related to the water sector is the “Resource -
Efficient Europe,” though it deals specifically more with water quality and less with actual
infrastructure projects.

461. In the case of Romania, addressing persistent basic service needs is a required key
step in reaching the Europe 2020 targets. This remains fundamentally true, even if it is not
spelled out in the Romania-specific recommendations resulting from the Europe 2020 strategy.
For example, providing people in rural areas with access to water and sanitation infrastructure
enables them to focus more of their time on productive activities and can also attract higher
levels of investment – both of these effects can contribute to an increase in employment. The
same goes for fulfilling the objectives on fighting poverty and social inclusion; without proper
access to basic services, Roma and other disadvantaged groups cannot fully access educational
opportunities and cannot properly compete on the labor market. Breaking the vicious cycle of
poverty and discrimination cannot happen in the absence of investments in water a nd
wastewater infrastructure.

B. National level
The Romania-EU Partnership Agreement (PA)
462. First and foremost, the Romania-EU Partnership Agreement (PA), as the key document
defining how the country will spend $50 billion over the next seven years, referen ces gaps in


                                                                                             245
water and wastewater infrastructure as one of the main challenges to Romania’s growth. This
fits under the Thematic Objective 6 on preserving and protecting the environment and
promoting resource efficiency. The agreement recognizes that such basic needs continue to
persist, especially in rural areas and pockets of urban poverty, despite the fact that both state-
budget and EU-funds have been channeled to the sector during the previous programming
period (2007-2013). In specific figures, the document notes that the full implementation of the
Water Framework Directive requires an addition €4.236 billion for improving drinking water
quality and €8.378 billion for wastewater collection and treatment. 130 On the prioritization of
investments, the same document specifies that this will be done based on updated versions of
Regional Master Plans in the water and wastewater sector. Regarding agglomerations under
2,000 p.e., these are not considered a high priority – given the need to reach the water and
wastewater targets in Romania’s Accession Agreement – though “support can be provided [to
these communities] in exceptional situations, consistently with the Master Plans and based on a
sound technical and economic justification, only for centralized systems.” 131

463. Importantly, the PA notes that national budget funds are expected to fill the financing
gap in the sector, “[following] the same procedures, indicators, and rules applied in the frame
of European Structural and Investment Funds.” 132 One of the reasons cited for the need to
ensure coordination is the fact that the Romanian Government has previously implemented
programs that competed with EU-funded schemes “in a counterproductive way.” 133 The
document goes on to say that “Romania will align the conditions of th e concerned national
funding schemes with those ruling access to ESI Funds, in terms of policy conditions
(regionalization framework in water and waste sector), the quality of the technical and
economic evaluation of projects, and the financing rates.” 134 One easy way to accomplish this
task is to channel national budget funds to the co-financing of EU-funded projects. Put
differently, the government could finance 20-30% of the costs of a project (higher than the
minimum co-financing threshold), ensuring that EU funds can cover a larger total number of
investments. This possibility can be further explored in future iterations of this report.


The National Sustainable Development Strategy 2013-2020-2030
464. Internally, Romania’s main strategic document in the envi ronment sector is the
“National Sustainable Development Strategy 2013 -2020-2030,” completed in 2008 with
assistance from UNDP. Under the current situation diagnostic chapter, the document notes that
Romania still faces tremendous challenges in terms of basic infrastructure, citing the common
statistics on the coverage of water and sanitation systems, wastewater discharges, and the
quality of water supplied (in 2008, a quarter of the localities between 50 and 5,000 people had
inadequate water quality). Under the chapter on target objectives and actions for 2013-2020-
2030, the strategy includes a sub-heading on “Conservation and Management of Natural
Resources,” with a national objective to “reduce the gap compared to other EU Member States
with respect to environment-related infrastructure, in terms of both quantity and quality, by

developing efficient public services.” 135 The document explicitly draws from EU-level directives
and targets, noting the massive financing needs in the sector, but does not go further in
prioritizing investments or in suggesting specific funding streams. That said, the National
Sustainable Development Strategy 2013-2020-2030 has several key merits: first, it properly
reflects the need to invest in water and sanitation infrastructure to close the gap between
Romania and other EU Member States; second, it specifically correlates with EU policies,
programs, and targets in the sector, while citing other documents that will be revised over the
coming years (e.g., management plans for river basins, flood and hazard maps, etc.).


The Governing Program 2013-2016
465. The Governing Program 2013-2016 establishes the policy agenda and priorities for
Romania for the short and medium-term, as set out by the current cabinet (as of October
2014). Water and sanitation infrastructure needs are mentioned repeatedly and, as elsewhere,
they are put in the context of broader EU requirements. For example, under the “water and
forestry” chapter, one of the action items for water management is to “finalize the invest ment
projects for water supply, sewage, and water treatment plants with the aim of implementing EU
water directives and to fulfill European and international commitments.” 136 A similar objective
shows up again in the chapters on the “environment” and on “minorities”, in relation to the
need for improving people’s quality of life, including through better water and sanitation public
services, with a special focus on Roma communities. Interestingly, the section on “development
and administration” argues that there has been a chronic shortage of financing of services
offered by local authorities and a lack of public investment prioritization, with clear financing
criteria, which has led to ever-larger discrepancies between various areas in Romania. Under
action items for Romania’s development, the program emphasizes the need to continue and
finish infrastructure projects that have been started in the past, based on clear priorities and
consultations with beneficiaries. The same document also prefaces the National Local
Development Program (PNDL), calling for “financing a minimum package of required public
investments,” which include water and sanitation systems, along with roads and various types of
social infrastructure.


The National Territorial Development Strategy 2035 (SDTR)
466. Last but least, the National Territorial Development Strategy 2035 (SDTR) serves as the
foundation for Romania’s spatial planning and territorial development system, including
lower-level strategies (i.e., at the regional and local level) and urban development plans. The
strategy emphasizes the role of urban areas as economic engines for the country’s sustainable
and inclusive growth. In this context, references to water and sanitation infrastructure include
the following key points:
     Lack of water and wastewater services affects a significant proportion of the housing
         stock, particularly in rural areas and smaller towns. Implicitly, this reduces people’s
         quality of life and perpetuates the conditions that contribute to social exclusion.
     Particularly in lagging areas, critical investment efforts should focus on the delivery of
         basic public services to enable similar living standards all across Romania. Less than half

                                                                                                247
           of the population has access to centralized sanitation systems and about 11 million
           people benefit from public water supply.
          Cities have a polarizing effect: peri-urban areas around București, Timișoara, Cluj,
           Constanța, and Sibiu enjoy markedly better access to water and sanitation services
           compared to areas that are more distant from urban centers. This suggests that new
           investments in the networks’ expansion around the main cities should be prioritized.
          Another important consideration in undertaking investment projects refers to proper
           consideration of operations and maintenance (O&M) costs. Particularly for wastewater
           systems, as the strategy notes, people in rural areas may not afford to connect to the
           central network and may continue to use cheaper alternatives.
          The SDTR also proposes to monitor a few key indicators, including the number of
           households with access to running water / public sewage.
          Investments in water and wastewater infrastructure fall under the strategy’s second
           main target – “increasing quality of life through the development of public
           infrastructure and public services to ensure high-quality, attractive, and inclusive urban
           and rural spaces.”137 The SDTR proposes ambitious targets to be reached in the next 7
           years: 100% of residents in urban areas and 70% of residents in rural areas connected to
           water supply systems; 75% of all residents connect to sanitation systems.


C. Regional level
Regional Development Plans
467. At the regional level, there are a number of planning documents that are supposed to
guide investment priorities across counties – foremost among them, the Regional
Development Plans (RDPs). Romania does not have formal administrative regions, but merely
“development regions” that primarily come into play when it comes to the programming and
implementation of EU structural funds. At the level of each region, the Regional Development
Agency (RDA), a public-utility NGO, is mandated by the association of counties in that particular
region to develop the RDP. This document applies to a full EU programming period (e.g., 2007-
2013, 2014-2020, etc.), but it is not mandatory in the sense that there is nothing requiring local
authorities to follow the directions provided in the RDP.

468.     On the topic of water and sanitation infrastructure, typically under the
“environment” chapter, RDPs include some key data. For instance, in the diagnostic section,
there are region-specific indicators on share and number of people connected to the central
public systems, noting potential discrepancies across and within counties. RDPs also present lists
of potential investments in each county, including estimated total budgets. The Plans also
feature some indicative targets to be reached by the end of the programming period (e.g., for
the NE Region, the aim is to reach by 2022 an 80% connection rate for water supply (vs. only
45.3% in 2012) and 65% for sanitation systems (vs. only 35.4% in 2012). What such documents
usually lack is a correlation of project lists and available budgets from various sources, and they
typically focus only on EU-funded instruments, with no or few references to state-budget funds.
In part, this is due to the fact that the latter are a lot more unpredictable over a seven-year
period. As such, there are no in-depth discussions on how to coordinate strategies and


137
      See “The National Territorial Development Strategy 2035 (SDTR),” p. 209


                                                                                                 248
investment projects across multiple sources of funding. Strikingly, some RDPs even fail to
reference Regional Master Plans for Water and Wastewater, which are supposed to guide and
prioritize all investments in the sector (see below).

River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs)
469. The Water Framework Directive requires Romania to develop management plans at
the level of each river basin, with the aim of “balanced management and protection of water
resources in order to reach the proper status for both surface and underground waters.” 138 As
such, this is less about expanding access to water/wastewater services and more about the
sustainable management of existing waters to ensure that Romania can properly respond to
current and future challenges; moreover, reaching good ecological status where implementing
the Urban Waste Water Directive is a necessary, but insufficient condition for many water
bodies. The main players responsible for the development of RBMPs are the Ministry of
Environment and Climate Change (MECC) and the National Administration Romanian Waters.
Romania’ s territory is part of the wider Danube River Basin Management Plan. At the national
level, this includes 11 sub-plans, as follows: Someş - Tisa; Crişuri; Mureş; Banat; Jiu; Olt; Argeş -
Vedea; Buzău - Ialomiţa; Siret; Prut - Bârlad; and Dunăre, Delta Dunării, Dobrogea (see figure
below). The National River Basin Plan provides a synthesis of these 11 separate documents,
covering the following topics: general overview of water resources in each basin; surface and
underground waters (types, sources, pollution risks, etc.); protected areas; monitoring of
current status; environment objectives; economic assessment; lists of priority measures/actions;
climate change; public consultations on the documents; and other issues.
There are 11 river basins in Romania

The ecological state of different types of Romanian waters has been mapped in detail




                             Source: National River Basin Management Plan

470. The National RBMP also provides an in-depth look into the quality and quantity of
Romania’s water resources, mainly based on 2007 data provided by NARW. For example, the
document presents the ecological and chemical status of all water bodies (rivers, lakes, coastal
waters, etc.). In the map above, which refers to the ecological status, blue corresponds to very
good quality, green to good quality, yellow to average quality, orange to weak quality, and red
to poor quality. Most of Romania’s waters are “yellow” and “green” – i.e., average to good
ecological status. The Management Plan has detailed information at the level of each basin, split
based on the percentage of waters in each category. This is particularly helpful for
understanding where investments into improving water quality are needed, in the general
sense; again, this is a different – yet critical – issue that complements the need to expand access
to water/sanitation per se. In fact, the prioritization of investments into urban wastewater
treatment should take into account the current water quality status of different water bodies
and the main pressures (urban, diffuse, hydromorphological) identified through each RBMP. In
addition, the RBMPs review extensive data on the quantity of water available, the usage for
different types of consumers (e.g., industry, agriculture, private households, etc.), and scenarios
for future demand and supply of water to determine potential excess capacity or shortages.

471. The National RBMP also includes a list of measures (i.e., investments) needed to abide
by EU and national legislation – i.e., basic ones to fulfill minimum legal requirements and




                                                                                               250
supplementary ones to fulfill the Water Framework Directive’s Article 4 objectives. 139
Estimated investment costs and timelines are based on the county-level Master Plans on Water
and Wastewater. For the full implementation of basic and supplementary measures, the
national plan estimates a total need of EUR 20.992 billion, of which 97.2% are costs related to
basic measures. 140 The same document also defines the three general principles that apply in
determining costs: (1) precaution and prevention (decisions must be fact-based, minimizing all
risks); (2) the beneficiary pays (water has value, in all its forms of use); and (3) the polluter pays
(any changes in the quality of water, attributable to a specific user, nee to be addressed by that
user). There are also specific principles to be followed: (1) proper knowledge of water quality
and quantity; (2) high level of protection generally and special protection for certain areas; (3)
continuous monitoring; (4) continuous reporting; (5) positive incentives for users who
demonstrate special care in managing water resources; and (6) optimal distribution and sharing
of risks. Overall, the National Plan describes the full set of investment projects needed, from
expansion of water supply networks to the reduction of industrial and agricultural pollution of
bodies of water.

472. On water and wastewater infrastructure investments specifically, the national and
subnational RBMPs make direct references to Master Plans (MPs) in the sector. MPs are
developed precisely to “establish and prioritize needs and investments at the lowest possible
cost, which determines a project’s eligibility, [...] and describe the viable technical solutions of
water and wastewater public services.” 141 To this end, the National RBMP urges local authorities
to join forces and enable a regional approach to the delivery of such services, as the optimal
solution for minimizing costs through economies of scale and for achieving meaningful positive
environmental impact at the river basin level. It is also expected that all operation costs would
be financed through the tariff charged by Regional Operators to consumers.

473. All in all, the RBMPs reinforced the idea that the general management of water
resources needs to be performed at the level of river basins to increase efficiency and
accountability. Romania has been managing its water resources on a similar framework (i.e.,
river-basin based) since 1956, so this is a natural continuation and update of past policies. When
it comes to actual infrastructure investments, the RBMPs rely on the Master Plans for Water and
Wastewater, completed for 2007-2013 and in the process of getting updated for 2014-2020, as
of October 2014. In addition to investments for reaching the targets for expanding coverage of
water and sanitation systems, the Romanian authorities also need to keep in mind
environmental objectives, or they may risk infringements for potential breaches of the Water
Framework Directive.


Regional Master Plans for Water and Wastewater
474. For the 2007-2013 programming period, each area covered by a Regional Operator
(RO) in Romania – typically corresponding to one county – developed a Master Plan (MP) for

the Extension and Rehabilitation of Water and Wastewater Infrastructure. Recently, these
documents have been updated to prepare for the 2014-2020 programming period. The aim of
the MPs is to propose an integrated long-term development strategy for water and wastewater
infrastructure, in a defined area covered by a Regional Operator, including cost estimates for
investments required as part of Romania’s EU commitments. In essence, each MP puts forth a
list of priority investments, selected based on clear criteria and prioritized for different periods
of time (e.g., through 2015, 2016-2018, and after 2018). Going forward, it will be critically
important to integrate environmental objectives as part of the prioritization criteria for MPs.
Simply put, if there is not enough money to reach the targets of the Drinking Water Directive
and the Urban Waste Water Directive, Romania needs to make sure that the limited resources it
has at its disposal take into account the Water Framework Directive goal of achieving good
ecological status for all water bodies.

475. The content of each MP is pre-defined by the Guide for Developing Master Plans for
Water and Wastewater Projects, available from the Managing Authority for the SOP
Environment, and includes the following main sections:
     Introduction: main purpose and objectives, key players, etc.
     Diagnostic of the current situation: basic data about the area covered, water resources,
       existing infrastructure, etc.
     Forecasts: assessment of different scenarios regarding demand for water resources;
     National and county-level targets: policies, objectives, and targets for the water and
       sanitation sector in each area;
     Assessment of options: definition of agglomerations, list of investments, prioritization
       based on the need to fulfil EU acquis targets;
     County-level strategy: fit of proposed investments in county strategies and policies;
     Long-term investment plan: full list of proposed investments, including a summary of
       investments and O&M costs, implementation plan, contribution to reaching set targets
     Financial and economic analysis: detailed assessment of investment and O&M costs,
       including net present values for each project;
     Affordability analysis: estimates of different client types’ contributions, level of
       affordability given estimated costs and tariffs, etc.
     Priority investment plan: list of investments for a defined period of time (e.g., 2014-2018
       for the 2014-2020 MPs), including selection criteria;
     Action plan: deadlines, responsible parties, and concrete actions for putting in practice
       the objectives of the investment plan;
     Annexes: data, maps, etc.
There is a need to reflect the requirements of the Water Framework Directive in the MPs,
including through an analysis of the current ecological status of waters (from the RBMPs) and
the identification of the main pressures (urban, diffuse, hydromorphological, etc.) on various
water bodies.

476. To access financing under SOP Environment 2007-2013, local authorities had to join an
Intercommunity Development Association (IDA) and cede the operation of the
water/wastewater infrastructure to a Regional Operator. For example, in Bacău County, the
towns of Moinești and Comănești were initially defined as part of the same cluster.
Subsequently, because Comănești did not fulfill the eligibility criteria (i.e., local authorities did


                                                                                                 252
not agree to join the IDA), the two localities were placed in separate clusters to ensure that
Moinești could receive financing through SOP Environment. Again, conditionalities related to
accessing cohesion funds were meant to ensure that local authorities come together and enable
the creation of IDAs, thereby ensuring economies of scale in the delivery of water and
wastewater services.

477. As far as selection and prioritization criteria go, MPs generally give precedence to
projects that can be completed within specific timelines (e.g., by 2015 or 2018), which fit
Romania’s bro ader EU acquis commitments. Beyond that, each MP includes a specific set of
criteria, without a fully standardized approach. Some MPs leave these criteria at a broad level,
merely indicating that they include institutional, technical, and impact indicators, while others
present detailed scoring grids (e.g., Brăila, Constanța, Ialomița, Ilfov, etc.). The table below
presents one such example from the latter category, including different points for localities
depending on their population size. Other common criteria for the prioritization process are:
urgent measures required to stop environmental damages caused by wastewater discharges or
wastewater exfiltration; urgent measures required to stop water losses; and urgent measures
required to stop wastewater infiltration.

478. Another key element is the definition of clusters by each MP, which ensures that
water and sanitation services can be delivered efficiently, at the lowest possible operational
costs. Not all localities in a county belong to a cluster; there are remote villages, for instance,
where it is not possible to expand centralized water/wastewater systems at a reasonable cost.
For example, each MP considers some of these criteria in defining agglomerations: distance
between a particular locality and existing networks; characteristics of the terrain and maximum
levels of underground waters; risks of flooding; distance to major access roads/networks and
other localities; the required and maximum capacity of treatment plants; other criteria (e.g.,
cost and availability of the land, feasibility of centralized vs. decentralized treatment,
demographic projections, population density, etc.). A cluster does not necessarily correspond to
existing administrative territorial boundaries and may also expand/contract depending on
demographic and economic dynamics. If a particular community is not included in a cluster, it
does not necessarily mean that its residents should not have access to water and sanitation
public services. However, investments in such areas are less of a priority compared to larger,
easier-to-reach localities, and may involve different technical solutions that keep operations and
maintenance costs to a reasonable level, which can be covered from the tariffs paid by
consumers. Importantly, different areas for water supply and wastewater clusters do not need



                                                                                                  254
to overlap fully and depend on the specific characteristics of each area, as shown in the two
figures below for Bistrița Năsăud County.

Water supply areas (up) and wastewater clusters (down) in Bistrița Năsăud County

                                                                                         255
479. In short, county-level Master Plans are arguably the most important documents for
determining investment priorities in the water and sanitation sector. They are generally very
thorough, including data collected on the ground (to be refined/supplemented through
additional technical documentation like feasibility studies and detailed technical projects), and
follow the basic principle that Romania needs to allocate funds in such a way as to ensure
fulfillment of EU acquis targets by 2015 and 2018. Because of the large investment needs at the
level of each county, EU funds need to be complemented by other sources, primarily state-
budget-funded programs, if the investment plans are to be followed. This is why the Master
Plans for the Water and Wastewater should be the reference point for infrastructure
investments in the sector. If national, county, or local authorities decide to finance projects
outside the priorities defined by the MP, rigorous justification should be provided, along with
clear and convincing data regarding the sustainability of such investments over the long run.


D. Local level
480. At the local level, authorities issue general urban plans (PUGs) and development
strategies, both of which often reference planned investments in water and wastewater
infrastructure. For example, the PUG for Sibiu’s historical center notes the intention to expand
sewage networks, rehabilitate existing infrastructure, and perform new works for the proper
storage and discharge of rainwater. 142 In a similar vein, the development strategy for the
municipality of Bistrița provides an overview of the current situation in the water and sanitation
sector (e.g., % coverage, user satisfaction survey data, etc.), along with a summary of recent
infrastructure works through SOP Environment, forecasts for changes in the demand for
water/wastewater public services, and plans for the future. 143 The document notes under
“sectoral priority area 1.8” the need to expand and improve the city’s water and wastewater
systems, including for the collection and discharge of rainwater. There is also a list of specific
projects and streets that require the expansion of water supply and sewage networks, as well as
a proposed investment into modernizing the treatment plant in Sărata – each with a tentative
budget and implementation deadline. The strategy also includes a list of indicators, such as
kilometers of water/wastewater networks modernized/developed and number of connected
households.

481. There are two main challenges with such documents. First, they do not typically include
financing sources and available budgets. As such, they remain wish lists with desirable projects,
without any connection to a locality’s actual resources for bringing these from the concept
phase through project design and implementation. Second, sometimes such documents fail to
correlate with other key documents in the sector, especially the regional master plans for water
and wastewater. This can create overlaps and inefficiencies, leading to the financing of projects
that are not among the agreed priorities.

482. In addition, there are strategies specifically aimed at the development of public
services at the level of local communities. GD 246/2006 approved the National Strategy for
Accelerating the Development of Public Services, including a corresponding multi-annual
implementation plan. Under Article 6, this law mandated local authorities (communes, towns,
municipalities, and counties) to adopt similar strategies for their communities. Subsequently,
such documents were developed at all levels, without a full understanding of the purpose they
would serve. They follow a similar structure: overview of the town/county characteristics;
current situation for the public utilities sector (accessibility, technical status, operators,
legislation, financing, and SWOT analysis); the actual strategy, including mission, objectives,
principles, management structure, etc. However, the level of depth varies greatly across such
strategies. The Botoșani County Strategy for Accelerating the Development of Public Services is a
good practice example, including very detailed data and an action plan with key players,
objectives, deadlines, and financing sources. By covering all public services, some synergies
across sectors may be leveraged more easily (e.g., rehabilitating/introducing water/sewage
networks first and only then rehabilitating the roads).



Social Infrastructure
Key Players

A. Supranational level
The United Nations System
483. Through its various agencies and bodies, the United Nations (UN) system is an
important player at the international level for the education and health sectors, although it
does not necessarily cover specific aspects related to social infrastructure per se. However,
even if it does not make specific references in this respect, UN agencies’ work may indeed
influence the development of social infrastructure and related investments.

484. The UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), one of the five UN regional
commissions, has focused on the crucial connection between transport, health, and the
environment. In 2002, UNECE developed the Transport, Health, and Environment Pan-European
Program that offers a platform for countries from Europe, Central Asia, the Caucasus, and North
America to share information and knowledge, with the main purpose of translating national
policies into local actions. At a high-level meeting in Paris in 2014, the participants set five
priority goals to be achieved by 2019, such as contributing to sustainable economic
development and stimulating job creation through investment in environment and health-
friendly transport; promoting a more efficient transport system; reducing transport -related
greenhouse gas emissions and noise; and promoting healthy and safe modes of transport.

485. Together with the World Health Organization, through its Europ ean Center for
Environment and Health, UNECE established in 1997 a Joint Task Force on Health Aspects of
Air Pollution designed to assess the health effects of long-range trans-boundary air pollution.
This task force aimed to measure the contribution of pollution to human health risks and help
identify priorities for future monitoring and abatement strategies. Experts asses the health costs



                                                                                              257
associated with pollution and identify what additional informational is required to improve such
evaluations.

486. UNECE has also taken the initiative in the field of education in 2005 when it adopted
the Strategy on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). The document is a practical
instrument that incorporates the key theme of sustainable development into the region's
education sector. The strategy calls on Member States to integrate ESD into their education
systems. Main teaching topics about sustainable development should include poverty
alleviation, citizenship, ethics, peace, democracy and governance, security, health, human
rights, justice, and culture.

487. On a different note, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) seeks to contribute to peace and security in the world by promoting
international collaboration through education, science, and culture. UNESCO’s key priority is to
ensure that every child has access to quality education as a fundamental human right and as a
prerequisite for human development. Other priorities include building intercultural
understanding through the protection of heritage and support for cultural diversity, and
pursuing scientific cooperation among nations by developing a different mechanism, such as
early warning systems for tsunami or trans-boundary water management agreements.

488. The World Heritage was created by UNESCO as an instrument to help protect sites of
outstanding universal value worldwide. The UNESCO World Heritage in Romania includes seven
sites, namely the Danube Delta, the Churches of Moldova, the Dacian Fortresses of the Orăștie
Mountains, Monastery Horezu, the Saxon villages with fortified churches in Transylvania, the
historic center of Sighișoara, and the wooden churches of Maramureș.

489. The World Health Organization (WHO) is the directing and coordinating authority for
health within the UN system, responsible for providing leadership for global health matters.
The WHO shapes the health research agenda, sets norms and standards on health aspects,
forms evidence-based policy options, and provides technical assistance to countries on health
issues. Health 2020 is the WHO’s new health policy framework for Europe, setting out an
innovative roadmap aimed at providing support for actions across governments and societies in
order to improve the health and well-being of populations, reduce health inequalities, and
strengthen public health. This policy framework adopted in 2012 by 64 states in the European
region provides policymakers with a set of priorities and actions on health issues, and makes the
case for investments in health. One of the main recommendations is to address population
health through whole-of-society and whole-of-government approaches.

490. The WHO has been providing support for improving health conditions in Romania for
years. The current priorities have been set under the biennial collaborative agreement between
the WHO-Europe and Romania for the period 2014-2015. The agreement is aligned with the
WHO’s priorities for the period 2014-2019 that reflects three main areas of reform, namely
programs and priorities, governance, and management. WHO and Romania will join efforts to
raise the level of health in the country and diminish inequity in the distribution of health for the
population. The main program areas include development of integrated people-centered health
services and support for increasing access to health technologies and medicine.


                                                                                                258
491. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) is the UN development network
that partners with people at all levels of society to help empower lives and build resilient
nations and to improve the quality of life. The UNDP is the main UN body that has dedicated
efforts towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), with its main objective of
cutting poverty in half by 2015. Among other things, the UNDP offers assistance to improving
healthcare and rehabilitation/renovation of social infrastructure in countries all over the world.
The UNDP is actively engaged in Romania based on the legal framework provided by the
Standard Basic Assistance Agreement signed between the Romanian Government and the UN
agency. Over the course of time, the UNPD had developed a number of projects in the country.
For example, one of them involved providing support for setting up the HIV/AIDS Center within
the Institute for Infectious Diseases „Prof. Dr. Matei Balș” in Bucharest. The Institute hosts the
HIV/AIDS Center and provides access to its treatment and prevention facilities.
The World Bank
492. The World Bank (WB) has been active in Romania over the past two decades, engaging
in advisory analytical assistance services, and lending. Some of the WB programs target the
social infrastructure of the country. The WB is currently running a USD 250 million lending
program aimed at improving the health sector infrastructure. The program called “Improving
Health System Quality and Efficiency” is implemented by the Ministry of Health and it should be
completed by 2020. It aims to enhance the access, quality, and efficiency of public health
services by supporting the healthcare service delivery network through strengthening hospitals’
support systems and services, increasing outpatient medical care services, enhancing primary
healthcare services at the community level, and strengthening governance across the healthcare
system. The focus of the program stays on prevention and out-of-hospital assistance as the most
cost-effective ways to improve health outcomes.

493. The WB loan will be used for the rationalization of healthcare delivery by
strengthening key hospitals that will become the backbone of national/regional networks.
Ambulatory care will support secondary ambulatory and primary care through the development
of specialized secondary ambulatory care units aimed at boosting such services and reducing the
admissions rate in hospitals for patients who can be treated in outpatient settings. Eventually,
the main goal is to enhance primary health care services at the community level. In the past, the
WB assistance for Romania also included the rehabilitation of health services project and the
Health Adaptable Program Lending series.

The European Union
494. For its part, the European Union has several key policies and financing mechanisms for
health, education, and culture, providing support for the development of social infrastructure.
Two of the articles of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, known as the Lisbon Treaty,
approved in 2007, refer to health and education. According to Article 168, EU policies and
activities should ensure a high level of health protection, focusing on improving public health,
preventing physical and mental illness and diseases of people, promoting research into causes of
major health issues, and preventing transmission and prevention. It is for the Member States to
ensure proper health policies and health services and medical care, manage health services and
medical care, and allocate appropriate resources to these ends. Article 165 on education and
vocational training is calling on the EU to support the development of quality education by


                                                                                              259
encouraging cooperation between Member States, by providing assistance and supplement
their actions. Member states are fully responsible for setting up and organizing the education
systems, and ensuring their cultural and linguistic diversity. At the same time, the Treaty gives
the EU some guidance in terms of issues based on the specific nature of sport, and its social and
educational functions.

495. Health and education are mentioned in the Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the
European Union adopted in 2000. According to Article 35 of the Charter, all EU citizens have the
right of access to preventive health care and the right to medical treatment under national laws
and practices. EU policies and activities should include a high level of human health protection.
The Charter also emphasizes everyone’s right to education and access to vocational and
continuing training. To this end, the document calls on Member States to fund educational
establishments to allow people fulfil their right to education.

496. The European Commission (EC), the executive arm of the EU, is responsible for shaping
specific policies for different sectors through the directorate generals coordinated by their
respective European Commissioners . One of the most important branches of the EC responsible
for shaping regional development policies and actions in order to reduce regional disparities
between regions and countries is the Directorate General for Regional and Urban Policy, known
as DG Regio. DG Regio is involved in identifying the most appropriate cohesion policies for
promoting continuous improvements in the field of competitiveness and employment. This EC
branch helps regions that are less prosperous or are suffering from structural problems to
improve competitiveness and achieve a faster rate of economic development in a sustainable
way, by co-financing infrastructure projects, developing information society, speeding up the
transfer of know-how, and supporting investments in people. Two of the three major funds
managed by DG Regio are the European Regional Development Fund, which co-finances
investments with a focus on regions with lowest GDP/capita, and the Cohesion Fund that co-
finances transport and environment projects in Member States whose Gross National Product is
less than 90% of the Community average.

497. As a recipient of EU financial support through structural funds, Romania receives from
the ERDF billions of euros for reducing regional disparities, under the Regional Operational
Program (ROP). Part of the money that comes under the ROP covers investments in social
infrastructure, such as educational units and healthcare facilities. Under the 2014-2020 Regional
Operational Programme, Romania is expected to receive EUR 400 billion for investments in
health and social infrastructure aimed at promoting inclusion and fighting poverty. Investments
in social and health infrastructure should ideally lead to national, regional and local
development, reduce inequalities in terms of access to healthcare, and help the country
transition from institutional to community services.

498. The EU has several strategies calling for investments in the health sector. According to
“Investing in health,” a document prepared in 2013, investments in health play an important
role in achieving the objectives of smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth from the Europe
2020 strategy. The EU and the Member States should evaluate and modernize social policies to
increase their effectiveness by making efficiency gains in budgets, taking action throughout life,
ensuring adequate livelihoods, and using EU funds. The EU makes the case for efficient spending



                                                                                              260
in health, calling on the Member States to invest in programs for people’s health as a way of
reducing economic and social inequalities and fighting social exclusion. The Health Strategy
“Together for Health” supports the overall Europe 2020 Strategy, aiming to turn the EU into a
smart and sustainable economy based on growth for the citizens and based on a population in
good health. The document is a response to the challenges faced by the Member States in the
health sector by strengthening cooperation and coordination across the EU and complementing
national policies.

499. The EU cohesion policy and cohesion funds can assist Member States in improving
their national health systems. During the 2007-2013 programming period, EU members have
been allocated over EUR 5 million for health infrastructure through the European Regional
Development Fund. The EU proposal for the 2014-2020 programming period is set to support
health investments in Member States through the Cohesion and Structural Funds. In the next
few years, the EU seeks to support health infrastructure that fosters transformational changes in
the health system. Such changes should eventually shift from a hospital-centered model to
community-based care and integrated services, and enhance accessibility to affordable and
high-quality healthcare that could reduce inequalities among regions and help disadvantaged
communities.

500. The Directorate General Education and Culture is the executive branch of the EU for
shaping policies in field of education, culture, languages, and sports. The education component
focuses primarily on cooperation by opening ways for the Member States to learn from each
other’s experience, and join efforts to improve education across Europe. The DG manages a
number of education programs, such as Erasmus + aimed at improving education and training.
With regard to sports, the DG enables participation of people in physical activities and increases
availability of sporting opportunities, assisting Member States to increase access to sports
facilities for people with disabilities. The DG also encourages countries to promote their unique
cultural features and provides support for relevant cultural programs.

501. Perhaps one of the most important roles of the European Parliament (EP) is the
approval of the seven-year EU budget, which includes the money allocated under the
structural funds that cover, among other things, investments in education and health. The EP
works through a number of specific committees that cover all major EU issues, including health,
education, and culture. The Committee on Culture and Education is responsible for shaping
education and cultural policies, and oversees some of the main EU educational and cultural
programs. The Committee on Environment, Public Health, and Food Safety channels its efforts
to identifying the most adequate European solutions in the field of health. The Committee on
Regional Development is responsible for the operation and development of the regional
development and cohesion policy, the ERDF, and the Cohesion Fund. It also shapes the urban
dimension of the cohesion policy and gets involved in the coordination of the structural
instruments.


The European Investment Bank
502. An important player for social infrastructure investments in Romania is the European
Investment Bank (EIB). The EIB finances projects, supporting EU policies in Member States and
candidate countries, as well as in a number of developing nations around the world. The EIB


                                                                                              261
refinances its lending by issuing bonds on the international capital markets and it is one of the
most important external sources of funding in the region.

503. With co-financing from the World Bank and the Council of Europe Development Bank,
in 1997 the EIB launched a rehabilitation program of 1,200 schools in Romania in order to
reduce discrepancies in access to education across rural and urban areas. The program helped
improve the learning environment and contributed to the rationalization of the network of
schools. The EIB assistance helped Romania carry on with the educational policy in line with the
priorities set out in the EU Accession Agreement.

504. The second phase of the program was launched in 2003, when EIB lent Romania up to
EUR 131 million for school infrastructure, which covered rehabilitation and furnishing of about
1,400 pre-university units all over the country. 80% of the schools rehabilitated were in rural
areas and the rest of 20% in urban areas. More recently, the capital city Bucharest implemented
a large school infrastructure rehabilitation program under a EUR 228.2 million project, of which
EUR 112.2 million were provided in the form of a loan from the EIB, while EUR 116 million was
the contribution from the local budget. The project was completed in 2011 and it included 102
education units – 64 schools, 15 high schools, 19 special schools, and 4 kindergartens (including
10 sports halls, a swimming pool, and several ceremony halls).

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
505. Another important International Financial Institution for the field of social
infrastructure is the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The EBRD
provides project financing for banks, industries, and businesses, through both capital ventures
and investments in existing companies. The EBRD invests in public and private sectors from
Central Europe to Central Asia and in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean regions, thus
fostering the transition toward open and democratic market economies. The overall EBRD
investments in Romania in the past two decades amount to EUR 6.7 billion. Currently, the bank
is involved in a number of rehabilitation projects across the country, such as thermal
rehabilitation of 21 schools in Craiova, rehabilitation of seven schools in Arad, and renovation of
seven public buildings in Galati (including a hospital and a few education units).

The Council of Europe
506. Finally, the Council of Europe’s European Social Charter mentions the right to
protection of health. Article 11 of the Charter calls on the parties to take the appropriate
measures to remove the causes of ill-health, provide advisory and educational facilities for
health promotion programs, and prevent epidemic and other diseases. According to the Charter,
signatories should grant to those without resources adequate assistance to take care of their
health in case of sickness. The right to vocational guidance and vocational training is granted
under Articles 9 and 10 of the Charter, as countries should assist all people, including those with
disabilities, to help them pursue their occupational choices. Countries also agreed on a number
relevant issues, such as promoting technical and vocational training and granting facilities to
access higher technical and university education, providing apprenticeship for training
teenagers, and training workers and the reintegration of long-term unemployed people.

B. National level
The Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA)
507. First and foremost, a key player for investments in Romania’s social infrastructure is
the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA). As the managing
authority of the EU-funded Regional Operational Programme (ROP) aimed at promoting regional
development and reducing disparities among region, the MRDPA is responsible for investments
in education units, healthcare facilities, and cultural centers. The priority axis on the
development of health and social infrastructure tackles social inclusion and poverty. The ROP for
2014-2020 will stimulate, among other things, investments in social and health infrastructure
that could boost national, regional, and local development by reducing inequalities in terms of
access to healthcare. The ROP also helps with the transitioning from institutional services to
community services at the local level. One of the ROP’s axis targets the education sector by
supporting development of relevant infrastructure and training to increase participation in the
educational system. The MRDPA also coordinates the National Local Development Program that
supports the improvement, rehabilitation, expansion, and development of social infrastructure
in rural areas (e.g., kindergartens, elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, professional
schools, special educational units, post high schools, medical clinics, pharmacies, cultural
centers, or sports facilities).

The Ministry of Health
508. The specialized body of the central administration responsible for the national
healthcare policies and infrastructure in Romania is the Ministry of Health (MoH). The Ministry
drafts policies, strategies, and actions plans in the field of public health, and coordinates their
implementation at the national, local, and regional level. The Ministry takes appropriate
measures to improve the quality of the medical services delivered to people. With support from
the central and local governments, the Ministry monitors and evaluates the activity of all
medical institutions in the country, and ensures the necessary human, material, and financial
resources for a proper functioning of the public health system. Nearly 50 major national
hospitals and healthcare facilities of national interests are under the Ministry’s dire ct
management – this is a much lower number compared to before the decentralization process,
which mandated local authorities to take ownership over health units in their respective
jurisdiction.

509. This MoH also coordinates 41 public health departments at the county level and in
Bucharest, i.e., the deconcentrated institutions in charge with the implementation of the
national health programs policies at the local level. For their part, counties manage the county
hospitals, while local councils are responsible for local hospitals and healthcare facilities. County
hospitals receive funds from the county budgets, while local hospitals are funded from the local
budgets. Clinical hospitals with university departments are funded from the central budget by
the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education.

510. The National Strategy for Health for the period 2014-2020 and its Action Plan lay out a
number of activities aimed at improving the healthcare infrastructure at the local and regional
level. The actions included in the plan include the restructuring and rationalization of hospitals
at the national and regional level, expanding access to healthcare to all communities, building
three new regional hospitals, upgrading the infrastructure for oncology and radio thera py, and


                                                                                                 263
improving healthcare services infrastructure for ambulatory care by improving medical services
at the community level.

511. The Ministry’s task is to implement and oversee the activities laid out in the program,
together with local public administration institutions. These activities include: ensuring the
necessary infrastructure for a gradual development of healthcare services at the community
level, modernization of primary care services, and upgrading of infrastructure for medical
services for outpatient diagnostic and treatment services. Some of the future steps to be taken
involve the rehabilitation of healthcare facilities at the community level, upgrading the primary
care facilities or building new facilities at the community level and permanent local medical
centers, and rehabilitation or development of new ambulatory care facilities.


The Ministry of National Education
512. The Ministry of National Education is the central government body that designs and
applies the strategy and policies for education, establishes the objectives of the education
system, and sets the targets for all education profiles. The Ministry can execute financial
policies in the field of education and elaborates specific construction norms for educational
units and their endowment. In recent years, the Ministry has completed a number of higher-
education infrastructure projects throughout the country. At the local level, the city/commune
councils manage the land and the buildings of kindergartens and primary and secondary schools.
The county council is responsible for education facilities for students with special needs, while
the county school inspectorates are in charge with the auxiliary education infrastructure, such
as children palaces, student clubs, and sports clubs. Public universities have their own patrimony
and they can self-manage.

513. At the local level, the Ministry operates through the county school inspectorates .
These are the Ministry’s deconcentrated bodies responsible for fulfilling the objectives set in the
Education Law, with the main tasks of coordinating and monitoring the primary and secondary
education in the country. With approval from the Ministry, the inspectorates set up educational
units, such as kindergartens, primary schools and secondary schools, and arts and vocational
schools. The inspectorates also control the activity of the libraries that operate under
subordinated education units.

514. In recent years, youth and sports activities have been either under the Ministry of
Education or organized under a different governmental agency. In 2013, the Ministry of Youth
and Sports was established, with a primary objective of applying and implementing the
strategies and governmental programs with regard to sports and youth matters. The Ministry
manages the youth and sports public or private properties of the state, and develops and
implements projects related to the rehabilitation and expansion of students’ cultural houses and
leisure centers.

515. The Ministry has 42 deconcentrated departments for sports and youth at the county
level, including in Bucharest. Their primary responsibility is to manage the implementation of
sports and youth national policies and strategies at the local level. They can also use the leisure,
sports, and youth facilities to organize leisure activities and youth camps, and set up specific
sports and youth projects. Together with local public authorities and benefiting from support


                                                                                                264
from the Ministry and other sources, the sports and youth departments coordinate and develop
the material goods that belong to leisure and sports centers in order to modernize relevant
services. Special sports programs for athletes and sport teams at the local level can be funded
through the county school inspectorates.


The Ministry of Culture
516. The specialized government body responsible for designing and implementing the
national strategies and policies in the cultural sector is the Ministry of Culture. The Ministry’s
main tasks include protecting the cultural heritage and developing, restoring, and equipping the
cultural infrastructure. There are over 40 units of national interests under the Ministry, including
15 museums, seven theatres, five opera houses, the National Institute for Cinema, the National
Center for Dance, the Ellie Wiesel National Institute for the Study of the Holocaust in Romania,
and the National Library. The Ministry also has deconcentrated bodies – i.e., county
departments for culture and national patrimony. These departments are responsible for
implementing the strategies and national policies in the culture sector at the local level. With
support from local public authorities, the departments are responsible for protecting the
national heritage.


The National Investment Company
517. The National Investment Company (NIC), an agency under the Ministry of Regional
Development and Public Administration, is in charge with a number of national investment
programs, including regarding sports and social infrastructure . Such programs focus on sports
halls, sports facilities, cultural centers, swimming pools, skating rinks, development of higher-
education units, healthcare facilities in rural areas, and cinema halls. For example, the program
on cultural centers tackles rehabilitation, modernization, construction, and endowment of
cultural facilities in small cities and rural areas. So far, 45 cultural centers have been developed
or rehabilitated under this program. Between 2002 and 2014, the NIC has funded the
construction of 1,040 new sports facilities across the country and has rehabilitated 45 sports
facilities built before the year 2000.


The National Institute of Patrimony
518. Finally, the National Institute of Patrimony is an institution under the Ministry of
Culture that is funded by its own resources with subsidies from the state budget. The Institute
manages the funds targeting the restoration and conservation work of historical monuments
under the National Restoration of Historical Monuments Program. On behalf of the Ministry, the
Institute is responsible for the administration of historical monuments that have become
property of the state, other than those administered by different public institutions. It can
propose programs and projects aimed at reviving such historical monuments. The Institute can
also lease the monuments under certain conditions. The Institute prepares the documents of
the historical monuments to be included in the list of universal heritage. With support from the
cultural county departments and other specialized bodies, the Institute prepares the inventory
of historical monuments. Also, the Institute designs projects aimed at exploiting the historical
monuments and their adjacent areas through the promotion of cultural tourism.




                                                                                                265
C. Regional & local level
519. The county councils and local councils have the most important say with regard to
social infrastructure. Thus, rehabilitation of primary schools, healthcare and social assistance
facilities, local cultural centers (if they belong to communes/cities) is performed with funds from
the local budget. In the case of facilities belonging to the county, the responsibility to support
such works stays with county authorities. Depending on the budget, local and county authorities
can decide to start new investments. There are a few matters where local authorities share
competencies and responsibilities with governmental authorities, like pre-university education,
social housing, social and medical care for people with social problems, and assistance for
people with disabilities. County authorities may share responsibilities with central authorities
when it comes to primary and specialized social assistance for the protection of children or the
education of students with special needs.

520. In some areas of the social infrastructure, local and county authorities have exclusive
competencies. For example, local authorities are the administrators of the public and private
domains of the commune or city. They also manage the cultural institutions and medical
facilities of local interest, and the primary and the specialized social assistance services. County
authorities are solely responsible for the social infrastructure that makes up the public and
private domain of the county, for medical facilities of county interest (county hospitals), as well
as for specialized social assistance services for the elderly. The pre-university public education
assets (land and buildings), such as kindergartens or schools, are controlled by the local councils.
Public hospitals are financed from their own revenues and operate based on the principle of
financial autonomy. County hospitals get funds from the county council, while local healthcare
facilities are funded from the local budgets.


Legal Framework

A. Supranational level
UN Covenants
521.     The Universal Declaration of Human Rights tackles the right to health and education,
but like other international documents it refers mainly to policies and only indirectly to social
infrastructure. The right to health is discussed under Article 26, according to which everyone is
entitled to an adequate standard of living, proper for his/her h ealth and his/her family’s well-
being, including medical care and social services, while mothers and children should be given
special care and assistance. According to Article 26, elementary education and education at
fundamental stages is free, while elementary education should be made compulsory. At the
same time, technical and professional education should be made generally available, whereas
higher education should be accessible to all based on merit.

522. The right to health and education is also mentioned in the International Covenant on
Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, adopted in 1966. Article 12 of the Covenant does
recognize people’s right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health,
asking the parties to take the necessary steps in order to tackle a few stringent issues, such as
reducing infant mortality and generating appropriate conditions to ensure medical services and
medical attention for all, whenever needed. The right to education is discussed under Article 13,



                                                                                                266
according to which education is crucial for helping people develop themselves and enabling
them to participate effectively in a free society. Primary education should be available to all,
while secondary education should be accessible by appropriate means. The states should make
sure that people can get access to higher education based on merits, and should encourage
fundamental education for those who are not able to receive or complete their entire primary
education. Cultural aspects are referred to in Article 15 of the Covenant, which grants people
the right to take part in a community’s cultural life and enjoy the benefits of scientific progress
and related applications.


Europe 2020
523. At the EU level, the Europe 2020 Strategy is aimed at helping the EU b ecome a smart,
sustainable and inclusive economy by achieving five ambitious objectives, namely
employment, education, innovation, social inclusion, and climate/energy. According to the
Strategy, Member States to take the appropriate actions in order to deliver high levels of
employment, productivity and social cohesion by 2020. The Strategy targets social infrastructure
through setting the paths for a smart and inclusive economy.

524. The smart growth priority aims to improve the EU’s performance in the educat ion
sector, encouraging people to learn and study, and update their skills. Currently,
approximately 25% of the school kids across Europe have poor reading skills, and there is an
increase in the number of young people who are leaving education or training programs without
qualifications. Only a third of young people between the ages 25 and 34 have graduated from
college/university, which is below the figures in the United States (40%) or Japan (50%). In order
to address these issues, one of the EU’s main objectives with regard to education is reducing the
school dropout rate below 10%. The EU’s ambitious objective regarding inclusive growth is
emphasizing job creation and poverty reduction. The main targets are focusing on achieving a
high-employment economy capable of delivering economic, social, and territorial cohesion.
Some of the key targets Member States should accomplish by 2020 include two-thirds
employment rate for women between 20 and 64 years old, minimum 40% of the people aged
30-34 to complete third level education, and reducing the number of people living in poverty or
being at risk of poverty and social inclusion by 20 million.


B. National level
525. The section below regarding the Romanian legislation on social infrastructure is
organized according to public institutions’ competencies in terms of property, administration,
and finances, and with regard to the education, health, cultural, and sports sectors.


Property
526. According to the Romanian constitutional law and organic legislation Law no. 213
/1998 on public property goods, the property is public or private, it belongs to the public or
private domain, and it may be of national interest or of local interest . 144 The organic law that
provides the legal framework for the goods belonging to the public realm is Law no. 213/1998.

144
  See Article 136 of the Romanian Constitution: http://www.constitutiaromaniei.ro/art-136-
proprietatea


                                                                                               267
According to this law, public goods are any goods that are considered – by law or by their nature
– of public usage or of public interest. They are acquired by the state or by the territorial-
administrative units (TAU) through legal means.

527. The public domain includes all goods that are subject to the state’s public property or
belong to the TAUs and are of public usage or interest – be it national or local. The public
domain of the state includes the goods that are of national public interest and that are
considered as such by law. The public domain of the counties comprises those goods that are of
county public interest, considered as such by the county council unless they are declared of
national public usage or interest. The public domain of communes, cities, and municipalities
includes the goods that are of local public usage or interest, considered as such by the local
council unless they are already considered of national or county public interest.

528. The assets of the public domain are inalienable, undetectable, and indefeasible.
Inalienable assets cannot be alienated, but only given in administration, lease or concession,
according to the current laws. Undetectable goods means that they cannot be submitted to
forced execution and they cannot be used as real guaranties. Indefeasible assets are those
assets that cannot be acquired by other people through acquisitive prescription or by effect of
the good faith possession over movable goods. However, these assets may be rented based on a
governmental or county/local council decision, but the rented good must be exploited only
according to its character/nature. The rental revenues go to the state or local budget.

529. The notions of public domain, public property, and patrimony/heritag e are not
entirely synonymous, and neither are the terms of public interest and public usage . The
property is a judicial institution, while the domain represents the totality of goods that are the
object of property. It is also important to note that the sphere of the patrimony is larger than
the public domain because it also includes private domains, as well as patrimonial rights and
obligations. 145 There is also a difference between public usage goods and public interest goods.
The first category includes goods that can be used by all people at the same time (roads, public
parks etc.), while the second category comprises the goods that serve the functioning of the
public services (e.g., equipment) or the general interest of the national community or local
community (such as art collections, museums, etc.).

530. The private domain of the state or of a TAU includes the assets that are in their
property and do not belong to the public domain . Over these goods the state and the TAU have
the rights of private property. However, these assets may be transferred to the public domain of
the state or of the TAU based on a government, county council, or local council decision, as the
case may be. Similarly, the transfer of a good from the public domain of the state to the public
domain of the TAU is done upon the request of the county council or the local council and by
the national government’s decision. Conversely, the transfer of an asset from the public domain
of the TAU to that of the state is done upon the government’s request and following the
decision of the county council. The transfer of goods from the public domain to the private
domain is done based on a government, county or local council decision, as the case may be, but
only if the Constitution or the current laws do not dispose otherwise.


145
      See Art. 119 from the Law no. 215/2001 on local public administration


                                                                                              268
531. The goods belonging to the public and private domains of the state or of the TAUs are
subject to inventories. In the case of the state’s public domain, such inventories are done by the
ministries and other central public administration bodies, and are centralized by the Ministry of
Public Finance. The inventories of the assets belonging to the public domain of the TAUs are
done by special commissions chaired by the county council presidents and by the mayors. These
are centralized by the county councils and are sent to the national government. The Annex to
Law no. 213/1998 includes some the goods that are part of the public domain of the state and
of the TAUs. 146 Order no. 668/2014 of the Minister of Public Finance (presented below)
regulates the inventory of the state’s private property.

532. The public domain of the state comprises assets of national interest. These include:
monuments of national public interest; ensembles and historical and archaeological sites;
museums and art collections that have been declared to be of national public interest; land and
buildings in which central public authorities operate – the Parliament, the Presidency, the
government, the ministries, and other specialized bodies of the central administration, as well
as the public institutions subordinated to them; courts and prosecutor's offices; the military
bases of the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, intelligence services, and of
the General Directorate of Penitentiaries; decentralized public services of ministries and other
specialized bodies of the central administration, as well as prefectures, except for the land and
buildings acquired through their own extra revenues, which constitute their private property. It
also includes the national roads - highways, expressways, European primary and secondary
highways.

533. The assets belonging to the public domain of the counties are “of county interest,”
whereas those belonging to the domain of villages, cities, and municipalities are “of local
interest.” The first category includes: county roads, land and buildings where the county council
and its apparatus operate, but also the county public institutions (such as libraries, museums,
county hospitals, etc.), if not declared of national/local public usage or interest. The county
public domain also includes water networks developed at the zonal or micro-zonal level,
together with their treatment plants and installations, constructions, and related land. As for
local public domain of villages, cities and municipalities, it includes, among others: communal
roads and streets; public markets, trade fairs, public parks, and recreational areas; lakes and
beaches that are not of national or county public interest; water supply networks, sewerage,
district heating, wastewater treatment plants, with their facilities constructions and related
fields. The local public domain includes the lands and buildings in which the local council, the
mayor’s office, and public institutions of local interest (such as theaters, libraries, museums,
hospitals, clinics and the like) operate. It also comprises social housing units; monuments, unless
they have been declared of national public interest, and all underground resources, unless they
have been declared of national public interest; land for forestry, unless part of the private
domain of the state, and are not owned by individuals or private legal entities; city and village
graveyards.




146
      According to the law, the enumeration from the Annex is illustrative.


                                                                                                269
534. Under GD 1705/2006 on the centralized inventory of goods pertaining to the public
domain of the state, the government approved the centralized inventory of the assets
belonging to the public domain of the state (listed in 46 annexes). According to the law, any
changes to the centralized inventory must be approved by the government at the initiative of
the ministries, specialized bodies of the central public authorities subordinated to the
government, autonomous administrative authorities, and local public authorities (depending on
the exact situation) through the MRDPA. Importantly, the centralized inventory is updated
annually through the IT systems of the Ministry of Public Finance, and published on its website.


535. The Land Law (Law 18/1991) establishes the definition and the extent of Romania’s
land stock and makes a series of distinctions that are also present in Law 213/1998. Romania’s
land stock comprises any kind of land, irrespective of its destination, entitlement right, or
domain (public or private). The legal distinctions focus on the terms of property, domain, and
interest. First, the law distinguishes between lands held in private property by individuals or
legal entities, and lands pertaining to either the public domain or to the private domain.
Secondly, with respect to the public domain, it separates the public domain of national interest
from the public domain of local interest. In the former, the property and administration rights
belongs to the state, while in the latter they belong to communes, cities, municipalities, and
counties, which are entitled to administer them through the mayors’ offices or the prefectures.

536. The law stipulates clearly that the lands pertaining to the public domain (of national
or local interest) are those allocated to a public utility. For example, the lands on which public
interest buildings are placed belong to the public domain (either national or local). Like any
other asset from the public domain (see Law no. 213/1998), these lands are inalienable,
undetectable, and indefeasible, as explained above. As for the lands belonging to the private
domain of the state, respectively of the communes, cities, municipalities, and counties, the Land
Law only states that they are acquired by these entities in the ways provided for by the
legislation.


Administration
537. The Public Administration Law (Law 215/2001) regulates the local autonomy and the
organization and functioning of the local public administration. According to the law, local
public administration authorities have the right and capacity to solve and manage public affairs
in the name and for the interest of the local communities that they represent. This right is
exercised by the local councils and mayors, as well as by the county councils and their
presidents.

538. Among other provisions, the law includes a special chapter on public goods and public
works, reaffirming the legal provisions from the Land Law (Law 18/1991) and the Law on
public property (Law 213/1998). The law first defines what is understood by “patrimony” of any
territorial-administrative unit (TAU): the movable and immovable goods belonging to the public
and private domains of the TAU, as well as patrimonial rights and obligations. Second, it
distinguishes between the public domain and the private domain of any TAU, stating that all the
assets of public interest or usage (that are not declared of national public interest) belong to the
public domain. Third, it introduces the requirement of undertaking annual inventories of public



                                                                                                270
goods, with the mayor/the president of the county council (as the case may be) having to report
to the local/county council on the status of these assets.

539. In the same chapter, the law provides for the right of local and county councils to
decide whether goods belonging to the public or private domain, of local/county interest,
shall be given in administration, concession or lease to autonomous administrations or public
institutions . They also decide on buying or selling goods that belong to the private domain of
local/county interest. As a rule, sales, concessions, and leases are done by public auction. It
deserves to be mentioned that the local/county councils have the right to give for free use and
on a limited term movable and immovable goods that belong to the local/county public or
private property to non-profit legal entities that perform charitable or public utility activities or
public services. With respect to public works, the law gives local and county councils the right to
contract by auction public utility works and services within the limits set out by the local or
county budgets. Construction and repair works of public interest and financed by budgets of
communes, cities, municipalities, or counties must be awarded on the basis of public auctions.

540. Law no. 196/2006 on decentralization establishes the principles, rules, and framework
that regulate the process of administrative and financial decentralization , distinguishing
between three types of competences pertaining to administrative authorities: delegated,
exclusive, and shared . The delegated competences are attributed by the central public
authorities to the local public administration authorities – along with the corresponding financial
resources – and are exercised in the name and within the limits established by the central
authorities. The exclusive competences are attributed by law directly to the local public
administration authorities, which enjoy the right of decision and have the necessary resources
and means for accomplishing them. As for shared competences, they are exercised by the local
authorities together with other authorities at the central or county level, based on a clear
separation of the financing and decision-making prerogatives for each of them.

541. With respect to social infrastructure, local public administration authorities have
exclusive competencies over a wide range of assets . They cover: the administration of the
public and private domain of the commune or city; the administration of the cultural institutions
of local interest; the administration of public medical units of local interest; primary social
assistance services for the protection of children and for the elderly; and primary and specialized
social assistance services for the victims of family violence. As for the authorities at the county
level, they also have exclusive competencies with respect to social infrastructure: the
administration of cultural institutions of county interest; the administration of public medical
units of county interest; primary and specialized social assistance services for the victims of
family violence; and specialized social assistance services for the elderly.

542. Local public authorities from communes and cities share competencies with the public
authorities from the central level in areas related to social infrastructure that require both a
national and local approach. These areas include: building social housing and housing for young
people; state pre-university education (except for the education of students with special needs);
medical and social assistance services for individuals with social problems; and primary social
assistance services for persons with disabilities.




                                                                                                 271
543. County-level public administration authorities also share competencies with central
public authorities in the area of social infrastructure. These include: state education for
students with special needs; medical and social assistance services for individuals with social
problems; primary and specialized social assistance services for the protection of children; and
specialized social assistance services for persons with disabilities.


Finances
544. The Law 500/2002 on public finances defines capital expenditure as the share of the
public spending that is intended for the financing of investment objectives/projects and of
other investment categories . According to the law, under investment programs, capital
expenditures are grouped into three clusters: continued (in progress) investment
projects/objectives; new investment projects/objectives; and other capital expenditures. The
last cluster includes several types of costs, including costs for: the acquisition of real estat e,
including land; independent endowments; pre-feasibility and feasibility studies; permits,
authorizations, and approvals; technical design, technical assistance, etc. Investment programs
must be presented annually by the main credit release authorities, along with the funding
sources.

545. Many of the provisions of Law 500/2002 have been changed in recent years as a way
of strengthening the medium-term expenditure framework. For example, a key requirement
was introduced in 2013 under article 43, paragraph 9 on enforcing hard budgetary constraints
for public investments done exclusively with national funds. Thus, a public investment program
cannot add new investment projects, which cannot be financed integrally according with the
approved technical documentation. In essence, the value of these new investments has to be
below the ceiling set through the medium-term expenditure framework and/or fiscal-budgetary
strategy approved based on Law 69/2010. The exception to this rule are investment projects
financed with EU funds.

546. Supporting documents for each investment objective/project and for the expenditures
included in the cluster “other capital expenditures” have to be examined and validated by the
authorities. Depending on the value of the investment, technical and economic
documentations, approval documentations for intervention works, substantiation reports, etc.
must be approved by one of the following authorities: the government, for amounts over RON
30 million; the main credit release authorities, for amounts between RON 5 million and RON 30
million; other credit release authorities for proposed expenditures less than RON 5 million, but
with the prior approval of the main credit release authority.

547. The role of examining the investment programs in order to see if they fit in the
established expenditures limits belongs to the Ministry of Public Finance (MPF). The Ministry
has to also check if projects comply with the selection and prioritization criteria and if they
divide the budgetary appropriations according to the duration of the objectives’ execution.
Moreover, the MPF coordinates the monitoring of the entire investment program and is entitled
to request all necessary information from the main credit release authorities. As per the law,
any public investment program will include only the investment objectives/projects/categories
that can be financed entirely within the expenditure limits set by the expenditure framework



                                                                                               272
and/or the fiscal-budgetary strategy (approved by Law no. 69/2010 147 ). Exceptions are made for
investment objectives/projects/categories that are financed through external non-reimbursable
or reimbursable funds.

548. According to Law 273/2006 on local public finances, expenses for public investments
and other capital expenditures financed from local public funds have to be integrated in the
budget proposals of territorial-administrative units on the basis of their own investment
programs. The budget proposals are developed by the credit release authorities and then
approved by the deliberative authorities. Only investment objectives that are entirely financed
through multiannual budget proposals may be included in public investment programs. The
main credit authorities are the mayors of the TAUs (including the general mayor of Bucharest
and mayors of the sectors) and the presidents of the county councils148 .

549. The main credit release authorities for local budgets elaborate public investment
programs annually. For each of the objectives, financial and non-financial information is
integrated. The financial information includes: the total value of the project; the commitment
appropriations; the budgetary appropriations; the funding schedule, structured by sources and
years, and correlated with the implementation schedule; the cost-benefit analysis; and
operation and maintenance costs. The non-financial information should comprise: the
investment strategy (including investment priorities and the relationship between different
projects, and the analysis criteria that determine the introduction in the investment program of
new objectives to the detriment of ongoing ones); the description of the project; and the
physical progress of the objectives.

550. The main credit release authorities also set the priorities in the distribution of
amounts per each objective included in the investment program. They have to stay below the
limits set in the budget proposal. The structure of the local public investment programs follows
the same pattern applicable to other territorial-administrative levels and that is described in the
Law 500/2002 on public finances – i.e., the investment objectives as grouped in three clusters,
which are continued investments, new investments, and “other capital investments”. The last
cluster has to be structured according to investment categories, such as: acquisitions of real
estate; independent endowments; pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, technical design,
technical assistance etc.

551. The main credit release authorities are also responsible with monitoring investment
projects. If a project cannot be implemented according to the budgetary projections for
objective reasons, the main credit release authorities may propose to the deliberative
authorities the redistribution of funds among the projects included in the investment program.
Also, the main credit release authorities are required to publish on their websites details related
to the investment programs, in a maximum of 5 days after their approval.

552. Transfers from the state budget toward local budgets may be approved in certain
situations . This is possible for investments financed through external loans and with some
contribution from the central government. These transfers are approved annually through the
state budget law.

553. Order no. 980/2005 of the Minister of Public Finance (MPF) for the approval of the
methodological norms regarding the evaluation and selection criteria for public investment
objectives follows introduces norms for evaluating and selecting investment objectives
financed in full or in part from public (state or local) budgets.149 Law 500/2002 on public
finances stipulates that the MPF has, among others, the attribution of establishing the
methodological norms for the elaboration of evaluation and selection criteria that apply to the
public investment objectives.

554. According to the methodology, the implementation of investments follows the
following four stages . First, the technical and economic documentation of the investment
projects has to be developed. Second, the projects have to be included in the public investment
programs based on the evaluation and selection data from the prioritization corresponding to
each objective. Third, the costs of investments must be included in the public investment
program, as an annex to the annual budget. The documentation for each investment objective
must be prepared. The fourth stage refers to monitoring the implementation of the
investments, monitoring the drafting of the technical design, as well as the construction and
assembly works, the reception, and the commissioning of the investment projects.

555. According to the same methodology, the evaluation and selection of public
investments imply several steps . First, a reexamination of the ongoing investment projects has
to be performed in order to prove they are still consistent with the gover nment’s strategy. At
the same time, each project has to be analyzed according to the following aspects: expected
costs and benefits of the proposed investment; the stage of the project’s implementation; the
funds spent until the date of analysis; if the pr oject is still in line with the government’s policies
and if the project is justified considering the approved changes in the respective sectoral
strategies. At the end of the reexamination, the main credit release authorities decide whether
the investment can be put on hold (in which case alternative solutions must be found – e.g.,
asset sales, privatization, concession, management contract, etc.) or must continue and be




149
   The respective budgets at the state level are the following: state budget, state social insurances
budget, special funds budget, state treasury budget, autonomous public institutions budget, public
institutions budget financed partially or entirely through the state budget/social insurances/special
funds budgets, public institutions entirely financed by their own incomes, the budget of the funds
coming from external credits (contracted or guaranteed by the state), the budget of external non-
reimbursable funds (see Art. 1 (2) from the Law no. 500/2002 regarding the public finances ). The
local budgets are the following: the budgets of communes, cities, municipalities, Bucharest sectors,
counties, the budgets of the public institutions finances partially or entirely from the local budgets,
the budgets of the public institutions entirely financed from their own incomes, the budgets of
internal and external loans, with costs covered from the local budgets; the budget of external non-
reimbursable funds (see Art. 1 (2) from the Law no. 273/2006 regarding the local public finances).


                                                                                                          274
subject to the prioritization program. 150 The investments that continue and are subject to the
prioritization program will be evaluated against several other elements: size of the project, cost
estimations, funding plan, etc. Afterward, they are introduced in the public investment program
based on the order of their score. 151 The assessment of new investment projects follows next.
The analysis looks at the necessity, opportunity, and relevance of a project against general and
sectoral economic policies, as well as the data regarding its value, capacity, cost -efficiency and
cost-benefit analysis, social benefits, and environmental impact.


Education Infrastructure
556. Law 1/2011 (The National Education Law) treats separately the pre-university
education and the university education, including for infrastructure . Concerning the former,
the land and buildings of early education units, of the preparatory, primary, and secondary
education units (including any other units by levels of education, established by the state)
belong to the local public domain and are administered by the local councils. The other
components that constitute the material basis of the units are in their ownership and are
administered by the executive boards, as required by law. 152 Concerning the state schools for
students with special needs and educational assistance county centers, the land and buildings in
which they operate are part of the county public domain (Bucharest municipality included) and
are administered by the county council through the administration councils of the respective
education units. The other components from the material basis of these units are their property
and are managed by their respective administration councils. As for the palaces for children,
clubs for students, and sports clubs, they are part of the public domain and are managed by the
Ministry of Education through county school inspectorates and through the executive boards of
these units. Such facilities (including land and buildings) can be transferred from the public
domain of the state to the public domain of the territorial-administrative units where they
operate, at the request of the county/local council and by Government decision.

557. With respect to state or private universities, they have their own patrimony, which
they can freely manage within the limits set by the law. State universities may also have in
their patrimony movable and immovable goods belonging to the public or private domain of the
state. Over these assets, universities have the right of administration, use, rental, and
concession. These goods may be transferred from the public domain of the state to the private
domain of the state and then in the property of the state universities through the government’s
decision. In the case of dissolution, the goods owned by the respective university and left after
liquidation is transferred in the private property of the state. As for private universities, they
have property rights and other real rights over their own patrimony.




150
    The standard methodology for the evaluation of the ongoing investment objectives/projects can
be found in Annex 1 of the Order no. 980/2005
151 See Annex 2 of the Order no. 980/2005 for a close examination of the standard methodology for

the analysis and selection of the ongoing public investment projects. The Annex 3 includes the
template of the centralizing table of investment projects prioritization.

    See Art. 112 of the Law no 1/2011.


                                                                                                    275
Health Infrastructure
558. Law 95/2006 on the health system reform sets the legal, institutional, and policy
framework of the Romanian health system. It is a complex act that prescribes the rules for a
multitude of health-related aspects: from principles and authorities to specific medical activities,
insurances, medicines, etc. 153 The same law recognizes as authorities of the public health system
the Ministry of Health (as the specialized body of the central public administration 154 ) and other
institutions and specialized structures of the Ministry, functioning at the national, regional, and
local level.

559. The law distinguishes between public health county departments, institutes or centers
of public health (at the regional or national level) and county public health authorities . The
public health departments are deconcentrated public services of the Ministry of Health and
represent the public health authority at the local level, while the public health authorities are
subordinated to the Ministry of Health and implement national policies and programs at the
local level and develop local actions. For their part, the institutes/centers of public health are
also subordinated to the Ministry.

560. Law no. 95/2006 focuses mainly on public hospitals, public utility sanitary units with
beds, which provide various kinds of medical services . Based on their complexity and reach,
public hospitals are local, county, and regional. They may be part of three kinds of chains,
depending on the authority that has them under administration: 1) the Ministry Health; 2) other
ministries and public institutions; and 3) the local/county public administration authorities. The
management as well as the buildings that belong to the second and third chains may be
transferred to local public administration authorities or to state universities of medicine and
pharmacy.

561. According to the same law, public hospitals are entirely financed from their own
income and operate on the basis of the financial autonomy principle. Their revenues are
acquired from the amounts collected in exchange for medical services and other contract-based
services. The medical services are provided based on contracts that public hospitals have to sign
with the national health insurance house (NHIH). The contracts are negotiated by the hospital
managers with the management of the NHIH under the conditions set out in the framework
contract regarding the provision of medical assistance through the health insurance system.


153
    Law no. 95/2006 mainly regulates the following aspects: public health assistance principles, the
authorities of the public health system, public health control, medical assistance, pharmaceutical
assistance, implementation and financing of national health programs, family medicine, primary
medical assistance, first aid and emergency medical assistance, county ambulance services, mobile
emergency, resuscitation and extrication services, community medical assistance, human organs,
tissues and cells donations and transplants, organization, functioning and financing of hospitals,
health insurances, medical services covered from the National Fund for health insurances, the
organization of health insurances houses, medical services suppliers, voluntary health insurances
companies, profession of physician, dentist, pharmacist, the Romanian Colleges of Physicians,
Dentists, Pharmacists, medicines (fabrication, import, labeling, prospectus, classification,
distribution, publicity, public information).
154 See Law no. 184/2013, which approves the GEO no. 71/2012 regarding the nomination of the

Ministry of Public Health as centralized public acquisitions unit.


                                                                                                       276
562. The income earned by the medical units may be used for investments in infrastructure
and endowment with medical equipment, but only after covering their operational
expenditures. In the case of public hospitals belonging to the chain of the Ministry of Health and
to the chain of the ministries and other institutions with their own medical units (therefore,
except for the public hospitals attached to local public administration authorities) they also
receive funds from the state budget and from the local budgets for a clearly defined purpose.
Clinical hospitals with university departments receive funds from the state budget via the
Ministries of Health and Education. County hospitals receive funds from the county budgets,
while the hospitals of local interest receive funds from the local budgets.

563. The funds that the public hospitals attached to the central level administration receive
from the state budget and from local budgets cover various types of costs. State budget funds
may cover, among others, the acquisition of medical equipment and investments for building
new hospitals or for completing unfinished ones, as well as for modernizing, transforming,
repairing, and extending the existent constructions. The funds from the local budgets may
contribute to covering administration and operational expenditures, respectively goods and
services, investments, capital repairs, consolidations, extensions, modernizations, and medical
equipment endowments for the sanitary units of county/local interest, within the limits
approved in the respective budgets.

564. The public hospitals that are attached to the local administration may receive funds
from the state budget and from the Ministry of He alth’s own revenues for different purposes.
These include: finalizing investment objectives (new or in progress); medical equipment
endowment; capital repairs; modernizing, transforming, and extending existent constructions,
as well as expertise, technical design, and consolidation of buildings. The allocated amounts
from the Ministry’s budget for these objectives (except for the investment projects) and the list
of the beneficiary hospitals are approved annually by Government decision. The decision is
approved based on the proposals made by the specialized structures within the Ministry and
following requests from the local public administration authorities. The local public authorities
may also participate in the funding of administration and operation expenditures, respectively
staff-related costs, goods and services, investments, capital repairs, consolidation, extension,
and modernization, endowment with medical equipment, etc. As for the budgets of the public
hospitals attached to the local authorities, they are elaborated, approved, and executed
according to the provisions of the Law 273/2006 on local public finances and they are part of the
general budget of the territorial-administrative units/sub-divisions.

565. Order 512/2014 approving the Methodology for elaborating the public investments
program of the Ministry of Health and for allocating funds for capital expenditures to the units
from the chain of the Ministry of Health aims to establish specific procedures for developing
the Ministry’s public investments program, but is also used for the allocation of funds for
capital expenditure toward public units attached to the Ministry. The program has to be
presented as an annex to the approved budget of the Ministry of Health. The methodology
follows the provisions of Law 500/2000 on public finances155 and breaks capital expenditures



155
      See Art. 38 1 from the Law no. 500/2002 (with subsequent modifications and amendments).


                                                                                                277
under the investment programs into three groups: continued/in progress investment projects/
objectives; new investment projects/objectives; other capital expenditures.

566. Investment objectives/projects have to be supported by technical and economic
documents,156 approval documents for intervention works, 157 as well as by reports regarding
the necessity and opportunity of expenditures included in “other capital expenditures”
chapter. 158 The investment projects and documentations have to be approved by the
government (when the amounts are greater than RON 30 million), by the main credit release
authorities159 (when the amounts are between RON 5 million and RON 30 million), or other
credit release authorities (when the amounts are less than RON 5 million and with the prior
approval160 of the main credit release authority). Still, the approval of investment projects,
notwithstanding their value, does not automatically ensure the financing of capita l
expenditures. This approval only represents the condition for them to be integrated in the
annual investments programs and therefore to be annexed to the budgets of the Ministry of
Health, which have to be approved by annual budgetary laws.

567. The Ministry of Health centralizes the investment objectives/projects and other
capital expenditures that fulfill the necessary prerequisites for entering in the investments
program (including technical and economic documentations, approval documents, etc.). The
draft of the investments program is elaborated along with the budget proposal of the Ministry
of Health and has to take into account the following: the limits of budgetary expenditures
established by the Ministry of Public Finance and the strategy of the Ministry of Health with
regard to the investment policy in the health sector and the solicitations from the public units
attached to the Ministry of Health and/or from its specialized structures. The final draft of the
investment program, which is accompanied by substantiation reports161 regarding the need and
the opportunity of including in the investment program the respective objective/investment
category, is approved by the main credit release authority along with the approval of the annual
budget proposal of the Ministry of Health through the annual law of the state budget. The
investment program is annexed to the Ministry’s approved budget.

568. The methodology further describes the procedure of allocation of funds from the
Ministry of Health’s budget for capita l expenditures to the public units attached to the
Ministry . After the budget’s approval, the budgetary provisions for capital expenditures are
allocated to public units and/or to the specialized structures on the basis of substantiation

156
    The template regarding the presentation note that has to accompany the technical and
economic documentations, respectively the feasibility studies correspondent to new investment
objectives and the approval documentation for intervention works, is to be found in Annex 4.
157 Intervention works are construction works to existent buildings, including correspondent

installations. They include: repairs, changes, modifications, upgrades, consolidations, thermal
rehabilitation and intervention works to prevent or eliminate the effects of accidental actions and
natural disasters.
158 The template of the substantiation report for “other capital expenditures” is included in the

Annex 1 of the Methodology
159 The template of the act of Approval of the main credit release authority can be found at Annex

2.
160 The template of the Prior Approval of the main credit release authority is included in Annex 3.
161
    The template for this type of substantiation report can be found in Annex 5 to the Methodology.


                                                                                                      278
reports corresponding to the respective capital expenditure - new investment objectives,
continued/in progress investment objectives, and other capital expenditures. In what may
concern the substantiation of the Ministry of Health’s budget proposal, the same model used for
the investment program will be applied by the county (Bucharest) departments of public health
with respect to the proposals coming from the public hospitals attached to the local public
administration authorities, which may receive funds from the state budget and from the
Ministry’s own funds.

Cultural Infrastructure
569. According to GD 90/2010, the Ministry of Culture is a specialized structure of the
central public administration, which elaborates and ensures the implementation of strategies
and policies in the cultural sector . 162 The Ministry is responsible for protecting the national
cultural patrimony (material and immaterial), including through developing, restoring, and
endowing the cultural infrastructure according to cultural needs. Also, it has to ensure the
efficient administration of its institutional system, including subordinate institutions and
deconcentrated public services. The Ministry has to support, in collaboration with the local
public administration authorities, the proper functioning and activity of cultural institutions and
settlements that are subordinated to local and county authorities. Furthermore, the Ministry
has the attribution to propose and promote partnerships with the local public administration
authorities and with civil society actors in view of diversifying, upgrading, and optimizing the
public services offered by cultural institutions and settlements.

570. Annex 2 of GD 90/2010 lists the units that operate under the subordination of the
Ministry of Culture and are financed entirely from the state budget . They are the following:
county departments for culture and national patrimony, the National Preservation and
Promotion Center of Traditional Culture, and the State Secretariat for Cults. The Romanian
Copyright Office is a specialized body under the coordination of the Minister of Culture and is
also financed from the state budget. 163 The county departments for culture and national
patrimony represent the deconcentrated public services of the Ministry of Culture and their
directors are appointed by the Minister of Culture. The patrimony of these departments
includes rights and obligations over movable and immovable goods that are in the public or
private property of the state and that are administered by these departments.

571. There are as well central-level specialized bodies and national interest cultural
institutions that are financed both from their own revenues and through subsidies from the
state budget. They are the following: the national museums, the national theatres, the national
operas, philharmonic, and choir, national art centers, the National Patrimony Institute, the
National Institute for Cultural Research and Training, the National Cultural Fund Administration,

162
    The organizational structure of the Ministry of Culture is set out in Annex 1, as updated to the
latest version. The latest modifications of the Annex 1 were introduced by GD no. 21/2013 for the
modification and completion of GD no. 90/2010.
163
    Annex 2, as updated to the latest version, lists the units that operate under the subordination
and under the authority of the Ministry of Culture, as well as under the coordination of the
Minister of Culture. The last normative act that modified the Annex 2 is the GD no. 563/2002
regarding certain measures for the organization of the Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony
and the State Secretariat for Cults.


                                                                                                       279
Bucharest Cinema Creation Studio, “Video” publishing house, etc. There are also some cultural
institutions that are financed from their own income/extra-budgetary revenues – this is the case
of Artexim. Finally, there are units that operate under the authority of the Ministry of Culture:
the National Printing Compa ny “Coresi” S.A., the Autonomous Distribution and Exploitation
Administration “RomaniaFilm”, Cinema Studios “Rofilm”, “Sahia”, “Animafilm”, etc.


Youth and Sports Infrastructure
572. GD 11/2013 on the organization and functioning of the Ministry of Youth and Sp orts
establishes the roles and responsibilities of this specialized body of the central public
administration . 164 Its main role is to coordinate the implementation of governmental strategies
and policies in the sector of youth and sports. Among other responsibilities, the Ministry has to
ensure the administration of the entrusted goods, which are the public or private property of
the state. Also, it has the competence to establish youth centers by accommodating unused
spaces and buildings from the public domain of the state or spaces that are administered by the
institutions that are under its subordination. Among other responsibilities, the Ministry of Youth
and Sports has the task to develop and implement the plan for the rehabilitation and expansion
of leisure centers and students’ cultural houses. It also has to ensure their organization and
functioning.

573. Annex 2 to the Government Decision 11/2013 includes the units that function in the
subordination of the Ministry of Youth and Sports and mentions their s ources of funding: own
income and subsidies from the state budget. County departments for sports and youth are
organized and function as deconcentrated public services of the Ministry. 165 The students’
cultural houses and the “Tei” cultural and sports studen t complex are public institutions
belonging to the Ministry of Youth and Sports. 166 The sports clubs also belong to the Ministry of
Youth and Sports. The national sports complexes, as well as the National Training and
Proficiency Center for Coaches, the National Research Institute in Sports, and the Sports
Museum subordinated to the Ministry.


Strategies and Plans

A. Supranational level
The Europe 2020 Strategy
574. The Europe 2020 Strategy does not include special provisions for social infrastructure.
It sets two major goals in the education sector: 1) reducing early school leaving below 10%; 2) at


164
    The organizational structure of the Ministry of Youth and Sports is included in Annex 1 to the GD
no. 11/2013, as modified by the GD no. 30/2013.
165
    The activity of the county departments for sports and youth (including the Bucharest
department for sports and youth) is regulated by GD no. 776/2010 regarding the organization and
functioning of county departments for sports and youth and of the Bucharest department for
sports and youth (...).
166
    The activity of the students’ cultural houses and the “Tei” complex is regulated by GD 801/2004
regarding the organization and functioning of the students’ cultural houses and the “Tei” cultural
and sports student complex.


                                                                                                        280
least 40% of 30-40 year-olds completing third level education. These major goals were
translated into country-level objectives, with Romania committing to reduce early school leaving
to 11.3% by 2020 and to have at least 26.7% of 30-40 year-old complete tertiary education by
the same deadline. One could say that these targets could also be achieved through strategic
infrastructure investments, but a bigger role in this case will be played by policies, training, and
other soft investments.


B. National level
575. There are several overarching strategies and plans at the national level, which impact
how investments in social infrastructure are done. There is no overall strategy focusing on the
development/rehabilitation/modernization of social infrastructure, given that this sector is quite
eclectic. Rather, such investments are treated separately in individual sectoral strategies.
The Governing Program 2013-2016
576. The Governing Program 2013-2016 discusses a number of investment priorities for
culture, education, and health. In some cases, the proposals are quite specific, identifying a
number of priority projects to be considered; in other cases, the proposals are larger in scope
when discussing investment programs. For example, in the case of cultural heritage, the focus is
on a number of key objectives, such as the Dacian fortresses in the Orăștie Mountains, or the
network of ethnographic museums. Under the Education chapter, there is a section focusing on
the modernization of pre-university education infrastructure, with a focus on IT&C investments,
connection to high-speed internet, equipping of libraries and the extension of virtual libraries,
and strengthening educational centers (with the help of both EU and state-budget funds). In
terms of health infrastructure, the focus is on overhauling and modernizing the existing system
(e.g.. by investing in regional hospitals, in county hospitals of strategic importance, and
extending the SMURD infrastructure).

577. Social infrastructure is also covered in the section on regional revelopment. The focus
there is on rural development and on ensuring that each village in Romania benefits from a
minimum package of investments, including one of each of the following: health clinic,
pharmacy, library, and cultural center.


The National Territorial Development Strategy (SDTR) 2035
578. The draft SDTR 2035 discusses the need to provide basic infrastructure to improve the
quality of life in rural areas. The large objectives and sub-objectives do not go into specifics, but
the proposed performance indicators discuss details pertaining to social infrastructure (i.e.,
education, health, culture). Moreover, the strategy proposes the identification of rural localities
with a polarization potential in regions that lack an urban center. The idea is to prioritize
strategic infrastructure investments in such rural localities (e.g., improving a school or a health
center) and improve their connectivity to surrounding areas. This way, people from neighboring
rural localities can benefit from these services in a manner that ensures economies of scale.


The Romania EU Partnership Agreement (PA) 2014-2020
579. The Partnership Agreement makes a distinct mention of the need to in vest in social
infrastructure, particularly rural small-scale infrastructure. The PA acknowledges that small-



                                                                                                 281
scale infrastructure (e.g., education, health, cultural) plays a key role in improving the quality of
life in rural areas and in making them more attractive. For example, it is indicated that the
percentage of kindergarten coverage in rural areas is only 7.44% of the number registered at the
national level, while the number of agricultural high schools has dropped by 80% in the past 15
years (there were only 34 rural agricultural high schools left in 2011). It is also considered that
social services and related infrastructure do not meet the needs of the rural population,
affecting economic development potential. Moreover, cultural infrastructure, which is critical
for preserving local identity, is deficient.


C. Regional Level
580. Law 195/2006 defines the set of responsibilities that belong to local and county -level
authorities. The list of exclusive and shared competences is included in the table below. Thus,
county councils are responsible for the management, rehabilitation, and development of the
following type of social infrastructure: county culture institutions, county health units, and social
assistance and health services. Many county councils include as objectives in their development
strategies the rehabilitation/development of social infrastructure they are responsible for. In
addition, county councils can provide funds for projects undertaken by local authorities.

D. Local level
581. Local authorities administer the largest share of social infrastructure units in Romania.
The table below indicates the exclusive and shared competences that local authorities have, as
laid out in Law 195/2006. Most of the larger localities regularly carry out the
rehabilitation/modernization/development work of social infrastructure. Smaller localities,
however, remain for the most part dependent on transfers from the central government and on
national investment programs, such as the PNDL, the PNDR, or the ROP.

Annex B: Case Studies of Coordination Mechanisms
The coordination of public investments could be performed through different ways and
mechanisms. Most of the European countries rely on both horizontal and vertical coordination,
involving both central and local/regional governments. The OECD report Investing Together:
Working Effectively across Levels of Government and a number of OECD papers on coordination
of public investments across levels of government in different countries provide good examples
of the methods and mechanisms deployed by European states to better coordinate and keep a
vigilant eye on projects financed from public funds. 167 Below are a few example of how vertical
and horizontal coordination of public investments works in five regions in Europe.

Basilicata, Italy
The Basilicata Region in Italy uses coordination mechanisms across both vertical and horizontal
levels of government. Coordination at the central level is done through the Inter-Ministerial
Committee for Economic Planning and the Department for Development. The committee is a
political decision-making instrument comprising 11 ministries, headed by the Prime-Minister,
and coordinates regional and national policy priorities. The committee allocates funds for
development programs and projects, sets sectoral policies, and oversees the execution of public
investments in line with regional policy by co-financing regional action plans and approving
framework agreements. The Department for Development is in charge with the coordination of
investments financed from the structural funds and regionally allocated money through the
Funds for Development and Cohesion.

The coordination between the region and the central government is done through two main
players, namely the state-regions conferences and the Objectives for Public Services. The
conferences are the arenas for political dialogue and vertical coordination between the regional
and authorities, where the two parties meet at least twice a year in order to set regional policies
and negotiate over the funds. The Objectives for Public Service provisions (Obiettivi di servizio)
are the final objectives for performance management and reward in compliance with the
performance-based criteria. The money from the central government gets transferred to regions
based on how well or poorly they perform. Money goes to the most performing regions. This
programming practice enables the central government to provide incentives to the regional
authorities that achieve concrete targets and results in specific policy areas. For example, if the
region does not meet the given target, then the high-performing municipalities could receive up
to 50% of the resources assigned, while the remaining funds would go to other regions.

Another tool that is used to coordinate between the center and the regions is the framework
agreement signed between national and regional administrations. They assist municipalities to

stick around to the investment plans by setting schedules and mutual commitments for specific
interventions and sectors. Nearly 86% of framework agreement resources in Basilicata have
been used to finance public investments.

The coordination at the sub-regional level among municipalities is done through the
programming area (soon-to-be Unions of Communes - Unioni di Comuni) that act like
intermediate bodies between regions and municipalities. This framework gives significant power
to local administrations to push for the interventions they need at the local level. There are also
inter-municipal cooperation instruments within some of the operational programs that finance
joint provision of services, tourism, and sustainable urban development. Basilicata uses different
tools to encourage cooperation among regions and municipalities. A good example of such
coordination is the 1999 Inter-Regional Program Agreement on Water signed between the
regions of Puglia and Basilicata with the Ministry of Public Works to plan together on investment
strategies, on the use of water, and decide on tariffs.

Italy employs some strong monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mechanisms at the national,
regional and local level. One of the instruments doing the monitoring at national level is the
Public Investments Evaluation Unit set up by the Ministry of Economic Development that
provides technical support to the government for developing methods for ex ante , mid-term
and ex post evaluations of public investments. The unit establishes incentives to enhance the
effectiveness of public interventions and conducts ad hoc evaluations of economic policies
requested by the inter-ministerial committee headed by the Prime Minister. A network made of
central and regional evaluation units do the analysis at the lower level of the administration,
calling on regions to share methodologies and best practices.

At the regional level, the Public Investments Evaluation Unit under the Department for
Structural Funds checks consistency of the strategic projects with the regional development plan
and the annual financial plan. In addition, the System for Monitoring Public Investments uses a
unified codification system with information on procedural, financial, and physical indicators to
provide timely data on the implementation of all public investments financed from multiple
resources. Such mechanism that has been tested in five Italian regions, including in Basilicata,
and is connected to the Information System on Operations of Government Bodies for online
collection of data on cash transactions and payments made by public administrations. A similar
system tracks down projects funded through EU money or regional financial resources.


Brandenburg Land, Germany
Comprising four districts and 419 municipalities, the Brandenburg Land has limited powers over
the public investment spending, as it dependents mostly on transfers from the central budget
and EU funds. Regional investment priorities funded under structural funds are defined by
Brandenburg’s regional strategy, a document prepared in consultation with lower levels of
government, private actors, NGOs, and researchers.

The Land has a good vertical coordination and sectoral cooperation with higher levels of
government. Investment priorities for the Land are decided by the federal government, in
collaboration with the Land, under the Joint Task, a common platform setting priorities in a
number of sectors (such water and regional development). Joint Tasks are available for all


                                                                                               285
Länder in the country, and they are managed by the federal government through a body
comprising the Länder and the federal ministries of Finance and Economy.

The Joint Task for Brandenburg is an important source for public investment. Together with the
EU funds, it is funding interventions pertaining to regional development. Brandenburg has
limited leverage on the implementation process, since the federal government is responsible for
the coordination framework and EU procedures with regard to state and cohesion policy.
Coordination and implementation of public investments in Brandenburg involves a number of
factors, such as timeframes (the funds are allocated for three years and annual funds must be
spent by the end of the year), ex-ante evaluation, thematic priorities, and private sector
inclusion.

Although Germany has an institutionalized approach when it comes to coordination between
the center and the Länder, it is very sector-driven, as there are only a few institutionalized
mechanisms at the vertical level. 15 regional core growth areas help make coordination with the
sub-regional levels by concentrating funds for innovation and other business environment
investments, thus establishing a direct dialogue between the regional government and local
partners. Projects associated with one of the core growth areas are given priority. Brandenburg
Integrated Regional Transport until 2030 is a good example of cooperation within the Land.
Investments in the transport sector are decided jointly by the Land, communes and districts, and
other stakeholders (like transport operators).

The collaboration across Länder is weak due to the policy autonomy on energy, infrastructure,
and education, on one hand, and the allocation of public investments, on the other hand. Public
funds are allocated based on a competitive rather than a collaborative approach, while EU funds
are dedicated for each region. Anyway, despite weak horizontal collaboration across the Länder,
Brandenburg was able to establish a successful collaboration with Berlin, the capital city,
through a joint transport network with a single tariff system. There is also good horizontal
collaboration at the lower levels of Land through formal agreements between communes,
informal collaboration, and financial incentives for merging municipalities. Communes
collaborate well with each other primarily with regard to business environment, ambulance
services, and waste management.

The Land receives external administrative support to improve its capacity to better manage
funds, through two tools, namely the Communal Academy and the Regional Investments Banks.
The Communal Academy is providing training to more than 100 public administrators each year
in order to help them improve their administrative skills, including how to better manage local
funds. As for the Regional Investment Bank (Investitionsbank des Landes Brandenburg – ILB), it
manages government financing programs and sometimes can decide on the allocation of money
for small and medium-sized enterprises. ILB also provides consultancy for municipalities on
public-private partnerships and waste and sanitation treatment plants. Monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) of public investments in Brandenburg is carried out through the Joint Task
program, based on a number of indicators (such as the creation of jobs of economic
development programs). ILB is also involved in the M&E process by keeping an eye on the
eligibility of the use of funds.




                                                                                            286
Wielkopolska, Poland
Wielkopolska (Great Poland Voivodship) is one of the 16 Voivodships, comprising 35 Powiats
(district governments) and 226 Gminas (local commune governments). The regional government
is responsible for the regional development policy, including education, health, transport, and
protection of the region’s heritage. Public investment policy is coordinated by the Marshal’s
Office (the head of the region). The strategic goals for public investment policy are set by the
Regional Development Strategy, which is implemented via the EU-funded Regional Operational
Program (ROP). Each of the 16 Voivodships has its own ROP designed by the Marshal’s Office in
close collaboration with other regional stakeholders. The decentralization process added new
competencies to the regions with regard to coordination between the ROPs and the programs
managed by the central government.

Poland relies on vertical coordination between the regions and other levels of government with
regard to public investments. The coordination between the ROPs and other national programs
is managed by the Ministry of Regional Development, with support from special central level
bodies. The Ministry works closely with the Marshal Offices to set and implement the regional
programs but also to identify horizontal issues needed for program implementation. The central
government ensures coordination between the priorities and measures of the ROPs and the
operational programs.

Vertical coordination is ensured primarily by the central government institutions. The regional
authorities are the Managing Authorities for the ROP 2007-2013, and they are also in charge
with the implementation of other EU funds. Although the regional government cannot get
involved in the management of those projects that part of the national roads system, they take
into consideration the national plans dealing with the extension of the national highway
network in the regional transport infrastructure plans. The Main Directorate for National Roads
and Motorways, the Marshal Offices, and local authorities coordinate investments in the
transport sector.

Public investments must take into account a number of factors, such as the spatial planning
frameworks at different level of governments, ex-ante conditionalities for EU investments, and
contractual arrangements between regions and central authorities. Such agreements not only
help with the coordination at the vertical level, but they indicate how the state development
funding is used by regions in executing their ROPs. Agreements include provisions related to the
Ministry of Regional Development’s supervision of the funds by the regions and coordination
between the ROPs.

Regional investments are coordinated by regional and local stakeholders. The region designs the
regional development strategies and the ROPs, in consultation with local governments and
stakeholders. The other two instruments available in Wielkopolska dealing with coordination
between the regional and local level are the Monitoring Committee for the ROP, a body
gathering local representatives of different stakeholders (like private sector, trade unions,
NGOs) and the Wielkopolska Council of Thirty, a special advisory body dealing with regional
development and innovation-related issues.

The horizontal coordination between municipalities brings together associations of towns that
group resources, thus reducing the cost of investments that respond to common needs. These


                                                                                            287
activities are enforced by agreements signed between municipalities (gminas) – e.g., a joint
company established by a union of 13 local communal governments around the city of Kalisz or
the partnership with the private sector for the sewage system in the Poznań agglomeration
covering nine municipalities. It is worth noting that this Polish Voivodship partners with the
private sector for public investments.

The regional authorities assess twice a year how the Development Strategy of Wielkopolska met
its objectives, based on a set of indicators for each of the priorities and measures. The reports
are approved by the Regional Assembly. In addition, they are conducting impact evaluations on
the EU-funded projects that are subsequently presented as examples of good practices.


Galicia, Spain
The coordination of public funds in Galicia, an autonomous region in Spain comprising 4
provinces and 315 municipalities, is done both vertically and horizontally. The autonomous
regions in Spain have large executive, legislative and regulatory powers, but quite limited
financial and budgetary powers. Galicia has its own Regional Operational Programme.

The vertical coordination between the central authorities is executed through agreements and
co-financing under which local communities receive transfers from the central government for
capital expenditures. This process involves equalization funding and cooperative agreements
(Convenios de Colaboración) signed by regions in order to get money for each type of
investment. Such agreements play an important role in the regional development and influence
the long-term strategic planning of the autonomous communities. The agreements between
Galicia and the central government cover environment, rural and marine affairs, education, and
health.

Structural funds are Galicia’s most important source of public investment financing, accounting
for one-third of the region’s overall funding in 2011. The central government has an important
say with regard to the allocation and management of EU funds, taking into consideration
regional needs. For example, the EU-funded Technological Fund framework has been adjusted
for Galicia in order to finance specific projects for the region.

Vertical coordination between regions and local governments also occurs in the transfer of
earmarked grants. The horizontal coordination among municipalities is done through the so-
called soft and hard agreements. Signed by municipalities on a voluntary basis, the soft
agreements promote greater inter-municipal cooperation. Under such agreements, funding
priority is given to projects involving several municipalities, thus increasing the number of inter-
municipal investment projects. For example, there is a soft agreement for integrated water cycle
by grouping nine municipalities in a very rural, sparsely populated area in Galicia . Hard
agreements are imposed. They are used in Vigo, an association of 14 municipalities, for imposing
inter-municipal service provisions by law with the aim of improving services on water and
transport, thus increase efficiency through common expenditures. The association of
municipalities has opened the way for different types of local cooperation, such as the
collaboration in the transport sector grouping the seven biggest cities in Galicia.




                                                                                                288
Galicia attempts to integrate policies across different sectors through a multi-annual master
plan that regroups several regional plans for road infrastructure, transport, and water. Citizens
and firms are involved in the coordination and elaboration of the sectoral plans. For instance,
citizens were consulted for the development of Plan MOVE 2009-2025, a multi-billion euro plan
funded from EU, central, and local budgets, which includes municipal plans for the seven biggest
cities in the region.

Monitoring and performance assessments at the municipal level also lack conditionalities, as
there is no systematic outcome on investment evaluation. Because such evaluation is often seen
as an infringement of the regional autonomy, authorities are reluctant to impose stricter
performance indicators. It has to be mentioned that the Galician Infrastructure Agency also
monitors the results related to infrastructure projects.


Skane, Sweden
Skane is one of 21 counties in Sweden, comprising 33 municipalities. Despite of being a county,
Skane is referred as region, due to its additional responsibilities. Skane has weak regional
autonomy, with limited powers, although the list of responsibilities at regional and local level is
quite significant. In Sweden, regions have a say in the decision-making process, but the central
government decides on financing and implementation.

Vertical coordination between the region and the national government is performed by two
bodies, namely the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth and the National Forum
for Regional Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship, and Employment. The region relies on sectoral
and cross-sectoral regional policy guidance documents. The sectoral strategies are funded
through the central or municipal budgets, and they are developed altogether with budget and
implementation plans. Skate also has a cross-sectoral strategy with limited impact though
because it is not supported from the local and central budgets or from the region’s money.

There is weak coordination of public investments between the region and the central
government. For example, the region has only 20% autonomy over regional transport
infrastructure investments. Skane does not have a strong voice regarding transport policy, since
80% of the infrastructure investment decisions in the region follow from the national transport
policy plan. The coordination among municipalities is strong. Municipalities develop regional
sectoral plans – e.g., the Skane regional transport plan was developed in consultation among the
regional administration and the 33 municipalities. At the same time, there is simultaneous
vertical coordination with the central and local levels on specific transport investments
regarding the implementation process. Although the final decision about financing and
implementation stays with the central government, municipalities also have a say in this matter,
since they can block the project.

Skane employs an institutionalized integrated vertical coordination mechanism involving a
number of stakeholders. It is the case of the Sustainable Mobility, there is a platform where all
stakeholders meet and exchange experiences with regard to the sustainable transport plan for
the region. The vertical coordination between the region and municipalities is also ensured
through contracting — municipalities provide services to the region or get engaged in joint
transport projects.


                                                                                               289
Sweden coordinates well with EU programs, especially regarding regional cross-country
transport development. Sweden is part of the TEN-T network and INTERREG initiative where
Sweden consulted and coordinated international transport priorities with Denmark and
Germany. In Sweden, coordination between regions or across municipalities is done through
inter-municipal and inter-council collaboration. Such horizontal collaboration helped Skane
increase its stakes in negotiations with the central government, as the region coordinates with
other counties across the larger South Sweden Region.

The selection of investments in Skane takes into consideration two instruments, namely the
regional development programs (RUP) and the regional growth programs (RTP) that foster an
integrated policy approach in the region. The RUP is an umbrella program covering different
sectors, acting as a basis for other strategies in regional development, such as the RTP and the
EU funds.

Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of public investments in transport sector take place at the
central level. The region is responsible for M&E of the implementation of the regional
development strategy. However, the evaluation process is quite ineffective in forming further
policies, given the low impact of the regional development plan. User-feedback mechanisms
work well for regional level and for transport monitoring.

Coordination aspects related to According to the Strategy, the County Council has the responsibility of coordinating projects and reaching
investment objectives, types of activity, the targets set with respect to the assumed objectives, but its methods and tools of intervention are
and projects (expressly mentioned)        limited. For a unitary development, the established projects involve a number of other existing or potential
                                          partners, and their independent actions aiming at contributing to a common goal.

                                                  The implementation and monitoring of projects will be the prerogative of a Working Group on the
                                                  Development Strategy, involving a responsible person designated as Strategy implementation coordinator.
                                                  The Strategy Implementation coordinator will work closely with departments within/under the
                                                  subordination of Bihor County Council, such as: Technical Department, Economic Department, Chief
                                                  Architect, and General Department for Local Government.
                                                  The Strategy provides the criteria for the prioritization of projects, the following two aspects being
                                                  included:
                                                           Correlation of project with other investments in various stages of development in Bihor county;
                                                           Correlation of project with other future investments in the county of Bihor (from the list of
                                                           strategic and specific projects).
                                                  In the project portfolio, the need of correlating investment projects is also mentioned.
Other Observations                                Overall, the Strategy is clear, coherent, applied; its parts are closely intertwined.
Other useful things to note about this strategy   Looking at the details, it is worth mentioning certain strengths.
include…                                          The Action Plan is very specific - it includes, besides the title, actors, timeline, budget estimates (EUR) and
                                                  the assigned priority level (out of three levels of priority).
                                                  The strategy includes records of projects; these contain relevant details, such as: the projects’ relevance
                                                  for the envisioned development (its subordination to the strategic goal, specific objective or measure);
                                                  their integration into other national/regional strategies, territorial reach, objectives and main activities,
                                                  applicant and potential partners, potential funding sources, estimated budget, implementation timeline,
                                                  priority degree, project status.
                                                  The strategy also includes a cross-cut approach through five strategic initiatives; they are treated
                                                  separately and with priority, and they are located in various geographical points of Bihor county (center,
                                                  north, south-east, and west).
                                                  The project implementation structure is clearly defined.
                                                  According to the Strategy, specific projects are scheduled and sized according to the implementation
                                                  capacity of the County Council, but also according to the opportunities and available funding. The timing of
                                                  the projects depends on their degree of priority and on their compliance with other projects (some
                                                  initiatives are conditioned or preceded by others).

Coordination aspects related to According to the document, project portfolio composition was assessed against both the socio-economic
investment objectives, types of activity, analysis and the Strategy. It also states that a correlation between the projects proposed by the partners
and projects (expressly mentioned)              was made so as to eliminate any possible overlaps and identify complex integrated projects with impact at
                                                the county or even regional level.
                                                The Strategy mentions the need for its constant update; in this way the investment plans will be correlated
                                                to the resources that can be actually accessed by the initiators of priority projects.
                                                The Strategy also speaks of the need to promote a coordinated development and an integrated
                                                management of activities on water, land and adjacent resources: transport, urban development and nature
                                                conservation.
                                                Integrated territorial investments are mentioned as well.
Other Observations                              Overall, the Strategy is well developed and segmented according to development directions, but
Other useful things to note about this strategy insufficiently specific in terms of projects.
include…                                        The strategy includes 90 projects in its portfolio, which are ordered by priority. They are accompanied by
                                                the name of the applicant and include the correspondent amounts in about half of cases.
                                                The Strategy mentions that the projects were inventoried on the basis of a standard format, containing:
                                                the title, main activities, promoters of the project, estimated budget and possible funding sources. The
                                                strategy also states that projects are ordered by priority, and the criteria used to rank projects were
                                                sensible to: strategic objectives, complexity and potential impact, elements of financial and investment

                                                included in the strategy, nor in an Annex to the Strategy.
                                                The action plan includes only the responsible actors for the planned actions, which are divided into three
                                                time segments: short-term (2012-2013), medium term (2014-2017), long-term (2018-2020).

                                        being divided by years for each of them; the total expenditure and the total contribution of CJ are also
                                        mentioned. The investment plan includes: project title, overall objective, purpose, problems addressed,

                                        council, target group, calendar.
                                        The general impression is that the Strategy includes too many “soft” projects (information and awareness
                                        campaigns, support programs, trainings, etc.) and too few „hard” projects (infrastructure initiatives), which
                                        should be prioritized in view of ensuring a decent life standard for the county citizens. That saying, road,
                                        water, sewage, and social infrastructure projects are rare and vaguely formulated. Out of 156 initiatives,
                                        approximately 10 seem to belong to this sector.

                                        development focuses exclusively on targeted cities and localities.
                                        - Development focused on the stability of the subregion, initiated by domestic investors. The emphasis is
                                        on traditional values.
                                        - Development based on the cooperation of social and economic actors (local authorities, entrepreneurs,
                                        civil society). In addition to economic benefits, the aim is the sustainable development of the region's
                                        resources, the improvement of the quality of life, and the protection of natural and cultural values.

and projects (expressly mentioned)              to these issues are not present.
Other Observations                              The strategy is very schematic and incomplete compared to other strategies.
Other useful things to note about this strategy The strategy includes development scenarios and “strategies” on eight sectoral development areas (listed
include…                                        above).
                                                Although upgrading the transport network is referred to as a key element in achieving the strategic
                                                program, this is not detailed in the correspondent development area.

                                                The Strategy itself mentions that its aim is to guide the development of the county in 2007-2013 and to
                                                substantiate the county’s access to the Structural and Cohesion Funds of the EU.
                                                The project portfolio is divided into the same eight strategic axes contained in the Strategy: transport and
                                                energy infrastructure; economic competitiveness; tourism; territorial cooperation; rural development;
                                                human resource development and social services; the environment; urban development. The portfolio
                                                includes, for example, 280 road transport infrastructure projects, the total number of projects being 1431.
                                                The projects are presented on the basis of the following information: locality, name of the project, project
                                                stage, value in euro, priority, observations. The portfolio includes also a summary table of the amounts
                                                expected to be required on years (2007-2013) and on (the eight) strategic axes.
                                                The missing parts of the strategy include those relating to implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and
                                                public policy complementarities with other regional, national and European level.

Coordination aspects related to With respect to the implementation of the Strategy, the County Council assumed the coordination of the
investment objectives, types of activity, development of appropriate infrastructure and utilities. It also assumed that it would keep trace of the
and projects (expressly mentioned)              correlation between investments at the local level and would promote an integrated approach with

and projects (expressly mentioned)              infrastructure and utilities.
                                                The Strategy notes that a person will be designated (in the Department of Internal Funds Absorption) to
                                                take the responsibility of coordinating its implementation.
Other Observations                              The Strategy defines four priority areas of intervention at the level of infrastructure in order to support
Other useful things to note about this strategy investments in the following sectors: research - development - innovation; tourism, business in industry
include…                                        and services; business in the primary sector and manufacturing.
                                                The projects that are included in the Strategy are ordered by priority according to the following criteria:
                                                - The degree of relevance with respect to the needs identified in the diagnostic analysis;
                                                - The extent to which they condition other development initiatives too;
                                                - The degree of feasibility in relation to the estimated budget that is required.
                                                Based on these criteria, projects were marked with one to three stars of priority for the County Council
                                                (low, medium and maximum). The timeline depends, on the one hand, upon their relative priority and, on
                                                the other hand, upon the conditionality between projects (some initiatives are conditioned or should be
                                                preceded by others).
                                                The strategy includes project sheets for each strategic objective. Projects are presented based on the

include…                                        The strategic program included in Timis County Council's strategy is structured according to 10 strategic
                                                development axes, each axis including the corresponding strategic intervention areas, measures, and
                                                projects to be implemented by Timis County Council or the local public administrations in Timis County.
                                                The Strategy shows a clear interest of the county and local administrations to access EU funds for the
                                                projects included in the Strategy: it summarizes the major sources of non-reimbursable funds and some of
                                                the access conditions mainly addressed to public administrations in Romania.
                                                With reference to the structure of the strategic program, the following aspects are mentioned:
                                                intervention area, development objective, institutional competencies in matters of implementation,
                                                measures. With reference to the presentation of projects, the following details are included: title,

                                                The strategy contains the summary of the financial data for the strategic program, including for the
                                                modernization of public infrastructure in the localities of Timis county. The financial summary is divided
                                                into the already mentioned 10 strategic axes and contains the following information: the total number of
                                                projects for each axis, the estimated total value of the projects, and the total amount of local co-financing
                                                for them. The amounts for the priority projects included in the program (estimated value and the value of

                                                value of the total value of all projects included in the program. The transport and environment axes,
                                                followed by the culture axis have the highest share in terms of value - 45.09%, 21.45%, and 13.18%.
                                                The strategy also contains the financial data of projects completed in 2004-2008 according to the same
                                                strategic axes, thus showing continuity of approach. The highest number of completed projects (15) was
                                                recorded on the territorial cooperation axis and therefore their total value was the highest (5.1 mil. Euro).
                                                The next axis was that of the education and human resources (6 projects), but with a lower total (1.6 mil.

                                          projects).
                                          The chapter referring to the implementation of the strategic program has a special section on prioritization
                                          and project selection criteria, while the chapter on monitoring includes a catalog of indicators
                                          corresponding to the system of objectives of the strategy.

Annex F: The Polish Experience with Territorial Contracts
The territorial contract (TC) is an instrument of reconciliation of projects between the national
government and the regional authorities, aimed at implementing the regional development
policy objectives enshrined in the National Strategy for Regional Development (NSRD).

The contract is also a commitment by both the national and subnational governments to the
implementation of priority projects, focusing on areas of strategic intervention in accordance
with the NSRD, which also correspond to the directions of the Regional Development Strategy of
each region. Thus, the TC serves to coordinate development activities undertaken by the
government and local authorities to achieve common objectives defined for a particular
territory.

TCs should not be identified with any specific operational program, either national or EU-
funded, despite the situation in Poland whereby the contract is based mainly on activities to be
financed from the EU Operational Programmes’ funds. The TC constitutes a legal structure that
allows: completion of selected projects that solve identified problems in a coherent manner;
complementarity and synergies of actions on the regional level.

Each of the projects planned for in the TC should be consistent with the relevant actions of
strategic documents of the region, with the country cohesion policy, but also with the EU2020
Strategy. However, the TC covers only the most important projects implemented in the region
that have been agreed between the government and the regional and local governments during
contract negotiations. It does not include all projects implemented in the region.

The resources foreseen for the TC include:
     National public funds, especially those held by the Ministry of Regional Development
        and Infrastructure, including funds from the EU and other donors;
     Funds at the disposal of other ministries (including EU funds), with public funds from the
        local and regional governments;
     Funds from international financial institutions;
     Other public, semi-public, and private funds.


The involvement of the government in each concluded contract should not exceed 60%, which
means that at the regional level authorities need to mobilize at least 40% of the funds.

TC development steps:

1. Identification of thematic areas for support
Based on the analytical material prepared by the region, identification and justification of the
areas and sectors for support is concluded by the Regional Marshal Office, within each of those
types of “financial flows” foreseen in the TC.

2. Identification of specific projects / projects / plans to finance
As part of the thematic areas of possible support (which can be different for each of the regions)




                                                                                              422
a list of projects and types of projects is identified. All institutions, organizations, and companies
from a region are requested to provide feedback on the most important projects for the TC.
These projects are gathered by the Marshal Offices. Once compiled, the committee chaired by
the Marshal discusses all the projects and selects those that will be proposed for the TC (and
also for the Regional Operational Programme). The projects coming from the region are
accompanied later by the projects foreseen by the central government to be financed in that
specific region.

At the end of the negotiations of the TC, the document contains a detailed table, which specifies
the key information – as presented in the titles of the columns in the excerpt below:

                                                                                        2011-2015



3. Strategic investments
The projects that may be included in the TC have to: fulfil the objectives pursued by the TC; be
complementary with other projects that might be implemented in the area /sector within the
established timeframe of the contract.

Joint venture projects implemented and funded jointly by the government and by the
regional/local government are crucial for fulfilling strategic development objectives of the
government and the local governments.

There may also be complementary projects implemented and funded separately by the
government and sub-national governments, mutually reinforcing their impact on regional
development. The complementary projects should not be contradictory and can have the
following links:
1. Projects can complement themselves spatially or sectorally, and achievement of the effects of
one project is not dependent on the implementation of the second;
2. One of the projects complements the other and without its implementation expected results
of the second project are not achieved;
3. Projects complement each other and depend on each other for fulfilling their individual
results.

On behalf of the national government the contracts are signed by the Minister for Infrastructure
and Development, while on the regional level they are signed by the Marshal of the Region168 on

168

behalf of all regional and local authorities.

The specific actions listed in the contract are so much linked to EU Operational Programmes that
it is very difficult for either side to change the contract and the detailed projects agreed.
Therefore the contract is generally stable and does not change often, even if elections bring a
different party to power.
