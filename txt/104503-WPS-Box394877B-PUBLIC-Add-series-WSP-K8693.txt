         The use of VfM analysis to inform PPP decision making is difficult and can be controversial. Practitioners face some significant methodological challenges and, given the poor
         quality of data typically available for (smaller-scale) WSS PPPs, careful consideration should be given to the benefits of undertaking rigorous VfM analysis. See World Bank and
         PPIAF 2013. Recognizing the capacity and data constraints in low income countries, attempts are being made to develop simplified, practical, and effective VfM approaches.
