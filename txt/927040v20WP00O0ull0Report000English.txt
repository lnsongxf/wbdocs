Dramatic climate changes and weather extremes are already affecting millions of people around the world,
damaging crops and coastlines and putting water security at risk.
    Across the three regions studied in this report, record-breaking temperatures are occurring more fre-
quently, rainfall has increased in intensity in some places, while drought-prone regions like the Mediter-
ranean are getting dryer. A significant increase in tropical North Atlantic cyclone activity is affecting the
Caribbean and Central America.
    There is growing evidence that warming close to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels is locked-in to the
Earth’s atmospheric system due to past and predicted emissions of greenhouse gases, and climate change
impacts such as extreme heat events may now be unavoidable.
    As the planet warms, climatic conditions, heat and other weather extremes which occur once in hundreds
of years, if ever, and considered highly unusual or unprecedented today would become the “new climate
normal” as we approach 4°C—a frightening world of increased risks and global instability.
    The consequences for development would be severe as crop yields decline, water resources change,
diseases move into new ranges, and sea levels rise. Ending poverty, increasing global prosperity and reduc-
ing global inequality, already difficult, will be much harder with 2°C warming, but at 4°C there is serious
doubt whether these goals can be achieved at all.
    For this report, the third in the Turn Down the Heat series, we turned again to the scientists at the
Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Climate Analytics. We asked them to look at the likely
impacts of present day (0.8°C), 2°C and 4°C warming on agricultural production, water resources, cities
and ecosystems across Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, and parts of Europe
and Central Asia.
    Their findings are alarming.
    In Latin America and the Caribbean, heat extremes and changing precipitation patterns will have adverse
effects on agricultural productivity, hydrological regimes and biodiversity. In Brazil, at 2°C warming, crop
yields could decrease by up to 70 percent for soybean and up to 50 percent for wheat. Ocean acidification,
sea level rise, tropical cyclones and temperature changes will negatively impact coastal livelihoods, tour-
ism, health and food and water security, particularly in the Caribbean. Melting glaciers would be a hazard
for Andean cities.
    In the Middle East and North Africa, a large increase in heat-waves combined with warmer average tem-
peratures will put intense pressure on already scarce water resources with major consequences for regional
food security. Crop yields could decrease by up to 30 percent at 1.5–2°C and by almost 60 percent at 3–4°C.
At the same time, migration and climate-related pressure on resources might increase the risk of conflict.
    In the Western Balkans and Central Asia, reduced water availability in some places becomes a threat
as temperatures rise toward 4°C. Melting glaciers in Central Asia and shifts in the timing of water flows

 will lead to less water resources in summer months and high risks of torrential floods. In the Balkans, a
 higher risk of drought results in potential declines for crop yields, urban health, and energy generation. In
 Macedonia, yield losses are projected of up to 50 percent for maize, wheat, vegetables and grapes at 2°C
 warming. In northern Russia, forest dieback and thawing of permafrost threaten to amplify global warming as
 stored carbon and methane are released into the atmosphere, giving rise to a self-amplifying feedback loop.
     Turn Down the Heat: Confronting the New Climate Normal builds on our 2012 report, which concluded
 the world would warm by 4°C by the end of this century with devastating consequences if we did not take
 concerted action now. It complements our 2013 report that looked at the potential risks to development
 under different warming scenarios in Sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia and South Asia, and which
 warned that we could experience a 2°C world in our lifetime.
     Many of the worst projected climate impacts outlined in this latest report could still be avoided by
 holding warming below 2°C. But, this will require substantial technological, economic, institutional and
 behavioral change. It will require leadership at every level of society.
     Today the scientific evidence is overwhelming, and it’s clear that we cannot continue down the current
 path of unchecked, growing emissions. The good news is that there is a growing consensus on what it will
 take to make changes to the unsustainable path we are currently on.
     More and more voices are arguing that is possible to grow greener without necessarily growing slower.
 Today, we know that action is urgently needed on climate change, but it does not have to come at the
 expense of economic growth. We need smart policy choices that stimulate a shift to clean public transport
 and energy efficiency in factories, buildings and appliances can achieve both growth and climate benefits.
     This last report in the Turn Down the Heat series comes at a critical moment. Earlier this year, the UN
 Secretary General’s Climate Summit unleased a new wave of optimism. But our reports make clear that
 time is of the essence.
     Governments will gather first in Lima and then Paris for critical negotiations on a new climate treaty.
 Inside and outside of the conference halls, global leaders will need to take difficult decisions that will require,
 in some instances, short term sacrifice but ultimately lead to long term gains for all.
     At the World Bank Group we will use our financial capacity to help tackle climate change. We will
 innovate and bring forward new financial instruments. We will use our knowledge and our convening
 power. We will use our evidence and data to advocate and persuade. In short, we will do everything we
 can to help countries and communities build resilience and adapt to the climate impacts already being felt
 today and ensure that finance flows to where it is most needed.
      Our response to the challenge of climate change will define the legacy of our generation. The stakes
 have never been higher.

Summary
                                                                                                              Executive Summary
The data show that dramatic climate changes, heat and weather extremes are already impacting people, damaging crops and coastlines
and putting food, water, and energy security at risk. Across the three regions studied in this report, record-breaking temperatures are
occurring more frequently, rainfall has increased in intensity in some places, while drought-prone regions are getting dryer. In an overview of
social vulnerability, the poor and underprivileged, as well as the elderly and children, are found to be often hit the hardest. There is growing
evidence, that even with very ambitious mitigation action, warming close to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by mid-century is already
locked-in to the Earth’s atmospheric system and climate change impacts such as extreme heat events may now be unavoidable.1 If the
planet continues warming to 4°C, climatic conditions, heat and other weather extremes considered highly unusual or unprecedented
today would become the new climate normal—a world of increased risks and instability. The consequences for development would be
severe as crop yields decline, water resources change, diseases move into new ranges, and sea levels rise. The task of promoting human
development, of ending poverty, increasing global prosperity, and reducing global inequality will be very challenging in a 2°C world, but
in a 4°C world there is serious doubt whether this can be achieved at all. Immediate steps are needed to help countries adapt to the
climate impacts being felt today and the unavoidable consequences of a rapidly warming world. The benefits of strong, early action on
climate change, action that follows clean, low carbon pathways and avoids locking in unsustainable growth strategies, far outweigh the
costs. Many of the worst projected climate impacts could still be avoided by holding warming to below 2°C. But, the time to act is now.
This report focuses on the risks of climate change to development in Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and North
Africa, and parts of Europe and Central Asia. Building on earlier Turn Down the Heat reports this new scientific analysis examines
the likely impacts of present day (0.8°C), 2°C and 4°C warming above pre-industrial temperatures on agricultural production, water
resources, ecosystem services and coastal vulnerability for affected populations.

  Holding warming to below 2°C and bringing warming back to 1.5°C by 2100 is technically and economically feasible but implies stringent mitigation over the short term.
While IPCC AR5 WGIII identified many mitigation options to hold warming below 2°C with a likely chance, and with central estimates of 1.5–1.7°C by 2100, only “a limited
number of studies have explored scenarios that are more likely than not to bring temperature change back to below 1.5°C by 2100”. The scenarios in these studies are “charac-
terized by (1) immediate mitigation action; (2) the rapid upscaling of the full portfolio of mitigation technologies; and (3) development along a low-energy demand trajectory”.

       Box 2: Social Vulnerability Impacts of Climate Change
       Shocks and stresses related to climate change can undermine poverty reduction and push new groups into poverty. Informal settlements
       on flood plains and steep hillsides in many Latin American cities and the Western Balkans, for example, have been severely affected by floods and
       landslides in recent years. While many poor people will be living in isolated, rural areas, continued urban expansion into hazard-prone areas means
       that a growing proportion of urban populations will be at risk of climate-related extreme events and rising food prices, and thus of increasing poverty
       levels among urban groups.
             The impacts of climate change will often be most severely felt by poor and socially excluded groups, whose capacity to adapt to
       both rapid- and slow-onset climate change is more limited. These include indigenous people and ethnic minorities, migrant workers, women,
       girls, older people, and children. Although these groups—like their more advantaged counterparts—are already adapting to climatic and other
       changes, these efforts are often undermined by their limited assets, lack of voice, and discriminatory social norms. For example, increasing water
       stress, projected for parts of Latin America and low-income Middle East and North Africa countries, can dramatically increase the labor burden asso-
       ciated with fetching water in rural and poor urban environments; and child malnutrition linked to climate change reducing protein and micronutrient
       contents of staple foods (wheat, rice) could have irreversible, negative life-time consequences for affected children.
             Climate change may lead to displacement and also affect patterns and rates of migrations. Most displacement related to extreme
       weather events has, to date, been temporary. However, if climate change renders certain areas uninhabitable (for example, if they become too hot,
       too dry, or too frequently affected by extreme events—or sea-level rise) such migration may increase in scale and more often lead to permanent
       resettlement (as already being seen in some water-scarce parts of MENA). Large-scale migration may pose significant challenges for family relations,
       health, and human security. There is a risk of disadvantaged groups being trapped in adversely affected rural areas as they lack the funds and/or
       social connections to move.

       Box 3: Selected Climate Risks in the Latin America and the Caribbean Region
       In a 4°C world, heat extremes, changes in hydrological cycles, tropical cyclones and changes in the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are
       expected to pose severe problems with risks cascading to the agricultural sector, human health, large urban centers and the functioning of critical
       ecosystem services. At lower levels of warming, glacial melt in the Andes will reduce freshwater and hydropower for communities and large Andean
       cities during the dry season, while increasing the risks of flooding in the short term and impacting agriculture and environmental services down-
       stream. Severe threats are expected from sea-level rise, damages to low-lying areas and coastal infrastructures. Degrading coral reefs will endanger
       tourism revenues and undermine biodiversity, fisheries, and the protection of coastal zones thereby negatively impacting livelihoods. For the global
       community, the potential impact of climate change on the Amazon rainforest is of high relevance. With increasing warming, degradation—if not
       dieback—of the Amazon rainforest is increasingly possible potentially turning the forest into a large carbon source during dry years and triggering
       further climate change.

Box 5: Selected Climate Risks in the Middle East and North Africa Region
The region will be severely affected at 2°C and 4°C warming, particularly because of the large increase in projected heat extremes, the substantial
reduction in water availability, and expected consequences for regional food security. High exposure to sea-level rise in the coming decades is linked to
large populations and assets in coastal areas. In a 2°C world already low annual river discharge levels are projected to drop by more than 15 percent
and highly unusual heat extremes are projected to affect about a third of the land. Crop yield declines coupled with impacts in other grain-producing
regions could contribute to increasing food prices in the region. The growing food import dependency further exacerbates such risks. Deteriorating
rural livelihoods may contribute to internal and international migration, adding further stress on particularly urban infrastructure, with associated risks for
poor migrants. Migration and climate related pressure on resources (e.g. water) might increase the risk of conflict.

      Box 6: Selected Climate Risks in the Europe and Central Asia Region
      Increasing precipitation and glacial melt lead to increased water availability and flood risk in Central Asia in the coming decades. After mid-century
      and especially with warming leading to a 4°C world, unstable water availability poses a risk for agriculture and competing demands for hydropower
      generation. In the Western Balkans, extreme heat with a strong decrease in precipitation and water availability are projected to lead to large reduc-
      tions in crop yields, adverse effects on human health, and increasing risks to energy generation for a 4°C world; but would already be present in a
      2°C world. The Russian forests store enormous amounts of carbon in biomass and soils. While their productivity may generally increase with warmer
      temperatures, large-scale forest dieback and the release of carbon resulting from interacting heat stress, insect spread and fire, have the potential to
      further affect boreal forests in the second half of the century.

  noted explicitly. In addition, observed impacts or impacts occurring at lower or higher levels of warming that are not covered by the key studies high-
  lighted here are not presented (e.g., coral bleaching already occurs earlier than 1.5°C warming but the studies presented here only start at 1.5°C).
  Adaptation measures are not assessed here although they can be crucial to alleviate impacts of climate change. The layout of the figure is adapted
  from Parry (2010). The lower-case superscript letters indicate the relevant references for each impact.10 If there is no letter, the results are based on

This report describes the challenges for development and poverty reduction under anthropogenic climate change in Latin America
and the Caribbean (LAC), the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and Europe and Central Asia (ECA). Climate change projections
are presented for each region alongside an assessment of the most recent literature on climate change impacts that are expected
in key sectors for different warming levels, from the current baseline of 0.8°C through to 2°C and 4°C above pre-industrial levels in
2100. These impacts are then discussed in relation to existing social vulnerabilities to stress the implications of biophysical climate
change impacts for development in the different regions. In order to provide a better understanding of how climate change and its
expected impacts may affect development, storylines—referred to here as development narratives—are presented. These follow
the chain of impacts from the physical to the biophysical and social level and specify how climate change could affect human well-
being. Attention is paid to the specific ways in which different population groups are affected. The development narratives stress
plausible scenarios and plausible impacts rather than giving probability ranges for the impacts estimated. Following the chain of
impacts, the assessment shows that climate change poses severe challenges for human wellbeing and development, with the
poor and underprivileged often hardest hit.

The Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the IPCC provides a very comprehensive analysis of the physical science basis and the
observed and projected impacts of climate change as well as of the economics of climate change mitigation. The following chapter
should be read as an addition to the AR5, with emphasis on topics that are of particular relevance for the focus regions of this
report and where scientific studies published after the literature cutoff dates of the AR5 led to an update of the findings from IPCC
for specific issues.

 The medium-dark-grey shaded area (bar on right-hand side indicates year-2100 range) indicates the 90 percent uncertainty range over 114 baseline sce-
 narios from the literature, excluding a class of variants that assume very high autonomous improvements in energy intensity. The dark-grey range on the
 right-hand side indicates the broadening of the 90 percent scenario range, if one includes these variants. For comparison, the light-grey area indicates the
 80 percent range over all scenarios, as assessed in IPCC WGIII AR5 (2014d). The climate model underlying these calculations is the same as applied for
 all emissions scenarios in the IPCC WGIII AR5 (2014d). The climate-system uncertainty derived from such modeling is depicted for RCP2.6 as the blue-
 shaded area (66 percent uncertainty). Note that the estimates here are comparable to the full CMIP5 model range, which are slightly cooler at the end of
 the 21st century than the ISI-MIP subset of CMIP5 models used for most projections in this report (see Appendix). In this subset, the RCP 2.6 scenario
 represents a 1.8°C warming and the RCP 8.5 represents a 4.6°C warming above pre-industrial levels for the period 2081–2099.

  Box 2.1: Definition of Warming Levels and Base Period in This Report
  This report and the previous Turn Down the Heat reports reference future global warming levels against the pre-industrial period 1850–1900 consis-
  tent with the IPCC WGI AR5.
       To study the impacts of climate change at different levels of global mean warming in this report, the literature and present climate impacts for
  different warming levels above the pre-industrial period were reviewed using the following classification:


                 WARMING
                 CATEGORY                  OBSERVED         1°C             1.5°C            2°C              3°C            4°C
                 Range [°C]                     <0.8          0.8–1.25        1.25–1.75        1.75–2.25        2.25–3.5        >3.5

       Given the diversity of different base periods for projections, emissions scenarios, and models or model ensembles used, this report adopts a
  standardized approach to convert any given warming level with any given base period to its corresponding warming level relative to the pre-industrial
  period (see Appendix). This allows, within limits, for a classification of climate impacts independent of the underlying emissions scenario and model
  or model ensemble used. This stringent approach of classifying warming levels is new in this Turn Down the Heat report and allows for a consistent
  comparison of climate change impacts across studies and sectors.
       Median warming for the full CMIP5 model ensemble under the RCP2.6 is about 1.6°C (and therefore on the border between the 1.5° and 2°C
  warming categories presented above); 22 percent of the models nonetheless projecting a warming above 2°C. For the estimation of heat extremes,
  precipitation, and aridity, this report uses a subset of the CMIP5 models (as in the ISI-MIP project) showing a median warming of 1.8°C above pre-
  industrial levels by 2081–2100 for the RCP 2.6 scenario. As in the earlier reports, impacts in a “2°C world” refer to the impacts assigned to the 2°C
  warming category. Where the results of the ISI-MIP ensemble for RCP 2.6 are used to describe a 2°C world, readers need to be aware that this is at
  the low end of the 2°C impact category. Sea-level rise projections presented in this report are based on a larger model ensemble with an ensemble
  mean warming of less than 1.75°C; as a result, end-of-century sea-level rise in RCP2.6 is classified as 1.5° warming.
       The “4°C world” refers to impacts assigned to the 4°C category as described above. The median warming of the RCP8.5 CMIP5 ensemble for
  the period 2081–2100 is 4.3°C, whereas the projected warming for the ISI-MIP ensemble (used to project heat extremes, precipitation, and aridity)
  is 4.6°C above pre-industrial levels (and thus at the high end of the 4°C warming category). Impacts shown in tables refer to the exact warming
  category above pre-industrial levels, as they allow for more detail than the stylistic futures drawn at 2°C and 4°C global mean warming.
       The terms “2°C world” and “4°C world” always refer to end-of-21st-century impacts’ for impacts referring to earlier time periods the convention
  of “2°C warming by 20xx” is chosen.

 variations of surface warming (Balmaseda et al. 2013; England
 et al. 2014; Foster and Rahmstorf 2011).17 An additional factor is
 data uncertainty. Without taking data uncertainties or the physical
 explanation of a remaining “hiatus” into account, the recent slower
 warming has led to media attention that suggests the sensitivity of
 the climate system to anthropogenic emissions might be smaller
 than estimated previously. IPCC AR5 WGI estimated equilibrium
 climate sensitivity (ECS) at 1.5–4.5°C, which has a lower low-end
 estimate than the IPCC AR4 at 2–4.5°C. On the contrary, values
 substantially higher than 4.5°C still cannot be ruled out.
     Climate projections for the 21st century are, however, not highly
 sensitive to equilibrium warming estimates. Rogelj et al. (2014)
 evaluated the implications of both AR4 and AR5 assessments of
 ECS in a climate-model framework. While the uncertainty ranges
 of global-mean temperature increases by 2100 for RCP2.6 and
 RCP8.5 are slightly wider for the AR5 than for the AR4 model

  Box 2.2: Mechanisms Behind the El-Niño/Southern Oscillation
  In simple terms, the oceanic part of ENSO is characterized by the movement of a pool of warm surface water in an east-west direction along the
  equator. In the mean state, this warm pool is confined to the western tropical Pacific, whereas in the Eastern Pacific, sea surface temperatures (SST)
  are much cooler and the surface water layer, separated from the cold, deep ocean by the so-called thermocline, is shallower (see Figure 2.4 a). In
  the west, the warm surface water facilitates strong atmospheric convection and resulting precipitation; together with sinking motion over the colder
  East Pacific and easterly surface winds that follow the SST gradient an overturning movement of air is formed—the so-called Walker circulation. This
  wind pattern, in turn, drives upwelling of cold deep water in the East Pacific and reinforces the concentration of warm surface water in the west.
       This positive feedback between oceanic and atmospheric processes renders the mean state unstable. Small fluctuations in a part of the system
  are amplified into oscillations of the entire system. Every couple of years, when the easterly surface winds weaken and the warm water from the
  West Pacific extends so far to the east that it approaches the American coast, it creates an El Niño event, with a characteristic pattern of positive
  SST anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific (see Figure 2.4 b). In some years the pendulum swings the other way, and easterly winds
  strengthen and the warm water pool gets concentrated further in west than on average. This is called a La Niña event. Both El Niño and La Niña
  events occur every 2–7 years and with varying magnitudes.

 indicates that projected changes in boreal summer temperature are twice as large as currently occurring variations in summer temperatures across different years.




     Box 2.3: Heat Extremes
     This report defines two types of monthly temperature extremes using thresholds based on the historical variability of the current local climate (similar
     to Hansen et al. 2012). The absolute level of the threshold thus depends on the natural year-to-year variability in the base period (1951–1980), which
     is captured by the standard deviation (sigma). While there is a range of impact relevant temperature extreme measures on a daily or multi-daily basis,
     this report focuses on monthly data.

     3-sigma Events—Three Standard Deviations Outside the Normal
     •   Highly Unusual at present
     •   Extreme monthly heat
     •   Projected to become the norm over most continental areas by the end of the 21st century

     5-sigma Events—Five Standard Deviations Outside the Normal
     •   Essentially absent at present
     •   Unprecedented monthly heat: new class of monthly heat extremes
     •   Projected to become common, especially in the tropics and in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes during summertime
         Assuming a normal distribution, 3-sigma events would have a return time of 740 years. The 2012 U.S. heat wave and the 2010 Russian heat
     wave classify as 3-sigma events (Coumou and Robinson 2013). 5-sigma events have a return time of several million years. Monthly temperature
     data do not necessarily follow a normal distribution (for example, the distribution can have long tails, making warm events more likely) and the return
     times can be different from the ones expected in a normal distribution. Nevertheless, 3-sigma events are extremely unlikely and 5-sigma events have
     almost certainly never occurred over the lifetime of key ecosystems and human infrastructure.

2.3.6 Droughts

While an upward trend for extreme temperature and heavy pre-
cipitation events can be clearly deduced from the observational
record, there is still considerable debate as to whether or not
there is a trend in global drought in recent decades (Dai 2012;
Sheffield et al. 2012). Drought projections depend strongly on the
underlying methodology, the applied indicators, and the reference
periods used (Trenberth et al. 2014). In accordance with the overall
drying trend in several world regions, an increase in intensity and
duration of droughts is estimated to be likely by the end of the
21st century (IPCC 2013a, Table SPM.1).

  Box 2.4: The CO2 Fertilization Effect
  Increasing carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere lead not only to higher air temperatures due to the greenhouse effect but also affect
  plant productivity and vegetative matter (Ackerman and Stanton 2013). Higher CO2 concentrations also lead to improved water use efficiency in
  plants through reducing transpiration by decreasing the plant’s stomatal conductance (Hatfield et al. 2011).
        Plants can be categorized as C3 and C4 plants according to their photosynthetic pathways. Maize, sorghum, sugar cane and other C4 plants
  use atmospheric CO2 more efficiently, which means that C4 plants do not benefit as much as C3 plants from increasing CO2 concentrations except
  during drought stress (Leakey 2009). C3 plants, including wheat, rice, and soybeans, use atmospheric CO2 less efficiently and therefore profit from
  increasing CO2 concentrations (Ackerman and Stanton 2013; Leakey 2009); this possibly attenuates the negative effects of climate change for C3
  plants.
        The degree to which the CO2 fertilization effect will increase crop yields and compensate for negative effects is uncertain, as differing experi-
  mental designs have shown. For example, Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiments suggested a 50-percent lower CO2 fertilization effect than
  enclosure studies (Ackerman and Stanton 2013; Long et al. 2006).* Moreover, the yield response to elevated CO2 concentrations seems to be plant
  and genotype specific and depends on the availability of water and nutrients (Porter et al. 2014). It seems certain, however, that water-stressed
  crops benefit stronger from elevated CO2 concentrations, and thus rain-fed cropping systems could benefit more than irrigated systems (Porter et al.
  2014). A debate is ongoing over whether results from FACE experiments, laboratory experiments, or modeling approaches are closest to reality
  and results among the different approaches differ greatly (Ainsworth et al. 2008; Long et al. 2006; Tubiello, Amthor et al. 2007). For this reason,
  many climate impact studies include a scenario with the CO2 fertilization effect and one scenario without considering the fertilization effect. Elevated
  CO2 concentrations are thought to positively influence future food security through faster plant growth, but they could also have a negative impact
  through a change in the grain’s protein concentration (Pleijel and Uddling 2012; Porter et al. 2014). This change comes about when the increased
  biomass accumulation happens faster than the corresponding nitrogen or nitrate uptake, leading to increasing yields but reduced protein concen-
  tration; this is also known as growth dilution (Bloom et al. 2010; Pleijel and Uddling 2012). This decrease in grain protein concentration, which in
  experiments with wheat ranged from 4–13 percent (and 7.9 percent in FACE experiments), and with barley ranged from 11–13 percent, is assumed
  to have negative effects on the nutritional quality of grains (Bloom et al. 2010; Erbs et al. 2010; Högy et al. 2013; Pleijel and Uddling 2012; Porter et al.
  2014). In addition, elevated CO2 concentrations are associated with significant decreases in the concentrations of zinc and iron in C3 grasses and
  legumes (Myers et al. 2014).

  *The study by Long et al. (2006) triggered a debate and resulted in a critical response by Tubiello et al. (2007) which in turn was answered by the original authors
  in Ainsworth et al. (2008).

                                                       Latin America and the Caribbean
The Latin America and the Caribbean region encompasses a huge diversity of landscapes and ecosystems. The region is highly
heterogeneous in terms of economic development and social and indigenous history. It is also one of the most urbanized regions in
the world. In Latin America and the Caribbean, temperature and precipitation changes, heat extremes, and the melting of glaciers
will have adverse effects on agricultural productivity, hydrological regimes, and biodiversity. In Brazil, without additional adaptation,
crop yields could decrease by 30–70 percent for soybean and up to 50 percent for wheat at 2°C warming. Ocean acidification,
sea level rise, and more intense tropical cyclones will affect coastal livelihoods and food and water security, particularly in the
Caribbean. Local food security is also seriously threatened by the projected decrease in fishery catch potential. Reductions and
shifts in water availability would be particularly severe for Andean cities. The Amazon rainforest may be at risk of large‐scale forest
degradation that contributes to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and local and regional hydrological changes.

     Years indicate the decade during which warming levels are exceeded with a 50 percent or greater change (generally at start of decade) in a business-as-usual scenario
(RCP8.5 scenario) (and not in mitigation scenarios limiting warming to these levels, or below, since in that case the year of exceeding would always be 2100, or not at all).
Exceedance with a likely chance (>66 percent) generally occurs in the second half of the decade cited. Impacts are given for warming levels irrespective of the timeframe (i.e.,
if a study gives impacts for 2°C warming in 2100 then the impact is given in the 2°C column). If a study refers to a warming level by the end of the century, this is marked
with an asterisk (*). Impacts given in the observations column do not necessarily form the baseline for future impacts. Impacts for different warming levels may originate
from different studies and therefore may be based on different underlying assumptions; this means that the impacts are not always fully comparable (e.g., crop yields may
decrease more under a 3°C than a 4°C scenario because underlying the impact at 3° warming is a study that features very strong precipitation decreases). Moreover, this
report did not systematically review observed impacts. It highlights important observed impacts for current warming but does not conduct any formal process to attribute
impacts to climate change.

The Middle East and North Africa region is one of the most diverse in the world in economic terms, with per-capita annual GDP
ranging from $1,000 in Yemen to more than $20,000 in the Arab Gulf States. As a consequence, adaptive capacity and vulnerability
to climate risks varies enormously within the region. The region will be severely affected at both 2°C and 4°C warming, particularly
because of the large increase in projected heat extremes, the substantial reduction in water availability and expected consequences
for regional food security. In some countries, crop yields could decrease by up to 30 percent at 1.5–2°C and by almost 60 percent
at 3–4°C in parts of the region. Deteriorating rural livelihoods may contribute to internal and international migration, adding further
stresses on particularly urban infrastructure with associated health risks for poor migrants. Migration and climate‐related pressure
on resources might increase the risk of conflict.

 Agriculture corresponds to ISIC divisions 1–5 and includes forestry, hunting, and fishing, as well as cultivation of crops and livestock production. Value added is the net
output of a sector after adding up all outputs and subtracting intermediate inputs. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or
depletion and degradation of natural resources.

    Some individual grid cells have noticeably different values than their direct neighbors (e.g. on Turkey’s Black Sea coast under RCP8.5). This is due to the fact that the aridity
 index is defined as a fraction of total annual precipitation divided by potential evapotranspiration (see Appendix). It therefore behaves in a strongly non-linear fashion and
 year-to-year fluctuations can be large. As the results are averaged over a relatively small number of model simulations, this can result in local jumps.

   Box 4.3: The Nile Delta
   For Egypt, and assuming no adaptation, annual damages have been projected in the range of $5 billion by 2100 for a 1.26-meter sea-level rise
   (Hinkel et al. 2012) and $14.8 billion by 2100 under the A1B scenario (Brown et al. 2009). Dasgupta et al. (2009), meanwhile, projected losses of
   25 percent of the Nile Delta’s land area, affecting 10.5 percent of the population and 6.4 percent of GDP with a 1-meter sea-level rise (Dasgupta,
   Laplante, Meisner et al. 2009). Another study estimated the value of assets exposed to a 0.5-meter sea-level rise by 2070 at $563 billion in the city
   of Alexandria alone (Hanson et al. 2011).
        The Nile Delta, however, has an extensive history of coastal defense that dates back to the construction of the Mohamed Ali Sea Wall in 1830. Modern
   defensive works and other infrastructure, including the International Coastal Road, provide further protection against flooding (Frihy and El-Sayed 2013).
        Studies by Egypt’s Coastal Research Institute concluded that, under the A1F1 scenario, 14.4 percent of the Nile Delta would be at risk from
   inundation by 2100; this fell to three percent when taking into account the value of the Mohamed Ali Sea Wall (EEAA 2010). Another study found
   that, although 22.5–29.2 percent of the area was vulnerable to inundation depending on the sea-level rise scenario and assuming no adaptation,
   much of that impact would fall on undeveloped lands and wetlands, with built-up land accounting for less than five percent of the impact (Table 4.8)
   (Hassaan and Abdrabo 2013).

  Box 4.4: Impacts of Climate Change on Tourism in Morocco
  In Morocco, different studies have explored the complex interlinkages between coastal development, climate vulnerabilities, and tourism. During the
  peak summer months, the population of Morocco’s Mediterranean area doubles from eight to 16 percent of the national population; this has driven
  rapid coastal urbanization (Anfuso et al. 2011). Urbanization has contributed to the increased erosion of Morocco’s sandy beaches, thereby increasing
  vulnerability to coastal flooding (Ahizoun et al. 2009; Anfuso et al. 2011). Ambitious plans to expand coastal tourism in Morocco could exacerbate coastal
  vulnerabilities by increasing the amount of exposed assets and as coastal modifications weaken the coast’s natural defenses (Anfuso et al. 2011).
       Snoussi et al. (2009) found that 99.9 percent of sandy beaches and 84.5 percent of tourism infrastructure in Tangiers would be lost to an 0.86-meter
  sea-level rise by 2100. Snoussi et al. (2008) projected that for the area between Saidia and Ras el Ma, 50 percent of sandy beaches would be eroded by
  2050 under a 0.39-meter sea-level rise and 70 percent by 2100 for a scenario of a 0.86-meter sea-level rise, with consequent impacts on tourism.
       Other studies in Morocco have shown that climate change impacts on water supply and demand are likely to increase competition for water
  between tourism and other uses, which may ultimately affect the economic performance of specific tourism services (Tekken et al. 2009, 2013;
  Tekken and Kropp 2012). This is a particular issue in the context of growing luxury tourism, which requires high water demand for golf courses,
  swimming pools, and other leisure facilities (Tekken et al. 2013; Zarhloule et al. 2009). Together, these factors could contribute to a structural water
  deficit, requiring policy, planning, and investment to manage (Tekken and Kropp 2012).

      Please note that the years indicate the decade during which warming levels are exceeded with a 50 percent or greater change (generally at start of decade) in a business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5 scenario), and
      not in mitigation scenarios limiting warming to these levels, or below; in the latter case, the year of exceeding would always be 2100 or not at all. Exceedance with a likely chance (>66 percent) generally occurs in the
      second half of the decade cited. Impacts are given for warming levels irrespective of the timeframe (i.e. if a study gives impacts for 2°C warming in 2100, then the impact is given in the 2°C column). Impacts given in the
      observations column do not necessarily form the baseline for future impacts. Impacts for different warming levels may originate from different studies and therefore may be based on different underlying assumptions—
      meaning that the impacts are not always fully comparable (e.g., crop yields may decrease more in 3°C than 4°C because underlying the impact at 3°C warming is a study that features very strong precipitation decreases.
      Moreover, this report did not systematically review observed impacts. It highlights important observed impacts for current warming but does not conduct any formal process to attribute impacts to climate change.
      * Impacts of sea-level rise on coastal land, infrastructure, and tourism might have been calculated with different warming levels than reported here but have been moved to a lower warming level in the table to be
      consistent with the sea-level rise reported at the top of the table. Please see Chapter 2—The Global Picture for more information on the reason for different sea-level rise projections and Section 4.4.5, Coastal
      Infrastructure and Tourism for details on the individual impact studies.

is the region spanning from 30N to 48N latitude and from 10W to 40E longitude. See Figure 2 in Sillmann et al. (2013b).

     On average one of the summer months (June, July or August) each year will exceed temperatures warmer than three standard deviations beyond the 1951–1980 mean.

     Note that these relatively large percentage changes projected for regions south of 25°N occur in a region that is very dry today. Thus, the absolute changes are small.

     Physical exposure to drought, a product designed by UNEP/GRID-Europe for the Global Assessment Report on Risk Reduction (GAR). It was modeled using global data.
It is based on three sources: (1) a global monthly gridded precipitation dataset obtained from the Climatic Research Unit (University of East Anglia); (2) a GIS modeling
of global Standardized Precipitation Index based on Brad Lyon (IRI, Columbia University) methodology. (3) a population grid for the year 2010, provided by LandScanTM
Global Population Database (Oak Ridge, TN: Oak Ridge National Laboratory). Unit is expected average annual population exposed (inhabitants). This product was designed
by Pascal Peduzzi (UNEP/GRID-Geneva, ISDR). Credit: GIS processing UNEP/GRID-Europe.

than one mm. The Sahara region is defined as a box stretching from 18N–30N latitude and 20W–65E longitude. The Mediterranean region is defined as a box stretching from
30N–48N latitude and 10W–40E longitude (only land grid points).

     Various authors used the MEDALUS model to quantify the vulnerability against desertification in the MNA region. The MEDALUS model integrates regional information on
vegetation, soil, climate, erosion, and management and quantifies the sensitivity of a region against desertification in four classes: critical, fragile, moderate, and non-sensitive.

The Europe and Central Asia region encompasses a wide range of geographic features ranging from the mountains to coasts in
the Western Balkans and from the vast plains of Central Asia to Russia’s boreal forests. In the Western Balkans and Central Asia,
heat extremes and reduced water availability become threats as temperatures rise toward 4°C. This includes earlier glacier melt
in Central Asia and shifts in the timing of water flows, and a higher risk of drought in the Western Balkans, with potential declines
for crop yields, urban health, and energy generation. In Macedonia, for example, yield losses are projected of up to 50 percent for
maize, wheat, vegetables and grapes at 2°C warming. Flood risk is expected to increase slightly along the Danube, Sava and Tisza
rivers, and a slight decrease in 100-year flood events is projected in the southern parts of the Western Balkans. At 2°C warming,
methane emissions from melting permafrost could increase by 20–30 percent across Russia in the mid‐21st century.

  Agriculture corresponds to ISIC divisions 1–5 and includes forestry, hunting, and fishing, as well as cultivation of crops and livestock production. Value added is the net
output of a sector after adding up all outputs and subtracting intermediate inputs. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets, or depletion
and degradation of natural resources.

   Some individual grid cells have noticeably different values than their direct
neighbors. This is due to the fact that the aridity index is defined as a fraction of
total annual precipitation divided by potential evapotranspiration (see Appendix).
It therefore behaves in a strongly non-linear fashion and year-to-year fluctuations
can be large. As the results are averaged over a relatively small number of model
simulations, this can result in local jumps.

 disagree over the direction of change (partly due to similar uncer-
 tainty in projections of precipitation changes).
      Northern regions will see an increase in the AI (i.e., wetter
 conditions) as would be expected from the projected increase in
 annual-mean precipitation. The signal is especially strong over
 the Northeast (i.e., the Asian part of Russia), with a 20–30 per-
 cent increase forecast under RCP2.6 and a 50 percent forecast in
 a 4˚C world.
      The shift in AI shown in Figure 5.9 causes some regions to
 be classified in a different aridity class. In a 4˚C world, the area
 of land classified as hyper-arid, arid, or semi-arid will grow from
 about 13 percent in 1951–1980 to 17.5 percent in 2071–2099, which
 is an increase of more than 30 percent (see Table 5.2). In a 2˚C
 world, this increase in arid regions is much more limited (only
 about five percent larger).

     Climate change will also influence the snow regime in the
mountains. This will further contribute to a shift of the spring floods
to earlier periods. River flow will be lower in the vegetation period
and the winter runoff may increase. Siegfried et al. (2012) found
for Central Asia that climate changes are likely to affect runoff
seasonality due to earlier snowmelt. Based on a model set up for
2050 for the Syr Darya, they projected a shift in the peak flows
from summer to spring. This may increase water stress in the sum-
mer, particularly in unregulated catchments (Siegfried et al. 2012).
     By the end the 21st century, climate change is expected to lead
to a distinct decrease in the water volume of the Syr Darya (see
Figure 5.16) and an even more distinct decrease in the Amu Darya
River due to its higher share of glacier melt water (Davletkeldiev
et al. 2009; Main Administration of Hydrometeorology 2009). This
is due to decreasing precipitation and enhanced glacial retreat
(see Figure 5.17 for an example). Glacier retreat will continue to
diminish the stock of water stored in the high mountain areas as
snow and ice; this will provide enhanced runoff during the next
few decades, followed by a severe water shortage as the stock
becomes depleted. In particular, the summer floods of the Amu
Darya, highly important for irrigation, are expected to decline
substantially by 2100. A further reduction in surface water flow is
projected to be caused by an increase in evaporation rates, due to
higher temperatures. By the end of the 21th century, runoff generation
rates in the mountainous areas of Central Asia are likely to decline
substantially (Main Administration of Hydrometeorology 2009).

Impacts on the Aral Sea and Major Lakes
More than 50 years of unsustainable water use for irrigation in arid
deserts has led to a profound depletion of water resources in the Aral
Sea basin, with consequences for society, the economy and nature.         Source: Novikov et al. (2009).
Starting in the 1960s, the Aral Sea has shrunk drastically, mainly
due to water withdrawals for irrigation purposes and the construc-

 et al. (2007) range from 58 TgC per year up to 520 TgC per year for
 boreal Russia/Siberia for different time periods within 1971–2002.
 A large part of the uncertainty relates to how burn severity is
 accounted for (Balshi et al. 2007). An estimated 59.3 percent
 of vegetation fires occurred in forest areas and accounted for
 about 82 TgC per year of emissions on average during 1998–2010
 (Shvidenko et al. 2012). A later study (Shvidenko and Schepaschenko
 2013) estimated the total amount of carbon burnt in 1998–2010 at
 121±28 TgC per year, with 76 percent (i.e., 92±18 TgC per year)
 occurring on forest lands. Shvidenko and Schepaschenko (2013)
 also stressed that post-fire dieback is uncertain and may amount
 to 90–100 TgC per year.

      Please note that years indicate the decade during which warming levels are exceeded with a 50 percent or greater change (generally at start of decade) in a business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5 scenario) and not
      in mitigation scenarios limiting warming to these levels, or below (since, in that case, the year of exceeding would always be 2100 or not at all). Exceedance with a likely chance (>66 percent) generally occurs in the
      second half of the decade cited. Impacts are given for warming levels irrespective of the timeframe (i.e. if a study gives impacts for 2°C warming in 2100, then the impact is given in the 2°C column). Impacts given in the
      observations column do not necessarily form the baseline for future impacts. Impacts for different warming levels may originate from different studies and therefore may be based on different underlying assumptions,
      meaning that the impacts are not always fully comparable (e.g., crop yields may decrease more in 3°C than 4°C because underlying the impact at 3°C warming is a study that features very strong precipitation decreases.
      Moreover, this report does not systematically review observed impacts. It highlights important observed impacts for current warming but does not conduct any formal process to attribute impacts to climate change.

 The uncertainty ranges reflect upper and lower bounds as originally reported, without distinction between likely and very likely ranges. Note that expert
 judgment assessments were originally reported for 2100 and subsequently adjusted by us to match the common projection horizon (2081–2100), assuming
 a linear increase in the rate of rise from present day to the projection horizon. Present-day baseline climate refers to 1986–2005 in the current report and
 may vary in other assessments (e.g. 1980–1999 for AR4, 2010 for BA2013), but no adjustment was made because results are less sensitive to the chosen
 baseline. Emissions scenarios vary slightly across the reports, but were selected to make the comparison at least qualitatively meaningful (e.g., A1FI for
 AR4, RCP8.5 for AR5 and Turn Down the Heat). Note that land-water storage is not included in this comparison and was removed from the IPCC AR5
 estimate for consistency (estimated at 0.04 m (–0.01 m, 0.09 m) between 1986–2005 and 2081–2100, Table 13.5 in Church et al. 2013).
