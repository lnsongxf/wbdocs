    during a month on the same route.                            several routes in a single day.


       Data Adjustment 1: Splitting Fuel Consumption Data Among Drivers

       Many transport companies operate bus routes that have long service spans. The service on routes begins
       early in the morning (for example, 6 am) and ends late in the evening (10 pm). It is common to schedule
       this type of service using one bus and two drivers who work eight hour shifts each.

       The bus is fuelled at the end of the day since it is not practical to refuel it each time a driver changes. The
       fuel record often shows the bus number, the route number, the names or employee identification numbers
       of the drivers, the kilometres operated and the litres of fuel consumed. In many cases, however, the
       company does not record actual kilometres operated by individual drivers on a daily basis.

       The simple technical adjustment in this case is splitting the kilometres operated and the volume of fuel
       consumed equally among the drivers.

       For example, Bus 45 is operated by Drivers 102 and 207 on Route 2. The bus travels 200 km and consumes
       80 litres. This is split equally among the drivers to modify their individual records to reflect Driver 1 and
       Driver 2 both driving 100 km and consuming 40 litres of fuel each.

introduced when making apportionments                     performing buses and drivers.


  Data Adjustment 2: Splitting Fuel Consumption Data Among Routes


  Many transport companies schedule drivers to operate more than one bus route during the day using a
  single bus. This may be done because the routes have different starting and ending times or as an effort
  to reduce dead kilometres for routes with long distances and service spans.

  The simple technical adjustment is splitting the kilometres operated and the litres of fuel consumed equally
  among the routes.

  For example, Driver 104 operates Bus 45 on Routes 12 and 18. The bus travels 180 km and consumes 60
  litres. This data is split equally between the two routes, with each having operated 90 km, consuming 30
  litres each.




  Data Adjustment 3: Route Grouping


  A vast majority of transport companies operate bus routes with varying bus requirements. Most bus routes
  require at least two buses to meet passenger load demands, which also help maintain reasonable service
  frequencies on medium to long distance urban routes. At times some transport companies operate bus
  routes that require only one bus, especially when the routes are short and have low passenger loads.

  Targeting low performing buses and drivers on such routes can present a problem if the same bus
  is assigned to the route every day. In this situation, the average fuel consumption will equal the fuel
  consumption of the single bus. There are no high or low performing buses on the route, just one bus.

  A variation of this problem is when two types of buses are operated on a route, but there is only one bus
  operated of a single bus type. For example, a route may regularly use four 160-HP buses and one 130-HP
  bus.



The simple technical adjustment that is                    stop more frequently for passengers, traffic
used to address this problem is grouping                   junctions and congested traffic.

                                                           An example of this grouping adjustment is
to create a new ‘combined route’ for the

12   Guidelines FOR Improving Fuel Economy in City Bus Transport
  Analysis Adjustment 1: Weighted Bus Relative Fuel Economy

  An individual bus may operate on more than one route during a month because, either:
  •	 The bus is scheduled to operate on two or more routes on a single day; or
  •	 The bus is a replacement (back-up) bus for a regularly-assigned bus that is in the depot for the day for
     repairs, preventive maintenance or routine inspection.
  A weighted-averaging method is used to develop a composite score for relative fuel economy for a bus
  that provides services on more than one route during a month. The individual, relative fuel economy scores
  for the bus on each route are weighted by the kilometres operated to calculate one composite value of
  relative fuel economy for the bus.
  An example of calculating weighted bus relative fuel economy is shown in Exhibit 5. Bus 43 operated on
  Routes 12, 14 and 16 during the analysis month. The relative fuel economies were calculated for Bus 43 on
  Routes 12 (-0.27 kmpl), 14 (-0.14 kmpl) and 16 (-0.12 kmpl). The weighted-average relative fuel economy
  for Bus 43 was -0.18 kmpl. This result is used as the value to rank Bus 43 among the other buses operated
  by the transport company.

  Analysis Adjustment 2: Weighted Driver Relative Fuel Economy


  An individual driver may drive on more than one route or drive more than one type of bus during a month
  because:
  •	 The driver is scheduled to operate on two or more routes on a single day;
  •	 The driver operates a replacement bus that is a different type from the one that he normally operates;
     or
  •	 The driver is a replacement (back-up) driver for a regularly-assigned driver who is absent for reasons
     such as sickness, family emergencies or paid leave.

  A weighted-averaging method is used for developing a composite score for relative fuel economy for
  a driver who provides services on more than one route or operates more than one type of bus during
  a month. The individual, relative fuel economy score for the driver on each route is weighted by the
  kilometres operated to calculate one composite value of relative fuel economy for the driver.

  An example of calculating weighted driver relative fuel economy is shown in Exhibit 6. Driver 213 drove four
  routes during the analysis month — Routes 21, 23 and 34 as part of his regular assignment and Route 26 on
  which he drove for three days as a substitute driver. The relative fuel economies were calculated for Driver
  213 on Routes 21 (-0.27 kmpl), 23 (-0.14 kmpl), 26 (0.18 kmpl) and 34 (-0.12 kmpl). The weighted-average
  relative fuel economy for Driver 213 was -0.14 kmpl. This result is used as the value to rank Driver 213 among
  the other drivers in the transport company.

        Objective 1: Demonstrate a Technical Approach


        The ESMAP recommended action plan focuses on five principles (Exhibit 15). These principles are a
        combination of technical and management actions.
        To demonstrate the potential benefits of the ESMAP approach it was decided to limit the focus of the pilot
        demonstrations to three ESMAP technical actions:
        •	Data collection and analysis
        •	Maintenance of low fuel efficient buses
        •	Training of low-performing drivers
        There would be no formal implementation of the two management action areas — management
        commitment and ownership and employee communication and rewards — in the pilot demonstration.
        These are actions 1-3 and 15-16 in Exhibit 15. It was felt that employee rewards and incentives and
        management bonuses could involve significant costs and the systems might be unwilling to implement
        these actions until fuel savings were shown.
        It was expected that the full ESMAP program would be implemented after the technical benefits were

28   Guidelines FOR Improving Fuel Economy in City Bus Transport
Objective 2: Refine Analysis Techniques


The 2011 ESMAP guidance note on Transit Bus Operational and Maintenance Practices to Maximize Fuel
Economy has a very good overall approach but provides limited information on analysis techniques. As
part of the preparation work for the pilot demonstrations, further work was identified and conducted in two
analytical areas: data validation and targeting of low-performing buses and drivers.

This work is documented in detail in the chapter Targeting Methodology in this guidance note.




Objective 3: Document Maintenance and Training Protocols


The 2011 ESMAP guidance note on Transit Bus Operational and Maintenance Practices to Maximize Fuel
Economy describes elements that comprise maintenance and driver training protocols but does not
provide detailed instructions on how to conduct the protocols. These instructions are necessary for the
local city staff members to conduct a fuel economy analysis and for applying the protocols.

Detailed instructions were prepared and are documented in the chapters Bus Maintenance Protocols
and Bus Driver Training.




Objective 4: Prepare Operations Manual


The 2011 ESMAP guidance note on Transit Bus Operational and Maintenance Practices to Maximize Fuel
Economy is limited as it provides step-by-step procedures or is a ‘how-to’ manual. Hence, this current
guidance note is written as a simple operations manual for local urban transport managers. It focuses on
three ESMAP technical actions:
•	 Data collection and analysis
•	 Maintenance of low fuel efficient buses
•	 Training of low-performing drivers

In addition, a simple, runtime Access program Fuel Efficiency Analysis Tool (FEAT) was written to conduct
the targeting analysis. The runtime version allows users to run the FEAT program without purchasing or
installing the Microsoft Access program on their computers.
