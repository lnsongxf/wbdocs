to outline the allocation process and the criterion.

2.3 REGISTER OF LICENSES
The data under EITI Requirement 2.3 (required) is
defined as follows:
     License defined as “any license, lease, title,
  a) 
     permit, or concession by which the government
     confers on a company(ies) or individual(s) rights to
     explore or exploit oil, gas and/or mineral resources”.
     Register of licenses defined as “a publicly available
  b) 
     register or cadastre system(s) with the following
     timely and comprehensive information regarding
     each of the licenses pertaining to companies
     covered in the EITI Report”

Data output: Quantitative + spatial + narrative
The data categories for this Requirement comprise of
information to be drawn from the government’s register
of licenses (whether online or a paper register). Data
includes information on ID numbers for allocated
licenses, the owner of these licenses and their location.
The information covered includes details on the
property, its location (geospatial data), the registered
owners and details of the license itself10.
   The possible data categories are provided in Table 8
with recommendations on what information can be
provided and the format this should take. The good/better/
best recommendations for this EITI Requirement are
based on provision of greater detail within each category.

through the rest of the economy. This can be done effectively by using a flow chart as illustrated in Figure 4.

  Within this exercise, the data collection methods and
process should be given special emphasis, so not only
are the data categories standardized, but also the
methodology for collecting/collating this information.
The exercise should focus on taking information in the
public domain (such as Annual Report and International
Exchange filings) and creating equivalence with EITI
data categories.
  The eventual outcome would be the development of
EITI reporting forms that implementers and MSGs can
consider using for their Country Report preparations.
  In the next phase, data on Legal and Fiscal context,
and Licensing data should be consolidated. The third
phase can focus on the remaining EITI Requirements,
as they tend to be more complex and country specific.

(2.2 & 2.3), Contracts (2.4), Production and exports
(3.2 & 3.3), Revenue streams (4.1 – 4.6) and
Contribution of extractives industries to the
economy (6.3).
  These indicators were then categorized based on the
nature of the data outputs into:
  • narrative (QL),
  • quantitative (QT)
  • indexed (A) data.
  Narrative data is defined as text, predominately in the
form of annual reports, contracts and factsheets.
Quantitative data is data points, either numeric
(production volumes) or text (categorical survey data),
often in the form of downloadable datasets or interactive
visualizations.
  Indexed data is where an initiative has analysed
multiple data points to create a measurement relevant
to the chosen indicator. These indexes are often
presented in the form of an interactive visualization and
may also include a downloadable dataset. If an initiative
has published multiple data types relevant to a
particular indicator, all are listed and the predominant
type is listed in bold font.
  There are two initiatives (Dodd-Frank 1504 and EU
Accounting Directive) listed in Table 20 which have
indicated the types of data they will cover but have not
yet begun publishing this data. For these initiatives, the
types of data they will cover have been noted in Table
20 and the reason for not publishing yet is also
detailed. In instances where an initiative has no relevant
data to the EITI’s key indicators, the reason has also
been noted in Table 20.
