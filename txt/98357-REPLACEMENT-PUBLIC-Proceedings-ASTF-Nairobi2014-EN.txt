1.       INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND


The African Region is faced with a multitude of challenges when it comes to
sustainable transport. Achieving sustainable and inclusive transport systems in
Africa is essential for the Region’s economic and social development, as well as
ensuring a transition to clean fuels and technologies, and thus healthier
environments. Rapid urbanization, increasing motorization and inefficient
vehicles and fuels are some of the factors which are contributing to a state of
increasing traffic congestion, a significant decrease in air quality, rising road deaths
and poor accessibility. Despite acceptance that transport and mobility can be
regarded as a pre-condition for sustainable development, a lack of sustainable
transport infrastructure and affordable services remains a major obstacle to
African countries.

In both Asia and Latin America, transport and environment professionals have
been coming together periodically at their respective ‘Environmentally Sustainable
Transport (EST)’ Fora, to discuss and strategize towards more sustainable
transport future. Building on this example, the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP) and the World Bank initially launched a proposal to develop
a similar initiative for Africa, with a view to developing an agreed continent wide
framework for action for sustainable transport, supported by an Africa-based
governance structure and implementation mechanism.

1.1.     ASTF 1st Ministerial Experts Conference

                                          The organization of the 1st
                                          Conference     of     the   Africa
                                          Sustainable Transport Forum
                                          (ASTF) was supported by the
                                          World Bank, The African
                                          Transport      Policy     Program
                                          (SSATP), UN-Habitat and UNEP,
                                          with UNEP hosting the interim
                                          ASTF Secretariat until such a time
as the Forum meets again. The main source of funding for the conference was
provided by SSATP and the South African Fund for Energy, Transport and




                                                                                      1
Extractives (SAFETE). SSATP is an international partnership of 40 African
countries, Regional Economic Communities, continental institutions (African
Union Commission), UN agencies (United Nations Economic Commission for
Africa), public and private sector organizations, and international development
agencies and organizations. All SSATP members are united in their efforts to
strengthen policies and strategies to promote efficient, safe and sustainable
transport for the people in Africa (www.ssatp.org).

The Government of Kenya hosted the first Forum Conference which took place
from 28-30 October 2014 at the UN Headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya. The event
was opened by the UN Secretary General Mr. Ban Ki-moon and His Excellency
Uhuru Kenyatta, the President of Kenya on 30 October 2014, and brought
together representatives of 43 African countries and 21 Ministers from both
Environment and Transport Ministries. This marked the first time that both
environment and transport Ministers came together to agree on priority actions
concerning sustainable transport at a continent wide level.

Substantively the conference broadly addressed issues inclusive of accessibility,
human health, natural resources, inclusivity (including gender), road safety and
social cohesion. The dialogue which ensued confirmed consensus in the
understanding of sustainable transport as an enabler of economic prosperity,
quality of life and societal empowerment, and a tool for reducing the impact of
lifestyles on our natural resources and climate.

The Conference was held over three days with the first two days dedicated to
discussion, interaction and debate on the current and emerging issues of
importance to achieving sustainable transport in Africa, which resulted in the
development of a proposed Action Framework. On the third day of the
conference, invited Ministers and Heads of Delegations listened to the experts
propose the priority areas for action, before reviewing and agreeing upon an ASTF
Action Framework that provides a roadmap towards sustainable transport for
Africa.

1.2.    Conference Objectives

The broad objective of the ASTF is to integrate sustainable transport into the
region’s development and planning processes and increase the amount of funding
going to sustainable transport programs in Africa – to improve accessibility,
reduce air pollution and climate emissions and improve road safety and health.
The high level nature of the first Forum Conference and the opportunities which




2
were presented by bringing Ministers from both environment and transport
spheres together resulted in a set of ambitious goals for the Conference itself. The
aspirations set for the event were with a view to generating a solid and action
orientated outcome, while also addressing fundamental decisions regarding the
nature of the Forum itself - in the interim of a concrete Forum administrative and
consultative system being determined.

The goals of the ASTF 1st Ministerial and Experts Conference were to:

   Share sustainable transport challenges, solutions and best practices,
    especially those from within Africa;
   Discuss and agree on substantive issues of sustainable transport
    infrastructure, road safety, vehicle emissions, and enabling conditions, with a
    view to prioritizing action areas for sustainable transport in Africa through
    the development of an Action Framework;
   Discuss and agree on the institutional arrangements of the ASTF, to support
    the implementation of the Action Framework;
    Collate the above through the development of an Outcome Document.

Integrating sustainable transport into the regions development is a matter of
increasing importance given the rapid urbanization occurring in African cities,
and the opportunities this presents to ‘leapfrog’ to more sustainable and accessible
forms of transport. At present, problems of traffic related air pollution and road
fatalities are increasing, taking a toll on Africa’s societies and economies.
Solutions to these problems need to integrate a suite of initiatives relating to non-
motorized transport, public transport, climate change, air pollution and road
safety holistically - to avail of the broad reaching benefits of sustainable transport.
Ensuring economic growth for trade, employment and innovation in Africa is
dependent on clean, safe and accessible transport systems.

1.3.     ASTF Agenda, Speakers and Participants

Agenda

The Agenda of the ASTF 1st Ministerial and Experts Conference covered three full
days of Conference proceedings to allow for two days of substantive discussion
including the development of a draft Action Framework and one day for
Ministerial attention. The Agenda was designed to facilitate high levels of audience
interaction, debate and discussion while also allowing for participation from all
attendees. Allowing time for good deliberation on substantive issues was an




                                                                                     3
important aspect of drafting the Agenda with panel discussions favored over
power-point presentations. The use of images (photographs, visuals etc.) to guide
the dialogue was encouraged to the speakers when planning for their
presentations, and attention was given to the flow of the Agenda to ensure that
participants were informed, motivated and aspirational when it came to decisions
regarding the ASTF Action Framework.

Day one examined the reality of transport in Africa, drawing on perspectives from
both technical and political backgrounds, while also giving attention to viewpoints
of marginalized and vulnerable groups and civil society organizations. Agenda
time was also allocated to explore existing Africa-led solutions under the broad
banners of solutions for green-growth and solutions for emissions and energy
consumption.




Having deliberated over the various problems and solutions of transport issues
specific to Africa, day two allocated time towards smaller groups working together
to identify priority action areas. This process allowed for all participants to
contribute and discuss before reaching a consensus on priorities. Similarly, time
was dedicated in the Agenda to discussing what African countries need and expect
from the ASTF Secretariat, where this Secretariat should be housed, how it should
be owned and what actions it could take to assist countries in realizing sustainable
transport.

The Agenda also accommodated a full day of Ministerial discussions, with a focus
on the resulting ‘proposal’ of priority action areas and the institutional framework
for ASTF, as an outcome of the work of participants during the first two days.

The full Agenda is included as Annex A to this document.

Speakers

More than 40 individuals filled the various roles of the Agenda over the course of
three days. The various speakers, moderators, facilitators, panelists and high level
guests represented diversity across academic, political, technical and civil society
spheres and countries.

Participants

                                            A total of 43 African Countries
                                            were represented during the
                                            ASTF 1st Ministerial and Experts
                                            Conference. On day three, 21
                                            Ministers or Deputy Ministers
                                            attended. High Level guests that
                                            spoke at the opening of the
                                            Ministerial Session included UN
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, His Excellency President Uhuru Kenyatta and
UNEP Executive Director Mr. Achim Steiner.

Invited participants, in addition to the African Ministers and heads of delegations
included sustainable transport experts from across Africa at both national and
local levels, non-governmental organizations, multi-lateral development banks,
Africa regional organizations, international development organizations and
academic institutions.

The full participant list is included as Annex B to this document.

2.       1ST MINISTERIAL AND EXPERTS CONFERENCE: OVERVIEW OF
         PROCEEDINGS AND OUTLINE OF KEY SESSIONS


2.1.     Conference Summary

Day one of the Conference proceedings led the participants through diverse
perspectives of the reality of transport in Africa, drawing on available data,
experience and expert knowledge while making linkages with related issues at a
global level. Proven solutions as demonstrated in Africa were also discussed
including examples of successful Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) programmes and Non-
Motorized Transport (NMT) interventions as contributors to green growth,
alongside solutions aimed at reducing transport emissions such as adopted fuel
economy targets and goals.

Taking from the deliberations of day one, on day two participants were split into
smaller groups facilitated by breakout sessions - where each group took a holistic
view of the challenges, solutions and opportunities for realizing sustainable
transport in Africa. The priority considerations for action were captured from
every participant and clustered into one of four thematic areas covering access and
sustainable infrastructure, road safety, transport emissions and enabling
conditions. The resulting analysis produced clearly identifiable priority areas for
action which were developed into proposed priority action areas for consideration
of the attending Ministers.

The second part of day two was devoted to discussion around the governance and
institutional aspects of the ASTF, and questions were posed to the attendees
provoking input on the institutional arrangements. These institutional
arrangements included the nature of the ASTF and its Secretariat and its
supporting institutions, frequency of high level meetings, political ownership of
ASTF and the role of regional communities. The conversation was further
informed by lessons learned from the experiences of the EST forums of Asia and
Latin America.

The emerging proposal concerning the institutional arrangements of ASTF was
agreed upon by those in attendance and brought forward along with the priority
action areas for consideration of the Ministers on day three.




                                                                                 7
                                During the High Level Opening which took place
                                on the Ministerial day (day three), keynote
                                speeches and endorsements were made by UNEP
                                Executive Director Mr. Achim Steiner, on behalf
                                of the UN and the World Bank, UN Secretary
                                General Mr. Ban Ki-moon and President Uhuru
                                Kenyatta of Kenya.

                                The opening was followed by a Ministerial Session
                                in which the Ministers were introduced to the
                                outcomes of day one and two, namely the draft
                                ASTF Action Framework – which included both
                                the priority action areas and the proposed
institutional structure for the ASTF. The Ministers deliberated over both the
substantive and organizational aspects of the Framework until broad agreement
was reached.

The resulting ASTF Action Framework is constituted from both the agreed
priority action areas and the ASTF institutional structure. The agreed action areas
set out a clear direction for Africa in terms of priority actions to achieving
sustainable transport. These actions are harmonized to capture the wide-reaching
perspectives of the Forum participants and offer direction and focus to both
ongoing and new initiatives aimed at enhancing transport and mobility across the
continent. The Actions address areas with the most urgent need for intervention
and ensure cross-cutting principles of inclusivity, gender empowerment and
participation are entrenched within the associated activities. The ASTF
institutional structure outlines the institutional home, secretariat arrangements,
political ownership and agenda for the year ahead until the ASTF meets again.
These institutional arrangements were agreed as the interim solution to take the
Forum and its activities forward to the 2nd Ministerial and Experts Conference
(proposed 2015), when a more permanent institutional arrangement may be
decided upon.

The agreed ASTF Action Framework is included in Section 3.

2.2.     The Realities of Transport in Africa: Challenges and Solutions

Population growth, growth of national income, and urbanization and
motorization rates in African countries are among the highest in the world. The
transportation sector is unable to provide affordable, accessible and clean




8
transport and meet the growing demand for access. Investment in sustainable
transport infrastructure and modes of transport is lacking far behind what is
required.

                                                In Africa, accessing finance for
                                                transport      projects    has    been
                                                challenging, due in part to a lack of
                                                supporting sustainable transport
                                                policies, institutional challenges and
                                                political buy in. The Region faces
                                                numerous challenges in the provision
                                                of basic transport services and
                                                ensuring connectivity - both within
                                                the continent and from the continent
to the rest of the world. Despite its low levels of motorization, most urban areas in
Africa are encountering a multitude of transport issues beyond connectivity,
including poor safety and environmental performance, an exclusion of vulnerable
populations and inefficient public transport systems.

High-level policy focus in Africa, as reflected in the traditional pipeline of
transport projects, remains centered on improvements to connectivity through
heavy infrastructure investment – improved and upgraded trunk roads, new rural
roads, improved logistics from ports to inland markets, and infrastructure
investments in and around cities. The attention of policy makers on heavy
infrastructure development has fostered policies in which sustainability –
environmental, social, and economic issues– have not been fully integrated into
the development agenda.

Issues of urban transport and mobility are particularly pertinent to Africa. It is
vital that African cities plan to meet the demands of rapidly growing cities in
sustainable ways, and avoid becoming ‘locked-in’ to an unsustainable pattern such
as increasing reliance on private cars and informal public transit, as is the
trajectory which many African cities are currently experiencing . The share of
Africa’s urban areas in relation to the average population growth is expected to
more than double between 2000 and 2030. Some African cities experience a
doubling of their vehicle fleets every seven years. The role of environmental, social,
and economic sustainability, and the need for low-carbon and resilient solutions
as part of creating and maintaining connectivity, needs to be better understood at
all levels of the policy making and implementation process in Africa. Intervention
now is critical, while opportunities still exist to effectively introduce infrastructural




                                                                                       9
solutions to steer cities in a more sustainable direction, while aiding a reduction in
inequalities, poverty and the wider social and economic consequences of business
as usual.

During day one of the ASTF Conference, the focus was on determining a baseline
of issues and conditions that were broadly applicable across the African continent
concerning transport. To facilitate this, six different perspectives of the transport
reality in Africa were heard and deliberated upon by the participants.

Setting the scene, Mr. Nduva Muli, Principal Secretary, Ministry of Transport and
Infrastructure, Government of Kenya in his welcome address, described the
potential of the ASTF to foster collaboration and cooperation in advancing
sustainable transport in Africa. Mr. Roger Gorham of the World Bank followed
with a background to and brief history of the development of ASTF, emphasizing
the important aspect of African ownership over the initiative and the potential role
of the Forum in influencing the pipeline of sustainable transport infrastructure
projects.

Nairobi City County Governor: Dr. Evans Kidero

Nairobi City County Governor Dr. Evans Kidero described the reality of urban
transport in Nairobi, Kenya, against a context of rapidly increasing urban
populations. Governor Kidero discussed the particular dangers faced by
pedestrians in his city, and the fact that these problems persist despite the fact that
just 9% of the population are car owners and over 45% rely on travelling by foot to
make their daily trips.

Governor Kidero also mentioned that, in order to sufficiently address urban
transport, Nairobi is planning to create a Metropolitan Transportation Authority
to manage traffic, integrate routes, and organize public transport.

Science Editor – World Health Organization: Ms. Elaine Fletcher

The World Health Organisation (WHO) released a report in March 2014 which
revealed new data relating to the numbers of deaths attributable to outdoor air
pollution. WHO estimates 176,000 deaths annually from outdoor air pollution in
Africa and 3.7 million deaths globally – making outdoor air pollution now the
world’s largest single environmental health risks, fast becoming one of the leading
causes of illness and death in developing countries.

                                                  This new light on the seriousness
                                                  of air pollution to public health
                                                  calls for a concerted action to
                                                  clean the air that we breathe, and
                                                  push for initiatives to adopt fuels
                                                  that are less polluting, ensure
                                                  better fuel economy and reduced
                                                  dependency on private vehicles as
                                                  a means of travel.

Ms. Fletcher, of the WHO emphasized in her presentation that social well-being is
a pillar of sustainable development and as such, should be central to the activities
of ASTF. She went on to highlight the serious risks to society from unsustainable
transport. From the perspective of risk, Ms. Fletcher sited 7 million people a year
are affected by air pollution (including indoor) and the increasing problem of road
deaths. Particulate matter and fine particulates have been recognized as the most
dangerous pollutant as they directly lead to high incidences of heart disease, stroke
and other cardio-vascular diseases. Particulate matter is a problem particularly
associated with diesel vehicles. Diesel emissions are also known to be carcinogenic.
Ms. Fletcher also referred to the growing problem of physical inactivity, obesity
and diabetes as consequences of a lack of attractive non-motorized transport
infrastructure.

WHO has been implementing air quality monitoring and setting air quality
guidelines in several countries. They have had success in Europe but more needs to
be undertaken in other global regions.

Pamoja road Safety: Mr. Lucas MuneneGachuru

Africa has just 2% of the world’s vehicle population but is home to 16% of the
world’s road deaths, making it the highest number of road deaths per capita in the




                                                                                  11
world. 38% of those road deaths occur among pedestrians and cyclists. The cost of
a rapidly rising trend in road deaths in Africa has massive impacts to societies and
economies, and according to the WHO (2013), traffic accidents is the biggest killer
in Africa after malaria and HIV/AIDS.

Mr. Lucas Munene Gachuru of Pamoja Road Safety highlighted three major areas
that are central to road safety, namely (i) problems of traffic-pedestrian conflict
and driver culture/behaviour (ii)incoherent institutions working on this issue, and
(iii) an insurance system which is unable to provide adequate and timely support
for victims of road accidents, including a lack of hospital facilities and social
support.

Kampala Capital City Authority: Mr. Jacob Byamukama

                                               An integrated approach to transport
                                               and mobility planning, ensuring
                                               complementary land use and modal

                                               to successfully overcoming the
                                               multi-faceted challenges facing
                                               rapidly growing African cities. Mr.
                                               Jacob Byamukama of Kampala

                       Harrison-Prentice       Capital City Authority gave a
                                               perspective from his experience in
terms of trying to manage a myriad of challenges central to transport in the
Kampala context. He spoke of a situation where currently 60% of trips are
dependent on travelling by foot or by bicycle and the rapidly increasing presence
of motorcycles taxis which accounts for the second largest public transport service.
Consequently motorcycle accidents are among the highest in the city. The
situation is further challenged by a practice of parking on streets and a flow of
heavy goods vehicles traversing the city every day. Mr. Byamukama’s presentation
led to a dialogue around the role of Government in leading a process of integrating
all transport operators with input and echoed experiences from the floor.

The African Association of Public Transport (UATP): Mr. Zoro Bi Nagone

The African Association of Public Transport (UATP) represented by Mr. Zoro
Bi Nagone highlighted four challenges to make the transport sector more
sustainable. Mr. Zoro Bi Nagone listed (i) managing problems associated with




12
urbanization (ii) governance and the need for a long term strategic vision (iii) a
lack of NMT facilities and poor quality roads and (iv) understanding of transport
markets and related structures.

Many countries responded to this with examples provided from Tunisia, South-
Africa and Nigeria. BRT was highlighted as a practical solution to transport
problems in African cities and the conversation closed with a discussion around a
potential responsibility of the ASTF Secretariat to provide a platform for exchange
of experience.

2.3.      Transport in Africa: Vulnerable Groups and Gender

                                                      Transport and mobility is not just
                                                      about        developing       transport
                                                      infrastructure and services, but about
                                                      overcoming the social, economic,

                                                      movement, such as class, gender
                                                      relations, poverty, physical disabilities
                                                      and affordability.

for a people focused planning approach to sustainable transport solutions. She
stressed the importance of solutions that are based on the needs of all of society,
where the vulnerable in our communities (e.g. women, youth, elderly, disabled
and the poor) are catered for. Ms. Ngabirano stated that there seems to be a focus
on ‘maintaining’ cities and not adopting forward thinking solutions based on a
holistic vision of future city potential. Her presentation drew on the issues of social
injustice, and the lack of participatory approaches for all citizens to have their
voice heard in regard to decisions which affect them. Ms Ngabirano linked
deprived human development to issues of access, safety and equality, and
concluded with asking the question of what kind of city do we want, an inclusive
city or an unjust city.

Remarks from the floor included the issue of land management, and the barriers
to achieving sustainable transport posed by issues of land ownership etc.

Mobility Solutions for Green Growth (Panel Discussion)

In this session, chaired by Prof. Winnie
Mitullah of the University of Nairobi,
sustainable transport solutions with a focus
on mobility/accessibility were discussed. Mr.

high number of road accidents. He
reminded participants that there is an African Plan of Action for Road Safety
adopted by Ministries of Transport in the continent. Issues on institutional
responsibility were raised and the need to have a dedicated focal point or separate
coordinating institution was discussed.

                                           Ms. Daisy Dwango of the Johannesburg
                                           Transport Department mentioned that the
                                           Department currently has a policy which
                                           focuses on safely accommodating pedestrians
                                           as a priority, followed by cyclists and finally
                                           public transport. She discussed the Rea Vaya
                                           BRT experience and the processes of

  Green Growth’ Ms. Daisy Dwango
                                           operators into the new system. Ms. Dwango
shared the lessons learned in terms of how the approach to the project could have
been improved with regards to integrating the new system with other feeder
modes. In terms of financial profitability, Ms. Dwango, mentioned that the Phase
1 of Rea Vaya BRT was subsidized. The Department are currently looking at
integrating land use to increase revenue and reduce subsidies for increased
sustainability.
Mr. Taiwo Olukayode of the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority
(LAMATA) described the experience of Nigeria in implementing a BRT system in
Lagos. The system has dedicated lanes but does not include all elements of BRT
systems that have been implemented elsewhere like the Transmilenio in Bogota,
Colombia, or the Rea Vaya in Johannesburg; to distinguish, this is referred to as a




14
‘BRT Lite’ system. Before implementation, a BRT law was put in place to pave the
way for the implementation of the system. A political champion (the Governor)
was identified as critical to see through the implementation of the BRT. Important
elements to success included the broad negotiations which were required to ensure
that existing public transport operators were integrated into the new system, a
proper financial model was developed and good integration was planned with the
various feeder services. In the case of Lagos, the BRT has presented the
opportunity to integrate land-use and public transport, including the creation of
more space for pedestrians.

Mr. Patrick Kayemba of the First African Bicycle Information Organization
(FABIO), an NMT advocacy NGO based in Uganda highlighted Uganda’s existing
NMT policy which requires all new roads to include NMT facilities in the design.
Mr. Kayemba described the progress that has been made in the last two decades in
Uganda, in terms of mainstreaming the concept of NMT as a valuable and vital
component of transport planning among policy makers. Similarly he described the
commitment required on behalf of civil society organizations and advocates to
keep pushing the issues from a grass-roots level and to be persistent in demanding
needs based transport solutions. Currently in Uganda a follow-up study on multi-
modal transport modes is being conducted. Mr. Kayemba emphasized the role of
civil society as a central player in ensuring that NMT policies are developed,
adopted and implemented.

Following a question from the Moderator, it was determined that Senegal,
Ethiopia, Botswana, Rwanda, Cote d’Ivoire, and Kenya are countries which have
existing initiatives to promote and adopt NMT and/or BRT policies.

Solutions for Reducing Emissions and energy Consumption (Panel Discussion)

Mr. Patrick Mwesigye of UNEP and Mr. Alioune Badiane of UN-Habitat, co-
chaired this session which focused on transport related emissions. Examples of
solutions for reducing transport emissions and improving energy efficiency in
vehicles were presented for discussion. Mr. Badiane mentioned lateral/horizontal
and vertical mobility as enablers to high rates of urbanization (vertical mobility =
elevators and lateral/horizontal = cars and urban transport). Mr. Badiane also
emphasized the pressing need to address emissions from urban transport.
Mr. Frederick Nyang of the Kenya Regulatory Commission described their project
to improve vehicle fuel efficiency through the Global Fuel Economy Initiative. In
Kenya, the number of vehicles has increased three fold compared to last year and if




                                                                                 15
the current trend is to continue, the total number of vehicles is set to increase to 6
million by 2030. At present, about 85% of all these vehicles are imported from
Japan. Existing government regulations require all imported vehicles to be eight
  years old or younger. Importation policies from other countries were discussed
 including the possibility of having a regional harmonized importation policy for
 Africa. Mr. Samir ElMowafi of the Egyptian Ministry of Environment described
                                                                the situation in his

highlighted the achievements of the Partnership for Cleaner Fuels and Vehicles
(PCFV) particularly in removing lead in gasoline/petrol in Africa. The PCFV is
now focused on phasing down sulphur in fuels, particularly diesel and in assisting
countries to develop equivalent vehicle emission standards. Mauritius mentioned
their vehicle excise act which promotes energy efficient vehicles taking into
consideration CO2 emissions of vehicles.

Other issues discussed and raised included the role of biofuels, management of
lead in batteries, use of MMT, addressing maritime transport as an energy efficient
mode of transport.

In closing, Mr. Debashish Bhattacharjee of UN-Habitat provided a brief summary
of the issues discussed during day one. Having listened to the issues and solutions
on transport in Africa, he asked what is holding Africa back in implementing more
sustainable transport policies. Is it the policy framework, time to make decisions,
financing? Mr. Bhattacharjee expressed the view that the ASTF may be the right




16
instrument available to Africa to help address these issues and implement
sustainable transport policies.

2.5.     ASTF Framework for Action – Priority Action Areas and Institutional
         Arrangements

An essential objective for the ASTF’s first conference was to formulate a solid
road-map for action on transport issues across Africa, and to determine what
African States want and need from the ASTF Secretariat in a consolidated way. The
Conference achieved this objective by deliberating with participants to identify
their priority areas for action concerning sustainable transport, and in reaching
agreement on what the essential components and tasks of the ASTF and the newly
formed ASTF Secretariat should be. Both of these aspects were discussed during
the course of day two, before being presented as a proposal to the attending
Ministers on day three.

ASTF – Break Out Sessions – Identification of Priority Action Areas

The Breakout Sessions of day two were a critical part of the process of determining
the focus areas and priority actions on a continent wide level for ASTF. This was a
vital input to establishing a harmonized Africa-wide vision for sustainable
transport.

Having considered the various aspects of sustainable transport in Africa including
technical, policy and societal considerations - each participant was asked to note a
small number of priority actions for sustainable transport in their own words.
Participants were encouraged to be aspirational and to think holistically about all
of the issues discussed on day one, and define what is needed to achieve
sustainable transport from their own point of view. The gathered actions were
discussed and debated broadly, before being categorized within the Breakout
Sessions into four Action Areas. This process made it clear which actions were
priorities according to the sentiment of the group.

The four action areas within which the various actions were clustered consisted of
the following:

    Enabling Conditions – The ‘pre-conditions’ required to ensure
     sustainability of transport initiatives. Enabling Conditions include issues
     such as political commitment, funding, capacities, institutional landscape
     etc.




                                                                                 17
      Road Safety – Actions with a road safety focus and interventions at the level
       of policy, road design, infrastructure, licensing, post-accident care, law
       enforcement and traffic calming.
      Accessibility and Sustainable Infrastructure – Actions with a focus on the
       planning and infrastructural aspects of sustainable transport, including
       non-motorized transport, public transport, integrated transport planning
       and travel demand management.
      Emissions – Actions with a focus on reducing the health and climate change
       impact of transport by reducing vehicle emissions, introducing clean fuel
       and clean vehicle technologies, and improving fuel economy and reducing
       CO2 emissions.
The ASTF team captured the individual actions and identified Priority Action
Areas from each of the four Break-Out sessions. The team then compiled a table of
actions to present to the attending Ministers on day three for their views and
inputs.

Cross Cutting Issues – Action Areas

The social, economic, political and physical barriers to movement, such as class,
gender relations, poverty, physical disabilities and affordability received much
attention during the substantive discussions of the Forum, and as such were
identified as cross cutting and applicable to the sustainability of all actions.

Inclusivity

The failings of transport initiatives to fully accommodate and service particular
groups namely those burdened with poverty, those marginalized to the periphery
of cities, the disabled, elderly and children received significant attention. The
potential of ‘access’ to lift struggling communities out of poverty and/or towards
improved lifestyle opportunities cannot be under estimated. Inclusivity and
accessibility are critical and issues of particular relevance to transport in Africa,
and should be positioned at the center of sustainable transport initiatives.

Gender

Women and girls not only rely on transport to a different extent than men and
boys, they also face particular and often targeted risks when transiting. Safety and
security in public transport and when commuting on foot are issues that
disproportionately affect women and girls. Safety and security barriers to transport




18
have an impact on educational possibilities and access to employment, health care
and social networks.

Participation

Formal decision making determines the extent of programmes and investment in
mobility. The representation of all groups in decision making processes is essential
to allocating resources amidst competing interests. Effective public participation
enables vulnerable persons to be aware of, and to participate in decisions which
affect them. Ensuring the inclusion of traditionally excluded groups in decision
making is critical to determining that limited public resources are directed on the
basis of local needs. Creating a space for this type of inclusion requires
mechanisms to be in place through which all stakeholders can be reached, and at
the right time in the process.

Barriers and Challenges

                                             During the course of the Conference

                                             African countries. In terms of what
is preventing progress, the following factors were raised and agreed on through
various opportunities during the conference discussions.

       Lack of information on best practice
       Need of political and top level awareness and backing
       Need for capacity building and support (technology, financial, knowledge)
       Institutional complexities
       Lack of room for participation of non-governmental organizations
       Poor facilitation of public-private partnerships

These factors were captured in the process of clustering priority action areas, and
where agreed, were included in the section of the Action Framework categorized as
‘Supporting Activities’ or the enabling conditions to achieving the identified
priority actions. Factors relative to knowledge sharing, political championing and




                                                                                 19
access to best practice, were identified as areas in which the ASTF Secretariat could
support the Forum through various targeted activities.

ASTF – Institutional Arrangements

To assist the consensus on what the essential components and tasks of the newly
formed ASTF Secretariat should be and the institutional shape of the ASTF
initiative, presentations were given to share with participants the experience of the
Asian Environmentally Sustainable Transport (EST) Forum, and the global
context of organized action on sustainable transport.
                                                         Ms. Chikako Takase of the United

                                                         initiative. Ms. Chikako highlighted
                                                         that Asian cities face similar

policies and promote lessons learned and exchange of knowledge/ideas. Ms.
Takase mentioned it has taken five years for a solid policy framework to be
developed relating to sustainable transport for Asian cities. Through EST Asia,
each country is encouraged to develop a national EST strategy. Currently in Asia
44 cities are already signatories to the Kyoto declaration on cities. The Japanese
Environment Ministry supports the Asian EST forum with funding.

Bringing the broad objectives of initiatives like EST Asia and the ASTF to a global
context, Mr. Cornie Huizenga of the Partnership on Sustainable Low-Carbon
Transport (SLoCaT) discussed what is happening worldwide to achieve more
sustainable transportation models. Mr. Huizenga stressed that better
connectivity/access for sustainable transport needs to be created through the
‘avoid, shift and improve’ model. He mentioned that a ‘Results Framework’ has
been created to quantify in a real way what needs to be achieved by 2030 in the
transport sector. Mr. Huizenga mentioned three clear targets associated with (1)
rural transport; (2) urban transport; and (3) national and regional connectivity
have been identified, and so have associated commitments required for ensuring




20
that sustainable transport becomes a reality.

International efforts geared towards development of the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) - including identification of funding mechanisms - at the global
level need to incorporate sustainable transport. Seven out of the 17 SDGs have a
transport component and this is an important tool to promote sustainable
transport and ensure that priority actions are supported.

commitments were made. The specific Action Area of ‘Transport’ focused on
efforts to reduce emissions and steer towards cleaner technologies, while also
scaling up public transport.

Against this information on similar region-wide sustainable transport initiatives
and the global context, Mr. Jean-Noel Guillossou of the World Bank introduced a
discussion relating to the institutional arrangements for the ASTF and the ASTF
Secretariat. Mr. Guilloussou prompted this discussion with a number of key
questions to the participants relating to the various components required to
ensure the ASTF Secretariat is able to meet the needs and expectations of African
countries. Questions related to the below key points:

  Governance (structure, roles etc.)
  Partners (Country partners, Strategic partners etc)
  Advisory group
  African institutionalization (link with Conferences of African Ministers of
   Transport and Environment Discussion)
  Frequency of conference (annual, biennial with regional conferences in
   between)




                                                                                                   21
  Location of conference
  Structure of conference (experts’ days, ministerial session)
  Location of secretariat
  Activities (monitoring, capacity building, knowledge sharing, not
   implementation)
  FundingThe concluding decisions agreed upon during the discussion which
   followed Mr. Guillossou’s presentation, included agreement that the
   institutional arrangements for the Secretariat of the ASTF will remain as
   interim until such a time as the Forum meets again. There was also consensus
   that the political ownership of the ASTF should ideally lie with the African
   Union and that Kenya, as the hosting country of the ASTF would lead the
   dialogue with the African Union Commission - and cooperate with the
   Secretariat and supporting institutions going forward. It was decided that the
   supporting institutions to the ASTF should continue to include those who
   supported the 1st Conference i.e. the World Bank and UN Agencies. Other
   institutions would be welcomed who were interested in supporting the Action
   Framework and Forum goals. Africa’s Regional Economic Communities were
   identified as key partners for further consultation and it was requested that
   the 2nd meeting of the Forum should be held towards the end of 2015.

2.6.    Ministerial Session

Day three, the ASTF Ministerial
Session, was opened with keynote
speeches from Hon. Eng. Michael
Kamau, Cabinet Secretary, Ministry
of Transport and Infrastructure –
Government of Kenya, UN Secretary
General Mr. Ban Ki-moon, His
Excellency Uhuru Kenyatta, President
of Kenya, and UNEP Executive
Director Mr. Achim Steiner (speaking
on behalf of UNEP, the World Bank
and UN-Habitat), all emphasizing the
importance of sustainable transport
to Africa.

Alice Kaudia, Environment Secretary from the Kenyan Ministry of Environment,
Water and Natural Resources, was invited to give a presentation to the Ministers,
summarizing the first two days of the Conference, and outlining both priority
action areas and proposed institutional arrangements for the ASTF. A questions
and answers session was held with a panel of experts to facilitate the ‘report back’
process to Ministers. This session included the moderators of the smaller group
sessions from day two: Bright Oywaya (ASIRT Kenya), Stefan Atchia (AfDB) and
Samson Gyamera (Ghana Minsitry Local Government and Rural Development),
who outlined the primary points as agreed during day one and two.

The subsequent dialogue included input from Tunisia, Ethiopia, Congo, Uganda,
Ghana, Lesotho, Botswana, Cameroon, Senegal, Tanzania, Malawi, Burkina Faso,
Comoros and Egypt. Questions and dialogue covered issues of inclusion and
representation of all African countries, the role of regional communities in
facilitating coordination, capacity building, benchmarking, financing and
implementation. The issues of air pollution, public health and road safety were
also raised as points of particular importance for discussion.

The Ministers, in discussing the report back from day one and two, asked the
Secretariat to develop specific actions and targets for consideration by the
Ministers during the session on the Action Framework in the afternoon.

The second panel discussion of the morning was on the subject of mobilizing
investment for sustainable transport. Panel members included Stephen Mogore
(JICA), Paolo Ciccarelli (European Commission) and Thierry Jacquin De
Margerie (Alstom International). The session was moderated by Jose Luis
Irigoyen, Director of Transport and ICT, World Bank. The panel discussion
highlighted issues of the complexities of security, trade, human rights and
environmental factors that influence funding as a means to addressing issues of
development including transport. Key questions which led the discussion and also
incorporated questions and comments from the floor included the following:

       What is needed right now to guide and support financing of
     transportation projects in Africa?
     How can we remove the ‘stop and go’ challenges to financing?
     What would it take to scale up investment in ‘new areas’ that have been
     highlighted during ASTF?
     How can we remove co-financing challenges?
     What is the role of the private sector?
     How to ensure that the right projects are funded?




                                                                                 23
        How can governments streamline financing?
        Are transport projects currently of any benefit of the poor?

Along with these questions, the use of public-private partnerships received
much attention, as did the enabling conditions for ‘bankable’ (economically
viable, environmentally and socially sound) transport projects – particularly at a
political level.

In the afternoon of day three Dr. Joan Clos, Executive Director of UN-Habitat,
presented the importance of proper urban planning, and spoke of the changing
vision of urbanization and the potential that lies within for generation of wealth
and economic growth within Africa.

The Ministerial session also discussed the draft ASTF Action Framework,
including the 13 points of action contained within. The ASTF Action Framework
was discussed and finally adopted with some requested changes. The proposed
interim institutional framework was also approved by the Ministers. The resulting
outcome in the form of the final ASTF Action Framework is detailed below.

The ASTF 1st Ministerial and Experts Conference concluded with consensus from
the Ministerial Session on both the priority action areas and the institutional
arrangements.

Next steps identified on the basis of feedback from the Conference proceedings
include the following.

Implementation

Identify organizations that are willing to work with African countries and their
partners to support the implementation of the ASTF Action Framework.

Baselines

Develop a consolidated baseline of the current status of African countries in
relation to the Priority Action Areas. This will serve as a benchmarking tool against
which to assess progress and also as an indicator of where some countries may
benefit from knowledge-sharing/partnerships from others.

Capacity Building / Knowledge Sharing

Development of a platform to serve as a knowledge sharing interface where lessons
learned, experiences, solutions and technical information can be pooled and made
available to African countries. Develop mechanisms for capacity building on the
basis of the needs of countries and regions in implementing the Priority Action
Areas of ASTF.

Partnerships

Form partnerships with the African Economic Communities, the African Union
and other strategic partners who are already active and/or willing to contribute to
supporting initiatives around sustainable transport in Africa.

Annex C. Transport Week Activities

During the week of 27 – 31 December 2014 several events were organized to
coincide with the ASTF 1st Ministerial and Experts Conference. These events
linked to the various aspects of sustainable transport which arose within the
Agenda of the Conference, and offered participants networking, learning,
training and marketing opportunities.


Conversation Series

The ASTF ‘Conversation Series’ seeks to provide a discussion platform conducive
to understanding and advancing the current narrative around transport and
linked issues such as poverty eradication, environmental safeguarding,
equitable access for all and the full transformative potential of sustainable
transport for people, places, our environment and our economy.
The ASTF Conversation took place on the 30th October coinciding with day
three of the ASTF 1st Ministerial and Experts Conference.

Understanding the complex existing and emerging relationships which impact
on the potential to achieve sustainable transport systems in Africa, requires
consolidating existing available information, identifying data gaps and the
facilitation of knowledge sharing. A practice of data availability and open and
inclusive dialogue surrounding these issues can catalyze partnership,
participation and research, ultimately supporting informed policy making.

The ASTF Conversation Series was designed to be an exchange where themes
of particular importance and growing relevance to transport and mobility in
Africa can be discussed. The associated ill health, congestion and loss of
productive time tends to disproportionately affect those who are most
vulnerable in communities and who are typically the least likely to be included
in the decision making processes which affect them. Against this background,
the ASTF Conversation Series seeks to provide a discussion platform conducive
to understanding and advancing the current narrative around transport and
linked issues such as poverty eradication, job creation, green economic growth
and equitable access for all. The three different sessions included in the
Conversation Series examined the transformative potential of sustainable
transport for people, places, our environment and our economy.

  Each session had an audience of between 30 – 34 participants including a
  moderator and several identified ‘resource people’. The sessions were
  conducted with a view to facilitating inclusive and dynamic conversation,
  allowing for targeted input from experts to inform on the latest available
  information and thinking on the particular issues under discussion. A diverse
  array of perspectives and contributions were offered from academic, private
  sector, NGO, Government, international organization and civil society
  participants.

  Outcome

  The expert opinions, knowledge and questions gathered by the ASTF
  Conversation Series will serve to inform projects, partnerships and new
  research around transport in Africa. Going forward the Series will also act as an
  enabling platform for on-going exchange of knowledge and information
  thereby serving to inform decision making at all levels.

  The main points and discussion will be captured in Issue Papers and made
  available from http://www.unep.org/Transport/astf/ once drafted. The
  ‘conversation’ will be kept live and inclusive of new opinions and topics via the
  ASTF website.

The Solution Expo provides a platform for all participant organizations to
showcase innovative sustainable transport solutions in Africa and beyond and
to promote collaborative dialogue. Ultimately the aim is to strengthen and
form effective, innovative and concrete partnerships in the implementation of
the ASTF Action Plan.




 From 28 – 31 October 2014, the ASTF Conference hosted the ASTF Solutions
 Expo; showcasing some of the most successful, exciting and innovative
 sustainable transport solutions within the African continent and beyond. In
 particular the Solutions Expo supported two of the key aims of the 1st ASTF
 Conference; sharing best practice and developing partnerships.

 The Expo demonstrated sustainable transport solutions which currently exist
 and ideas/innovations to support a move towards green economic growth
 applicable to Africa. Serving as a platform to showcase solutions, the Expo also

UNEP – Share the Road Training

‘Share the Road’ is a UNEP initiative, developed with and supported by the FIA
Foundation. It brings together the environment and safety agendas in the
context of urban transport in the developing world where the majority of
people – those moving by foot or bicycle – are disadvantaged on the road. The
overall goal is to catalyze policies in government and donor agencies for
systematic investments in walking and cycling road infrastructure, linked with
public transport systems.
Around the world, investment patterns in road infrastructure continue to favor
the car. Despite the high societal costs, increasing the road space for cars
continues to be a priority for investors and governments. In regions like Africa,




                                                                                        51
the first region of focus for Share the Road, where only a small fraction of the
population own or have access to a car, the development of road infrastructure
neglects the needs of the majority of road users – pedestrians and cyclists.
(Read our 2-page article “High Time to Change Road Investment Patterns in
Africa” in Urban World, UN-Habitat’s quarterly magazine.)
Investing in road infrastructure for walking and cycling leads to massive
benefits in environment, safety and accessibility. It reduces emissions of air
pollutants and greenhouse gases, protects vulnerable road users and income
earning adults from high-speed motor traffic, and increases affordable access
to vital services and employment.

                                                    academia etc. Overall, 13
                                                    countries participated in
the training including Ghana, Tanzania, Mauritius, Ethiopia, Mozambique,
Burundi, Malawi, Cote d’Ivoire, Uganda, Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya. The
training was conducted by UNEP in collaboration with resource persons from
the University of Twente, with the aim of building capacity of participants on
planning and development of NMT policy and infrastructure. The Ugandan
Deputy Minister of State in the Ministry of Water and Environment graced the
occasion, and presented certificates to participants at the end of the training.
The participants were supported to understand multi-disciplinary and
innovative approaches surrounding NMT and its implementation; relate
methods, techniques and approaches for policy planning and analysis; and
gauge perspectives on equity, environment, gender and sustainability. The
recently developed Courseware on NMT Situational Analysis was utilized during
the training.
