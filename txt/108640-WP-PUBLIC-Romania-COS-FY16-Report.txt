I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Romania perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Romania
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Romania
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From May to June 2016, 454 stakeholders of the WBG in Romania were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies; Project
Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 105 stakeholders participated in
the survey (23% response rate).

Respondents received and completed the questionnaire online on an independent survey
platform. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Romania; their overall attitudes
toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and
activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Romania; and the WBG’s
communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate is 42%, N=81). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of
the FY’16 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, and E. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix D (page 94).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister and
       office of a minister were combined, respondents from PMUs/consultants/contractors
       working on WBG supported projects/programs were combined with employees of
       ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies; respondents from the
       financial sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector
       organizations. Few respondents from the office of a parliamentarian, local governments,
       bilateral/multilateral agencies, media, the judiciary branch, and other organizations were
       included in the “Other” category. There were no respondents from private foundations,
       trade unions, faith-based groups, or youth groups.

Geographic Locations
     Note: Because of the small number of respondents from the urban area, other than
      Bucharest and the rural area, analyses comparing geographic locations would not be
      statistically reliable and, therefore, were not conducted.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey were significantly less
        familiar with the WBG than respondents in the previous FY’13 Survey (weighted mean
        in FY’16 = 7.1; weighted mean in FY’13 = 7.6)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Romania, and the extent to which
        the WBG plays a relevant role in development in Romania, and significantly, moderately
        correlated with the extent to which the WBG contributes to the country’s development
        results.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Romania, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty nine specific
areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Romania. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at public sector governance/reform; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Romania, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at rural development;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability.

Appendix D: Responses to Selected Questions by Year18
All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number of respondents
indicated will be slightly different from the aggregated responses in Appendix A. Similarly, responses from FY 2013
respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2013 COS report.

FY 2013 Number of comparable respondents = 75  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 92

By weighting, the FY 2013 data have the same stakeholder composition as they are in FY 2016.
Therefore, the two years are comparable. Respondents from the office of parliamentarian, local
governments, bilateral/multilateral agencies, private foundations, media, trade unions, faith based
groups, youth groups, and other organizations were not included in the year comparison analysis,
because respondents from these groups were not present in both years. The weighted stakeholder
breakdown is presented below:
