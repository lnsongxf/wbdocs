1 – MAIN CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    1.1 – Background
At the request of the GEF Council, the Evaluation Office conducts country portfolio evaluations (CPEs)
every year. CPEs aim to provide the GEF Council and the national governments with an assessment of
results and performance of GEF-supported activities at the country level, and of how GEF-supported
activities fit into the national strategies and priorities as well as within the global environmental
mandate of the GEF. In 2012, the Vanuatu national project portfolio and the SPREP-executed regional
project portfolio were selected for evaluation.

In Vanuatu, the GEF has supported a portfolio totalling US$17.9 million with US$70.0 million in co-
financing for 13 national projects. As shown in Table 1.1, these include five climate change (CC)
projects, five biodiversity (BD) projects, one in land degradation (LD), one in persistent organic
pollutants (POPs), and one multifocal area (MF) project. These 13 national projects have been
implemented solely in Vanuatu. Nine projects have been completed, one is ongoing, and three are in
the pipeline. Eight of the 13 projects are enabling activities (EAs). The projects have been implemented
by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), and the World Bank.

Since 1991, the Secretariat for the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) has been involved
as regional executing agency through various GEF Agencies (UNDP, World Bank, UNEP and the Food
and Agriculture Organization) in 11 projects totalling over US$63.1 million in GEF financing or US$204.4
million with co-financing.1 Regional projects include multiple countries throughout the Pacific region;
all but one SPREP-executed project included Vanuatu.2 As shown in the top half of Table 1.2, these
include six climate change projects, three biodiversity projects, one international waters project, and
one persistent organic pollutants (POPs) project. Eight of the 11 SPREP regional projects are full-sized
projects (FSPs), one is a medium-sized project (MSP), and two are EAs. Seven out of the 21 SPREP-
member Small Island Developing States (SIDS) –Cook Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, Micronesia, Marshall
Islands, Samoa and Tuvalu – are involved in at least nine SPREP-executed GEF projects.

As shown in the bottom half of Table 1.2, GEF has also committed US$119.6 million for other regional
projects in which Vanuatu participates, but which are not executed by SPREP. All of these projects are
FSPs, and the majority of the funding has gone to projects in the multifocal area, notably the project
‘Implementation of Global and Regional Oceanic Fisheries Conventions and Related Instruments in the
Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS)’ (GEF ID 4746), which received US$45.6 million. Most of
these projects are in the pipeline or ongoing.

      1.2 – Objectives, Scope and Methodology
As noted in the Terms of Reference (TOR): ‘The purpose of the Vanuatu and SPREP Portfolio Evaluation
is to provide the GEF Council with an assessment of how GEF is implemented in Vanuatu and more
broadly in the Pacific region, report on results from projects and assess how these projects are linked
to national and regional environmental and sustainable development agendas as well as to the GEF
mandate of generating global environmental benefits within its focal areas.’3 The evaluation assesses
the relevance, effectiveness, sustainability, and efficiency of the GEF project portfolio in Vanuatu and
the South Pacific from 1991-2012. Intended audiences for the evaluation results include the GEF
Council, SPREP countries, GEF Agencies, and partners.

The evaluation was conducted between October 2012 and August 2013 by an evaluation team
comprised of staff from the GEF Evaluation Office and consultants with extensive knowledge of
environmental program evaluation, the environmental sector in Vanuatu, and SPREP. The
methodology employed several qualitative and quantitative methods, including: (i) interviews
conducted with 40 people from 12 institutions; (ii) quantitative analysis examining the efficiency of GEF
support using standard metrics (e.g., the time and cost of preparing and implementing projects); (iii)
use of standardized analytic tools and project review protocols adapted to the Pacific context; and (iv)
development of Review of Outcomes to Impact (ROtI) field studies for two completed projects: Pacific
Islands Renewable Energy Programme (GEF ID 1058) and Local Conservation Initiatives (GEF ID 1682).
The evaluators triangulated across qualitative and qualitative data sources to confirm findings and
strengthen confidence in the results.

   1.3 – Conclusions
          1.3.1 – Results, Effectiveness and Sustainability
Conclusion 1: The GEF helped pave the way for the development of national plans, establishment
of environmental agencies, and establishment of relevant environmental legislative frameworks in
Vanuatu and SPREP countries in all focal areas through enabling activities.

In Vanuatu, GEF support has focused primarily on EAs to develop national sectoral plans for climate
change, POPs, land degradation, biodiversity and capacity building self-assessments, and
establishment or strengthening of legislative frameworks and environmental institutions. EAs have
played a valuable role in the portfolio by enhancing capacity and building awareness of global
environmental issues at the national level. GEF support through EAs has also facilitated
implementation of international conventions on the environment by providing a regular, if limited,
stream of support to key government agencies responsible for the conventions, and providing
technical and financial assistance to develop capacity within these ministries and enhance multi-
sectoral collaboration across government ministries, the private sector, and civil society.

EA projects generate information and build capacity for addressing environmental challenges and
fulfilling commitments to international conventions, thereby laying the groundwork for MSPs and FSPs.
Prior to GEF EAs, there was limited information on each of the GEF focal areas in Vanuatu and other
SPREP countries. Through these EAs, Vanuatu produced its National Biodiversity Strategy and Action
Plan (NBSAP), the National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA) and Climate Change Policy
Framework (CCPF), the National Implementation Plan (NIP) for Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs),
and the National Action Plan (NAP) for land degradation, which provided the baseline information and
assessment of threats at the country level, and identified the priority actions for each focal area. The
NBSAP, in turn, directly contributed to the development of the Environmental Protection and
Management Act 2006, identifying and developing multi-stakeholder consensus on priority issues, and
proposing inputs that were mainstreamed into the approved legislation.

GEF-supported EAs have built awareness of environmental issues and helped attract donor funding to
implement several of the priority actions identified in the national plans that were developed with GEF
support. EAs have also strengthened institutional capacity and multi-sectoral coordination, because all
the EAs require multi-sectoral steering committees to produce these plans, and promote inclusive
multi-stakeholder consultative processes.

At the regional level, the level of technical capacity across focal areas was also quite limited prior to
GEF support. In climate change, the need to address this limited technical capacity prompted the
Pacific Islands Climate Change Assistance Program (PICCAP) (GEF ID 336), which was executed by
SPREP to assist countries in building their capacity. The PICCAP produced national communications
plans and conducted inventories and vulnerability assessments for climate change, which became the
basis for much of the climate change work currently being implemented. The project also established
multi-sector country teams that continue to spearhead the implementation of climate change actions
at the national level as well as the effective participation of SPREP countries at international climate
change forums.

The Pacific Islands Renewable Energy Program (PIREP) (GEF ID1058), another SPREP-executed project,
compiled national renewable energy assessments that have since been widely used to develop

                                                                                                        7

national plans for renewable energy in Pacific Island Countries (PICs). The PIREP also established
national committees that have since been used to further implement the follow-up GEF project on
Pacific Islands Greenhouse Gases Abatement and Renewable Energy Program (PIGGAREP) (GEF
ID2699). Some PICs have gone on to develop and adopt renewable energy legislation and policies. For
example, Tonga’s Renewable Energy Bill 2008 was developed with the support of the PIGGAREP.4 Cook
Islands announced its Renewable Energy Chart in July 2011, acknowledging support from PIGGAREP
and GEF.5 Changes in legislation and policies in Vanuatu, Samoa, and other countries are strongly
linked to and built on the national renewable energy assessments carried out under PIREP and later
continued with PIGGAREP.

Conclusion 2: Replication and scaling up of community-based project outcomes has occurred at the
sub-national level; however, projects have faced constraints in scaling up to the national level.

GEF project outcomes have been sustained when they could be replicated at a sub-national scale (e.g.,
at the local community level) and with direct impact on individuals. This is reflected in the
establishment of community conservation areas, which are managed by traditional communities, as
generated by the South Pacific Biodiversity Conservation Project (SPBCP) (GEF ID 403), the
International Waters Project (IWP) (GEF ID 530), the Vanuatu Local Conservation Initiatives (LCI)
project (GEF ID 1682), and the GEF Small Grants Programme (SGP). The community-based conservation
approach piloted in the SPBCP is now widely adopted throughout the Pacific, in various forms and
scales. The scaled-down version is helping overcome difficulties with shared boundaries on customary-
owned lands and other land tenure issues and village capacities, while the integration of community
livelihood issues into conservation plans strengthens their relevance and appeal to local communities.

The SPBCP supported 17 conservation areas projects (CAPs) spread over 12 PICs. At least 12 are still
operating, some as part of new larger-scale initiatives, while others are maintained by local
communities at a low level of activity, with varying levels level of external funding and technical
support. In this way, initial threats to biodiversity have been reduced or eliminated. Although some
efforts have floundered due to internal village conflicts, others such as the Takitimu CAP in Cook
Islands and the Kosrae Conservation Project in the Federated Islands of Micronesia have continued to
flourish and grow – the former with strong ecotourism linkages, and the latter with increasing
partnerships and support from several international conservation organizations and funders.

However, sustaining and scaling up community activities to the national level has been limited, mostly
by the lack of continued funding and technical support from government agencies or other donors
after the end of GEF support. The projects generally did not develop financial sustainability strategies
or mechanisms to sustain efforts at the same scale beyond the GEF funding period. In addition, the
Department of Environmental Protection and Conservation’s (DEPC) acute lack of capacity (both in
terms of local budgetary resources and personnel) severely limits its ability to play an effective
technical support role. Moreover, the Conservation Area Regulation drafted in 2009 as part of the LCI
to legalize conservation areas and provide national support to traditional communities in managing
conservation areas still has not been enacted, contributing to the uncertain state of many community
conservation activities initiated under the LCI.

Conclusion 3: GEF support has been instrumental in raising environmental awareness in all focal
areas in Vanuatu and the SPREP countries.

The current level of awareness of environmental issues such as climate change, biodiversity, and
conservation in Vanuatu and SPREP countries is very high among government officials and the general
public. This is, to a large extent, a result of the considerable resources invested in producing
environmental information and the engagement of wider stakeholders in the GEF EAs. Much of the
information and several publications produced in Vanuatu projects such as LCI, NBSAP, and NAPA are
still in use. In addition, the Government of Vanuatu has incorporated biodiversity, climate change, and
waste management issues into the primary and tertiary education curriculum.

Conclusion 4: GEF paved the way for strengthening capacity at the individual, institutional and
system levels, but sustaining this capacity has been and still is problematic, in all focal areas
except climate change.

Some GEF projects produced useful capacity building results, such as the strengthening of the DEPC
during the LCI project, the establishment of multi-sectoral country teams used in the implementation
of PICCAP, the training of Conservation Area Support Officers (CASOs) and similar project officers
during SPBCP and IWP, and the preparation of NBSAP, NAP and NIP. Unfortunately, these country
teams have been dormant since the completion of the above plans, thus most of the actions identified
in these plans have not been used or mainstreamed by the relevant government agencies into their
sectoral work. The DEPC, which is supposed to coordinate these committees, does not have the
resources or staff to sustain them.

GEF projects invested heavily in building the capacity of the specific individuals involved with projects.
Unfortunately, the Government of Vanuatu has not been able to retain the individuals beyond
projects, and so the organization’s capacity reverts to zero. According to DEPC, the department is
developing a new organizational structure that aims to attract, sustain, and retain individual capacity.6

The only exception to this general trend is in climate change. The national climate change country
teams established during PICCAP continue to function effectively, despite staff transitions, due to the
mainstreaming of such committees into national frameworks. These same country teams have been
used for subsequent GEF projects such as PIREP, PIGGAREP, and PACC. The ability to retain the country
teams and continue working together at the national level proved to be effective in the sustainability
of activities, and for engaging in international forums on climate change. This underscores the need for
new projects to build on existing systems and structures, such as those established under PACC, to
maintain and leverage capacity gains from previous projects.

Conclusion 5: Institutional capacity in Vanuatu to effectively implement national-level projects is
insufficient.

National projects in Vanuatu experience more delays and extensions than SPREP projects. Whereas
regional project coordinators provide additional assistance to national coordinators in the preparation
of project reports and implementation of activities for regional projects, the regional coordinators do
not have the institutional mechanisms to provide such support for nationally-executed projects. This is
highlighted in the EAs for preparing the POPs NIP and the NAP, which have not been closed yet. The
proper records and financial acquittals have not been completed despite the project activities having

been completed for several years. According to DEPC, the department is undergoing reforms to better
deliver projects on time and within budget.7

SPREP, on the other hand now, has a strengthened technical capacity in several GEF focal areas and
has been providing much-needed backstopping to national initiatives, notably in climate change and
biodiversity. These technical support teams have been used extensively in the implementation of the
PIGGAREP (GEF ID 2699) and the Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change (PACC) (GEF ID 3101) projects,
as well as the Island Biodiversity and Invasive Species (IBIS) project (GEF ID 3664), which is just
beginning implementation. In addition, SPREP has appointed a GEF Support Advisor and established a
GEF support team within the Secretariat to strengthen SPREP’s support for Pacific countries in GEF
matters.8

             1.3.2 – Relevance
Conclusion 6: GEF support is highly relevant to Vanuatu and the SPREP region’s environmental
needs and challenges in all GEF focal areas.

The evaluation found that all GEF focal areas are relevant to Vanuatu and the SPREP region. The
majority of projects have addressed biodiversity and climate change. For Vanuatu, GEF support
enabled the preparation of environmental sector national plans such as the NAPA, the NBSAP, the
NAP, NIP and the National Capacity Self-Assessment (NCSA) through seven completed EAs – i.e., one in
climate change, four in biodiversity, one in POPs and one multifocal project. SPBCP introduced
community-based approaches to biodiversity and sustainable resource use that were adopted and
replicated through other initiatives including the LCI and smaller-scale SGP initiatives, to address
threats of overexploitation of resources. Similarly, IWP introduced an integrated and holistic approach
to the management of water resources, which complements and reinforces strategies for biodiversity
conservation as well as climate change.

The dominance of biodiversity and climate change projects in the GEF Vanuatu/SPREP portfolio reflects
the importance of those focal areas in the SPREP Regional Plan and in Vanuatu. The impact of climate
change is regularly felt in the SPREP region, including Vanuatu, and is reflected in projects mostly
focusing on adaptation measures and improving resilience. Climate change is not only an
environmental issue but is now perceived in all PICs as the biggest source of economic vulnerability
confronting Pacific economies. Biodiversity is a priority as the fragile ecosystems in the region are
easily impacted by invasive species, and threatened by overexploitation.

To date, there has been less activity in the POPs and land degradation focal areas. Resources have
been directed toward establishing baseline information in these areas and developing national plans.

Conclusion 7: GEF support in Vanuatu and SPREP has been highly relevant for accelerating the
sustainable development agenda and meeting development needs. GEF has been a major catalyst
in helping move the environmental and sustainable development agenda into the national
forefront.

The GEF-supported EAs that produced the NBSAP and the PICCAP were catalytic in preparing the
Environmental Management and Conservation Act, and in integrating the concept of sustainable
development into national development plans. SPBCP and LCI not only raised awareness and the

profile of areas with globally significant biodiversity but, with IWP, also demonstrated community-
based approaches that Vanuatu and other PICs have since increasingly adopted in managing
biodiversity and natural resources on customary land areas. The PIREP and PIGGAREP projects have
been influential in the development of national energy policies and the recent shift in emphasis to
renewable energy technologies among PICs. Much of the planning information now available to
countries in the GEF focal areas was generated from GEF projects. These have not only been useful in
the design of projects, but also in the formulation of sector policies.

Similarly, GEF contributed to accelerating the national sustainable development agendas elsewhere in
the region. The outcomes of the PICCAP, with its national greenhouse gas assessments and the
vulnerability assessments, helped frame the Pacific Forum Leaders Communiqué of the past 10 years,
stressing the importance of actions to combat climate change and prioritise adaptation measures. In
Fiji, the NBSAP project helped accelerate the development of national sustainable development plans.
In Samoa, the outcomes of GEF projects have been instrumental in mainstreaming climate change,
biodiversity, and land degradation into the country’s Development Strategy 2012-2014. GEF’s
contribution in the climate change focal area is particularly relevant, as Samoa and other PICs
recognize the threat of climate change-induced extreme weather events as a major source of
economic vulnerability for their development ambitions.

Conclusion 8: National ownership of GEF projects in Vanuatu is generally low, except for enabling
activities.

The evaluation found a strong sense of national ownership of GEF enabling activities, with their
expedited procedures and absence of co-financing component; seven of the nine completed Vanuatu
national projects are EAs. The only two completed MSPs in Vanuatu (the LCI project and Sustainable
Land Management project) were both initiated by a GEF Agency.

SPREP regional projects including SPBCP, IWP, and PACC were based on SPREP Meeting resolutions.
These projects are intended to address issues that are common throughout the region as well as
national concerns; however, the evaluation findings suggest that these projects have not always
addressed specific national priorities. Country obligations under various multilateral environmental
agreements (MEAs) and initiatives of GEF Agencies in facilitating access to GEF funding are other
drivers that prompt PICs to engage in activities that are not necessarily consistent with national
priorities.

Consequently, the GEF supported some national plans in areas that were not fully aligned with the
highest national priorities and were not supported by national budget allocations. As a result, the use
or implementation of the outputs from these projects has been limited. Examples include National
Biosafety Frameworks (NBF), POPs National Implementation Plans (NIP), and to an extent, National
Action Plans (NAP) for addressing land degradation and desertification.

          1.3.3 – Efficiency
Conclusion 9: The preparation time for GEF projects in Vanuatu and the SPREP region is excessive.
This affects the efficiency of implementation in terms of changes in institutional memory, staff
turnover, and national co-financing allocations.

The approval process takes 1.7 years on average for national projects and 2.4 years on average for
regional projects. However, there is substantial variation across different project modalities. For
                                                                                                       11

example, national FSPs in Vanuatu have a longer approval process (4.3 years) on average than SPREP-
executed regional FSPs (2.5 years). On the other hand, EAs have been approved somewhat faster, on
average, for Vanuatu national projects (1.2 years) compared to SPREP-executed regional EAs (1.4
years). Overall, these figures compare favourably with the GEF global average of 5.5 years (GEF
Evaluation Office, 2007), as well as with those reported in the OECS Cluster CPE (GEF Evaluation Office,
2012). However, the averages for MSPs and FSPs still exceed the GEF Secretariat standard of an 18-
month approval process. Furthermore, interviewees from the GEF Secretariat and GEF Agencies
acknowledged that the process takes longer than it should, considering the reforms introduced during
GEF-4 and the rather small number of nationally-executed projects in Vanuatu. Moreover, the average
time required to approve national projects has increased, from less than one year in GEF-1 to 4.3 years
in GEF-4. The GEF Council is aware of the delays and is continuing its efforts to streamline the approval
process.

As projects take longer to prepare, priorities and commitments identified in the project documents
may change, potentially affecting the efficiency of implementation. In most of the regional projects, a
complete reworking of the project documents was undertaken after the GEF Council and GEF Agency
approvals, due to changes that occurred in some countries concerning national priorities, the
institutional memory of the national focal points, staff turnover, and budgetary constraints. In
addition, in some instances co-financing initially allocated to those projects had to be shifted to newly
emerging national needs. This was the case for the IWP and PACC projects and the Vanuatu LCI project.

Conclusion 10: GEF projects’ monitoring and evaluation (M&E) produced very important
information and lessons both for institutional capacity building and identifying actions to address
environmental concerns. The use of these lessons has varied, with some being successfully used
and several others not having been used at all.

All GEF projects have monitoring and evaluation (M&E) protocols in the form of annual Project
Implementation Reports (PIRs), Mid-Term Reviews (MTRs), and Terminal Evaluations (TEs). The
evaluation team found that the M&E systems in place are used effectively for adaptive management
during the life of the projects. All the completed regional and national projects include examples of
improvements since the relevant MTR took place.

Some good examples of adaptive management include the changes that UNDP and SPREP initiated to
address delays in the disbursement of funds for the PACC project. This was an issue since UNDP and
SPREP started working together on GEF projects in the mid-1990s. The new approach allows
disbursement of funds only to those countries that have submitted the necessary reports on time,
rather than waiting until all countries have submitted their reports before funds are disbursed to
SPREP. Also, SPREP now only has to submit progress reports on a six-month basis rather than quarterly,
freeing up staff time to work on project activities. SPREP reports that it will soon appoint an M&E
Advisor which will, in part, support SPREP’s M&E activities relating to the GEF.9

The evaluation team also found that project TEs produced some very useful lessons and
recommendations for future action. Unfortunately, these lessons do not appear to have been
incorporated into the design of subsequent projects or taken up by government in their relevant work
programs. Examples include the recommendations from the LCI to enact the Conservation Area
Regulation (CAR) in Vanuatu and providing support for the communities to maintain their established

conservation areas. The evaluation found that neither of these has been addressed. Other
recommendations from the TE of the LCI project, and the NBSAP projects as well as the IWP,
highlighted the need for strengthening the capacity of DEPC. Unfortunately this has not happened,
mainly due to a lack of political commitment to raising the profile of environmental issues at the
national level.

   1.4 – Recommendations
          1.4.1 – Recommendations to the Government of Vanuatu
Recommendation 1: Identify and implement action items in GEF-funded action plans that are most
closely aligned with national priorities.

The GEF has supported the Government in developing a myriad of strategies and action plans through
EAs. These plans include suggested action items to address pressing environmental issues. While some
of the recommended actions have been implemented, several others have not. The Government
should systematically review the pending action items in the National Biosafety Frameworks, POPs
National Implementation Plans, and National Action Plans for addressing land degradation and
desertification; decide which action items are most closely aligned with national priorities and available
funding; and redouble efforts to implement the selected actions. This effort would not only benefit the
specific areas highlighted in the plans, but would demonstrate the Government’s commitment to the
environment while raising the profile of environmental issues in Vanuatu.

Recommendation 2: Mainstream project coordination mechanisms into ongoing national planning
processes to sustain progress and strengthen national capacity.

Through GEF EAs, the Government has established committees and teams to work on meeting the
country’s environmental obligations under various international agreements. While these
arrangements have resulted in effective coordination during the lifetime of the projects, these
mechanisms have not been integrated into broader national planning processes and have gone
dormant, with the exception of committees and teams working on climate change issues. The
Government should actively consider opportunities to integrate coordination mechanisms established
during GEF EAs into its ongoing national work programs. In so doing, the Government should look for
opportunities to improve cross-sector integration and coordination between DEPC and other line
ministries and organizations to ensure efficient use of resources and expertise.

          1.4.2 – Recommendations to the GEF Council
Recommendation 3: Continue to work on reducing the time required to approve GEF projects,
while accounting for delays in project execution.

The time required to approve MSPs and FSPs exceeds the GEF’s 18-month target. This evaluation was
not able to fully determine the causes of delays due to missing and inaccurate data; going forward, the
GEF should track this issue carefully to identify and address the sources of delays. As indicated in many
other GEF CPEs, excessive approval time is an ongoing challenge. While making every effort to shorten
the approval process over the medium to long term, the GEF should acknowledge that delays are likely
to be encountered within the current process, and plan projects accordingly. For example, the
evaluation finds that national priorities and resources often change between the time when project
proposals are developed and when projects are approved; the GEF may want to set aside additional
                                                                                                         13

resources for stakeholder consultations after projects have been approved to reaffirm national
commitment and make any needed changes to project plans based on recent developments.

          1.4.3. – Recommendation to the GEF Council and SPREP
Recommendation 4: Further strengthen knowledge management by integrating communication
and outreach components in GEF projects and disseminating lessons learned more broadly
through SPREP’s regional platform.

While the evaluation finds some successful examples of knowledge sharing, it also finds that lessons
from past projects are not being fully utilized. The GEF should ensure that communication and
outreach are integrated in project designs to facilitate ongoing learning and dissemination. For its
part, SPREP should include ‘learning and adaptive management’ as a permanent webpage on
SPREP’s website. This should build on the existing resources available on SPREP’s website and help
crystalize good practices and lessons for specific types of projects. In addition, SPREP technical staff
should draw on this knowledge when helping countries design and implement projects. For example,
SPREP could help ensure that lessons learned are reflected in the design of new projects.

          1.4.4 – Recommendation to SPREP
Recommendation 5: Continue and reinforce SPREP’s role of providing technical assistance for GEF
projects, particularly after GEF funding ends.

Evaluation stakeholders identified SPREP as playing an important role in providing technical support
for project design, implementation, replication, and scale-up. The evaluation findings suggest that
countries would benefit from even more technical assistance, particularly after GEF funding ends.
SPREP should continue to build its technical expertise in climate change and biodiversity, in addition
to other focal areas that are aligned with SPREP’s mandate. In addition, SPREP should look for
opportunities to leverage and coordinate technical expertise throughout the region to address
country-specific capacity needs.

2 – EVALUATION FRAMEWORK
This chapter presents the background, objectives, and methodology for the GEF Vanuatu and SPREP
portfolio evaluation.

     2.1 – Background
The Evaluation Office conducts CPEs every year at the request of the GEF Council. GEF-eligible
countries are chosen for CPEs based on their size, diversity, and maturity of their project portfolios.
These evaluations usually cover all national projects, and include a selection of the most important
regional and global projects in which the country participates.

In FY2011, the CPE team conducted a different type of CPE, taking a cluster approach that analysed the
portfolios of six GEF beneficiary countries of the Organization of the Eastern Caribbean States. That
evaluation, the first of its kind for the CPE team, looked at the relevance, performance, and results of
regional projects, one of the main support modalities in Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Building
on this experience, the Vanuatu and SPREP Portfolio Evaluation provides an opportunity to compare
regional to national project relevance and performance in SIDS in the South Pacific region.

The South Pacific region comprises 22 countries scattered over one-third of the globe, covering about
30 million km2, mostly oceanic. The region is tremendously diverse in its geography, culture, languages,
social-political organization, size, and natural resource endowment.10 At the same time, Pacific
countries face a full range of geologic and climatic hazards, including: population increase, waste
management, climate change and sea level rise, and economic and institutional capacity.

SPREP is an intergovernmental organization established in 1982 by the governments and
administrations of the South Pacific region to address environmental issues in the region. SPREP is
composed of 25 countries, including all 21 Pacific Island countries and territories, and four developed
countries.11 It is charged with promoting cooperation, supporting protection and improvement of the
Pacific Islands environment, and ensuring its sustainable development. SPREP focuses on climate
change, biodiversity and ecosystem management, waste management and pollution control, and
environmental monitoring and governance.

     2.2 – Objectives and Scope
The main focus of this evaluation is the 13 national projects implemented within Vanuatu and the 11
regional projects executed by SPREP. However, the evaluation also considers 10 regional projects that
were not executed by SPREP.

Based on the overall purpose of GEF CPEs and their standard TORs, the evaluation has the following
objectives:

      i.    independently evaluate the relevance and efficiency12 of GEF support in the region from
            several points of view: national environmental frameworks and decision-making processes;
            the GEF mandate and the achievement of global environmental benefits; and GEF policies and
            procedures;
      ii.   assess the effectiveness and results13 of completed projects aggregated by focal area;
     iii.   provide additional evaluative evidence to other evaluations conducted or sponsored by the
            Office; and
     iv.    provide feedback and knowledge sharing to (1) the GEF Council in its decision-making process
            to allocate resources and to develop policies and strategies; (2) the countries on their
            participation in, or collaboration with the GEF; and (3) the different agencies and organizations
            involved in the preparation and implementation of GEF-funded projects and activities. The
            evaluation results will be used to provide information and evidence to inform other
            evaluations being conducted by the GEF Evaluation Office.

This evaluation assesses GEF support for projects in Vanuatu and the South Pacific. It analyses the
performance of individual projects as part of the overall GEF portfolio. CPEs do not attempt to evaluate
or rate the performance of the GEF Agencies, partners, or national governments.

       2.3 – Methodology
The evaluation was conducted between October 2012 and August 2013 by an evaluation team
comprised of staff from the GEF Evaluation Office and consultants with extensive knowledge of
environmental evaluation and the South Pacific region. The methodology used qualitative and
quantitative data collection methods and standardized analytical tools. Qualitative data sources
included the following:

           At the project level, project documents, project implementation reports, terminal evaluations,
            terminal evaluation reviews, reports from monitoring visits, and technical documents
            produced by projects.

           At the country level, national sustainable development agendas, environmental priorities and
            strategies, GEF-wide focal area strategies and action plans, and global and national
            environmental indicators.

           At the GEF Agency level, country assistance strategies and frameworks and their evaluations
            and reviews.

           Evaluative evidence from the GEF Evaluation Office.

           Interviews with roughly 40 GEF stakeholders and beneficiaries – 10% of the interviewees
            from civil society, 50% from national government institutions, 30% from SPREP, and 10% from
            GEF Agencies.

           Field visits to selected projects sites.

12
   Relevance: the extent to which the objectives of the GEF activity are consistent with beneficiaries’ requirements, country
needs, global priorities and partners’ and donors’ policies; efficiency: a measure of how economically resources/inputs
(funds, expertise, time, etc.) are converted to results.
13
   Results: the output, outcome or impact (intended or unintended, positive and/or negative) of a GEF activity;
effectiveness: the extent to which the GEF activity’s objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into
account their relative importance.
                                                                                                                          16
February 2014                                                                    GEF Evaluation Office


        Information from national consultation workshops.

The quantitative analysis used standard indicators to assess the efficiency of GEF support using
projects as the unit of analysis, particularly the time and cost of preparing and implementing projects.

The evaluation team used standardized analytical tools and project review protocols (PRPs) for the
evaluation and adapted these to the South Pacific context. Twenty-two person-days were spent on
fieldwork, including interviews and site visits conducted in Vanuatu, Samoa, and Fiji. Review of
Outcomes to Impact (ROtI) field studies were undertaken for two projects – Pacific Islands Renewable
Energy Program (PIREP) (GEF ID 1058) and Local Conservation Initiatives (LCI) (GEF ID 1682) – that were
completed at least two years prior.14

A triangulation analysis was undertaken by comparing data collected from each of the evaluation
methods to synthesize answers to the key evaluation questions. Based on this analysis of the
evaluative evidence, the evaluation team produced preliminary findings, which were summarized in an
aide-memoire that was distributed to stakeholders for factual correction and identification of
additional evaluative evidence. Stakeholder comments on the aide-memoire, received at the
consultation workshop held in March 2013, were taken into account in finalizing the conclusions and
recommendations contained in this report.

     2.4 – Limitations
The following limitations were taken into account and addressed wherever possible while conducting
the evaluation:

        Country-level evaluations are challenging, as the GEF does not yet operate by establishing
         country programs that specify expected achievement through programmatic objectives,
         indicators, and targets. Many projects do not clearly or appropriately specify the expected
         impact and sometimes even the outcomes of projects. This evaluation sought to overcome
         these difficulties by undertaking field verifications to ongoing projects and two field ROtIs and
         interviews with other related organizations not directly associated with GEF projects. The
         results presented in this report are based on triangulation across various sources, including:
         project reports; interviews; focus groups; field visits; desk reviews; portfolio analysis; the
         Global Environmental Benefits Assessment (GEBA); Environmental Legal Framework; the two
         field ROtIs; meta-analysis of prior studies; literature review; and websites.

        The lack of a filing system within the main GEF Operational Focal Point (OFP) office meant
         most of the information used in the desk reviews was limited to whatever was available in the
         GEF database and other websites. The team used the interviews and field assessments to
         supplement the written record and relied highly on the individual interviews conducted.

        Weaknesses of M&E at the project and GEF program levels have been mentioned in past
         country-level evaluations and other evaluations of the Office. These weaknesses were also a
         challenge in conducting the Vanuatu and SPREP Portfolio Evaluation.

        As in previous CPEs, the analysis of the portfolio proved challenging for a number of reasons,
         including inconsistencies in the GEF Project Management Information System (PMIS) and

          incomplete data for some projects. This posed particular difficulties for the efficiency analysis
          of the time required to complete the project approval process, as many projects were missing
          dates for some phases, or the dates provided were apparently inaccurate (e.g.,
          implementation start dates preceded project approval dates). Efforts were made by the GEF
          Evaluation Office to follow up directly with the GEF Agencies and by the consultants during the
          fieldwork to clarify the anomalies in the data; however, the team was not able to reconcile all
          of the discrepancies. Instead, the team extrapolated missing data points using the available
          data.15 This approach is based on taking averages between phases and across different types
          of projects; while this should provide a reasonable estimate of the project cycle overall, it does
          not allow us to isolate which steps of the process took the longest for specific projects.

         The lack of technical capacity in the PICs, including Vanuatu, and high turnover made it difficult
          to find knowledgeable project staff for interviews.

         Travel within the Pacific let alone Vanuatu is expensive and very difficult, as flights are mostly
          once a week to the outer islands where some of the project sites are located.

         As foreseen in the TOR, it is difficult to assign attribution to observed results. The evaluation
          does not attempt to provide a direct attribution of development and even environmental
          results to the GEF, but assesses the contribution of GEF support to overall achievements.

Despite the methodological challenges, the evaluation team managed to establish a clear and reliable
set of data on projects and project documentation through the methods and approaches discussed
above and throughout this evaluation report.

  The evaluation team used the following methodology to backfill missing dates:
   To fill in missing ‘Pipeline Entry/Received’ (A) dates:
          o Where the ‘Entry Work Program/ PIF Clearance’ (B) date is available:
                          For Full Size Projects, take the average time from A-B (across FSPs) and subtract this value from
                           the ‘Entry Work Program/PIF Clearance’ (B) date.
                          For Enabling Activities, take the average time from A-B (across all projects, because no data
                           available for just EAs) and subtract this value from the ‘Entry Work Program/PIF Clearance’ (B)
                           date.
          o Where the ‘Entry Work Program/PIF Clearance’ (B) date is not available:
                          For Enabling Activities (the only ones in this category), take the average time from A-C (across EAs)
                           and subtract this value from the ‘CEO Approval’ or ‘CEO Endorsement’ (C) date.
   To fill in missing ‘Entry Work Program/PIF Clearance’ (B) dates:
          o For all project types, take the midpoint between the ‘Pipeline Entry/Received’ (A) and ‘CEO Approval’ or
                ‘CEO Endorsement’ (C) dates.
   To fill in missing ‘CEO Approval’ or ‘CEO Endorsement’ (C) dates (only one case):
          o For Full Size Projects (the only one in this category), take the average from A-B (across FSPs) and add this to
                the ‘Entry Work Program/ PIF Clearance’ (B) date.

3 – CONTEXT OF THE EVALUATION
This chapter summarizes the context for the evaluation in terms of both the environmental framework
of Vanuatu and the South Pacific island countries, and the mandate and operations of the GEF.16
Volume II of this report includes further details about the Global Environmental Benefits Assessment
and Regional Environmental Legal Framework.

     3.1 – Vanuatu and SPREP Region: General Description
General Description: SPREP Region

The Pacific Islands constitute a diverse region which includes 14 nation states and eight territories
scattered over-one third of the globe, covering an area of around 30 million km2. Of the total area,
only 0.4% is covered by land, made up of between 20,000-30,000 small islands, with Papua New
Guinea (PNG) covering 83% of the region’s land area.

As reflected in Table 3-1, the Pacific Island nations range in size and population, from Papua New
Guinea, which is spread over 400,000 km2 with a population of over 5 million, to Niue with a
population of roughly 1,500 residing on a land area of 259km 2. Population growth rates for the
region are relatively high, averaging 2.2% per annum. Countries that have high emigration rates such
as Tonga, Samoa, and Tuvalu normally have less than 1% growth rates, while Niue and Cook Islands
with New Zealand citizenship have had negative growth rates for the last 10 years.17

The Pacific economies are primarily dependent on agriculture (20-40% of GDP), fishing (10% of GDP)
and tourism (up to 40% of GDP in some countries).18 For Samoa and Tonga, remittances from
workers overseas to their home countries account for 25% and 32% of their respective GDPs. The
continental high islands of the Melanesian group have extractive industries such as logging and
mining as additional major contributors to their economies. The resource-rich Melanesian states
have higher GDPs than the Polynesian and Micronesian states. PNG has a GDP of US$7906 million,
Fiji a GDP of US$3061 million, Solomon Islands a US$715 million GDP, and Vanuatu a US$729 million
GDP. The rest of the region – which includes Samoa, Tonga, Niue, Cook Islands, Tuvalu, Federated
States of Micronesia, Palau, Kiribati, Nauru, and the Marshall Islands – have GDPs ranging from
US$523 million in Samoa to US$54 million in Nauru.

With the exception of PNG, the Pacific’s populations predominantly reside in rural coastal areas,
thus making them particularly vulnerable to sea level rise and tsunamis.

General Description: Vanuatu

Vanuatu is comprised of an irregular Y-shaped chain of some 80 islands, with a total land area of
about 12,190 km2. The country’s total population was estimated to be 240,000 people in 2010, and it
has an annual population growth rate of 2.3%.19 Vanuatu is located in a seismically and volcanically
active region with high exposure to geologic hazards, including volcanic eruptions, earthquakes,
tsunamis, and landslides.20

Vanuatu’s GDP was approximately US$729 million in 2010 with a growth rate of 4.7% and per capita
income of US$1,908 as shown in Table 3-1. Agriculture and tourism are the main productive sectors
contributing to Vanuatu’s economy. Agriculture contributes 21.5% of GDP; tourism contributes 19%
of GDP.21 The vast majority of Vanuatu’s population is engaged in informal subsistence economic
activities. 79% of Vanuatu’s population lives in rural villages, ranging from one family to a thousand
people, meeting subsistence and cash needs from locally available terrestrial and inshore marine
resources. The monetized commercial sector accounts for less than one third of all economic
activity.

Vanuatu ranks 118th on the Human Development Index (HDI) and 52nd on the Human Poverty Index
(HPI). Poverty levels stubbornly remain at about 40% of the population, with about 26% living on less
than US$1 per day. The low economic and social statistics for Vanuatu are a major stumbling block in
implementing the national plans developed as part of the Rio Conventions as the limited national
budget is spread thinly over several sectors of society.

     3.2 – Environmental Benefits in Key GEF Support Areas
The Global Benefits Index (GBI) is a measure of the potential of each country to generate global
environmental benefits in a particular GEF focal area. Separate indices are determined for the
biodiversity and climate change focal areas as shown in Table 3-2.

The GBI for biodiversity seeks to measure the potential global benefits from biodiversity-related
activities in a country. It reflects the complex, highly uneven distribution of species and threats to
them across the ecosystems of the world, both within and across countries. The GBI for climate
change seeks to measure the potential global benefits that can be realized from climate change
mitigation activities in a country. The approach reflects the objectives of the GEF climate change
operational programs to address long-term priorities to mitigate climate change. Adaptation funding
is through the Least Development Countries (LDC) Fund, the Adaptation Fund, and the Special
Climate Change Fund, which is outside of the GBI calculations.

As shown in Table 3-2, the climate change GBIs for individual nations in the Pacific Islands are zero –
and yet, these countries are highly vulnerable to the effects of global climate change due to the
smallness of the islands and their tropical location. In addition, the Pacific is home to a very high and
rich biodiversity, as reflected in the biodiversity GBIs.


             3.2.1 – Biodiversity
The Pacific Islands region is one of the richest areas of terrestrial and marine ecosystems on earth,
with habitats ranging from mountain forest ecosystems to volcanic islands and low lying coral atolls
and extensive coral reef systems. The New Guinea Islands (the west is part of Indonesia and the east
is part of Papua New Guinea) alone are home to over 5% of global terrestrial biodiversity, with two-
thirds of these species found nowhere else in the world, despite being less than 1% of the global
landmass. The Western Pacific, which includes the Melanesian countries and Palau, is recorded as
having the highest marine biodiversity along with the most extensive coral reef system in the world.
The region’s isolated islands provide ideal conditions for the evolution of new species. As a




                                                                                                                          21

consequence, Pacific islands have high numbers of ‘endemic’ species, including more than 400
endemic bird species.22

The huge expanse of ocean supports the most extensive and diverse coral reefs in the world, the
largest tuna fishery, the deepest oceanic trenches and the healthiest and, in some cases, largest
remaining populations of many globally rare and threatened species including whales, sea turtles,
dugongs and saltwater crocodiles. The richness of biodiversity in the Pacific is evident in the
presence of biodiversity hotspots that include both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Eastern
Melanesia, New Guinea Island and New Caledonia are recognised for their rich and diverse
terrestrial areas, as shown in Table 3-3.

Due in large part to the small size of most of the islands, many of the unique plants and animals of
the Pacific region have very small populations and are amongst the most endangered in the world.
The Pacific currently has about 25% of the world’s threatened bird species and has already lost many
species. Worldwide, the largest number of documented extinctions (28 between 1600 and 1899 and
23 in the twentieth century) has occurred on the islands of Oceania which now have more
threatened species (110) than any other region. Estimates identify that there are roughly seven
times more endangered bird species per capita in the South Pacific than in the Caribbean, 50 times
more than South America, and a hundred times more than in North America or Africa. The
Polynesia-Melanesia hotspot is considered the epicentre of the current global extinction crisis.23

Biodiversity in Vanuatu

Vanuatu belongs to the East Melanesian Islands biodiversity hotspot. As shown in Table 3-3 above,
the hotspot is rich in biodiversity and high in endemic plant, mammal, bird, amphibian, and
freshwater fish species.24 A review on studies of the flora and fauna for the Vanuatu Biodiversity
Strategy Action Plan noted the presence of more than 1,100 plant species, 297 coral species, 80
species of insects, 13 mammal species, and more than 469 shallow fish species. Vanuatu’s terrestrial
ecosystems are classified into five main vegetation types, mainly lowland rainforests, montane cloud
forests, seasonal forest, scrub and grasslands, and coastal vegetation. The rich marine ecosystems
include coral reefs, mangrove forests, sea grass beds, wetlands, and rare marine biodiversity such as
sea turtles, whales, dugongs, and dolphins.

              3.2.2 – Climate Change
Climate change is disproportionally affecting the islands of the Pacific. Although islanders have done
little to contribute to the increase in carbon emissions – less than 0.03% of current global
greenhouse gas emissions – they are among the first to be affected. Most islands are experiencing
climate change impacts on communities, infrastructure, water supply, coastal and forest
ecosystems, fisheries, agriculture, and human health as well as tourism.

Agriculture, which is mostly rain-fed in the region, is susceptible to changes in rainfall distribution.
Intense and prolonged rainfall could damage seedlings, resulting in greater run-off and soil erosion
and encouraging conditions that promote pests and diseases. Droughts combined with higher
temperatures would cause added thermal stress on plants. Projected increases in sea surface
temperatures combined with increased ocean acidification (from increased CO2 concentrations in
the atmosphere) are likely to put pressure on the marine food chain (particularly reef systems and
other calcifying organisms such as planktons), which in turn potentially threatens aspects of marine
food supply and associated livelihoods. The incidence of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and
dengue fever, and water-borne diseases such as dysentery and diarrhoea, are likely to increase and
shift in distribution (for example, malaria is likely to extend further southwards).25

The impacts of climate change and sea level rise on the Pacific Island nations are real and life
threatening. For example, citizens on some of PNG’s islands have been relocated in response to
rising sea levels. Tuvalu and Kiribati have been seeking countries for their people to relocate to in
the near future as the sea level continues to rise, inundating their low-lying atoll islands. Droughts
and cyclones are threatening the national economies and livelihoods of Pacific people.

Climate Change in Vanuatu
Vanuatu’s location in the ‘ring of fire’ and the ‘cyclone belt’ of the Pacific makes it extremely
vulnerable to a range of natural hazards. Since 1939 Vanuatu has experienced 124 tropical cyclones,
of which 45 were categorized as having hurricane force winds. Several of these disasters have
caused loss of human life, disrupted livelihoods and resulted in millions of dollars in infrastructure
damage. Cyclone Prema, which occurred in 1993, caused some US$60 million in damages, and Dani
in 1999 resulted in damage estimated at US$8 million. The Penama earthquake and tsunami of
November 1999 affected 23,000 people.26 Vanuatu is also affected by the cycles of El Niño, which
comes with changes in precipitation patterns (drought) associated with increased mean
temperatures, and La Niña, which brings increased rainfall. The effects of global climate change
increase Vanuatu’s vulnerability to cyclones and sea level rise.

The country’s vulnerability is further heightened by a number of socio-economic factors. Vanuatu’s
narrow economic base is comprised of subsistence small-scale agriculture, which contributes 65% of
the country’s GDP, with fishing, offshore financial services and tourism making up the remainder.
Some 80% of the population are rural and depend on agriculture, but productivity is low and the
domestic market for agricultural products is limited. Therefore, the population is extremely
vulnerable to the disruptions caused by extreme weather events on the nation’s economy.

Vanuatu has completed both a National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA) and a National Action
Plan (NAP) for Disaster Risk Reduction. Additionally, the national government’s commitment is
reflected in the merging of the former National Advisory Committee on Climate Change (NACCC) and

Board for Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction. The establishment of the Project

Government and funding from the GEF and other development partners.

          3.2.3 – International Waters
The Pacific Ocean covers an area of nearly 40 million km2 (15.4 million square miles) or over 7.9% of
the Earth’s surface. The Coral Triangle lies in the Pacific and is considered one of the richest marine
biodiversity areas in the world. This area stretches from Southeast Asia to encompass PNG, Solomon
Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji and Palau. This vast and complex marine system contains an enormous and
largely undocumented array of biodiversity. This includes the most extensive and biologically diverse
reefs in the world, the deepest ocean trenches, deep-sea minerals, the world’s largest tuna fishery,
as well as an array of globally threatened species such as sea turtles, whales and dugongs.

The many thousands of islands are, with the exception of some larger Melanesian Islands, entirely
coastal, often with limited freshwater resources. The islands are surrounded by a rich variety of
ecosystems including mangroves, seagrass beds, estuarine lagoons and coral reefs.

The Pacific hosts the world’s largest remaining stocks of tuna, providing approximately one -third of
the world’s catches of tuna and related species. The western and central Pacific Ocean tuna
industries have a total landed value of around US$2 billion/year and an estimated market value of
US$6–8 billion/year. About half of this annual catch is taken from the Exclusive Economic Zones
(EEZs) of Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Annual licensing fees for the predominantly
foreign fishing fleets provide revenues of about US$60–70 million to the region. As a consequence,
responsible and effective stewardship is a priority, recognising that over-fishing of two key species –
big eye and yellow-fin tuna – now places stock levels in jeopardy.

The ocean and its resources have been the lifeline for Pacific people for millennia, but with declining
fishery resources, rising sea levels, warming ocean temperatures, ocean acidification and pollution,
the oceans are changing rapidly. These changes are degrading the livelihoods, and threatening the
very survival of Pacific Islanders.

          3.2.4 – Land Degradation
Land degradation is a pivotal issue for most of the smaller Pacific Island countries. Already, Nauru
has no native forest left due to years of mining, while Tonga (12% remaining native forest) and
Kiribati (15% remaining native forest) face problems for future land use and management. Land
degradation from clearing of native forests for logging operations, commercial plantations and
farms, and increasing urban settlements poses additional problems such as the contamination of the
underground water lens and resulting threats to the livelihood and food security of the resident
populations.

Land Degradation in Vanuatu
The volcanic origins of the Vanuatu archipelago make most of the islands steep and mountainous.
About 36.7% of the country is forested and only about 9.8% of Vanuatu’s total land area is arable.
Approximately 60% of low-lying coastline areas are utilised for agricultural activities and human
settlement and industrial activities.

There have been numerous changes in the way land is used in Vanuatu in the last decade,
particularly in the urban areas of Vila and Louganville. In rural communities, land remains primarily
                                                                                                       24

under customary ownership and a large proportion of it is under cultivation. The extent of land
degradation in Vanuatu is largely unknown. The impacts of land degradation on local economic and
subsistence activities and national economic and political aspirations have not been assessed.

              3.2.5 – Persistent Organic Pollutants
All 14 Pacific Island nations have signed the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants
(POPs), but are in various stages of developing and implementing their National Implementation
Plans (NIPs). Unfortunately, because most of the Pacific countries still have not completed their
national assessments and NIPs, a regional overview on the global environmental benefits could not
be adequately ascertained.

In a regional study of hazardous waste conducted by SPREP in 13 Pacific countries (all except PNG), a
total 131 tons of PCBs, and 10.4 tons of DDT were recorded at over 20 sites. The chemicals were
mostly disposed of by burial or sealing off from human contact.27 The results of this study were used
as the basis for the Pacific Regional POPs project under consideration for GEF-5 funding.

POPs in Vanuatu
Vanuatu lacks the capacity to record, control or monitor the releases of dioxins and furans. The
knowledge and application of best available techniques (BAT) and best environment practices (BEP)
for new or existing sources in Vanuatu is very limited or non-existent.

The National Implementation Plan confirmed that DDT was used for the control of malaria-carrying
mosquitoes until 1989, and some of the used stocks of electrical transformers in Vanuatu contained
PCBs. The report for the inventory of chemical imports has shown that the main sources of dioxin
and furan releases in Vanuatu are from the incineration of quarantine and medical wastes and
uncontrolled burning, including landfills and backyard rubbish fires.28

      3.3 – Environmental Legal and Policy Framework in Vanuatu and the
      South Pacific Region
The environmental legal framework in the South Pacific consists of international and regional
agreements that countries have signed and ratified/acceded to, non-binding strategies and plans
endorsed at high-level international conferences, and national-level legislation and regulations,
along with accompanying institutional arrangements for their administration. For Pacific Islands
States, the lines of demarcation between obligations and responsibilities at these different levels are
often blurred in practice, in large part because obligations for reporting, information sharing, and
implementation are often overlapping.

              3.3.1 – Regional Conventions
Three important regional conventions govern environmental activities in the Pacific: Apia
Convention, Noumea Convention, and Waigani Convention.

           Apia Convention (1976). The objective of the Apia Convention is to take action for the
            conservation, utilization and development of the natural resources of the South Pacific
            region through careful planning and management for the benefit of present and future
            generations.

              3.3.2 – International Agreements
All Pacific Island states are party to a large number of Multilateral Environmental Agreements
(MEAs), including the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the United Nations Convention for Combating
Desertification (UNCCD). Their participation reflects the serious regional concern regarding their
vulnerability to the transboundary impacts of environmental impacts such as marine pollution,
climate change, loss of biodiversity and ozone depletion. The MEAs not only provide Pacific Island
States access to a global stage on which to express their issues and sometimes grievances, but also
the opportunity to cooperate with the international community and to access financial resources to
support the implementation of their activities. Those that are of particular relevance to GEF as a
funding mechanism – i.e., CBD, UNFCCC and UNCDD – are particularly well supported.29

              3.3.3 – Other Regional Policy and Planning Frameworks
Regional policies, plans and frameworks often endorsed at high-level international and regional
meetings constitute an important part of the larger framework within which SPREP and its member
countries operate. While these are not legally binding, compliance with them is important for
political and other reasons, including that of access to financial resources. Many of these directly
support international conventions and agreements. For instance, the Pacific Plan 2005’s purpose
(among others) is ‘… to guide the region’s efforts towards achieving the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs)’ (PIFS, 2011). The Action Plan for the Implementation of the Climate Change
Framework, noted the Pacific Islands Climate Change Roundtable (Madang, 2005), ‘… will also be
guided by decisions and activities at the level of the UNFCC and GEF’ (SPREP, 2009).

Most regional frameworks are developed through highly inclusive and consultative regional
processes and because they are formally endorsed and adopted by high-level meetings of Pacific
leaders, they command a high degree of legitimacy and recognition both at the national level and
with development partners. Volume II summarizes the international and regional frameworks,
strategies and plans that are widely recognized and used in the Pacific region.

            3.3.4 – Secretariat for the Pacific Regional Environment
            Programme (SPREP)
An important addition to the institutional arrangements for supporting environmental activities in
the region is the existence of SPREP. SPREP was established under the Agreement Establishing SPREP
in 1993, ‘… to promote co-operation, and provide assistance in order to protect the environment
and to ensure the sustainable development for present and future generations.’30 The Secretariat is
located in Samoa. It has a Director, and a complement of professional and support staff that
implement the organization’s annual work programme and respond to country-specific requests for
assistance and support. In 2011, SPREP had a total of 69 professionals and support staff and an
operating budget of US$14.3 million.31

The Secretariat reports to the annual SPREP Meeting consisting of representatives of all 25 member
states and territories. The Meeting approves the organization’s annual budget and Work
Programme. The current work programme addresses four strategic priorities: (i) climate change, (ii)
biodiversity and ecosystem management (iii) waste management and pollution control and (iv)
environmental monitoring and governance.

SPREP assists its member countries by (i) coordinating regional input and providing technical and
legal advice for instance in conventions negotiations, and COPs participation; (ii) directly
implementing regional programmes and activities in pursuit of its strategic priorities, including
donor-funded programmes and projects, and (iii) directly responding to specific country requests for
assistance.

SPREP, in collaboration with other regional and international organizations, has also been
instrumental in setting up and supporting the operation of regional coordinating mechanisms that
bring together and link a broad range of stakeholders including funders, international and regional
NGOs, academic institutions and civil society groups. These coordinating mechanisms share a
common interest, to collectively strategize and coordinate their activities, and to share information,
resources and experiences. Two highly successful networks are the Pacific Islands Roundtable for
Nature Conservation and the Pacific Islands Climate Change Roundtable.

            of Vanuatu
Environmental Legal Framework

Vanuatu’s Constitution (revised 1988) holds that it is a fundamental duty of all ‘to protect the
Republic of Vanuatu and to safeguard the national wealth, resources and environment in the
interests of the present generation and of future generations.’ To implement this constitutional
provision, the Government is empowered to enact specific laws and create institutions to protect
and manage the environment.

The principal environmental legislation is the Environmental Management and Conservation Act No.
12 of 2002. The main parts of the Act deal with (i) administration; (ii) environmental impact
assessments; (iii) biodiversity and protected areas; and (iv) offenses under the Act. The Act provides
for a department to develop, implement, and coordinate the Government’s environmental policies
and programs and makes it mandatory to (i) prepare and publish a national state of environment
report at least once every ten years and (ii) maintain a publicly accessible environmental registry.
The Act provides for establishment of a biodiversity Advisory Council, and specifically covers the
issues of bio-prospecting and community conservation areas.

The Act also governs the management of POPs, with the Minister empowered to regulate (amongst
other things) the environmental effects associated with the importation and transportation of
hazardous substances, pests and weeds, waste management, and air and water pollution.

The Act bestows on the Director considerable powers including the power to directly appoint staff
from outside the Department, determine if a development application requires an Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) and the manner in which the EIA must be compiled, and to stop any
specified activity due to non-compliance with the terms under which its EIA was approved. This
discretionary authority has been a source of some controversy.

Vanuatu has also taken steps to address waste management and pollution. Since 1994, the Public
Health Act No. 22 of 1994 provides the basic requirements for sanitary systems for all dwellings in
rural and urban areas. A National Waste Management Strategy and Action Plan 2010-2015 is now in
place. The Pollution Control Bill and the Waste Management Bill were drafted and submitted to
Parliament in 201232 and are expected to be enacted before June 2013.33

Institutional Framework

This section provides an overview of the main government institutions that are responsible for
protecting the environment in Vanuatu.

        Department of Environmental Protection and Conservation (DEPC). Vanuatu’s environment
         agency, previously called the Vanuatu Environment Unit (VEU), was upgraded to become the
         Department of Environment Protection and Conservation (DEPC) in 2009. It is hosted under
         the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources and is responsible for the administration of the
         Environmental Management and Conservation Act 2002. The DEPC also leads the
         preparation of both the National Conservation Strategy and the National Biodiversity
         Strategy and Action Plan, and is involved in the development of the National Waste
         Management Strategy. It is the Operational Focal Point for international environmental
         conventions like the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), United Nations Framework
         Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), United Nations Convention to Combat
         Desertification (UNCCD), and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
         (CI TES), among others (SPREP-IWP 2004). However, as discussed in the next chapter, the
         DEPC’s capacity is still quite limited as a result of historical and ongoing challenges.

         The institutional instability of the past and lack of capacity effectively means progress on the
         implementation of legislation and obligations under international environmental treaties
         was very slow. To its credit, however, notwithstanding its limited capacity, the DEPC has

         been successful in other areas, notably in promoting and facilitating the establishment of
         Community Conservation Areas which total registered area has increased from 194 km 2 in
         2005 to 16,259 km2 in 2008.

         As DEPC is not well-resourced, the task of managing the environmental actions has taken on
         a multi-agency approach. For example, the climate change division is housed within the
         Ministry of Meteorology and Disaster Management. A number of agencies have
         responsibilities that are integral to the health of coastal environments,34 but the absence of
         policy leadership on integrated coastal management is likely to lead to sub-optimal
         management.

        Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction Unit. The Government of Vanuatu established
         a multi-sectoral Climate Change advisory committee in 1990 in the lead up to the Earth
         Summit of 1992 to coordinate national activities on climate change. This same committee
         continued until 2012 when it was changed to the National Advisory Board on Climate
         Change and Disaster Risk Reduction. With this change, the government established a
         centralised project management unit for climate change within the Department of
         Meteorology and Geo-Hazards. The Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction Unit
         (CCDRR) now has over 20 staff dealing with international conventions and policies,
         adaptation, mitigation, communications and corporate services.

         The CCDRR Unit work is managed through the National Advisory Board made up of
         Permanent Secretary and Director level personnel from the all the relevant Government
         Agencies impacted by climate change. Despite not having climate change legislation, the
         PMU’s work is guided by the Climate Change Policy Framework.

        Other responsible national agencies. Environmental management is also implemented
         through sector specific legislation (see Volume 2). In the land sector, the Land Lease Act
         (1983) and the Urban Land Act (1993) guide the operations of Vanuatu’s Land Use Planning
         Office. There are also many other land use policies formulated to ensure effective
         management of lands and related resources, such as the National Land Use Plan and Policy
         and the Provincial Land Use Plans and Strategies, Land Suitability Criteria, etc. Other laws
         that regulate the use of natural resources by other sectors are the: Mines and Minerals Act,
         Petroleum (Prospecting and Production) Act, Geothermal Energy Act, Forestry Act, Fisheries
         Act, Foreshore Development Act, the Pesticides Act, and others.

         The Department of Geology, Mines and Water Resources under the Ministry of Lands and
         Natural Resources administers the Geothermal Energy Act of 1987, which regulates the
         exploitation of geothermal energy, as well as the Petroleum (Exploration and Production)
         Act of 1993 which regulates the searching for and producing of petroleum on land. This
         includes the land beneath water, the seabed and the subsoil beneath the territorial seabed;
         and the seabed and the subsoil of the continental shelf or beneath the waters of the
         exclusive economic soil. The Ministry of Land and Natural Resources implements the Mines
         and Minerals Act (1986), which regulates the exploration and development of minerals and
         related matters through a licensing and permit system. Quarrying is the only current mining

  The DEPC, for instance, is responsible for biodiversity and environmental management through the 2003 Environmental
Management and Conservation Act, and the Vanuatu Fisheries Department (VFD) has responsibility for managing the
harvesting of marine resources, the 2005 Fisheries Management Act, No.: 55, and the 2008-2013 Aquaculture Development
Plan.

         activity but presence of gold on Santo and Malekula has been confirmed. There may be
         reserves of petroleum, although this is not yet proven.

National Environmental Policies and Strategies

Vanuatu does not have a National Sustainable Development Strategy. However, a National Priority
Action Agenda (PAA) includes sustainable development of Vanuatu’s forests and marine resources.
Vanuatu’s first national conservation strategy was prepared in 1993 (Environment Unit 1993), with
assistance from SPREP, AusAID, and IUCN. The highest priorities were identified as (i) improving
environmental education and awareness; (ii) improving legislation and law enforcement; (iii)
strengthening existing environment institutions; (iv) preserving natural resources and tabu places;
and (v) using resources more efficiently.

Some of the strategies identified in 1993 were implemented, while many others were not. Other
national strategies and plans have since been developed; including some that were developed under
GEF funded enabling activities.35

         3.3.6 – Role of GEF-Funded Interventions in the Development of
         National Laws and Policies
The extent to which GEF-funded interventions contributed to the development and strengthening of
the environmental legal framework in Vanuatu is partly evidenced in the explicit acknowledgement
of GEF support expressed in national planning documents and reports, where one of the outputs of
the GEF enabling activities were the production of these documents themselves. Acknowledgements

of GEF involvement are seen in the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP), National
Adaptation Plan of Action (NAPA), and the National Capacity Self Assessment (NCSA) Report.

GEF influence can also be inferred from the chronology of events, wherein GEF activities preceded
the ratification of conventions, enactment of national legislation, and adoption of national strategies
and plans on the other hand.36 For example, the sequence of events resulting in the adoption of the
NBSAP started with the ratification by Vanuatu of the CBD, the enactment of the CBD Ratification
Act by the Vanuatu Parliament, before the start of implementation of the NBSAP Enabling Activity of
which the NBSAP was produced. The development of the NAPA followed a similar sequence. Both
sequences are illustrated below in Figures 3-1 and 3-2.

In the case of the NAPA, two regional enabling activities (GEF 336 and 850) were implemented
before the NAPA with a focus on gathering information for NAPA formulation, such as the
compilation of greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories, identification and assessment of various options
for climate change mitigation and adaption, and the development of different scenarios of future
changes in climate and sea level.

The influence of GEF-funded interventions in strengthening the framework for the management of
persistent organic pollutants took a different track relative to that taken in the development of
NBSAP and NAPA, as illustrated in Figure 3-3. Where in the case of the former two plans, GEF
assistance followed Vanuatu’s ratification of the CBD and UNFCCC, in the case of the Stockholm
Convention, GEF intervened to prepare the groundwork for ratification and initial reporting
requirements (GEF 1942). Vanuatu’s subsequent ratification of the Convention paved the way for its

participation in the GEF-funded regional POPs project (GEF ID 4066)37, which is currently being
implemented. The Pollutions Bill and a Waste Management Bill – both dealing with aspects of
hazardous waste management and presently before Parliament for enactment – are not an intended
output of the GEF project. However, GEF activities helped raise the profile of hazardous waste
management at the time when the legislation was presented to Parliament. The two pieces of
legislation will also address some of Vanuatu’s obligations under the Stockholm Convention,
including obligations for appropriate legal and administrative measures under Article 3.

GEF’s influence in the development of environmental legislation in Vanuatu may also be seen not
only in the way the NBSAP called for and supported the development of the Environmental
Management and Conservation legislation, but also in setting in motion a process of stakeholder
consultation that generated discussion and brokered consensus on specific actions and provisions to
be considered in the drafting of the legislation. The NBSAP made nine specific recommendations on
issues for inclusion in the Environmental Management and Conservation Act:

           Controls on the introduction of living materials;

           Management regulations for designated terrestrial species including measures for size limits,
            closed seasons for birds, flying foxes, crabs and freshwater prawns;

           Establishment of an EIA process;

           Establishment of an Environment Trust Fund to fund biodiversity research and conservation
            work;

           Establishment of a legal mechanism to protect intellectual property rights of ni-Vanuatu with
            respect to their knowledge and use of biodiversity;

           Appropriate controls for the import and export of rare species;

           Appropriate controls for the importation and safe handling of living modified organisms;

The enacted legislation (Environmental Management and Conservation Act 2002) contained
provisions for four of the nine areas proposed for consideration. These are the (i) EIA (Part 3 sections
11 – 28); (ii) Bio-prospecting (Part 4; sections 29 – 34); (iii) LMOs (Part 6, Section 45(2)(a)(ii); and (iv)

   3.4 General Description of the GEF
The GEF provides funding to achieve global environmental benefits in biodiversity, climate change,
international waters, depletion of the ozone layer, POPs, and land degradation, according to their
respective international agreements. GEF activities are carried out through 10 Agencies: United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), World
Bank, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), United
Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), Asian Development Bank (ADB), African
Development Bank (AfDB), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).

GEF Agencies have direct access to funding through a memorandum of understanding with the GEF.
GEF support modalities include the following:

       Full-size projects, which have funding of more than US$1 million;

       Medium-size projects, which have funding of US$1 million or less;

       Enabling activities, intended to help countries meet their obligations under the various
        conventions for which the GEF serves as a financial mechanism; support for developing
        environmental policies, strategies, and action plans; and support for the formulation of
        NCSAs;

       Project preparation grants (PPGs; formerly known as project development facility [PDF]
        grants), which provide funding for the preparation and development of projects; and

       Small grants, which have funding of less than US$50,000, and are directed to NGOs and local
        organizations; small GEF grants are structured into the SGP administered by UNDP.

The GEF officially began with a two-year pilot phase from 1992 to 1994. This was followed by three
regular four-year replenishment periods: GEF-1 (1995–98), GEF-2 (1999–2002), GEF-3 (2003–06),
and GEF-4 (2006–10). In July 2010, GEF-5 was initiated; it continues through June 2014. Until and
including GEF-3 there were no country allocations, and eligible GEF member countries submitted
their requests to the various windows through the different GEF Agencies on a demand basis.

4. THE GEF VANUATU AND SPREP PORTFOLIO

This chapter presents an overview of GEF support to Vanuatu in terms of financial resources and
number of projects, type of project, GEF focal area, GEF Agency, and GEF phase. The GEF provided
US$218.2 million for projects in Vanuatu and the surrounding region. This includes US$17.9 million
for national projects, US$182.0 million for regional projects (US$63.1 million went to SPREP-
executed regional projects, and US$119.6 million was committed for Vanuatu regional projects not
under SPREP), and US$18.4 million for global projects. Additionally, Vanuatu received US$975,000
for Small Grants Programme projects. This chapter describes the project portfolio in further detail.

   4.1 National Projects in the GEF Vanuatu Portfolio
The GEF portfolio in Vanuatu includes 13 national projects, which received US$17.9 million in GEF
funding and US$70.0 million in cofinancing. Tables 4.1 – 4.3 summarize the national project portfolio
by project status, focal area, and project type.

Most of the national projects have been completed, and were financed by UNEP or UNDP. Five
projects are in the climate change focal area, five in biodiversity, one in persistent organic pollutants,
one in land degradation, and one in the multifocal area. Though eight of the 13 national projects are
enabling activities, these projects received only US$1.7 million of the total GEF support. Most of the
funding for national projects is for two climate change FSPs in the pipeline stage (78% of GEF
funding). In contrast with the completed projects which are mostly EAs, all of the pipeline projects
are FSPs or MSPs. Additionally, the only national projects that are in the pipeline or ongoing are
climate change projects, in contrast to the completed projects which are mostly in biodiversity.

      4.2 Regional Projects Involving Vanuatu
The GEF has committed US$182.7 million to projects in the SPREP region, which have also received
US$817.0 million in co-financing. These include 11 SPREP projects and 10 other regional projects in
which Vanuatu participates.38

Tables 4.4 – 4.7 summarize the regional project portfolio. The 11 SPREP regional projects received
US$63.1 million in GEF funding. Most of this funding has gone to projects in the climate change focal
area. Most of the SPREP projects are ongoing or completed, and only one is in the pipeline phase.
Additionally, most of these projects are executed by UNDP or UNEP, and are Full Sized Projects
(FSPs).

     Vanuatu participated in all but one SPREP-executed project (GEF ID 4023).
                                                                                                             35

GEF has also committed US$119.6 million for Vanuatu regional projects that are not under SPREP. All
of these projects are FSPs, and the majority of the funding has gone to projects in the multifocal
area, notably the project ‘Implementation of Global and Regional Oceanic Fisheries Conventions and
Related Instruments in the Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS)’ (GEF ID 4746), which
received US$45.6 million. Most of these projects are in the pipeline or ongoing.

There are differences between the SPREP-executed versus other regional projects: nine of the 11
SPREP projects are in the climate change or biodiversity focal area, while international water and
multifocal area projects play a greater role in the non-SPREP regional portfolio. Across both the
SPREP regional and Vanuatu regional projects, most of the GEF funding has gone to FSPs in the
multifocal area.

   4.3 Evolution of GEF Funding in the South Pacific Region
The GEF national portfolio in Vanuatu has evolved from GEF-1 to GEF-5, as shown in Figure 4.1. GEF
funding increased substantially in GEF-4 and GEF-5. The allocation of funding to different focal areas
has evolved. During GEF-1 and GEF-2, the only projects that received GEF funding were in the
biodiversity focal area. During GEF-3, GEF support for national projects expanded to encompass all
focal areas (except international waters). In contrast, during GEF-4 and GEF-5, only projects in the
climate change focal area received funding. Only one national project was funded in GEF-5,
‘Adaptation to Climate Change in the Coastal Zone in Vanuatu’ (GEF ID 5049). This is a full-sized
climate change project under UNDP, and it received the greatest amount of funding among all the
national projects (US$8.3 million).

Figure 4.1

GEF Funding for National Projects by Focal Areas across GEF Phases




GEF funding for regional projects (SPREP and other executing agencies) over time is shown in Figure
4.2. There does not appear to be a clear trend in the amount of regional funding over time, except
for the surge in GEF funding during in the multifocal area during GEF-4. The regional project portfolio
appears to be much more diverse than the national portfolio, with projects spanning the focal areas
and increasing in diversity over time. The GEF funded one biodiversity project in the pilot phase and
one climate change project in GEF-1. During GEF-2 and GEF-3, the GEF funded projects in two focal
areas: international waters and climate change. Climate change projects in GEF-3 received much
greater funding than climate change projects funded under GEF-2, while international waters
received slightly less. GEF-4 and GEF-5 showed much greater diversity in projects. During GEF-4, two
projects were funded in biodiversity, two in climate change, one in international waters, three in the
multifocal area, and one in persistent organic pollutants. In GEF-5, GEF funded one project in
biodiversity, one in climate change, one in international waters, and one in persistent organic
pollutants. However, the GEF has not funded any regional projects in land degradation.

   4.4 Implementation Status of National and Regional Projects
Of the 13 Vanuatu national projects supported by the GEF, only one – ‘National Communications
Programme for Climate Change: 2nd National Communication to UNFCCC,’ an enabling activity – is
currently under implementation. All other national enabling activities have been completed. Two
FSPs and one MSP are in the pipeline; all three are in the climate change focal area. Among the
SPREP and other regional projects, nine are ongoing, six are in the pipeline, and six have been
completed. Most of the ongoing regional projects are in the climate change and biodiversity focal
areas. The regional pipeline includes projects in a diverse range of focal areas, including persistent
organic pollutants, climate change, international waters, and the multifocal area.

   4.5 National and Regional Allocations by GEF Agency
Figure 4.3 presents the evolution of GEF support to Vanuatu national projects by Agency across the
different GEF replenishment periods. GEF national projects have been implemented by UNDP, UNEP,
and the World Bank.

About 57% of GEF funding for national projects in Vanuatu has gone to UNDP projects, and the
majority of this funding has been for projects in the climate change focal area. UNDP projects
received funding in GEF-3 and GEF-5.

World Bank projects have received about 37% of the GEF support for national projects, and all of this
funding has been dedicated to two projects in the climate change focal area, both of which were
funded in GEF-4.

                                                                                                      39

About 6% of the GEF support has gone to projects implemented by UNEP, in the biodiversity,
persistent organic pollutants, and multifocal areas. Four of the six UNEP projects are in the
biodiversity focal area, and the UNEP projects have been financed during GEF-1, GEF-2, and GEF-3.

Figure 4.4 presents GEF support to regional projects (SPREP and other executing agencies) by GEF
Agency and focal area across GEF replenishment periods. The regional projects have been
implemented by the World Bank, UNDP, UNEP, FAO, and ADB. Four of the regional projects have
been implemented by multiple agencies, for example, the Coral Triangle Initiative (GEF ID 3647) is
being implemented by ADB, UNDP, FAO, and the World Bank. Multi-agency projects appear to have
received the greatest amount of funding, but this was mostly for a single project (GEF ID 3647) being
implemented by ADB, UNDP, FAO, and the World Bank.

5. EFFECTIVENESS, RESULTS, AND SUSTAINABILITY OF
GEF SUPPORT TO VANUATU AND THE SOUTH PACIFIC
GEF support in Vanuatu has covered the full range of GEF focal areas for which the country has been
eligible through national projects and through regionally implemented projects. The results of these
activities are assessed in this chapter. A focal area approach is adopted, which provides a clear
delineation between projects, the accumulation of results from outputs towards long-term impacts,
and global environmental benefits. Where trends are discernible within and across focal areas, these
are discussed and commented on. The chapter concludes with an assessment of institutional and
other forms of capacity development, and the mainstreaming, replication, and up-scaling of project-
level impacts.

Within each focal area, the GEF has supported three broad categories of interventions. The first
(EAs) is that of foundational capacity building, supporting and strengthening Vanuatu’s capacity to
fulfil its national obligations under various multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs). These are
targeted activities such as national communications to various Convention secretariats and the
preparation of national plans such as NBSAP, NAPA, and NAP. The output of these activities has been
important because it has allowed Vanuatu to progress towards development and implementation of
further MSPs and FSPs, which have the potential to deliver tangible results on the ground. Beyond
these, the EAs raised awareness of environmental issues and strengthened capacities within the
Government of Vanuatu. Part of this capacity includes the gathering of baseline information and the
adoption of a systematic and science-based approach to environmental planning, whose utility
extends well beyond the immediate needs of the EAs’ intended outputs. Equally important, the EAs
encouraged and facilitated the use of inclusive consultative processes and dialogue among multiple
stakeholders that hitherto were not regularly involved in the national and sector level planning
processes, including civil society groups and local community representatives. These consultative
processes have since been effectively mainstreamed in most if not all levels of planning in the
country. This is an important achievement in Vanuatu’s transition to sustainable development.

The second category of intervention has been that of pilot/demonstration projects. The earliest
opportunities were provided by the SPREP-implemented South Pacific Biodiversity Conservation
Project (SPBCP) and the International Waters Project (IWP) activities during GEF 1. The influence of
both projects, which promoted context-specific community-based approaches to biodiversity
conservation and water catchment management on customary owned land, can be seen in modified
forms in the LCI (GEF 1682) and in the community-based activities of the Vanuatu Small Grants
Program (SGP). In GEF 2 and 3, the completed PIREP and the ongoing PIGGAREP respectively
promoted renewable energy as part of climate change mitigation and adaptation, with the latter
going one step beyond demonstration by providing small-scale investment in renewable energy
generation with funding from the Government of Italy.

The third category of GEF intervention is investment projects. Vanuatu is just entering this phase
with three projects (two FSPs and one MSP) in the pipeline in the climate change focal area. The
progression from EAs to demonstration/pilots to investment interventions shows the continuing
growth and maturing of the GEF portfolio, most notably in the climate change focal area. This
emphasis is consistent with the Vanuatu Priority Action Agenda’s (PAA) focus on the development of
risk reduction and disaster management programs.

     5.1 Biodiversity
The GEF-funded EAs in biodiversity were satisfactorily completed with intended outputs produced.
These included: the NBSAP, the First National Report to the CBD, setup of the Clearing House
Mechanism, completion of the assessment of capacity-building needs for biodiversity and
participation in the CHM, and the National Biosafety Framework (NBF). Both the NBSAP and the NBF
were formally approved by the Government of Vanuatu. The impact of the NBSAP, in particular, has
been significant. As discussed in the analysis of the Environmental Legal Framework, NBSAP’s
influence is seen in the formulation of the Environmental Protection and Management Act 2006 and
its continuing use as the framework and roadmap for biodiversity action in the country. Based on the
NBSAP recommendation and SPBCP experience, the DEPC (formerly the Vanuatu Environment Unit
or VEU) developed the LCI (MSP) proposal, which was funded and implemented during GEF 3.

The LCI project, an MSP titled ‘Facilitating and Strengthening the Conservation Initiatives of
Traditional Landowners and their Communities to Achieve Biodiversity Conservation Objectives,’ was
implemented over a five-year period from 2005 to 2010. As documented in the ROtI (Volume II), the
project supported traditional leaders and communities initially in 12 sites (three in Tanna, three in
Santo, and six in Gaua), wherein targeted species and habitats were protected or sustainably
managed using traditional taboos. Most participating communities in the LCI, according to reports,
made progress in the following areas: (i) acquiring a strong sense of community pride in their
endemic and native species and habitats and a strong interest in their protection, (ii) establishing
local committees trained in monitoring and who were already enthused and motivated by positive
changes in the populations and improved conditions of targeted species and habitats observed
within taboo areas, and (iii) growing interest from the provincial governments of Santo, Tanna, and
Gaua to extend support to the conservation areas.40

Project reports noted increases in species populations within taboo areas including fish, crabs,
freshwater prawns, and birds41 at the 12 initial sites in the early years of project implementation.
The project also targeted a 50% increase in additional sites by the end of the project. After three
years, some 30 new sites were using traditional taboos in Gaua, while Tanna and Santo have three
new sites each. Unfortunately, environmental monitoring data for the latter part of the LCI were not
analysed, due to the premature departure of the M&E specialist. Consequently, other than
anecdotal and qualitative reports of increases in populations of several marine and bird species
within taboo areas, the full extent of the project’s impact could not be ascertained.

The LCI sustained and expanded on existing in-country efforts, including collaborations with the
Vanuatu Culture Centre on documenting and protecting traditional knowledge; support for the Wan
Small Bag’s environmental awareness programs; the Forestry and Fisheries Departments’ work on
conservation and sustainable harvesting of biodiversity resources; Reef Check Vanuatu’s monitoring
training for local communities; and the Foundation of the Peoples of the South Pacific (FSPI) project
on community governance for sustainable forestry management and gardening. These organizations
and stakeholders became partners in LCI implementation, extending their activities and sharing
technical expertise to benefit LCI-targeted communities and LCI objectives.

Post-project sustainability of the LCI is at best mixed. The ROtI found that most LCI-initiated sites
were left unsupported after the closure of LCI, with DEPC lacking the budgetary resources to absorb

conservation areas, and to promote its replication to other communities.

LCI project staff or incorporate LCI activities into its work program. However, there are a few positive
exceptions. Following the completion of the project, DEPC assisted two LCI communities in Tanna to
prepare SGP funding proposals that secured funding for coconut crab monitoring and marine
protected area support. DEPC was also instrumental in nominating Lake Letes as a World Heritage
Site (it has since been put on the Tentative List) and in promoting the inclusion of the Gaua sites
(Lake Letes and upland forests) in the GEF PAS project on Forest Protected Areas and Conservation.

Of the SPREP-executed biodiversity projects, Vanuatu was one of the 12 SPREP Pacific Islands
member countries that participated in the South Pacific Biodiversity Conservation Project (SBPCP),
which was implemented from 1994 until 2001. With SPBCP support, the Vatthe Conservation Area in
Santo was established to demonstrate a community-based conservation area (CBCA) approach that
sought to combine conservation and sustainable resource use, in this case using a mix of traditional
and modern management tools, and ecotourism. The Vatthe Conservation Area brought under
conservation management 2,720 ha of native forests and a significant diversity of endemic flora and
fauna species. An additional 16 conservation areas (CAs) were established in other participating PICs.

The Vatthe Conservation Area Project (CAP) established under the SPBCP has continued successfully
12 years after the end of SPBCP support (2001), with the level of activities fluctuating depending on
available resources and funding. The fundamental requisite for sustainability – the landowning
communities’ continuing interest and commitment to the conservation of the areas’ biodiversity –
remains strong. The critical contributing factor to its longevity to date is the availability of technical
support and funding for its key activities, from outside partners. For instance, collaborations
fostered during SPBCP with the Royal Forests and Birds Society of New Zealand in support of
ecotourism continue. An annual tour of the Vatthe CAP by eco-tourists generates income for the
community, and provides free labour and expertise for specific project activities. The Espiritu Santos
Tourism Association and the Vanuatu Bungalow Association and Island Safaris continue to promote
the area on their websites as a tourist destination, with several websites marketing hotels in Santos
as ‘Hotels near the Vatthe Conservation Area.’ In 2004, DEPC and the Vanuatu National Museum
nominated the Vatthe Conservation Area to UNESCO for consideration as a World Heritage Site,
based on natural criteria, and the site has since been included in UNESCO’s Tentative List. In the
same year, Conservation International (CI) contributed US$20,000 to compensate a local
landowner42 and in doing so, help resolved a major land ownership dispute that threatened the
project. In 2010, Forest and Birds (NZ) and local group Eco-Livelihood Development Associates (EDA)
collaborated to secure a GEF SGP grant (US$50,000) to assist with the communities’ efforts to
control the Merremia peltata vine that is the major threat to the areas’ native forest.

At the regional level, GEF progress reports in 2001 observed that the sustainability of the sites had
not yet been secured ‘… with 7 CAs very likely to be sustainable beyond the period of SPBCP funding
and a further 7 sites may possibly be sustainable, while 3 are considered unlikely.’43 The Final Project
Evaluation Report (Baines et al, 2002) assessed the sustainability of all 17 CAPs using an eight-point
system, with ‘8’ the most likely to be sustainable and ‘0’ being unsustainable. The results are shown
in Table 5.1 below. This is compared to status updates for each CA based on a range of information
sources including information from various internet websites, and from national environmental
agencies. The updates show that two CAs no longer exists (Komarindi and Uafato – due to local
ethnic unrest and internal conflict respectively), two have no recent information available (Kiritimati

The final independent GEF evaluation of SPBCP was highly critical of aspects of the project,
concluding that overall the project did not achieve global environmental objectives, largely due to
design and implementation flaws. 44 The evaluation also stated that SPBCP contributed little to the
conservation of the biological resources that support rural communities in the region. However,
GEF’s own review of the independent evaluation report observed that SPBCP deserved more credit
given its achievements. 45 Twelve years on, 12 of the 17 areas the project established or supported
continue to provide protection and/or sustainable management for large areas of the region’s
globally significant biodiversity.

      5.2 Climate Change
GEF funded two nationally-executed climate change EAs in Vanuatu. There are also two FSPs and
one MSP in the pipeline. Vanuatu also participated in five SPREP-executed regional climate change
projects, including: three EAs (refer to Table 4.2), an MSP (GEF 1058 – PIREP), and an FSP (GEF 2699
PIGGARREP). Vanuatu has also received support for climate change projects under the SGP.

The first nationally-executed EA (GEF 1970) produced the National Adaptation Plan of Action (NAPA)
in 2007, a country-wide plan identifying immediate and urgent project-based adaptation activities in
priority sectors, to address present and future adverse effects of climate change, including extreme
weather events. This project built on results from earlier regional activities, in particular PICCAP
Phases 1 and 2. The full-size climate change projects presently in the pipeline were identified from
the NAPA which is presently being updated. The second climate change EA – the National
Communications Programme for Climate Change, Second National Communication to UNFCCC – is in
progress.

Vanuatu’s participation in the regionally executed PICCAP I and II significantly enhanced its
understanding and capacity in planning for climate change adaptation. PICCAP supported national
inventories for greenhouse gas sources and sinks, the identification of mitigation options for climate
change and sea level rise, as well as areas of vulnerability to climate change and sea level rise, and
the development of adaptation options and national implementation plans. PICCAP also supported
the preparation of Vanuatu’s Initial National Communication for UNFCCC, which was submitted in
October 1999.

Vanuatu is also benefitting from its participation in the PIREP (GEF 1058) and the PIGGAREP (GEF
2699). PIREP was completed satisfactorily in September 2006. As discussed in the ROtI, the project
raised awareness and understanding of the possible role of and potential for renewable energy (RE)
in the region and identified barriers hindering the widespread adoption of RE. PIREP-funded national
assessments also generated valuable baseline information for national energy policy making and
planning; the same information contributed to the development of the GEF PIGGAREP project
proposal that also includes Vanuatu, and which is currently under implementation. Under PIGGAREP,
Vanuatu’s potential for wind and hydro power generation is being studied – including the Talise
hydro and the Myno Island hydro studies, the latter supported by IUCN.

Vanuatu also participated in two SPREP-implemented climate change EAs (PICCAP 1, PICCAP 2), an
MSP (i.e., PIREP), and two FSPs (PIGGAREP and PACC). The PICCAP was designed to strengthen the
capacities of participating countries to meet reporting commitments under the UNFCCC. On
completion of PICCAP I and II, 10 PICs had completed greenhouse gas inventories and Vulnerability
Assessments, nine countries had completed and submitted their Initial National Communications to
the UNFCCC, and six countries had completed their national implementation strategies. PICCAP also
made a significant contribution to building capacity in participating countries, including Vanuatu, in
the methodologies for inventorying greenhouse gas sources and sinks, and climate change
vulnerability and adaptation assessment. The latter involved representatives from 12 participating
countries on a six-month course at the International Global Change Institute at the University of
Waikato, New Zealand. These trainings not only benefitted the targeted 10 PICs, but also Niue, PNG,
Tonga, and Palau.46 All four countries have since submitted national communications.

The benefits of the regionally-implemented PIREP for the other 14 participating countries are similar
to those in Vanuatu. As discussed in the RoTI (Volume II), PIREP strengthened the capacity of all 15
participating PICs by producing baseline studies that have since been widely used for other planning
purposes, such as in the development of national energy policies (as in the case of Tonga, Cook
Islands, and Samoa), the new World Bank/GEF-supported Sustainable Energy Financing Program
(SEFP) which will be implemented in five PICs (Fiji, PNG, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, and
Vanuatu), and the UNDP/GEF MSP proposals ADMIRE (Marshall Islands) and SEDREA (Palau).
According to stakeholders consulted, the awareness and knowledge of RE technologies, barriers and
capacity needs identified by PIREP have been the catalyst and the major source of information for
the development of sector policies that have since taken place in many PICs, which have made
further progress with support from PIGGAREP.

PIGGAREP commenced implementation in 2007 and is scheduled for completion at the end of 2013.
Covering 11 PICs, its purpose is to reduce the growth of GHG emissions from fossil fuel use in the
PICs through the removal of the barriers to the widespread and cost-effective use of feasible RE
technologies. The full extent of its effectiveness in delivering on its designed outcomes will not be
known until a final evaluation is completed. So far, UNDP annual progress reports noted satisfactory
progress in the early stages of project implementation, but disruptions stemming from the
departure of the first Project Coordinator stalled progress while recruitment for a replacement
coordinator took over a year. A recent UNDP progress report (UNDP, 2011) noted a number of
completed outputs at the national and regional levels including: i) the establishment of Sustainable
Energy Industry Association of the Pacific Islands (SIEAPI); ii) preparation and endorsement of a new
Pacific Regional Energy Framework (including a policy as well as strategic action plan); iii) close
partnership established with the US$66 million Japanese-funded Pacific Environment Community
Fund (PECF) including required preparatory work for the US$4 million Samoa grid-connected PV
project and the US$1 million Rakahanga mini-grid PV project in Cook Island designed and agreed to
be funded by PIGGAREP; and iv) wind resource monitoring planned and initiated in Vanuatu and the
Solomon Islands.

PIGGAREP is in the late stages of implementation and questions of post-project sustainability are at
best speculative at this stage. However, a number of issues relevant to discussions of sustainability
are intimated in the MTR. According to the MTR, the ongoing reliance over many years on donor
funding for energy projects in PICs has led to a lack of knowledge amongst RE advocates, politicians,
decision makers, donors and their advisors, and the public in PICs, of the true cost of energy supply
(whether fossil fuel-based and/or renewable) in urban, rural and remote island PIC settings. The
MTR also noted that the true cost of energy supply is still not widely known, and the real commercial
and post-project sustainability lessons are still not being learned from the many previous (often
unsuccessful) RE demonstrations and projects undertaken to date in PICs. The lack of capacity in-
country is observed by SPREP to be another major hindrance to project sustainability in all focal
areas including climate change.

PIGGAREP is still being implemented and there are issues pertaining to the lack of quantitative
reporting in country reports. It is therefore difficult to report on how far the project has progressed
in meeting its targets. Estimates in a recent progress report (APR, 2010) indicated that emissions
avoided since the start of the project were 12,509 and 12,695 Mt of CO2 in 2009 and 2010,
respectively; however, it is not clear from the available information how this volume of emissions
avoided relates to the stated target of 30% reduction by 2015.

The other major climate change intervention, the PACC, is an FSP working to help 13 countries
develop resilience to climate change in three areas: food production and food security,
coastal management capacity, and water resource management.47 The PACC commenced
implementation in 2009 and was scheduled for completion in 2012, but is now likely to be
completed in 2013. The latest report available for this evaluation (APR, 2011) indicates that PACC is
on track to produce tangible adaptation benefits for participating countries, primarily through
Component 2, which includes implementation of pilot adaptation measures in coastal management,
agricultural management, and water management. So far, PACC has been effective in strengthening
national coordinating mechanisms and building national capacities in adaptation planning, climate
change assessments, vulnerability identification and selection of adaptation options, the formulation
of policy options using agreed national and sectoral policy frameworks, and the analysis of existing
policies for mainstreaming climate change adaptation measures. However, concerns have been
raised about persistent operational bottlenecks. According to the Annual Progress Report, the
bottlenecks are due to the very complex project structure, which involves 13 national projects
through NEX-type arrangements between SPREP and countries and a set of regionally-executed
activities by the Regional Project Management Unit (RPMU) as well as the capacity of national
coordinators to produce quality reports on a timely basis.

An MTR for PACC was scheduled for July – October 2012, but the MTR is not in the project file.
However, country progress reports presented in the 2012 Multipartite Review in Nauru (August
2012) provide some insights into issues and challenges that have implications for post-project
sustainability. These include: (i) the lack of sectoral integration of climate change concerns into
policies and programmes (Cook Islands); (ii) the sustainability of increasing adaptive capacity (Cook
Islands); (iii) sustaining the support of communities post project (Samoa); (iv) PACC working in
isolation of other players (Fiji); (v) the lack of coordination among agencies with roles to play in
climate change adaptation and disaster risk management (Fiji, Palau, FSM (between states), Republic
of the Marshall Islands, and Tuvalu); (vi) the lack of in-country capacity (Niue, Tuvalu); and (vii) the
lack of institutional support (PNG). Each country report identified actions for addressing these
challenges, but with limited time remaining to the end of the PACC, the possible impact of these
challenges on the sustainability of the project’s outcomes is magnified.

     5.3 Land Degradation
GEF funded one national land degradation project in Vanuatu (GEF 3502) during GEF 3. The project is
an MSP titled ‘LDC/SIDS Portfolio Project: Capacity Building and Mainstreaming for Sustainable Land
Management in Vanuatu.’ Implementation commenced in April 2008 and was scheduled for
completion in April 2012. There were no SPREP-implemented land degradation initiatives.

The GEF 3502 was intended to improve the system of land administration and decision-making and
ensure that the Government of Vanuatu at the highest level considers the long-term environmental
health of land resources and the adverse effects of land degradation when making economic and
development decisions. It was intended to build capacity for sustainable land management (SLM)
horizontally across sectors, and vertically from the individual landowner to community leaders to
provincial and national governments. The targeted outcomes were to (i) produce a National Action
Plan for Combating Land Degradation; (ii) mainstream sustainable land management in national

Federated States of Micronesia, Samoa, Tokelau and Vanuatu are developing coastal management capacity; and Nauru,

                                                                                                                    48

planning and farm management techniques; (iii) develop capacities for sustainable land
management; and (iv) formulate a Medium Term Investment Plan.

The project’s status is ‘incomplete’ to date although it was scheduled for completion in April 2012.
Reports and information gleaned from stakeholder consultations and former project staff indicate
that three of the four project outcomes have been completed satisfactorily. These outcomes are: (i)
completion of CCD National Action Plan (NAP) for Combating Land Degradation; (ii) mainstreaming
SLM; and (iii) capacities developed for sustainable land management. The fourth outcome – Medium
Term Investment Plan – remains outstanding. According to stakeholders consulted, continuing
delays in funding from the UNCCD Secretariat have constrained the ability of project proponents to
meet the last objective. According to DEPC, these delays result from procedural arrangements
governing the UNCCD Secretariat’s disbursement of funds, wherein funds cannot be disbursed to
requesting parties until a minimum of 75 requests for grants from parties/countries have been
received. Vanuatu’s request was submitted in 2011.

According to the former Project Coordinator, the NAP has been approved formally by the
Government and has been transmitted to the UNCCD Secretariat. The key feature of the NAP is a
matrix of proposed actions for integrating SLM principles into national and sector-level plans. The
actions can be stand-alone projects or sector programs. For each action, the NAP identifies the lead
agency and partners for implementation and the approximate duration. GEF Agencies identified
include Departments of Land, Forestry, Agriculture, Environment, Tourism, Planning and Finance,
Water Resources and Meteorology.

With the exception of the NAP, completion reports for other project outcomes cannot be validated.
Similarly, the assessment of sustainability is severely constrained by the lack of information to verify
and confirm the limited anecdotal information received from stakeholders consulted. No written
progress reports were received, and because it is still incomplete, no GEF end-of-project evaluation
has been conducted.

   5.4 Persistent Organic Pollutants
GEF has funded two active or completed projects in the POPs focal area, one a national EA (GEF
1942) during GEF 3, and the second a recently launched (GEF 5) full-sized regional project (GEF
4066). The FSP is entering its first year of implementation; hence this evaluation focuses on the EA.

The EA – ‘POPS Enabling Activities for the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants
(POPs): National Implementation Plan for Vanuatu’ (GEF 1942) – was designed to: (i) prepare the
groundwork for ratification and implementation of the Convention in Vanuatu; (ii) assist Vanuatu in
meeting its reporting and other obligations under the Convention; and (iii) strengthen Vanuatu’s
national capacity to manage POPs and chemicals. The expected outcomes were: (i) assessment and
strengthening of national capacity to implement the Stockholm Convention; (ii) preliminary
inventories of POPs; (iii) National Implementation Plan, including specific Action Plans and strategies
required under Articles 5 and 6; (iv) strengthened POPs management infrastructure and raised
public awareness on POPs; and (v) capacity to meet reporting obligations under the Stockholm
Convention. The project is on record to have been implemented from April 2003 to 31 May 2005.
However, no standard progress reports were received. According to stakeholders consulted, a
National Implementation Plan (NIP) was developed but is still in draft form. The Stockholm
Convention’s official website noted the status of the Vanuatu NIP as ‘transmission pending’ as of
September 2013. No copy of the draft NIP was available and there is no information as to the status
of other expected outcomes.
                                                                                                       49

The GEF-funded EA appears to have overlapped with an AusAID-funded and SPREP-implemented
regional initiative called ‘POPs in PICs Project,’ which Vanuatu also participated in during the same
period. The intended ‘POPs in PICs’ outputs are similar to the GEF intervention, including compiling
an inventory of POPs and developing a plan for its containment, collection and removal, and
management of contaminated sites. The ‘POPs in PICs’ project completed the Vanuatu POPs Country
Plan and a detailed inventory of POPs and pesticides. However, these outputs seem to be
attributable to the AusAID project rather than GEF 1942.

     5.5 International Waters
The GEF-funded Strategic Action Plan for International Waters Project (SAP-IWP) was comprised of
two components: the Oceanic Fisheries Management (OFM) component and the Integrated Coastal
and Watershed Management (ICWM) component. The Secretariat for the Pacific Commission (SPC)
and Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) implemented the OFM, which began in February 2000, in which 14
PICs participated,48 while SPREP implemented the ICWM. The OFM component was officially closed
in January 2005, while the record indicates that the ICWM component continued on to 2006
(however, no final project evaluation report was received). This evaluation focuses on the SPREP-
implemented ICWM component.

In the absence of a final project evaluation report, the following assessment is based largely on
information from the UNDP APR/PIR for 2006 and consultations with project stakeholders. The
UNDP (2006) reported that all project activities were making good progress towards the
achievement of IWP outcomes, albeit with a two-year extension in project duration. Momentum in
implementation had picked up in the final year of the project, under new management, which the
UNDP Regional Technical Adviser noted to be ‘refreshingly committed to building sustainability,
replication and where appropriate, achieving more meaningful scale’ (ibid., p. 11).

Overall, the IWP generated an impressive amount of baseline data with which communities,
governments and GEF Agencies can effectively plan and implement future IWP-related projects and
programmes. This information was obtained through a number of project activities including:
community situation analysis, root cause (of environmental concerns) analysis, stakeholder analysis,
socioeconomic baseline assessment, resource/ecological assessments, economic valuation, and
solution identification exercises. While the national projects aimed at protecting water catchment
areas, IWP also helped to address land degradation issues such as deforestation and soil erosion,
which contribute to the pollution of rivers from which many island people draw their drinking water.
Raising awareness about the impacts of land clearing on drinking water and the coastal waters
contributed not only to the protection of freshwater supplies, but also to the conservation of
important biodiversity that would have been lost through land clearing operations. Moreover, some
countries have adopted positive changes in their sectoral policies, due in part to the legal and
technical support provided by the project.

The last UNDP report (UNDP 2006 APR/PIR) intimated that sustainability for country-level activities
depended largely on the willingness of the national governments to absorb the activities into
national programs. In the final year of implementation (2006), the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU)
was working closely with countries to develop sustainability strategies that would identify activities
that could be easily integrated into national agencies’ work plans, and other strategies and plans
that would require support from other funders. The report and consultations found that Cook

Islands, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Solomon Islands, PNG, and FSM had indicated their willingness to absorb
IWP activities and staff. Some partnerships for funding IWP activities (ICWM component) at the
national level were secured during the project for a limited number of countries (Fiji, Tonga,
Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu (UNDP, 2005).49 Overall, however, finding implementation and
funding partners (e.g., other national organizations and bilateral donors) has been very difficult for
participating PICs. Without this support, project activities may not be sustained.

While individual PICs have faced challenges finding partners and funding, SPREP has reportedly been
successful in integrating parts of the IWP into its own programs, most notably in waste water
management (UNDP, 2006). SPREP has also been disseminating lessons from the project learned
through various media and stakeholder forums (ibid.).

     5.6 Multifocal
GEF funded only one national EA in the multifocal area. This activity – GEF 1914 – ‘National Capacity
Needs Self Assessment (NCSA) for Global Environmental Management’ – was approved during GEF 3
with UNEP as the GEF Agency. Project implementation started in June 2004. The UNEP website listed
the project as ‘ongoing’, suggesting the absence of proper project closure including a final project
evaluation and financial acquittal reports.

The project produced two main outputs: the National Capacity Needs Action Plan, and the
stocktaking assessment on the capacity needs of the CBD – The Final Report – Stock Take and
Thematic Assessment on the Convention of Biological Diversity.50 It also set up the NCSA Steering
Committee and the Technical Advisory Group that assisted and oversaw project implementation.
However, the extent to which the Action Plan has been implemented appears limited at best.
According to the Vanuatu Third National Report to the CBD (2006), the NCSA had not yet
implemented any concrete actions (p.168). A 2009 SPREP assessment51 of institutional capacity in
Melanesian Countries to effectively respond to climate change, made use of its findings and
recommendations but made no comment as to any NCSA-implemented activities.

Vanuatu is participating in one active regional multifocal project: GEF 3591 – ‘Strengthening Coastal
and Marine Resources Management in the Coral Triangle of the Pacific.’ The project, which is being
implemented by ADB, is providing technical assistance to five Pacific countries (PNG, Fiji, Solomons,
Timor-Leste, and Vanuatu) to strengthen the resilience of their coastal and marine ecosystems. In
Vanuatu, activities will focus on helping the Department of Environment, Ministry of Lands and
Natural Resources to develop planning in coastal communities on integrated coastal resource
management and coastal fisheries management.52 The project is ongoing, and no project
implementation reports have been received. The website also does not provide information about
outcomes achieved in Vanuatu. Besides this project, two other regional multifocal projects are in the
pipeline: GEF 3647 – ‘Coral Triangle Initiative Program,’ and GEF 3420 – ‘Pacific Alliance for
Sustainability.’

        5.7 Institutional Sustainability and Capacity Development
The lack of capacity in managing GEF interventions in all focal areas is an all-pervasive constraint
inhibiting effective project implementation in Vanuatu and throughout the Pacific Islands region.
Capacity constraints affect all stages of the project cycle. Hardly any GEF interventions commence on
time due to delays in recruiting project staff or local consultants. In almost all cases, situation
analyses in project documents identify the lack of capacities, and project designs include sizable
investments of project resources in capacity building. A common source of disruption to project
implementation is when project staff depart prematurely, oftentimes to another donor-funded
intervention. Finally, sustaining outcomes after projects end has been challenging, due largely to
human and financial capacity constraints. The persistence of capacity limitations over time and
across all GEF focal areas raises a fundamental concern about limited absorptive capacity in Vanuatu
and the region.

GEF projects have attempted to address capacity issues across all major focal areas, as discussed in
the remainder of this section.

Biodiversity

The full range of GEF-supported capacity strengthening measures in the biodiversity focal area is
diverse. Support includes: physical assets and office equipment; personnel; multi-stakeholder
mechanisms for project coordination; and support for participation in regional and international
meetings.

In LCI and SPBCP, capacity building efforts focused on the project field staff, local resource owners,
and communities to ensure that project outcomes would be sustained. Capacity building involved
transferring skills, building facilities, fostering a deeper understanding of why conservation and
sustainable use is necessary, and building community pride in the uniqueness of their biodiversity.
Planning engaged diverse segments of the community – leaders, women, and youth – and
prioritisation and decision-making were based on consensus. SPBCP also invested heavily in
developing skills in alternative income-generating activities, such as ecotourism in Vatthe, and
developing links and networks with other local tourism operators. Several SPBCP-funded regional
workshops brought together CA Support Officers (CASOs) for training, consultations, and to share
experiences and lessons learned.53 In other cases, groups of community leaders from one
country/conservation area project were funded to travel to other countries to observe and share
experiences. Investments in community-level training are paying dividends with the continued
longevity demonstrated by the 12 SPBCP conservation area projects in Vanuatu and throughout the
region.

SPBCP also played a major role in starting the Pacific Islands Community Based Conservation Course
(PCCC) in collaboration with the University of the South Pacific (USP) and ICPL. The course offers
interested students and conservation practitioners formal training in community-based conservation
area management. SPREP, USP, and ICPL have since consolidated this initiative, and the course is
now a core requirement for the Postgraduate Diploma in Sustainable Islands and Oceans
Development offered by USP. The initiative transcends the immediate needs of SPBCP, but is highly
significant in terms of addressing the more fundamental issue of enlarging Vanuatu and the Pacific
region’s absorptive capacity in biodiversity conservation.

53
  However, the SPBCP Final Evaluation noted that training and capacity building were heavily concentrated on the CASOs,
with not enough involvement of government agencies and other stakeholders.
                                                                                                                     52

Unfortunately, the DEPC’s limited capacity continues to affect Vanuatu’s ability to fully meet its
requirements under the CBD. The severely limited capacity of DEPC was highlighted in the National
Capacity Self Assessment (NCSA, 2006) report, which noted that DEPC (which was then still the VEU)
lacked capacity in terms of finance, human resources, information and necessary equipment.
According to the Director of DEPC, the local budget allocation of US$150,000 (which covers both
salaries and operating costs) has remained unchanged over the last three years. Five project-funded
staff officers comprise 70% of DEPC’s biodiversity conservation management staff, and the
sustainability of this capacity is uncertain once projects end.

Climate Change

Institutional capacity development in climate change adaptation and mitigation, and in RE
mobilization and development are important aims of past and current GEF-funded interventions
such as PICCAP, PIREP, PIGGAREP, and PACC. The following discussion reviews and assesses the
overall contributions of these initiatives to the development of country and regional capacities and
institutional sustainability in climate change.

The earliest interventions – PICCAP I and II – assisted 10 PICs that signed and ratified the UNFCCC
with their reporting, training, and capacity building under the convention. In Cook Islands, Federated
States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Republic of Republic of Marshall Islands, Nauru, Samoa, Solomon
Islands, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu, PICCAPP set up Climate Change Country Teams and Climate Change
Country Coordinators for the following tasks: (i) creating inventories of sources and sinks of
greenhouse gases; (ii) identifying and evaluating mitigation options to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions; (iii) assessing vulnerabilities to climate change; (iv) developing adaptation options; and (v)
developing national implementation strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change over
the long term. Eight countries completed and submitted initial National Communications during the
project to coincide with COP 5.

PIREP produced national assessment reports on RE for 14 participating countries and Tokelau, a
regional synthesis report, and three special topic reports (financing mechanisms, technology support
system, and demonstration projects to showcase energy service delivery). The reports provide
excellent descriptions of the baseline situations in PICs and are reportedly being used widely in the
countries. PIREP also produced the PIGGAREP project proposal, which is now being implemented,
and engaged 11 PICs. In addition, the Republic of Marshall Islands and Palau developed their own
medium-sized UNDP/GEF proposals (called ADMIRE and SEDREA, respectively) as spin-offs of the
PIREP preparatory activities, and are in the process of implementing those activities.

PIGGAREP contributes to climate change mitigation by promoting the wider use of RE technologies
to reduce the Pacific Islands’ dependence on fossil fuels. The project aims to achieve this by
removing existing barriers to the wider use of RE technology. The MTR identified several capacity-
related challenges, including the need to strengthen the PMO with additional staff, and sharpen its
focus on implementing a more strategic barrier removal strategy. Additional staff has since been
recruited, but the ability of the PMO to take effective adaptive measures in response to the MTR’s
recommendations remains to be seen.

The PACC is the second FSP in the climate change focal area and is in the final phase of
implementation. It is the first major adaptation project to be implemented in the Pacific Islands
region that directly addresses the issue of improving the effectiveness of the response to climate
change in the Pacific, while enhancing the systemic and institutional capacity to undertake
adaptation across the region. According to the Asia Pacific Adaptation Network (APAN), ‘…it is at
                                                                                                        53
February 2014                                                                  GEF Evaluation Office


present the main means of sharing practical adaptation experiences, as well as pooling related
expertise and raising other initiatives.’ UNDP progress reports (UNDP, 2010) noted that the project is
hindered by capacity-related bottlenecks at the national and regional levels, including: time-
consuming setup phases for national PMUs; lack of project management skills and experience by
national coordinators; and issues concerning SPREP’s role in providing strategic leadership and
technical support to the Regional PMU. Nonetheless, the same report also listed capacity-related
activities that were successfully completed, including: strengthening national coordination
mechanisms to address climate change; setting up national Climate Change Country Teams or
equivalent mechanisms in eight project countries (CKI, Fiji, RMI, FSM, Niue, Solomon Islands, Palau,
and Tuvalu) with existing national Climate Change Country Teams in two countries (Vanuatu and
Samoa) strengthened; and strengthening and further harmonizing national sector coordination
bodies in four countries (Nauru, Tonga, Tuvalu, and PNG). The report also noted the involvement of
more than 100 institutions in the 13 countries based on engagements in PACC teams and
committees. In addition, SPREP has established partnerships with a number of other regional
organizations.

Land Degradation

The NAP is an important addition to Vanuatu’s institutional capacity in combating land degradation.
It identifies the causes and effects of land degradation in Vanuatu, the existing capacity limitations
for UNCCD implementation, vulnerabilities of different provinces, proposed strategies for
mainstreaming NAP into national and sector strategies and plans, and institutional arrangements for
coordinating NAP implementation and monitoring. The matrix of actions sets out priority areas for
implementation and responsible agencies. The NAP also incorporated the resolutions from the 2006
National Land Summit, which is an important initial step in translating the national consensus and
priorities into actionable measures.

POPs

The NIP for the Stockholm Convention was developed, but is still in draft form. Vanuatu nominated
the Director of DEPC as its Official Contact Point for the Convention Secretariat in April 2011, for the
performance of administrative functions and all formal communications under the Convention.
While the Convention also requires the official designation of a National Focal Point for the exchange
of information (as specified under Article 9), no NFP for Vanuatu is listed on the Convention website.
There is no record of any other capacity building activity being implemented in the POPs focal area,
except for activities under the AusAID-funded intervention, which was carried out separately from
the GEF project.

International Waters

A number of participating PICs in the IWP indicated their willingness to absorb project activities and
staff into their national programs. The PIR (2006) reported that for the ICWM component, changes
in sector policies were made in some countries, including new legislation adopted to empower local
communities to manage the environment and natural resources in their jurisdictions. In Cook
Islands, the Environment Unit indicated its commitment to supporting the project staff to continue
the national effort to protect freshwater resources; the Solomon Islands Department of Fisheries
and Marine Resources agreed to institutionalize the IWP as the coastal fisheries management unit,
with a focus on supporting community-based initiatives to establish marine protected areas; the
Department of Environment and Conservation in Papua New Guinea was to incorporate the IWP
(including existing staff) into their 2007 programme of work to continue IWP-initiated efforts to
                                                                                                       54
February 2014                                                                                GEF Evaluation Office


support community-based initiatives to manage local waste; and in Samoa, demonstration activities
for watershed protection were integrated into the work plan of the MNRE Water Resources Division.
In Fiji, the IWP also served as the nucleus of post-2006 activities by the Department of Squatter
Settlements, Environment and Conservation to strengthen the government’s efforts in waste
management.

        5.8 Mainstreaming, Replication, and Scaling-up
GEF aims to expand the reach and scale of its impact beyond individual projects to affect broader
changes in policies, practices, and institutions, thereby leveraging its investments to achieve
significant global environmental impacts. While various pathways can lead to broad-based impacts,
recent GEF literature identifies three pathways that are particularly relevant for the Vanuatu and
SPREP Portfolio evaluation.54 These include: (i) mainstreaming, in which lessons, information, or
outputs of GEF support are incorporated into broader policy or administrative reforms; (ii)
replication, in which a technology or approach is demonstrated and then taken to scale, often in
geographic locales beyond the boundaries of the project; and (iii) scaling-up, whereby an activity is
expanded to larger geographical, ecological, or administrative tiers.

The extent to which GEF support in Vanuatu and SPREP has resulted in mainstreaming, replication,
and scaling-up varies across focal areas, as discussed below.

Biodiversity

The NBSAP made a direct contribution to the development of the Environmental Protection and
Management Act 2006, identifying and developing multi-stakeholder consensus on priority issues,
and proposing inputs which were mainstreamed into the approved legislation. The NBSAP was also
the catalyst for the LCI, identifying priority species and sites for potential projects of global
environmental significance including those subsequently targeted in the GEF-funded LCI. The rapid
biodiversity assessments and other biodiversity information-gathering activities for NBSAP also
provided DEPC – which developed the LCI proposal – with the baseline information that was used to
justify GEF funding. The nomination of the Vatthe Conservation Area and Lake Letas Area in Gaua by
DEPC in 2004 and the Vanuatu Museum as UNESCO World Heritage Sites is not a specific
recommendation of the NBSAP, but the momentum generated by the NBSAP for biodiversity
conservation action and the profile and awareness of the conservation values of the Vatthe
Conservation Area generated by SPBCP contributed to this outcome, according to stakeholders.

Regionally, NBSAPs have become the main roadmap for biodiversity conservation for PICs,
identifying national needs and priorities and proposing potential project profiles for funding
consideration. Its recognition by external funders and regional conservation organizations is evident
in the 2008 – 2012 Pacific Islands Action Strategy for Nature Conservation, which mainstreams the
NBSAP priorities for PICs in determining regional priorities and actions.

The other GEF EA outcome, the National Biosafety Framework (NBF), appears to have had negligible
impact. As a tool for supporting decision-making regarding the acceptability of proposed
introductions of living modified organisms (LMOs), through a process of prior informed consent
based on thorough screening and risk assessment, the NBF by nature does not lend itself to
mainstreaming or replication, nor was it intended to serve these purposes. The extent to which it
has been effectively applied in practise is not known due to the lack of information available for this

evaluation. CBD Secretariat’s Biosafety Clearinghouse (BCH) website shows however that Vanuatu
has not received any notifications/requests from potential LMO importers that would have
necessitated its use.

The LCI MSP generated significant community interest and was quickly replicated in other non-
targeted communities across the country. However, in the absence of technical support and
monitoring after LCI, it was not possible to verify the current status of conservation efforts in most
of these replication areas.

The regionally implemented SPBCP was perhaps the most comprehensive and extensive in terms of
geographic coverage, with a focus on promoting the community-based conservation area (CBCA)
approach. This approach has now been replicated throughout the region and judging from the
number of conservation area projects (12 out of 17) it initiated that are still in action, SPBCP
deserves recognition for its contribution. It should be noted that SPBCB was not the only
intervention promoting community-based conservation; several other similar or related
independent initiatives including other GEF-funded interventions were emerging in parallel or soon
after within Vanuatu and throughout the Pacific region.55 Attribution issues aside, the community-
based conservation approach is now widely replicated in various forms and designs. According to the
Vanuatu Third National Report to the CBD (2006), the following areas were established in Vanuatu:

        Community-based conservation and sanctuary areas that have been in place for over 10
         years (as of 2006 when the Third National Report was submitted) are: Loru Protected Area,
         Vatthe Conservation Area, Ringhi te Suh (Maskelynes), Hideaway Island (Efate), Narong
         Marine Reserve (Uri Island), and Mystery Island Reef (Aneityum).

        New community-based conservation areas include: Nguna-Pele Marine Protected Area, Epi,
         Central Pentecost, Lelepa (Marine Protected Area), Mangaliliu (Marine Protected Area),
         Spuaki Conservation Area (Nguna), and Wiawi (Malekula).

        There are also many small local protected tabu and resource management areas declared
         under custom authority. The number has not been quantified. Johannes and Hickey (2002)56
         observed 51 marine resource management measures within a sample of 21 villages but did
         not consider non-marine sites.

The SPBCP was the first regional project to promote the CBCA approach; several country-specific
activities of other donors and conservation organizations were mobilized at around the same time
and shortly afterwards. The CBCA approach was endorsed by the Fifth South Pacific Conference on
Nature Conservation and Protected areas (1993)57 and later in the SPREP Action Strategy for Nature
Conservation in the South Pacific Region 1994 – 1998, the latter acknowledging SPBCP’s work in this


55
    In Vanuatu, these included the GEF-funded International Waters Project (IWP), and the Capacity Building for
Environmental Management Project (CBEMP). The latter was a collaboration with the Vanuatu Cultural Center (VCC) in
documenting and developing a database of traditional resource management methods. In 1995, a British group – ‘The
Vanuatu Protected Area Initiative’ – was also working with one traditional landowner to establish the Loru Protected Area,
which incorporated traditional environmental elements to strengthen non-traditional approaches to conservation, while
the Foundation for Peoples of the South Pacific (FSP)-Vanuatu had several years of experience working with traditional
landowners in sustainable forest management focusing more on small-scale logging and eco-timber certification standards.

area. SPBCP established 17 conservation areas in 12 PICs between 1991 and 2001, bringing under
conservation management a wide range of internationally significant biodiversity. During much of
the same period and continuing after SPBCP, an additional 17 community-based conservation
projects were initiated by other groups and donors throughout the region. These included activities
funded by New Zealand Overseas Development Assistance (NZODA),58 USAID-funded Biodiversity
Support Network,59 and the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF). SPBCP was, according to the GEF
Final Evaluation Report, effectively the de facto biodiversity programme for SPREP during the period
and in this role, was instrumental in partnering with the The Nature Conservancy (TNC) to establish
the Pacific Island Roundtable for Nature Conservation. The Roundtable is the major forum for
coordinating and monitoring the implementation of the Pacific Islands Action Strategy for Nature
Conservation, and a major champion for community-based conservation in the Pacific Islands region.

Climate Change

Climate change has evolved as an issue and a global concern demanding the commitment of
countries to collective action in the early 1990s, to a major source of economic vulnerability that is
the top priority for many PICs today. This progression is also matched by the evolving nature of GEF’s
funding from the foundational enabling activities in GEF 1 and 2 – which focused on awareness
raising, baseline studies and inventories, and capacity assessments in NCSA, PICCAP 1 and II – to
demonstration and pilot activities, and feasibility studies in PACC and PIGGAREP in subsequent GEF
phases. The region is now poised for a number of investment initiatives that were identified and
emerged out of existing activities such as PIGGAREP and PACC, and to an extent, PIREP.

The full extent to which PIGGAREP and PACC, in particular, will facilitate the wider replication and
or/scaling-up of RE and climate change adaptation measures remains to be seen. But some positive
signs of their potential impact are gradually emerging. PIGGAREP has been referred to as the major
regional driver of RE in the PICs (APR, 2010). Its focus on clarifying and raising awareness of the link
between climate change, the impacts of escalating fossil fuel prices on PIC economies, and RE as a
viable strategy and option for generating global climate change mitigation benefits and
strengthening local economic resilience, is reported to have raised the profile of RE to an
unprecedented level – so much so that it is now one of the key deliberation points for the annual
meetings of the PIC leaders, according to the APR 2010. This increased emphasis on RE is reflected in
the increasing number of PICs with national energy policies declaring major shifts from fossil fuels to
RE in the immediate future. There is also a corresponding increase in donor interest and funding to
support RE development. For instance, a total of US$72 million in new capital funding available for
RE projects is reported for RE projects in Kiribati, Tonga, and a US$66 million regional initiative
funded by the Pacific-Japan Leaders' Meeting-5 (PALM-5) Pacific Environment Community (PEC)
administered by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS). PIGGAREP also works closely and in
collaboration with RE initiatives of other CROP Agencies and donor partners in the region.60


58
   NZODA funded activities during this period included a conservation area project in PNG (Maisin land, Oro Province), a
bird park in Tonga, a community-based eco-tourism project in Abaca Fiji, and World Heritage sites at Rennel and Marovo
Lagoon in the Solomon Islands.
59
    USAID-funded Biodiversity Support Network was supporting projects that combine conservation with social and
economic development during the same period including the Crater Mt Wildlife Management Area in PNG (1993), a
Community Marine Conservation and Enterprise Development in the Solomon Islands, and community-based conservation
areas in Fiji and Vanuatu (in association with SPACHEE and the Biodiversity Conservation Network).

   According to the SPREP website, this includes: the GEF‐funded Actions for the Development of Marshall Islands’
Renewable Energies (ADMIRE), Palau’s Sustainable Economic Development through Renewable Energy Applications
(SEDREA), RE activities of PPA, SPC and USP, IUCN’s Energy, Ecosystems for Sustainable Livelihoods Initiative, the EU’s
Support to the Energy Sector in Five ACP Pacific Island Countries (REP‐5), ADB’s Energy for All Initiative, the World Bank’s

The catalytic and replication effects of PACC activities will be fully assessed once the project is
completed and a proper project evaluation conducted. So far, recent reports (APR, 2011) referred to
the significant momentum that PACC is creating at the regional level. There is donor endorsement of
the way the project is structured, which the APR (2011) referred to as ‘a reliable structure that can
provide successful results in adaptation to climate change.’ This confidence is evident in a recent
AusAID agreement to contribute AU$7.8 million to scale-up the results of the project.

Land Degradation

The main project output was a National Action Plan. Although the NAP was apparently approved by
the Government and transmitted to the UNCCD Secretariat, there is no information on whether the
NAP’s SLM principles have been mainstreamed into national policies or sector plans.

POPs

There is no indication of mainstreaming or replication effects from GEF support in the POPs focal
area. It appears that AusAID’s ‘POPs in PICs’ project (funded separately from the GEF project) was
the catalyst for the POPs Country Plan and the POPs inventory.

International Waters

Some outputs of the IWP project are showing signs of replication. For instance, according to
stakeholder consultations, a number of communities were composting their green waste as opposed
to burning and dumping. Compost toilets were also gaining acceptance as a more practical option to
flush toilets in low-lying areas where septic tanks are often flooded during high seas or heavy rain.

The IWP also contributed significantly to setting the path for governments, communities and other
stakeholders in the Pacific to follow as they try to deal with the multitude of issues affecting the
region’s environment and natural resources. The project introduced new and innovative ways of
addressing the escalating waste problem of small atoll countries in the Pacific. It provided a
mechanism for improved collaboration between and among government agencies, communities and
NGOs through the establishment of interagency National Task Forces, and created a pool of well-
trained and skilled nationals to lead project implementation in the future.

6. RELEVANCE OF GEF SUPPORT TO VANUATU AND THE
SOUTH PACIFIC
This chapter assesses the relevance of GEF support to: national environmental priorities, strategies
and action plans; the region’s sustainable development agenda and national priorities; global
environmental benefits in the South Pacific; emerging or evolving issues in the region; capacity,
needs, and priorities of the SPREP countries; and regional approaches to country needs.

   6.1 Relevance to National Environmental Priorities and GEF Focal
       Area Strategies and Action Plans
GEF support enabled Vanuatu to fulfil its obligations as a party to a number of multilateral
environmental agreements, most notably the UNCBD, UNFCCC, the Stockholm Convention on POPs,
and the UNCCD. Table 6.1 shows that GEF funding supported the development of national action
plans, legislation, and requirements under international conventions. Of particular note, for the CBD,
GEF support assisted with national reporting and the development of national strategies and plans
for the protection and conservation of its biodiversity. Vanuatu completed and submitted its First
National Report in 1998, its Second National Report in 2002, and its Third National Report in 2006.
The NBSAP also contributed to the formulation of the Environmental Management and Conservation
Act No. 12 of 2002, which addressed several legal obligations under the CBD and initiated the
formulation of the LCI proposal that together with SPBCP, helped Vanuatu with in-situ conservation
as required under Article 8. The NBSAP provides Vanuatu with a clear list of national priorities and
an action plan for biodiversity conservation for the Government and other stakeholders including
funding agencies.

GEF support is also relevant to Vanuatu’s national development priorities, as evidenced in the high
degree of congruence between the goals, objectives, and sector priorities in the Vanuatu Priorities
and Action Agenda (PAA) 2006 – 2015, and GEF’s focal areas. The PAA’s primary priority is ‘… to
create an environment for private sector led economic growth including activities in the primary
sectors of agriculture, forestry and fisheries as well as tourism.’61 It also reaffirms the Government’s
commitment to the United Nations Millennium Declaration in 2000 and the Millennium
Development Goals (MGDs) noting that MDG targets and indicators have been included as
performance indicators for the PAA.

At the sector level, eight priorities are identified for Chapter 6 of the PAA, which is called ‘Primary
Sector Development and the Environment’ and addresses the following issues: (i) implementation of
the Environmental Management and Conservation Act, (ii) development of protected areas, (iii)
waste management and pollution control, (iv) eco-tourism, (v) risk reduction from natural hazards,
and (vi) Port Vila development plan. These priorities are directly related to GEF’s biodiversity,
climate change, international waters, land degradation, and POPs focal areas.

     6.2 Relevance to Region’s Sustainable Development Agenda and
         National Priorities
GEF support has been relevant to meeting both the Pacific Island countries’ sustainable
development agenda and environmental priorities as well as the SPREP mandate. According to
SPREP,62 many countries have incorporated sustainable development and environmental
considerations into their National Sustainable Development Strategies and national planning
frameworks, while others have recognized the importance of environmental issues and are working
to mainstream environmental considerations into their national sustainable development agendas.
SPREP’s mandate – to promote cooperation in the Pacific Islands region and to provide assistance in
order to protect and improve the environment and to ensure sustainable development for present
and future generations – is pursued through programs in climate change, biodiversity, land
degradation, international waters, POPs, and ozone depletion. These areas are consistent with the
GEF mandate and focal areas.

All regionally implemented projects – including SPBCP, IWP, PIREP, PICCAP, PIGGAREP and PACC –
were developed from proposals that involved wide regional consultations coordinated by SPREP and
included national agencies, NGOs, and donors representatives. The proposals for SPBCP, IWP,
PICCAP, PIREP, PIGGAREP, and PACC were formally endorsed by the countries through the SPREP
Meetings, SPREP’s governing body, before formal submission to GEF. In the case of SPBCP,
PIGGAREP and PACC, the initial mandates to develop a project proposal were originated by the PICs
through SPREP Meetings, and in some cases Pacific Islands Forums communiques.63

GEF-funded interventions are also consistently tied to regional priorities defined in regional plans
and frameworks. In the case of SPBCP, this included the SPREP Action Plan and earlier Nature
Conservation Strategies. The Action Strategy for Nature Conservation in the South Pacific Region
1994 – 1998 strongly endorsed the region-wide application of the community-based conservation
area approach, acknowledging the work being carried out by SPBCP. The PACC is similarly closely

aligned with the Pacific Islands Framework for Action on Climate Change 2006 – 2015 (PIFACC), the
Pacific Plan, and the regional Framework for Action on Disaster Risk Management. PACC’s regional
activities are also consistent with common goals and priorities identified in regional consultations
such as the 'Fourteenth Pacific Regional Environment Programme Council Meeting' in 2003, and the
GEF-supported 'Pacific Islands Climate Change Assistance Programme (PICCAP)' (PIR Review).

The Strategic Action Plan for IWP (GEO 530), according to its project document, also incorporated
national and regional priorities as identified in countries’ State of the Environment (SOE) Reports
and/or National Environmental Management Strategy (NEMS). The SPREP Action Plan for Managing
the Environment of the South Pacific Region 1997-2000, the Draft Regional Strategy for
Development Priorities of the Forum Island Countries, the Action Strategy for Nature Conservation in
the South Pacific Region 1994-1998, and the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the
Marine Environment from Land-based Activities.

The PIREP and PIGGAREP were prompted by a request from PICs to UNDP and SPREP to pursue a
regional GHG mitigation project on RE within the framework of its Climate Change, Sea Level Rise
and Variability programme (PIGGAREP, ProDoc, p.6). According to the PIREP and PIGGAREP project
documents, the Pacific Island Leaders’ Forum meetings had consistently called for the adoption of
concrete measures to develop and utilise RE technologies as an effective means of addressing these
problems, highlighting the importance that Forum members place on domestic actions to reduce
emissions. The Regional Framework for Action on Climate Variability, Change and Sea Level Rise,
adopted by PIF countries in 2000,64 highlighted renewable energy, energy efficiency, and forestry as
priority GHG mitigation options for the PICs.

     6.3 Relevance to Global Environmental Benefits in the South Pacific
The GEF-funded projects in the biodiversity focal areas targeted the in-situ protection of globally
significant biodiversity. The LCI project areas in Gaua, Santos and Tanna constitute part of the
Solomons-Vanuatu-Bismarck Moist Forest, which is among WWF’s Global 200 Ecoregions, the
Eastern Melanesian Hotspot under Conservation International’s Biodiversity Hotspots, and BirdLife
International’s Vanuatu and Temotu Important Bird Area. The area extends from the Santa Cruz
Islands of the Temotu Province of Solomon Islands to the Torres Islands, Banks Islands (including
Gaua Islands), and Espiritu Santos Island. SPBCP targeted the Vatthe lowland rainforest. Details of
the globally significant biodiversity within these areas have been discussed elsewhere in this report.

GEF projects within the climate change focal area, especially PIREP and PIGGAREP, target the
reduction of GHG emissions by reducing the region’s use of imported fossil fuels and increasing the
use of renewable energy. The climate change enabling activities contributed to building in-country
capacity to assess country situations and their vulnerability to climate change, as well as the capacity
to best prepare and respond to climate change impacts. PACC is pioneering a number of adaptation
measures that are hoped to generate lessons learned and best practises that will benefit the rest of
the developing world.

     6.4 Relevance to Emerging or Evolving Issues in the Region
The Pacific Islands region has clearly identified through national development strategies and regional
and international forums, the impacts of extreme events associated with climate change as the
biggest source of economic vulnerability and environmental degradation, and the main threat to
their sustainable development. Previous predictions of more frequent and more intense weather
events including cyclones, storm surges, floods and droughts are now a painful reality with severe
economic, social, and environmental consequences. Over the last two decades since the signing by
most PICs of the UNFCCC in 1992, PICs’ response to climate change has progressively shifted from
advocating for global recognition of the special case of small islands developing countries to in-
country planning and mainstreaming, to (more recently) direct investment in mitigation and
adaptation. Presently, while there is recognition of the importance of mitigation such as in the
increased use of RE technologies, climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR)
are emerging as leading priorities and strategies in combating this threat. Through NAPA, PICs have
identified their most vulnerable sectors and have prioritized these sectors in their CCA and DRR
strategies. The PACC is a regional intervention targeting vulnerable sectors as nominated by
participating countries. GEF has been responsive to these emerging priorities: the increasing number
of climate change interventions in the pipeline relative to other focal areas is evidence of this shift
and of the GEF’s ability to respond.

Flowing from the challenge of addressing climate change is the realization of its cross-cutting nature
and the resulting demand for a coordinated ‘whole of country’ approach to planning and
implementation. Mainstreaming climate change impacts and CCA and DRR strategies into the
policies and plans of all vulnerable sectors is already underway in Vanuatu and other SPREP
countries under PACC. Strengthening adaptive institutional capacity was highlighted by a 2009 SPREP
report.65 These are initial steps in what is likely to be an ongoing challenge.

     6.5 Relevance to Capacity, Needs and Priorities of SPREP Countries
The lack of capacity across all GEF focal areas within the Pacific countries is consistently reported by
all past GEF project documents and project assessments. This is also confirmed by other donor-
funded studies including those supported by SPREP66 and ADB.67 In response, capacity building was
and continues to be an integral part of all past and current GEF interventions at the local, national,
and regional levels. The capacity building results, and outcomes of completed and ongoing
initiatives, have been discussed elsewhere in this report. Overall, GEF interventions in the Vanuatu
and SPREP portfolios have satisfactorily delivered on their intended capacity building outputs. The
extent to which these results are useful in addressing the priority capacity gaps in PICs is partly tied
to the overall relevance of GEF’s assistance to national development priorities as identified in
national planning documents including the NCSA, NBSAP, NAPA, NAP, NIP, and other similar
Convention-related plans.

In the case of the Vanuatu national portfolio, this evaluation found that GEF assistance is closely tied
to national priorities in the Vanuatu National Priority Action Agenda and to country commitments
made to international conventions and agreements. The strongest connections are in climate change
and biodiversity conservation, although the priority assigned to the implementation of the all-
encompassing Environmental Management and Protection Act means that POPs, land degradation,

and international waters are also highly relevant. Similarly, priorities for capacity building targeted in
GEF-funded MSPs and FSPs flow from the findings of needs assessments conducted in project
preparatory exercises such as PIREP, NBSAP, NAPA, NAP, and the NIP.

GEF-funded projects also contribute to informing and fine-tuning capacity needs assessments by
identifying specific capacity deficiencies confronted during implementation. At the national level, for
instance, PIGGAREP’s MTR highlighted the lack of capacity in public utility companies and the private
sector that are essential to RE projects’ up-scaling and sustainability, the lack of RE costing
information, and its implication for long-term RE development and sustainability. PACC’s MTR
country reports highlighted the lack of capacity at national and local levels as among the main
challenges facing the sustainability of national projects two years away from the end of PACC. LCI’s
incomplete reporting of results due to the lack of M&E analysis of field monitoring data highlighted
the lack of this expertise within DEPC and its importance for project reporting overall. Similar lessons
were earlier learned from SPBCP and IWP. Problems related to the recruitment of national personnel
and consultants were a common cause of delays and disruptions in the implementation of SPBCP,
IWP, LCI, PIREP, PICCAREP, and PACC. Analyses offered by all project assessments confirm what is
generally widely known – i.e., the severely limited pool of qualified and experienced locals in
environmental protection and conservation-related work throughout the PICs, compounded by the
high rate of staff turnover.

In Vanuatu, DEPC remains understaffed and under-resourced – despite having been upgraded from a
Unit to a government Department in 2009.68 Project-funded staff is heavily relied on for some of
DEPC’s core functions, but due to budgetary constraints, the staff are not absorbed into its structure
and are let go when projects are completed. LCI highlighted this weakness and it is also a looming
threat to DEPC’s current biodiversity capacity, wherein five of the existing six staff are project-
funded. DEPC’s capacity limitations underscore the necessity for and the important role of
Government inputs and support to build on gains made through GEF-funded interventions.

Weaknesses in capacity within Vanuatu and region-wide that were identified in GEF-funded
interventions have also been cited by SPREP and other non- GEF-funded SPREP-implemented
assessments. These include weaknesses in project coordination, contingency planning, and project
management.69 Although multi-stakeholder mechanisms were created as part of the GEF enabling
activities, and in response to MEA requirements including national steering committees such as
those for NBSAP, National Advisory Committees for Climate Change (NACCC) and others, ineffective
vertical and horizontal integration is hindering effective adaptive institutional capacity.70 This
remains a major constraint to effective project implementation, notably in the climate change focal
area. Samoa and Cook Islands are notable exceptions in terms of aid coordination, but other PICs are
noted to have problems with poor coordination between central planning agencies and line
ministries.71 Ineffective contingency planning for project management is a region-wide problem that
appears rooted in the limited pool of local experts readily available to provide back-up. SPREP cited
the lack of career development opportunities and staff retention policies as resulting in the loss of
staff. SPREP also observed that the common practise of assigning project management
responsibilities to current senior staff already fully occupied with other responsibilities denies aid-
funded projects the attention and focus they deserve to ensure effectiveness.

The experience from past and current GEF interventions in Vanuatu and the SPREP portfolios clearly
show that GEF-funded interventions are, and will remain, an essential and effective vehicle for
delivering capacity strengthening to PICs within its focal areas. But while GEF capacity building
activities tend to focus on existing project staff and other project stakeholders, and short-term
project-based needs, the fundamental issue of expanding and widening the pool of experts and
expertise within each PIC is a larger challenge that transcends GEF’s project-based approach. The
evaluation findings indicate that GEF’s contribution through project-driven training and capacity
strengthening is an essential part of what should be a more comprehensive programmatic approach
that PICs should lead, ultimately resulting in a regular and predictable flow of qualified practitioners
and graduates at all levels of environmental management.

   6.6 Relevance of Regional Approaches to Country Needs
Regional approaches have been justified in terms of cost effectiveness, the high cost of any country
‘going it alone,’ and the limited capacities within PICs for project management and implementation.
The experience of SPREP and other regional organizations indicate that this approach is well-
justified. Many project activities are more cost-effectively implemented regionally, given the high
costs of logistics and travel between countries and the lack of local expertise. High-level training in a
wide range of skill areas (including project coordination and management, project development and
design, M&E, international negotiations, etc.) can help support this approach. Similarly, national-
level consultations to fine-tune regional design of projects and to agree on regional synthesis and
priorities can be accomplished by bringing national representatives together in regional workshops
and meetings. SPREP has over the years been prudent in minimizing costs, often by piggybacking on
other regional events that would also maximize PICs’ participation.

Regional approaches have also been used to pioneer and trial new approaches in addressing
environmental problems. The aim is to identify best practises and to gain knowledge and lessons
that would inform and improve future project design and implementation. SPBCP and IWP were
partly designed to achieve these objectives. Among the key outputs are toolkits and ‘how-to’
manuals, and technical reports to assist with regional, national, and local planning and
implementation. Projects have also sponsored study tours for community leaders and
representatives to share experiences with other communities, and regional forums including the
Pacific Islands Conference on Nature Conservation. PIREP was a project preparatory initiative for
PIGGAREP and generated baseline information which has significantly improved participating
countries’ capacities to develop policies and design other interventions. The PACC project
demonstrates a framework of action that fuses the top-down (mainstreaming) and bottom-up
approaches to climate change vulnerability assessments and action. This dual approach encourages
approaches that are consistent with both community and national priorities and plans.

The relevance of these regional approaches to country needs can be inferred from the high level of
PICs’ support and level of participation in these endeavours. Furthermore, community-based
approaches advocated in SPBCP and IWP remain relevant, albeit in various modified forms, in
dealing with biodiversity, land degradation, and climate change adaptation. Similarly, planning tools
developed through interventions including PICCAP, PIGGAREP, and PACC – including methodologies
for GHG and waste inventories, vulnerability and risk assessments, and baseline information
collected in enabling activities – are important components of institutional capacities whose value
and utility remain beyond the completion of GEF-funded activities.

7. EFFICIENCY OF GEF-SUPPORTED ACTIVITIES IN
VANUATU AND THE SOUTH PACIFIC
This chapter examines various aspects of the efficiency of GEF support to Vanuatu and the SPREP region,
including: the time, effort, and financial resources required to approve Vanuatu national and SPREP
regional projects; catalytic financing role of the GEF; roles and levels of coordination among stakeholders
in project development and implementation; and synergies for GEF programming and implementation
among GEF Agencies, national and regional institutions, GEF projects, and other donor-supported
activities. The chapter concludes with an assessment of monitoring, evaluation, and learning.

 7.1    Time, Effort, and Financial Resources for Project Processing
This analysis distinguishes among the three main types of GEF projects – EAs, MSPs, and FSPs – as the
project cycle differs slightly depending on the modality. The analysis also distinguishes between national
and regional projects, as the latter require synchronizing resources and personnel across several countries,
which can influence project cycle duration. Missing and unreliable data are also accounted for as discussed
in Section 2.4. Throughout this chapter, data points that the evaluators extrapolated (for missing dates) or
revised (for unreliable dates) are denoted and explained in the table notes. Annex G presents the
complete list of national and regional projects along with detailed notes on the methodology for
calculating project duration.

Processing Time

This evaluation covers the full life of the GEF, but the GEF project cycle has evolved over the years,
which makes assessing project cycle durations over time challenging. Following the GEF Evaluation
Office’s 2006 Joint Evaluation of the GEF Activity Cycle and Modalities, the GEF project cycle
underwent a revision in 2007 (at the beginning of GEF-4), and processing time frame limits were
adjusted. For example, a limit of 22 months for project development was imposed during GEF-4.
This limit has been further reduced to 18 months for GEF-5. Figure 7.1 provides a summary
overview of the project cycle before 2007. Figures 7.2 and 7.3 give an overview of the current
project cycle, presented separately for FSPs and MSPs, as the project cycle varies slightly for each
of these modalities.

The approval process for national projects is summarized in Tables 7.1 and 7.2. Overall, the approval
process takes 636 days on average (1.7 years) for the national projects in the GEF Vanuatu portfolio.
This compares favorably with the GEF global average of 5.5 years as reported by the GEF Evaluation
Office in 2007; 72 however, it exceeds the goal of an 18-month (1.5 years) approval process.
Moreover, the trend seems to be going in the wrong direction, from less than one year in GEF-1 to
4.3 years in GEF-4. (GEF-5 is ongoing, and it is too early to assess the overall efficiency in the current

GEF phase.) This is likely due, in part, to the evolution from EAs (which are relatively simple to
prepare) to MSPs and FSPs (which are larger and more complex).

While the reforms implemented in GEF-4 were intended to streamline the process, concerns about
efficiency persist. The longest delay occurs between CEO approval/endorsement (C) and GEF Agency
approval (D). Delays stem from the requirements of the GEF Agencies, and the need to coordinate
between the GEF Agencies and the GEF. For example, the World Bank – Increasing Resilience to
Climate Change and Natural Hazards project (GEF ID 3798) had to meet the different requirements
of three separate funders: The World Bank, the EU, and the GEF. Delays are also caused by factors
within Vanuatu, including limited capacity for developing strong project proposals and lack of a
strong national coordination mechanism.

         step B only (GEF IDs 1682, 1914, 1942, 1970, and 3502).


As shown in Table 7.2, the approval time for FSPs tends to exceed the time for EAs and MSPs, which
might be expected given the relative size and complexity of FSPs.

The processing time for regional projects is summarized in Tables 7.3 and 7.4. Overall, the approval
process for regional projects takes 881 days on average (2.4 years), which exceeds the average for
national projects. This may reflect the relative complexity of preparing regional projects, which
requires traveling to and coordinating with multiple countries. Many countries in the South Pacific
region have had trouble understanding the GEF procedures and the requirements for formulating a
‘GEF-able’ project. However, large regional efforts such as the Pacific Alliance for Sustainability have
raised awareness about GEF requirements. Similar to national projects, the average time for steps A-
E (Pipeline to Implementation) is the longest for GEF-4 projects, and the time between phases tends
to be longer for FSPs than for MSPs and EAs. Unlike national projects, where the longest delay
occurs between CEO endorsement (C) and GEF Agency approval (D), the longest delay for regional
projects occurs between PIF clearance (B) and CEO approval/endorsement (C). In addition, getting
from step A (pipeline entry/received) to step B (PIF clearance) also takes much longer for regional
projects than for national projects. This is consistent with the finding that countries in the SPREP
region have difficulty preparing projects that can pass the GEF approval process.

A consequence of the excessive approval time is that by the time projects are approved, the national
situation and priorities may have changed. As a result, the project may not have the same level of
momentum as when it was conceived; in other cases, new circumstances require further
consultations to refine the project’s objectives and activities. Further delays sometimes occur due to
staff recruitment and training, as well as ongoing reporting requirements. For example, it took six
months after the LCI was approved in 2005 to hire needed staff and clarify the goals and activities.

Project Preparation Costs

A summary of the project preparation costs for national and regional projects is shown in Tables 7.5
and 7.6. The FSPs, for both national and regional projects, have the highest preparation costs and
total project allocations compared to MSPs and enabling activities. The preparation costs appear
very low compared to total project costs; overall, they represent only 1.2% and 0.7% of the costs for
national and regional projects, respectively.

However, interviews and project documents indicate that preparation costs funded by the GEF are
not sufficient to conduct adequate consultations to FSP and MSP implementation. It is not
uncommon to spend the first year of project ‘implementation’ on activities that might better be
classified as preparation – such as holding consultations to discuss intended outcomes, and rewriting
the project objectives and logframe. For example, after the GEF approved the Pacific Invasive
Species Project (GEF ID 3664), it was necessary to return to the participating countries to have
adequate consultations. Similarly, the IWP was approved without much national input; after the
project was approved, it became apparent that national priorities were not fully aligned with the
project objectives. The initial phase of the project was spent bringing the project goals and national
objectives into alignment. Similarly, the PACC did not have sufficient preparation funding to conduct
the necessary travel and stakeholder consultations. After the project was approved, SPREP had to
work with the participating countries to develop their priorities, and the project changed as a result.

 7.2 Co-financing
Cofinancing ratios for national projects are shown in Figure 7.4. The vertical axis shows the
cofinancing ratio; the numbers above the bars indicate the number of projects in each category. As
shown in the figure, cofinancing ratios increased through GEF-4, and have decreased slightly in GEF-
5. National MSPs show the highest cofinancing ratio compared to other project types (13.5). Across
focal areas, climate change projects have the highest overall cofinancing ratio of 4.4.

The regional projects show very different trends in cofinancing ratios from the national projects, as
shown in Figure 7.5. Unlike national projects, the regional projects do not show an increase in
cofinancing ratios over time. Additionally, the FSPs have the highest cofinancing ratios of the project
types (4.6), and neither of the regional enabling activities had any cofinancing. Of the focal areas,
international waters and the multifocal area received the highest cofinancing, with ratios of 5.7 and
6.1, respectively.

Interviewees for this evaluation noted several caveats that should be considered when interpreting
the cofinancing ratios for national and regional projects. Cofinancing ratios appear to be high, but
may be artificially inflated as there is incentive to show high cofinancing ratios to get projects
approved by the GEF. Cofinancing includes cash and ‘in-kind’ contributions; it also includes funds
committed to other government activities that are ‘aligned’ with GEF projects. For regional projects,
cofinancing contributions are primarily from donors rather than the participating countries; this is
especially true for climate change projects. Moreover, the cofinancing committed during the project
approval stage does not always materialize upon project completion. Therefore, the cofinancing
ratio may not be a good proxy for national commitment to GEF projects.

 7.3 Roles and Responsibilities
The GEF Secretariat has established processes and procedures to ensure that GEF-funded projects
are country-driven. One important mechanism for ensuring country ownership is the endorsement
of the country’s Operational Focal Point (OFP). The OFP is the main point of contact for in-country
stakeholders, the GEF Secretariat, and GEF Agencies. GEF Agencies formulate the project concept
and, with the endorsement of the OFP, submit the proposal to the GEF Secretariat. Although this
process is supposed to guarantee national ownership, in-country stakeholders have a perception
that they are not sufficiently engaged in formulating projects. Interviewees indicated that they are
                                                                                                    72
February 2014                                                                     GEF Evaluation Office


engaged later, after the project is farther along in the approval process, or even after the project has
been approved. This situation reflects, in part, the limited time and capacity of local stakeholders to
formulate and prepare projects that can pass muster with the GEF. However, this situation has
sometimes resulted in less national ownership of GEF projects.

After approval, GEF Agencies implement projects through an Executing Agency such as SPREP.
Typically, Executing Agencies hire project coordinators to manage daily logistics and monitor
activities. Recruitment has generally not been problematic, with the exception of PIREP. However,
findings from the interviews and fieldwork suggest that project coordinators are often recruited
based primarily on their technical expertise, with little or no project management skills. The
situation can be exacerbated by the reporting requirements of the GEF Agencies; for example,
project officers for PACC and PIGGAREP have reportedly spent up to one-third of their time writing
monitoring reports to satisfy UNDP’s reporting requirements. This can be seen as a source of
inefficiency and a cause of delays in project implementation.

 7.4 Coordination and Synergies
The evaluation finds that synergies are happening in some areas, but could be improved. At the
national level, coordination occurs more often when projects are implemented under the same
national steering committees or ministries. However, cooperation across some national ministries
and units has proved challenging. In general, existing projects are not coordinated with each other as
much as they could. Moreover, the absence of a strong national coordination mechanism also delays
the time required to prepare project proposals for GEF consideration.

In general, there is more coordination across projects at the regional level than at the national level.
Regionally executed projects draw on a wider technical capacity and can access knowledge and
resources more easily than national projects. For example, in the PIGGAREP project, SPREP was able
to locate wind testing equipment more quickly than Vanuatu could have done on its own.

In the past, there has sometimes been competition between the Council of Regional Organizations in
the Pacific (CROP) Agencies. For example, there was disagreement between SPREP and SOPAC about
who would be the Executing Agency for the PIGGAREP project. However, coordination is improving
among regional heads and in regional working groups for specific areas such as climate change.
Regional coordination has also facilitated using SPC agriculture experts for PACC projects in countries
dealing with food security issues.

Cost is another challenge that can hamper regional coordination. As discussed in Chapter 3, the
SPREP region consists of small, geographically disparate and remote islands. In theory, regional
projects should generate efficiencies by lowering the transaction costs associated with engaging
each individual island nation. In practice, this has proven challenging due, in part, to lack of sufficient
resources devoted to regional project coordination. In particular, the Pacific Alliance for
Sustainability (PAS) was conceived as a regional program, but it did not commit the funding required
to establish a robust coordinating mechanism at a sufficient scale. Similarly, the IWRM project
budget initially underestimated the costs of traveling throughout the Pacific; however, steps are
being taken now to address the issue.

Unfortunately, the evaluation finds scant evidence of coordination between regional and nationally-
executed projects in Vanuatu. In particular, regional/national coordination could have occurred, but
did not, in the biodiversity focal area. Similarly, PIGGAREP did not appear to be coordinated with
national energy efficiency efforts in Vanuatu; the projects were implemented by different Executing

                                                                                                          73
February 2014                                                                  GEF Evaluation Office


Agencies and government departments. On the other hand, there has been strong coordination
between national and regional energy efficiency projects in Samoa, as the same individuals serve on
the steering committees of both projects.

At the donor level, there are some positive examples of coordination, such as EU-World Bank efforts
to address climate change resilience in Vanuatu. However, other projects that should have been
coordinated have not been coordinated, and this has resulted in less harmonized and less effective
projects. For example, the inability of the PAS to establish a regional coordination mechanism was
partly due to disagreements between GEF and The World Bank about where the unit should be
located.

 7.5 Monitoring and Evaluation
All GEF projects have M&E protocols in the form of annual Project Implementation Reports (PIRs),
Mid-Term Reviews (MTRs), and Terminal Evaluations (TEs). The M&E systems in place are used
effectively for adaptive management during the life of the projects. Many of the completed national
and regional projects include examples of improvements that have been adopted since the relevant
MTR took place.

Some examples of adaptive management include the changes that UNDP and SPREP initiated to
address delays in the disbursement of funds for the PACC project. This was an issue since UNDP and
SPREP started working together on GEF projects in the mid-1990s. The new approach allows
disbursement of funds only to those countries that have submitted the necessary reports on time,
rather than waiting until all countries have submitted their reports before funds are disbursed to
SPREP. Also, SPREP now only has to submit progress reports on a six-month basis rather than
quarterly, freeing up staff time to work on project activities.

Another example of good adaptive project management is demonstrated by the GEF PAS Prevention,
Control and Management of Invasive Species project (GEF ID 3664). Project managers made the
change from one regional inception workshop to ten in-country inception workshops. This change
helped facilitate greater stakeholder involvement and participation at the national level in the
review of workplans and prioritisation of activities following initial review of strategies and project
design, and consultations with partners and countries. In addition, project administration
responsibilities were taken off the national project coordinators, allowing them to focus on
implementation of project field activities as opposed to reporting.

TEs produced some very useful lessons and recommendations for future action. Unfortunately,
these lessons do not appear to have been incorporated into the design of subsequent projects or
taken up by governments in their daily work programs. Examples include the recommendations from
the LCI to enact the Conservation Area Regulation (CAR) in Vanuatu and provide support for the
communities to maintain their established conservation areas. The evaluation found that neither of
these recommendations has been acted upon. The recommendations from the TE of the LCI project,
and the NBSAP projects as well as the IWP, highlighted the need for strengthening the capacity of
DEPC. Unfortunately, this has not happened, mainly due to the lack of political commitment to
raising the profile of environmental issues at the national level.

Institutionalizing M&E within the participating ministry or department beyond the lifetime of the
project has proved challenging. This is due to limited capacity – most ministries do not have a
dedicated M&E specialist – and staff turnover. Once a project ends, project officers often leave with
the knowledge gained during the project.

                                                                                                       74

Overall, the evaluation finds that lessons learned from completed projects are not taken up as much
as they could be. However, the evaluation found two examples where lessons learned from one
project have supported or could support the development of future projects. The LCI incorporated
lessons from the SPBCP, tailored to the national context. Also, lessons from IWP have been
documented and shared with other stakeholders in the Pacific, and may provide a foundation for
designing future projects.

GEF Vanuatu and SPREP Portfolio Evaluation: (1991 -
2012)
Approved by the GEF Evaluation Office Director on December 11, 2012

Background and Introduction
1. Country Portfolio Evaluations (CPEs) are one of the main evaluation streams of work of the GEF
Evaluation Office.73 By capturing aggregate portfolio results and performance of the GEF at the
country level they provide useful information for both the GEF Council and the countries. CPEs
relevance and utility has increased in GEF-5 with the increased emphasis on country ownership and
country-driven portfolio development.
2. GEF eligible countries are chosen for CPEs based on a selection process and a set of criteria
including the size, diversity and maturity of their portfolio of projects.74 These evaluations usually
cover all national projects, and include a selection of the most important regional and global projects
in which the country participates. In Fiscal Year 11, the CPE Team conducted a different type of CPE,
taking a cluster approach that analyzed the portfolios of six GEF beneficiary countries members of the
Organization of the Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). That evaluation, a first of its kind for the CPE
team, allowed looking at the relevance, performance and results of regional projects, one of the main
support modalities in Small Island Developing States (SIDS). The Vanuatu and SPREP75 Portfolio
Evaluation is expected to progress further along this line of analysis, by providing an opportunity to
compare regional to national project relevance and performance in Small Island Developing States
(SIDS) in the South Pacific region.76 Furthermore, the portfolios of Vanuatu and SPREP include
several ongoing, completed/closed projects with significant emphasis on Biodiversity, Climate
Change and Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs).
3. The South Pacific region comprises 22 countries scattered over one third of the globe, covering
about thirty million sq. km., mostly oceanic. These countries include 20,000 to 30,000 small islands.77
The South Pacific region represents an enormous diversity in physical geography, culture, languages,
social-political organization, size and natural resource endowment. Although containing just 0.1
percent of the world’s population, the region contains one third of the world’s languages and an
enormous cultural diversity encompassing social, political and behavioral complexities. This situation
is most pronounced across Melanesia, where 700 languages are spoken in Papua New Guinea alone,
and more than 100 each in the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.78 Agriculture, fishing and tourism are
the major industries contributing to national economies.
4. Vanuatu, formerly the Anglo-French condominium of the New Hebrides, is an irregular Y-shaped
chain of some 80 islands, with a total land area of about 4,710 sq. miles and a total coastline of 1,571
miles. The total population of Vanuatu is estimated to be 240,000 people in 2010 and it has an annual

population growth rate of 2.3 percent.79 In 2010, Vanuatu’s gross domestic product (GDP) was
approximately $729 million with a growth rate of 3 percent and per capita income of $3,042.
Agriculture and tourism are the main productive sectors contributing to Vanuatu’s economy.
Agriculture contributes 21.5 percent of the GDP. Tourism contributes 19 percent of the GDP.80
Vanuatu ranks 118th on the Human Development Index (HDI) and 52nd on the Human Poverty Index
(HPI). Poverty levels stubbornly remain at about 40% of the population, with about 26% on less than
US$1 per day.
5. SPREP is an intergovernmental organization established in 1982 by the governments and
administrations of the Pacific region. SPREP is composed of 25 countries, consisting of all the 21
Pacific island countries and territories, and four developed countries.81 It is charged with promoting
cooperation, supporting protection and improvement of the Pacific islands environment, and ensuring
its sustainable development.82 The key focal areas under SPREP projects are climate change,
biodiversity and ecosystem management, waste management, pollution control, environmental
monitoring and governance. Adaptation to climate change and rising sea levels, improvement in
natural disaster preparedness, prevention of worsening freshwater shortages, protection of coastal
ecosystems and coral reefs from pollution and overfishing, development of solar and renewable
energy, managing tourism growth to protect the environment and cultural integrity and biodiversity
conservation have been prioritized by SPREP.83
6. Pacific countries face a full range of geologic and climatic hazards including increase in
population, waste (including solid, nuclear & chemicals) management, climate change and sea level
rise, economic and institutional capacity. The Vanuatu islands are located in a seismically and
volcanically active region and have high exposure to geologic hazards, including volcanic eruptions,
earthquakes, tsunamis, and landslides.84 The key drivers of environmental change are a rapidly
growing economy, a young population and rapid population growth, urban drift, land speculation,
agricultural intensification, deforestation, inadequate fisheries and marine management, industry and
trade, tourism, imported energy and transportation needs, extractive industries, and the global rise in
greenhouse gas emissions.
7. Since 1991 (Table 1), the GEF has funded a total of US$13.9 million in Vanuatu with US$65.3
million co-financing, through 11 national projects. These include 4 climate change projects, 4 projects
in biodiversity, 1 in land degradation and 1 multifocal area project. 6 projects have been either closed
or completed (5 closed and 1 completed). UNEP has been implementing 5 projects with a total GEF
grant of US$0.94 million and co-financing of US$0.15 million; UNDP has been implementing 4
projects totaling US$9.5 million GEF grant with co-financing of US$33.7 million; the World Bank is
implementing 2 projects with US$3.5 million GEF grant and co-financing of US$31.4 million.

Objectives of the evaluation
8. The purpose of the Vanuatu and SPREP Portfolio Evaluation is to provide the GEF Council with
an assessment of how GEF is implemented in Vanuatu and more broadly in the Pacific region, report
on results from projects and assess how these projects are linked to national and regional
environmental and sustainable development agendas as well as to the GEF mandate of generating
global environmental benefits within its focal areas. This evaluation has the following objectives:
      i.    independently evaluate the relevance and efficiency85 of the GEF support from several points
            of view: national and regional environmental frameworks and decision-making processes; the
            GEF mandate and the achievement of global environmental benefits; and GEF policies and
            procedures;
     ii.    assess the effectiveness and results86 of completed projects aggregated at the focal area;
 iii.       provide additional evaluative evidence to other evaluations conducted or sponsored by the
            Office; and
     iv.    provide feedback and knowledge sharing to (1) the GEF Council in its decision making
            process to allocate resources and to develop policies and strategies; (2) the countries on their
            participation in, or collaboration with the GEF; and (3) the different agencies and
            organizations involved in the preparation and implementation of GEF funded projects and
            activities.
9. The performance of the GEF national portfolio in Vanuatu and the portfolio of SPREP executed
regional projects will be assessed in terms of relevance, efficiency and effectiveness, and of the
contributing factors to this performance. The Vanuatu and SPREP Portfolio Evaluation will analyze
the performance of individual projects as part of the overall GEF portfolio, but without rating such
projects. CPEs do not aim at evaluating or rating the performance of the GEF agencies, partners or
national governments.

Key Evaluation Questions
10. GEF CPEs are guided by a set of key questions that should be answered based on the quantitative
and qualitative analysis of the evaluative information and perceptions collected during the evaluation


85
   Relevance: the extent to which the activity is suited to local and national environmental priorities and policies
and to global environmental benefits to which the GEF is dedicated; Efficiency: the extent to which results have
been delivered with the least costly resources possible.
86
   Effectiveness: the extent to which the GEF activity’s objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, taking into account their relative importance; Results: in GEF terms, results include direct project
outputs, short- to
medium-term outcomes, and progress toward longer term impact including global environmental benefits,
replication effects, and other local effects; Sustainability: the likely ability of an intervention to continue to
deliver benefits for an extended period of time after completion; projects need to be environmentally as well as
financially and socially sustainable.
                                                                                                                   81

exercise. The Vanuatu and SPREP Portfolio Evaluation will be guided by the following key
questions:
Effectiveness, results and sustainability
    1) What are the results (outcomes and impacts) of GEF support at the project level and at the
       aggregate level (portfolio and program) by focal area? What are the results of GEF support at
       the regional level?
    2) Is GEF support effective in producing results related to the dissemination of lessons learned
       in GEF projects and with partners?
    3) Is GEF support effective in producing results which last in time and continue after project
       completion?
    4) Has the GEF support contributed to build adequate institutional capacity to allow direct
       execution at national level in the Pacific region?
    5) Has the GEF support facilitated the channeling of additional resources for climate financing
       that up-scales the efforts for achieving global environmental benefits in the Pacific region?
    6) Has the GEF support been effective in producing tangible concrete results (in terms of
       outputs, outcomes, and impacts) that go beyond foundational activities?
Relevance
    7) Is GEF support relevant to the Vanuatu and other Pacific countries’ sustainability
       development agendas and environmental priorities, in particular for what concerns sustainable
       land management and land degradation?
    8) Is the GEF support to Vanuatu and more broadly to the Pacific region relevant to the
       objectives linked to the different Global Environmental Benefits (GEBs) in biodiversity,
       greenhouse gases, international waters, land degradation, and chemicals focal areas?
    9) Is GEF support relevant to the Vanuatu and other Pacific countries’ development needs and
       challenges?
    10) Are the GEF and its agencies supporting environmental and sustainable development
        prioritization, country ownership and decision-making process in Vanuatu and more broadly
        in the Pacific region?
    11) Are Vanuatu and other Pacific countries supporting the GEF mandate and focal areas
        programs and strategies with their own resources and/or with the support from other donors?
Efficiency
    12) How much time, effort and financial resources does it take to formulate and implement
        projects, by type of GEF support modality in the Pacific region?
    13) What are the roles, and level of coordination and communication, among stakeholders in
        project development and implementation, particularly national and regional institutions?
    14) What are the synergies for GEF programming and implementation (including among GEF
        focal areas) among: GEF agencies, national agencies and regional institutions; GEF projects;
        and other donor-supported projects and activities in the Pacific region?
    15) What role does Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) play in increasing project adaptive
        management and overall efficiency?
11. Each of these questions is complemented by a set of indicators, potential sources of information,
evaluation tools and methods described in the evaluation matrix presented in Annex 1. The matrix
contains a tentative list of indicators or basic data, potential sources of information, and methodology
components.

Scope and Limitations
12. The Vanuatu and SPREP Portfolio Evaluation will cover all types of GEF supported activities in
the two portfolios under analysis (Vanuatu national and SPREP regional projects) at all stages of the
project cycle (pipeline, on-going and completed) and implemented by all GEF Agencies in all focal
areas, including applicable GEF corporate activities such as the Small Grants Programme (SGP). The
evaluation will look at all the Vanuatu national projects and all the SPREP-executed projects, be them
full size, medium size or enabling activities, with a view to continue, deepen and enrich the
comparative analysis started with the OECS Cluster CPE, by analyzing strengths and weaknesses of
the national (i.e. the Vanuatu national projects portfolio) and the regional (i.e. the SPREP-executed
regional projects portfolio) project modalities in SIDS contexts.
13. The stage of the project will determine the expected focus of the analysis (see Table 3).

14. The GEF does not establish country programs that specify expected achievements through
programmatic objectives, indicators, and targets. However, since 2010 the GEF has started supporting
countries in undertaking national portfolio formulation exercises on a voluntary basis. These exercises
serve as a priority setting tool for countries and as a guide for GEF Agencies as they assist recipient
countries. These country programming efforts are rather recent, which limits their usefulness in
country portfolio evaluations that look back up to the start of GEF operations, i.e. sometimes 20 years
back. This is why generally CPEs entail some degree of retrofitting of frameworks to be able to judge
the relevance of the aggregated results of a diverse portfolio of projects. Accordingly, the standard
CPE evaluation framework described here will be adapted along with the other relevant national and
GEF Agencies’ strategies, country programs and/or planning frameworks as a basis for assessing the
aggregate results, efficiency and relevance of the GEF country portfolio.
15. GEF support is provided through partnerships with many institutions operating at many levels,
from local to national and international level. It is therefore challenging to consider GEF support
separately. The Vanuatu and SPREP Portfolio Evaluation will not attempt to provide a direct
attribution of development results to the GEF, but address the contribution of the GEF support to the
overall achievements, i.e. to establish a credible link between what GEF supported activities and its
implications. The evaluation will address how GEF support has contributed to overall achievements in
partnership with others, by questions on roles and coordination, synergies and complementarities and
knowledge sharing.
16. The assessment of results will be focused, where possible, at the level of outcomes and impacts
rather than outputs. Project-level results will be measured against the overall expected impact and
outcomes from each project. Progress towards impact of a representative sample of mature enough
projects (i.e. completed at least since 2 years) will be looked at through field Reviews of Outcome to
Impact (ROtI) studies. Expected impacts at the focal area level will be assessed in the context of GEF
objectives and indicators of global environmental benefits. Outcomes at the focal area level will be
primarily assessed in relation to catalytic and replication effects, institutional sustainability and
capacity building, and awareness.

17. The context in which these projects were developed, approved and are being implemented
constitutes another focus of the evaluation. This includes a historic assessment of the national
sustainable development and environmental policies, strategies and priorities, legal environment in
which these policies are implemented and enforced, GEF agencies country strategies and programs
and the GEF policies, principles, programs and strategies.

Methodology
18. The Vanuatu and SPREP Portfolio Evaluation will be conducted by staff of the GEF Evaluation
Office and national and international consultants, i.e. the Evaluation Team, led by a Task Manager
from the GEF Evaluation Office. The team includes technical expertise on the national environmental
and sustainable development strategies, evaluation methodologies, and GEF.
19. The selected firm qualifies under the GEF Evaluation Office Ethical Guidelines, and its
undertaking the evaluation does not raise concerns related to conflict of interest. Operational Focal
Points in Vanuatu and in a selection of SPREP member countries will be asked to act as resource
persons in facilitating the CPE process by identifying interviewees and source documents, organizing
interviews, meetings and field visits.
20. The methodology includes a series of components using a combination of qualitative and
quantitative evaluation methods and tools. The expected sources of information include:
       Project level: project documents, project implementation reports, terminal evaluations,
        terminal evaluation reviews, reports from monitoring visits, and any other technical
        documents produced by projects;
       Country and regional levels: national and regional sustainable development agendas,
        environmental priorities and strategies, GEF-wide, focal area strategies and action plans,
        global and national environmental indicators;
       Agency level: country assistance strategies and frameworks and their evaluations and
        reviews;
       Evaluative evidence at country level from other evaluations implemented either by the Office,
        by the independent evaluation offices of GEF agencies, or by other national or international
        evaluation departments;
       Interviews with GEF stakeholders, including the GEF Operational Focal Points and all other
        relevant government departments, regional organizations, bilateral and multilateral donors,
        civil society organizations and academia (including both local and international NGOs with a
        presence in the countries), GEF agencies, SGP and the national UN conventions’ Focal
        Points;
       Interviews with GEF beneficiaries and supported institutions, municipal governments and
        associations, and local communities and authorities;
       Field visits to selected project sites;
       Information from national consultation workshops.
21. The quantitative analysis will use indicators to assess the relevance and efficiency of GEF support
using projects as the unit of analysis (that is, linkages with national and regional priorities, time and
cost of preparing and implementing projects, etc.) and to measure GEF results (that is, progress
towards achieving global environmental benefits) and performance of projects (such as
implementation and completion ratings). Available statistics and scientific sources, especially for
national environmental indicators, will also be used.
22. The Evaluation Team will use standard tools and protocols for the CPEs and adapt these to the
national and regional context. These tools include a project review protocol to conduct the desk and
field reviews of GEF projects and interview guides to conduct interviews with different stakeholders.

23. The Vanuatu and SPREP Portfolio Evaluation will include visits to project sites. The criteria for
selecting the sites will be finalized during the implementation of the evaluation, with emphasis placed
on both ongoing and completed projects. The evaluation team will decide on specific sites to visit
based on the initial review of documentation and balancing needs of representation as well as cost-
effectiveness of conducting the field visits.
24. Quality assurance will be performed internally by the Office at key stages of the evaluation
process. Issues to be covered include: a) adherence of the interim and final evaluation products to
these TORs; b) soundness of the evaluation methods and tools used and the processes followed; c)
solidity and completeness of the evidence base underpinning the findings and conclusions; and d)
concreteness and feasibility of the recommendations formulated in the final report. Possibilities to
have the final report externally peer reviewed by the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) under its
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Office are being explored.
Process and Outputs
25. These country-specific TOR have been prepared based on an initial GEF Evaluation Office visit
to Vanuatu and to SPREP Headquarters in Samoa in October 2012, conducted with the purpose of
scoping the evaluation and identifying key issues to be included in the analysis. The mission was also
an opportunity to officially launch the evaluation, while at the same introduce the selected consultants
to GEF national stakeholders. These TOR conclude the Vanuatu and SPREP Portfolio Evaluation
preparatory phase, and set the scene for the evaluation phase, during which the Evaluation Team will
complete the following tasks:
       Complete the ongoing literature review to extract existing reliable evaluative evidence;
       Prepare specific inputs to the CPE, including:
        -   the GEF Portfolio Database which describes all GEF support activities in Vanuatu and
            all the SPREP-executed regional projects, basic information (GEF agency, focal area,
            implementation status), their implementation status, project cycle information, GEF and
            co-financing financial information, major objectives and expected (or actual) results, key
            partners per project, etc.
        -   Regional Environmental Legal Framework which provides an historical perspective of
            the context in which the GEF projects have been developed and implemented in the
            Pacific region. This document will be based on information on national and regional
            environmental legislation, environmental policies of each government administration
            (plans, strategies and similar), and the international agreements signed by Vanuatu and
            other Pacific countries presented and analyzed through time so to be able to connect with
            particular GEF support.
        -   Global Environmental Benefits Assessment which provides an assessment of the
            countries’ contribution to the GEF mandate and its focal areas based on appropriate
            indicators, such as those used in the System for the Transparent Allocation of Resources
            (STAR) (biodiversity, climate change and land degradation) and others used in projects
            documents.
        -   Review of Outcomes to Impact (ROtI) field studies of one regional and one national
            project completed since at least 2 years, selected in consultation with the Evaluation
            Office staff.
       Conduct field visits of ongoing national and regional projects, selected in consultation with
        the Office staff.
       Conduct the evaluation analysis and triangulation of collected information and evidence
        from various sources, tools and methods. This will be done internally by the Evaluation Team
        at the end of the evaluation data gathering and analysis phase. The aim will be to consolidate
        the evidence gathered so far and fill in any eventual information and analysis gaps before
        getting to findings, conclusions and preliminary recommendations. Conduct a Final
        Consultation Workshop for the Government and national and regional stakeholders,
                                                                                                       85

           including project staff, donors and GEF agencies, to present and gather stakeholders’
           feedback on the main Vanuatu and SPREP Portfolio Evaluation key preliminary findings, to
           be included in an Aid-Mémoire.87 The workshop will also be an opportunity to verify
           eventual errors of facts or analysis in case these are supported by adequate additional
           evidence brought to the attention of the Evaluation Team;
          Prepare a Draft Vanuatu and SPREP Portfolio Evaluation report, which incorporates
           comments received at the final consultation workshop. The draft report will be sent out to
           external peer reviewers before circulation to stakeholders;
          Consider the eventual incorporation of comments received to the draft report and prepare the
                                                                  88
           Final Vanuatu and SPREP Portfolio Evaluation report.
26. As was the case during the scoping mission, the national GEF Operational Focal Points will assist
the Evaluation Team and consultants with the identification of key people to be interviewed,
communication with relevant government departments, support to organize interviews, field visits and
meetings, and identification of main documents. The GEF agencies will be requested to assist the
Evaluation Team and the selected consultants regarding their specific GEF-supported projects and
activities, including identification of key project and agency staff to be interviewed and provision of
project documentation and data.
