Global growth: continued weakness. In the recently released
June 2016 Global Economic Prospects, global growth is projected
at 2.4 percent this year, unchanged from the disappointing pace
of 2015, and 0.5 percentage point below the January forecast
(Figure 1A, Table A). EMDEs account for about half of this
downward revision, in large part due to the significant downgrade
to growth forecasts for commodity exporters, and amid
heightened domestic uncertainties and a challenging external
environment (Figure 1B). Advanced economies are projected to
expand by 1.7 percent this year, 0.5 percentage point lower than
expected in January. Investment continues to be soft, and export
prospects have worsened. Despite a boost from lower energy
prices and improvements in labor markets, advanced-economy
growth is struggling to gain momentum.                                  FIGURE 1B Contribution to global growth
                                                                        revisions
United States: decelerating growth. Growth is projected to slow
to 1.9 percent this year, from 2.4 percent in 2015, reflecting a
disappointing start of the year and continued headwinds in the
manufacturing and energy sectors. Low oil prices, and associated
financial stress, has led to a collapse of capital expenditure in the
energy sector, while a strong U.S. dollar and weakening demand
from emerging markets contributed to stalling exports. Private
consumption remains the main engine of growth and labor
market slack continues to diminish amid a declining
unemployment rate (Figure 1C). However, May employment
figures were weak. Mixed economic data and uncertainty about
global economic and financial developments contributed to the
decision by the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market
Committee to leave policy interest rates unchanged after its June       FIGURE 1C U.S. unemployment
meeting, but the median forecast of its members still suggests two
interest rate hikes later this year.

Euro Area: modest momentum. Recovery in the Euro Area is
proceeding at a moderate pace, supported by an exceptional level
of monetary policy accommodation, low oil prices, and slightly
expansionary fiscal policies. However, weak external demand,
renewed domestic uncertainties, and broad geopolitical risks
continue to weigh on confidence and activity. Private
consumption has been resilient, and improved labor market
conditions should help consolidate gains in 2016. Bank lending
to non-financial corporations is recovering slowly, particularly
among peripheral economies, where deleveraging pressures and

percent in 2016, slightly down from 0.6 percent registered in
2015. Given the underlying weakness in the economy, Prime
Minister Abe announced the government’s intention to postpone
the consumption tax hike to 10 percent from April 2017 to
October 2019. The announcement has not been factored into the
forecast and could result in stronger than expected growth in
2017, but delay a return to a primary fiscal balance.

China: ongoing rebalancing. Baseline projections envisage that
growth in China will continue slowing moderately, to 6.7 percent
in 2016 and to an average of 6.4 percent in 2017-18, with some
rebalancing from investment to consumption (Figure 2C). The
baseline assumes that reforms proceed as expected and that their
impact is smoothed by additional policy action as needed.

overcapacity. Producer price deflation, underway since 2012,
showed signs of bottoming out at the start of 2016, while
industrial profits recovered. The labor market is expected to
remain robust and support private consumption growth. The
shift toward services will continue, facilitated by policies to ease
business regulations. Policy easing in 2016 has been increasingly
focused on fiscal support measures and tax cuts, which have
widened the central government deficit to a six-year high of 2.3
percent of GDP in 2015, and to an expected 3 percent of GDP
in 2016.

EMDEs: diverging prospects. Growth disappointments have
extended into 2016. Aggregate growth for EMDEs is projected at
3.5 percent for 2016, just above the post-crisis low reached in
2015. However, the overall forecast masks a marked difference          FIGURE 2C China: GDP growth and components
between commodity exporters and importers (Figure 3A). After
stagnating last year, growth in commodity-exporting EMDEs for
2016 is expected to be 0.4 percent—substantially below the 1.6
percent forecast in January, reflecting a significant downward
revision in commodity price forecasts, weak global trade, volatile
capital flows, and persistent domestic challenges. In contrast,
growth projections for commodity-importing EMDEs are little
changed at 5.8 percent for 2016, and are expected to be broadly
stable at that level through 2018. Policy buffers continue to erode
in commodity-exporting EMDEs, especially in oil-exporting
countries, reducing their ability to withstand further negative
shocks.

exporters, current account and fiscal balances have deteriorated,      Sources: World Bank, Haver Analytics, European Central Bank, Consensus

deficits have narrowed, foreign exchange reserves are stable or
increasing, and inflation is below target levels. However, high and
rising private sector debt has become an increasing source of
vulnerability for both commodity-exporters and -importers.

LICs: commodity exporters struggling. Growth in low-income
countries (LICs) slowed to 4.5 percent in 2015, with about half
of the countries registering growth below long-term averages
(Figure 3B). Although growth is projected to pick up to 5.3
percent this year, lower commodity prices and persistent security
and political challenges have trimmed 0.9 percentage point from
the previous forecast. While the difficult external environment
confronting LICs will likely continue, growth is still expected to
be supported by resilient investment growth and implementation
of reforms.
                                                                      FIGURE 3B LICs with growth below long-term
Policy buffers: limited. Limited fiscal and monetary policy           average
buffers in many countries is leaving the global economy and
EMDEs in particular less prepared to cope with the
materialization of downside risks. The room for policy
accommodation has increasingly diverged between commodity
importers and exporters (Figures 3C and 4A). Diminishing
foreign reserves and fiscal buffers have already forced many
commodity-exporting EMDEs to tighten policy pro-cyclically. In
commodity-importing EMDEs, even though low commodity
prices have reduced fiscal and external vulnerabilities and
inflation, the scope for expansionary fiscal policy remains limited
because of weak starting positions. In advanced economies, actual
and expected inflation are below targets. Large-scale
unconventional monetary policy may have diminishing
effectiveness over time and raise financial stability risks.
Expansionary fiscal policy could support activity in a number of      FIGURE 3C EMDE policy interest rates
advanced economies in the event of an adverse shock.

Capital flows: weak but stabilizing. Following net outflows in
2015 and a period of high volatility at the start of this year,
capital flows to EMDEs have stabilized, as major central banks
committed to keep interest rates low for longer, and commodity
prices and the U.S. dollar firmed. Bond issuance has ticked
upwards so far in 2016 (Figure 4B), but a sustained recovery in
portfolio and bank lending flows might prove elusive unless
economic fundamentals improve. Liquidity conditions remain
fragile and leave markets prone to sudden reversals. The low
commodity price environment has negatively impacted mining
and exploration investment, and hence prospects for inflows of
foreign direct investment (FDI), in many EMDEs.

June from under $30/bbl in January. A number of unscheduled
outages (Nigeria, Ghana, Canada), stronger-than-expected
demand (China, India, Russia), and a slowing stock build-up
have contributed to a gradual rebalancing in the global oil
market. Oil prices are expected to average $41 per barrel for 2016
(down from an assumption of $51 per barrel in the January
Global Economic Prospects) and $50 per barrel for 2017. Metal
prices are projected to decline 15 percent in 2016 and to rise
moderately in the medium term as the expansion of capacity
slows, but the timing will vary by individual metals. Prices of
agricultural commodities are expected to stabilize in 2016,
supported by favorable weather conditions in the Southern
Hemisphere for most grains and oilseeds—except for rice, which
has been subjected to some El Niño-related disruptions in East
Asia. Upside risks arise from La Niña, which may affect crop

conditions later in 2016.

Risks: increasingly to the downside. In the short term,
discussion around the U.K. referendum on EU membership is
one of several factors that are contributing to current uncertainty
in the global economy. Other risks are associated with
deteriorating conditions among key commodity exporters,
disappointing activity in advanced economies, rising private
sector debt in large emerging markets, and heightened policy and
geopolitical uncertainties. Financial market conditions remain
fragile and subject to sudden bouts of volatility, especially given
the perceived erosion of monetary and fiscal policy space that
would be available to counteract further negative shocks.
Prolonged stagnation in advanced economies and weaker growth
potential in EMDEs could exacerbate protectionist sentiments.
The materialization of these risks could slow the catch-up of         FIGURE 4C Industrial commodity prices

and set back poverty alleviation.

Policy priority: focus on investment. Greater investment—in
infrastructure, productivity enhancing technology, and human
capital—could lay the foundation for stronger growth. Policies
should aim to fill public infrastructure deficiencies, encourage
FDI, strengthen human capital, foster diversification, and reduce
trade barriers. Countries with diminishing fiscal space may be
limited in financing such investments. Reallocating public
expenditure towards well-identified infrastructure needs,
facilitating public-private partnerships, and boosting efforts to
attract FDI could help overcome budgetary constraints.

in Global Growth Forecasts
Measuring uncertainty and risks. A comprehensive assessment
of global economic prospects requires baseline forecasts as well as
an assessment of risks. The latter conveys to policy makers a sense
of the uncertainty prevailing at the time of forecasting, which
might vary with incoming data, past forecast performance, and
changing expectations.. A Special Focus in the June 2016 Global
Economic Prospects: Divergences and Risks presents a new fan chart
approach that illustrates risks surrounding global growth
forecasts. The analysis shows that uncertainty around global
growth forecasts has risen and the balance of risks is increasingly
tilted to the downside. Given the already-weak global growth
prospects in 2016, the probability of global growth falling to or
below 1 percent in 2016 is above its historical average.                FIGURE 5B Uncertainty of global growth forecasts

Introduction of the fan chart. The fan chart derives confidence
intervals around global growth projections by mapping past
forecast errors to changes in the distributions of selected risk
factors, including equity markets, oil prices, and term spreads
across G20 economies. Signals from the market-implied or
consensus forecast distribution of forward-looking indicators are
extracted and weighted to derive the fan chart around global
growth projections. Changes in the degree of uncertainty
(dispersion) and balance of risks (skewness) of underlying risk
factors are used to assess the potential size and direction of
forecast errors at any point in time. The resulting fan chart shows
confidence intervals at 50, 80 and 90 percent probability around
the growth projections in the June 2016 Global Economic
                                                                        FIGURE 5C Contribution of risk factors to forecast

Selected risk factors. Various market- and survey-based
indicators have been suggested as useful measures of forecast
uncertainty. In particular, the pricing of options used by investors
to hedge can provide information on market perceptions of
underlying risks and has predictive power in forecasting future
uncertainty of the underlying assets. The degree of disagreement
among private sector forecasters can also capture diverging signals
on the outlook, and is particularly large around cyclical turning
points. Three risk indicators are used in this exercise: equity price
futures, term spreads (difference between long and short-term
nominal interest rates), and crude oil forward prices, all of which
are correlated with growth prospects.

Prospects: Spillovers amid Weak Growth). Using the estimated
weights, global uncertainty and the balance of risks can be drawn
around the baseline global growth forecast.

Uncertainty: close to decade average. Several episodes of
heightened uncertainty stand out from the analysis of these risk
factors (Figure 5B). The first one is the global financial crisis of
2008-09. Its unexpected severity was associated with financial
market disruptions and a broad-based increase in volatility and
risk aversion. This was also reflected in the rising degree of
uncertainty of all three risk factors (Figure 5C). The second and
third (milder) episodes were around intensifications in the Euro
Area sovereign debt crisis in 2011 and 2012, when financial
market indicators also pointed towards a greater level of                                   FIGURE 6B Contribution of risk factors to the
uncertainty surrounding global growth forecasts. Recent episodes                            balance of risks to global growth
of market stress, such as those associated with the taper tantrum
in 2013, the sharp decline of oil prices since mid-2014, and the
ongoing EMDE slowdown, have also raised forecast uncertainty.
Around these episodes, downside risks to growth have been more
prevalent. Uncertainty about growth forecasts for 2016 and 2017
is estimated to be near the historical median but has increased
since early January 2016, reflecting heightened volatility in oil
prices, term spreads, and equity prices since the start of 2016
(Figure 5C).

Risks: tilted to the downside. The balance of risks to global
growth is tilting increasingly to the downside for 2016 (Figure
6A). Rising downside risks and diminishing upside risks
compared to January forecasts reflect growth concerns in                                    FIGURE 6C Probability of global growth being 1

Overall, the probability of global growth being 1 percentage
point lower than currently projected in 2017 remains around the
average for the decade (17.5 percent), and still well below the
probability in 2008 on the eve of the global financial crisis
(Figure 6C). Moreover, results indicate that the probability of
global growth falling to or below 1 percent, which would likely
trigger a global recession, is below the average of the decade (5
percent) for both 2016 and 2017.1
