    1. Setting Clear Expectations for Teachers
        While there are clear expectations for what students should learn and what       zz||
        teachers are supposed to do in Papua New Guinea, policies could more
        explicitly guide teachers towards instructional improvement.
                                                                                          Emerging
    2. Attracting the Best into Teaching
       While opportunities for career growth may help attract aspiring teachers,         zz||
       working conditions may deter some candidates.
                                                                                          Emerging
    3. Preparing Teachers with Useful Training and Experience
       While substantial practical professional experience is integrated into pre-       zz||
       service training, the minimum level of education required of teachers is lower
       than in most high-performing systems.

    4. Matching Teachers’ Skills with Students’ Needs
       With limited incentives to attract teachers in hard-to-staff schools and no
       incentives to increase teachers of subjects for which there is an instructor
       shortage, teacher distribution may be inefficient or inequitable.
                                                                                          Established
    5. Leading Teachers with Strong Principals
       Policies require principals to support teachers to improve quality, and           zzz|
       principals are empowered to do so through an induction program and ongoing
       training.
                                                                                          Established
    6. Monitoring Teaching and Learning
        A variety of criteria is used to assess teacher performance, consistent with     zzz|
        good practice, but the system makes limited use of large-scale assessments
        to inform policy and teaching.
                                                                                          Emerging
    7. Supporting Teachers to Improve Instruction
        Teachers are required to participate in some professional development, but       zz||
        policies could focus more on practice-oriented training such as teacher
        networks and observation.
                                                                                          Established
    8. Motivating Teachers to Perform
        A teacher’s performance can influence his or her salary increases, and           zzz|
        teachers can be dismissed for offences such as child abuse.

       The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER)
       initiative produces comparative data and knowledge on education
       policies and institutions, with the aim of helping countries
       systematically strengthen their education systems.          SABER
       evaluates the quality of education policies against evidence-based
       global standards, using new diagnostic tools and detailed policy
       data. The SABER country reports give all parties with a stake in
       educational results—from administrators, teachers, and parents to
       policymakers and business people—an accessible, objective
       snapshot showing how well the policies of their country's education
       system are oriented toward ensuring that all children and youth
       learn.

       This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of teacher
       policies.
