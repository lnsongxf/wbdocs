                     Box 1: “Whole of T&C” Country-level approach to gender
In Tanzania, a new Investment Climate Advisory Services Program promotes sustainable and inclusive economic
growth through better economic foundations and increased trade and business growth support. This 5-year
program will help Tanzania improve its competitiveness, attract investment, eliminate barriers inhibiting private
sector growth and increase access to global markets. The entire program will integrate gender dimensions from
the design stage so that policies proposed include consideration of impact on women and youth and data
collection can be standardized throughout the life of the program to properly assess the impact of increasing
women’s participation in Tanzania’s economic growth.

Gender-informed programming is a priority in the T&C portfolio for Pakistan, with a range of gender-informed
lending operations, analytics and advisory services designed to support women’s participation in the country’s
growth, development and competitiveness. Examples include:

       Punjab Jobs & Competitiveness PforR program supports women, especially in industrial estates, to
        improve compliance with duty free access requirements for EU markets, which require measures to
        address discrimination against women and encourage female employment.
       Punjab Investment Climate Advisory program assists the government to improve the provincial
        business environment, including for women.
       WomenX program builds capacity for enterprise growth and addresses constraints women
        entrepreneurs face through business education, networking, and mentoring. This pilot has been
        underway in Karachi since 2014, and activities were initiated in Lahore and Peshawar in 2016.

Likewise, enhancing economic opportunities for women entrepreneurs and workers is highlighted in the T&C
program in Bangladesh. As part of program design, the Bangladesh Investment Climate Fund (BICF) Phase 2
embeds gender analysis in all forthcoming diagnostics, and includes gender as a dimension of identifying reform
opportunities. Potential gender-informed and gender targeted actions include conducting value chain analysis in
targeted sectors, addressing regulatory implementation gaps for women in business, improving incentives for
women entrepreneurs and skills for female labor force participants, and addressing wage gaps. The results
framework aims to include gender targets/milestones, and will measure project impact on women’s economic
empowerment as entrepreneur, wage laborer, and business leader through qualitative and quantitative impact
assessments.
Finally, in Belarus, the Belarus Investment Climate Advisory Project – which aims to accelerate SME growth
through better policies and their implementation including at the subnational level, is piloting a gender-targeted
initiative in the regions of Brest and Grodno. The project aims to strengthening business skills through the skills
development program for aspiring women entrepreneurs, and includes an assessment of knowledge gaps within
specific segments of aspiring women entrepreneurs. The goal is to narrow the knowledge/skill gap among
Belarusian female entrepreneurs in these two regions by providing participants with customized training
(including the localization of the WBG training materials developed for projects such as WomenX). The pilot is
working with public and private organizations that can support local women-led start-ups.

                                             Box 2: Rating Methodologies

In the World Bank, a systematic review for gender activities is conducted retrospectively by the Gender CCSA for active
projects across all Global Practices. An aggregated rating system is used which captures three dimensions: Analysis,
Actions, and Monitoring, all of which are assigned based on project design.
         The Analysis flag is designed to indicate projects that identify and analyze gender issues; refer specifically to gender
          diagnostics or gender disaggregated assessments; and/or reflect consultations with individuals or NGOs that deal
          with gender themes.
         The Actions flag is designed to capture projects that include specific actions that address the needs of individuals
          based on gender; propose gender-specific safeguards in social/environmental assessments or resettlement
          frameworks; or show how interventions are going to narrow existing gender disparities.
         The Monitoring flag is intended to capture projects that include specific gender and sex-disaggregated indicators
          in the results framework; and/or propose an evaluation strategy that includes an analysis of the project’s specific
          gender impact.
         Additionally, the World Bank system includes a binary indicator on whether at least one gender component is
          included, thus making the project “gender-informed.”

The IFC Rating system is conducted by project teams, and it identifies 6 dimensions which capture the nature of a gender
intervention:
         A Diagnostic flag, which is intended to capture whether the project included a study or review of the role played by
          gender in the project context.
         A Design flag intended to capture whether the project includes targeted outreach and/or training for women.
         A Design flag intended to capture whether the project promotes inclusiveness, dialogue and feedback mechanisms
          for women.
         A Design flag to indicate whether the project includes tools, products or design components to enhance
          opportunities and benefits specifically for women
         A Design flag to indicate removal of regulatory barriers for women entrepreneurs and/or promotion of regulatory
          reforms that will disproportionately benefit women
         A Tracking flag on whether the project monitors gender-related development outcomes and impacts
         Additionally, the IFC system includes project expenses related to gender and an overall “Benefits Women” flag.

New methodology for assessing World Bank Group performance on gender and development
A new Gender tag is being designed under the auspices of the WBG Gender Strategy which will shift the focus toward
measuring the quality and results of Bank operations, especially sector-specific outcomes, in closing gender gaps. Teams will
be prompted to think about project-relevant gender gaps and how they align with the country engagement framework. They
will be asked to select specific indicators to track the activity’s outcomes or impacts. During implementation, teams will
report against these indicators in the Implementation Status and Results Report. At project completion, the Implementation
Completion and Results Report will rate the project’s performance in closing targeted gender gaps.
