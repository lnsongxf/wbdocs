         1. Health-Related School Policies
            School health is included in the National Economic and Empowerment
            Strategy (NEEDS). A national budget for school health exists in both the
            health and education sectors. A situation analysis was conducted that
                                                            school-aged children,
            identified health and nutrition problems amongst
                                                            listed gaps in existing school
            gathered statistics on school participation, and
            nutrition and health services. There is a monitoring and evaluation plan for
            school health that is integrated into a wider national monitoring system.


         2. Safe, Supportive School Environments
            The need for safe water provision and sanitation facilities is recognized, but                
            national coverage has not been achieved. There are mechanisms in place to
            respond to all forms of institutional violence in schools.


         3. School-Based Health and Nutrition Services
            A situation analysis was undertaken, identifying the need for school-based                    
            screening and referral to remedial services. However, the government has not
            taken any actions to attempt to meet this need.


         4. Skills-Based Health Education
            Nigeria’s school health curriculum is fully developed. All schools teach this                 
            curriculum. There are participatory approaches integrated into the national
            curriculum, but they are not effective.

gathering systematic and verifiable information about
the quality of a country’s policies through a SABERͲ
School Health Questionnaire. This dataͲcollecting

disseminate good practice and knowledge sharing. This
holistic and integrated assessment of how the overall
