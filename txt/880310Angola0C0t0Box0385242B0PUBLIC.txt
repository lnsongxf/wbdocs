I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:

       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Angola
        perceive the Bank;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Angola regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Angola;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Angola;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank ’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in Angola; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Angola.

       Use data to help inform the Angola country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
In March-June 2012, 584 stakeholders of the World Bank in Angola were invited to provide their
opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President; the office of the
Prime Minister; the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry,
ministerial department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World
Bank-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials or staff; bilateral and multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs; community-based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the
judiciary branch. A total of 119 stakeholders participated in the country survey (20%).

Respondents received questionnaires via courier, post or email and returned them accordingly.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Angola; their overall attitudes toward the
Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge; working with the
World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Angola; and the Bank’s communication and information
sharing in Angola.

Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues facing Angola: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Angola is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, and which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth in Angola.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Angola, the extent to which the Bank meets
   Angola’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the extent to which the
   Bank should seek or does seek to influence the global development agenda. Respondents
   were also asked to rate their agreement with various statements regarding the Bank’s work
   and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development partner. Furthermore,
   respondents were asked to indicate the sectoral areas on which it would be most productive
   for the Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest values and greatest weaknesses in its
   work, the most and least effective instruments in helping to reduce poverty in Angola, with
   which groups the Bank should collaborate more, and to what reasons respondents attributed
   failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve sustainable development results in Angola, and the Bank’s
   level of effectiveness across thirty-five development areas, such as economic growth, public
   sector governance, basic infrastructure, social protection, and others.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate the areas on which the
   Bank should focus its research efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s
   knowledge/research, including how significant of a contribution it makes to development
   results, its technical quality, and the Bank’s effectiveness at providing linkage to non-Bank
   expertise.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank ’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, and increasing Angola’s institutional capacity.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Angola: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Angola’s development in the near future, and to
   indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Angola.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate where they
   get information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, their access to the Internet, and their usage and evaluation of the
   Bank’s websites. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to
   Information policy, past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement
   that they use more data from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy.
   Respondents were also asked to indicate their level of agreement that they know how to find
   information from the Bank and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Angola, and their geographic location.
When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from the 103 respondents (22% response rate) who completed the country
survey in FY 2009. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
    For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the office of the President
       and the office of the Prime Minister were combined with respondents from the office of
       Minister; respondents from multilateral agencies were combined with those from bilateral
       agencies; respondents from the financial sector and private banks were combined with
       those from private sector organizations; and the few respondents from the office of
       Parliamentarian, local government, independent government institutions, and the
       judiciary branch were included in the “Other” category. Note that respondents from
       NGOs, community based organizations, private foundations, and faith-based groups were
       combined under the “CSO” category. There were no respondents from PMUs and trade
       unions.

       Responses across both geographic locations for all country survey questions can be found
        in the Appendix C (see page 79). Only significant differences between geographic
        locations in response to indicator questions will be discussed in the body of this report.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank
        Across all respondents, familiarity with the World Bank received a mean rating of 4.8;
         this was statistically similar to the mean ratings received in the FY ’0 9 country survey
         (4.8).
          It should be noted that respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were
           significantly, strongly correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall
           effectiveness in Angola and the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
           development results; respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were also
           significantly, moderately correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s relevance to
           Angola’s development.

         employees of ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies indicated that
         Angola was headed in the right direction. Respondents from CSOs, the media, and

         to indicate that they were not sure whether Angola was headed in the right or wrong
         direction.

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)
       There were significant stakeholder differences in their ratings of the Bank’s effectiveness
        across two of these thirty-four areas. Consultants/contractors on Bank supported projects
        and respondents from CSOs had the highest ratings across these areas whereas
        respondents from private sector organizations/financial sector/private banks tended to
        have significantly lower ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness acr oss these areas. Those
        areas with significant stakeholder group differences were:
             “Environmental sustainability”; and
             “Climate change”.

       There were significant differences between geographic locations across six of these
        thirty-four areas. In all six instances, respondents from Luanda had significantly lower
        ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness across these areas than respondents from other
        locations. Those areas with significant differences were:
             “Health”;
             “Global information and communications technology”;
             “Monitoring and evaluation”;
             “Financial markets”;

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable development results in Angola, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-four specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of
effectiveness in one specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s
overall effectiveness or perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Angola. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                Labor markets/job creation/employment;
                Domestic private sector development;
                Equality of opportunity;
                Global integration; and
                Law and justice.

       Achieving Sustainable Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest
        Pearson Product-Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results in
        Angola, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results. The
        areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             Equality of opportunity;
             Economic growth; and
             Education.

Overall Perceptions
         Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly higher levels of agreement

          imposes reasonable conditions on its lending compared to respondents from the FY ’09
          country survey.
         Respondents across all stakeholder groups had statistically similar levels of agreement
          regarding all of these aspects of how the Bank operates.
         There were significant differences between geographic locations across three of these
          aspects: “Where country systems are adequate, the World Bank makes appropriate use of
          them”; “The World Bank’s teams and visits are well coordinated”; and “The World
          Bank’s "Safeguard Policy" requirements are reasonable”. Respondents from Luanda had
          significantly lower levels of agreement with these statements than respondents from other

work is perceived. This is one tool the World Bank uses to assess the views of its critical stakeholders. With this
understanding, the World Bank hopes to develop more effective strategies, outreach and programs that support
development in Angola. The World Bank commissioned an independent firm to oversee the logistics of this
effort in Angola. This ensures anonymity and confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid. To complete the survey,
