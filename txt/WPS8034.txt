Financial flows across countries have increased dramatically over the past decades
(Bank of International Settlements 2010). Nevertheless, the global financial market is
still far from being a fully integrated market due to pervasive frictions that hamper the
flow of finance (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti 2008). The literature assigns a key role to
informational frictions. In particular, gravity variables that affect the extent of
informational frictions (e.g., lower distance, common language, common legal origin,
etc.) have consistently been shown to increase bilateral financial flows and to mitigate
home bias (Coeurdacier and Rey 2013). Portes and Rey (2005) and Lane and Milesi-
Ferretti (2008) show this for cross-border equity flows. Aviat and Coeurdacier (2007)
extend the analysis to bank loans, equity flows and bond holdings.1
    This paper posits that the cross-border movement of people reduces informational
frictions across countries and stimulates bilateral financial flows. The reason is that
migration from country i to country j has the potential to reveal information on
country i which is valuable for investors in country j that seek to invest in country i
(e.g., information on the characteristics of the home country’s financial and political
institutions). In addition, migrants create or integrate into international business and
financial networks, thereby enhancing financial transactions between their home and
host countries.
    Anecdotal evidence suggests that this channel is indeed operative. For instance,
the Bank of China owns a subsidiary in the US. The core business of the US
subsidiary is lending to Chinese firms. About 90% of the employees working at the
New York branch are locals and most of them are ethnically Chinese (Wall Street
Journal 2016). Similarly, the Turkish bank Akbank owns a subsidiary in Germany,
which hosts a large community of migrants from Turkey. The CEO of the German
subsidiary in Frankfurt was born in Turkey in 1963, and she moved to Germany as a
young child (Frankfurter Rundschau 2015). The German subsidiary, named Akbank
AG, lends mainly to “multinationals based in Turkey” (Akbank annual report 2015:
62). Akbank AG receives finance from international banking institutions (Global
Trade Review 2015), which indicates that the bank funnels funds from a wide range
of global investors into Turkey. This evidence is consistent with the view that
migrants working in financial institutions at their host countries help to facilitate the
transfer of financial flows to their home countries.

    In this paper, we present empirical results that support this argument. In doing so,
we follow a growing literature demonstrating the role of migration in facilitating trade
(Gould 1994, Head and Ries 1998, Rauch and Trindade 2002, Rauch and Casella
2003, Combes et al. 2005, Iranzo and Peri 2009, Parsons and Vezina 2017,
Felbermayr and Toubal 2012, Felbermayr, Jung and Toubal 2010), FDI (Kugler and
Rapoport 2007, Leblang 2010, Javorcik et al. 2011, Aubry et al. 2016), and the
diffusion of knowledge (Kerr 2008, Agrawal et al. 2011, Bahar and Rapoport 2017).2
The paper most closely related to ours is Leblang (2010) who proposes a comparative
analysis of the effect of migration on FDI and portfolio asset flows. Regarding the
latter, Leblang (2010) focuses on the main effect, which we believe is hard to properly
identify, while we focus on differential effects by degree of information imperfection
as discussed below.
    We test the hypothesis that migration affects international financial flows. We
proceed as follows. First, we introduce migration into an otherwise standard gravity
model of financial flows, following Martin and Rey (2004) and Aviat and
Coeurdacier (2007). As a general proposition, we expect the effect of migration on
financial flows to be larger where informational imperfections are more pervasive.
This is supposedly the case for country pairs that differ in terms of cultural proximity,
or for investment in developing countries compared to developed countries. The effect
of migration should also depend on migrants’ skills. In particular, highly educated
migrants are more likely to be part of international business and financial networks,
and, hence, likely more able to transfer information and reduce bilateral transaction
costs. Hence, we expect their influence on financial flows to be larger.
    Our empirical strategy relies on the estimation of differential effects along a
number of dimensions: a skill dimension, a cultural dimension, an asset-type
dimension, and an income status dimension. We start by showing that migration has a
significant positive impact on international bank loans. When we distinguish between
skilled and unskilled migrants, we find consistently a larger coefficient for skilled
migration. For example, when we introduce skilled and unskilled migrants jointly into
a gravity model of international bank loans, we find a significant positive elasticity of
skilled migrants of about 0.2 while no significant effect is found for unskilled
migrants. We take this result as initial supportive evidence of our conjectures.

    2. See Docquier and Rapoport (2012) and Rapoport (2016) for recent surveys of the literature on
migration networks, globalization, and development.

                                                3
   Next, we allow for the effect of migration to vary with the degree of cultural
proximity. We find that the effect of migration is nearly zero for country pairs that
share common language, colonial history, or legal origin, and positive otherwise.
These results are consistent with the view that the potential for migration to alleviate
informational frictions is higher for culturally distant countries. In addition, we expect
the effect of migration to be larger where information imperfections are more
pervasive, that is, in developing countries. And indeed, when we interact our
migration variables with a dummy for developing country status, we find a magnified
effect coming mostly from the extensive margin. Furthermore, when we distinguish
between investments in long- versus short-term bonds, we find a stronger impact on
investment in long-term bonds issued by developing countries, which is arguably a
riskier type of investment.
   Taken together, these differential effects are in line with the theoretical arguments
outlined above and provide supportive evidence that migration contributes to lower
informational frictions across countries. The main concern in this analysis is the
possibility of omitted variables governing the joint pattern of emigration and reverse
financial flows. However, to be able to explain the entire set of results, a possible
confounder should explain not just the main effect but also the differential effects for
skilled versus unskilled migrants, culturally close versus distant country-pairs,
developed versus developing countries, and long- versus short-term bonds, as well as
the time structure of our results. We find the existence of such a variable unlikely.




                                   I. METHODOLOGY

Our main assumption is that financial investments are informational sensitive. In other
words, investors tend to invest more in places they know better. The well-known
implication of this assumption is the home bias in financial flows, which has been
found repeatedly in the literature (Coeurdacier and Rey 2013). Given these
information frictions, the presence of migrants is expected to stimulate bilateral
financial flows. Specifically, migrants facilitate the flow of information from their
home countries to their host countries.
   We build on the gravity model developed by Okawa and van Wincoop (2012). In
particular, we assume that investors in foreign markets perceive higher volatility of

                                            4
asset returns compared to domestic markets. This assumption gives rise to a gravity
equation where the log of bilateral financial flows depends on the log of information
frictions. As shown by Okawa and van Wincoop (2012), this specification depends on
the assumptions that there are no borrowing constraints and that asset returns are
uncorrelated across countries, except for global or regional shocks, against which
investors can fully hedge their portfolios. To the extent that these assumptions do not
fully hold in our context, we view the gravity model as an approximation of the true
model. Importantly, our identification strategy, as explained in more detail below,
builds on differential effects rather than main effects. In this regard, we assume that
deviations from the conditions of Okawa and van Wincoop (2012) that bias the main
coefficients do not affect the difference between the coefficients (i.e., the differential
effect).
    Information frictions depend on a set of bilateral variables such as distance,
common language, etc. We test the hypothesis that the information frictions between
country j and country i are alleviated by migration from country i to j. In particular,
we posit that migrants from country i that live in country j convey important
information about country i to investors in country j. This information reduces
investment risk and enhances financial flows from country j to country i.
    A simple gravity model is likely to suffer from an omitted variable bias. Hence,
we focus our analysis on differential effects across a number of dimensions. The first
dimension is the general level of education of the migrants. To become involved in
the financial sector, migrants need to have high cognitive skills. First, they are
expected to have deep knowledge about their home country economy and be able to
gain new knowledge constantly. Second, they need to be able to exchange this
knowledge with the financial sector of their host country in a credible way. This task
requires high communication skills. Third, skilled migrants are more likely to serve as
liaison agents, or reference, and allow for reaching out to the business and financial
community in their home country. Hence, the migration effect is likely to be stronger
when migrants are more skilled. We test this differential effect by the following
regression:


                                                    
log Loans ji  1 log Skilled Migrantsij   2 log Unskilled Migrantsij      (1)
                     
 3 log Distanceij   4 X ij  ci  c j  òij .


                                                    5
Loansji denotes the stock of international bank loans from country j to country i as of
2000. Skilled Migrantsij is the stock of skilled migrants (i.e., with college education)
from origin country i living in destination country j, and Unskilled Migrantsij refers to
unskilled migrants (i.e., with below-college education). Hence, our first empirical test
is to estimate the differential effect of skilled-unskilled migration from country i to
country j on financial flows in the reverse direction, namely, from country j to country
i. The regression controls for the distance between the two countries as well as for
other variables that are associated with cultural and economic proximity, denoted
collectively by Xij. In addition, we control for origin and destination-country fixed
effects, which are denoted by ci and cj.
   Identifying differential effects is a common strategy to deal with endogeneity
problems (e.g., Rajan and Zingales 1998). The identification assumption in this case is
that the estimate of the differential effect α1 – α2 is unbiased, while the estimates of α1
and α2 separately might be biased.3 Indeed, this assumption implies that the bias of α1
and α2 is in the same direction and of the same magnitude. Moreover, if the bias is
upward, we assume that it is not too large, so that the true effects are not negative. We
deal with these limitations by exploring various dimensions of the data, as explained
below. In most cases, we find that migration is associated with stronger financial
flows between countries for which information is most needed. We find it unlikely
that the overall set of results is produced by omitted variables.
   The second dimension that we exploit is the cultural proximity between the two
countries. Since migrants alleviate informational frictions, their impact on financial
flows should be strongest for country pairs that exhibit high informational frictions.
For instance, migrants are likely to have a stronger impact on financial flows between
the US and Egypt than between the US and Canada, simply because informational
frictions in the latter case are very weak. We test this dimension by the following
regression:


                                       
log Loans ji  1 log Migration ij * Cultural Proximityij          
                              
 2 log Migration ij   3 log Cultural Proximityij                  (2)
 4   log  Distance    X  c  c
                    ij       5   ij   i   j    òij .

   Here, Cultural Proximity is an indicator for the cultural proximity of countries i
and j. It is measured by three alternative variables: common language, colonizer, and
legal origin.4 Our hypothesis is that migration should have a stronger effect on
financial flows between countries that are culturally more distant. We test this
hypothesis in section III. As explained, we also expect stronger effects when the
migrants’ homecountry is a developing country, and, in a last set of regressions,
reported in section IV, we interact our variable of interest with a non-OECD dummy.
   Finally, we also look at differences in the underlying investment risk. Specifically,
we examine investment in developing versus developed countries and find that the
former is more sensitive to migration than the latter. We also examine investment in
long- versus short-term bonds, assuming that the former is riskier than the latter. We
find that the migration coefficient is most significant for investment in long-term
bonds issued by developing countries.
   Our empirical analysis focuses on the effects of migrants on financial flows from
their host country to their home country. However, a similar effect may work in the
opposite direction. Namely, a migrant coming from the US to Egypt may encourage
US investors to invest in Egypt for the exact same reasons (i.e., by reducing the
informational frictions between the two countries). Our sample is less suitable for
testing this direction, because we have data on financial flows from the small set of
OECD countries to the rest of the world, whereas the main migration flows are in the
opposite direction. Indeed, when we reduce our sample to country pairs where
migration and financial investments flow in the same direction, the sample size drops
by around 75%. Therefore, in this study, we concentrate on the effects of migration on
financial flows to their home countries.
   To summarize, we estimate differential effects along four dimensions: (i) skilled
versus unskilled migrants; (ii) cultural proximity; (iii) long- versus short-term bonds;
and (iv) developed versus developing countries. These dimensions form the basis of
our empirical strategy.




   4. That is, in our paper, Cultural Proximity is not a composite index.

                                          II. DATA

The migration data come from Artuc, Docquier, Özden, and Parsons (2015) data set,
the last extension of the Docquier and Marfouk (2006) dataset, which includes
bilateral data on migration by country of birth,5 skill category (skilled versus
unskilled, the former having college education) and gender for 195 sending/receiving
countries in 1990 and 2000. The main additional novelty is that the dataset now
captures South-South migration based mainly on observations (taken from Özden et
al. 2011) and occasionally on estimated data points (for the skill structure).6
    Our financial data come from two commonly used sources. Data on international
bank loans are from the Consolidated Banking Statistics published by the Bank of
International Settlements (BIS). These data capture the worldwide consolidated
positions of internationally active banking groups headquartered in the reporting
countries. The data include the claims of reporting banks’ foreign affiliates but
exclude intragroup positions. Nationality of the borrower is determined by the
immediate borrower with whom the bank contracts to lend (see Bank of International
Settlements [2015] for more details). Our main specification refers to the year 2000,
for which we have 17 lending countries, 175 borrowing countries, and a total of 1,628
country pairs (observations) with positive loan values, given missing data. In addition,
we take data on investment in short-term bonds and long-term bonds from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey
(CPIS).
    Further details on the sample and summary statistics are reported in the
supplemental appendix (tables S.1-S.4).
    Our migration data include two years, 1990 and 2000. Ideally, we would like to
estimate a panel equation, but since we only have two time periods, this is not
feasible. Alternatively, we could run a difference equation. However, this would
introduce a serious endogeneity problem. Specifically, the sample period is
characterized by the formation of many new countries, mainly in Eastern Europe.
These countries experienced strong outflows of migrants, and strong inflows of
foreign investments, to build the new economies. This phenomenon introduces
endogeneity to the sample, which is difficult to control for. In addition, both our main

dependent variable, loans, and main variable of interest, migration, suffer from a
measurement error problem, which is exacerbated when moving to first differences.
Since our data do not allow a proper panel data analysis or a difference regression, we
choose to focus on the cross-section dimension of our data. As a result, the analysis
concentrates on differential effects rather than on the main effects.
    We construct a cross section that minimizes as much as possible endogeneity
concerns. First, we take a lag of ten years between the migration data and the financial
data. Hence, we regress financial flows in 2000 on migration data in 1990. This way
we reduce short-term endogeneity, such as new countries that were established in the
1990s and experienced an outflow of migrants and an inflow of foreign investments.
    Second, we choose as our benchmark results the regression of financial
investments in 2000 on migration in 1990, although we also ran similar regressions
for 2010 financial data on 2000 migration data. The reason we focus on the earlier
period is that our dataset indicates that many country pairs had no financial
investments in the 1980s and started their investment connections only in the 1990s.
For instance, if we restrict our sample to 16 countries that were active in foreign
lending in 1985, we obtain around 1,400 lending-borrowing country pairs between
1985 and 1992. The number of country pairs increased significantly during the 1990s
and reached 1,877 by the end of the decade. By contrast, in the following decade,
there was no significant change in the number of country pairs.7 Part of the increase in
lending-borrowing country pairs in the 1990s is due to new countries that were
formed in the 1990s, and part is due to a rise in the volume of international loans. In
this respect, the migration stock in 1990 can be regarded as a predetermined variable
for country pairs that had no lending activity in the 1980s and started to lend in the
1990s.8
    We complete our dataset with gravity variables taken from Aviat and Coeurdacier
(2007) and CEPII (CHELEM dataset). Trade data are taken from Feenstra et al.
(2005).




    7. In 2010, the number of country pairs reached 1,908.
    8. However, our results are fully robust to the use of data for the 2000-2010 period. Note that
measurement errors might be larger for the earlier period due to the appearance of new countries in the
1990s.

                                                  9
                                             III. RESULTS

We build on the specification of Aviat and Coeurdacier (2007), who studied a similar
regression without the migration variable. We include in the regression source and
destination fixed-effects as advocated by Okawa and van Wincoop (2012). Table 1
presents the first set of results. Column (1) reports a standard gravity equation without
migration, and column (2) introduces the migration variable. Country fixed-effects are
included in columns (3) and (4). The migration variable is highly significant, implying
a strong correlation of migration with international loans.9 Following Okawa and van
Wincoop (2012), column (5) drops the fiscal variables and stock market correlation.
This does not affect much the results. On the other hand, we gain a much larger
sample with 17 lending countries, 175 borrowing countries and a total of 1,628
observations (country pairs), given missing data and zeros, which is twice the original
sample size. The migration coefficient remains highly significant in the Poisson
regression proposed by Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006), which is reported in
column (6).10 These results are robust to different sets of fixed-effects and further
control variables, i.e., remittances and political institutions (appendix table S.5).
    We now turn to heterogeneous effects along a number of dimensions.

                                Skilled Versus Unskilled Migration

The significance of migration in the gravity regressions of foreign loans suggests that
migrants alleviate informational frictions between their host and home countries.
Arguably, to be able to perform such a role, migrants should have the required skills
and connections that allow them to communicate efficiently with the financial
markets in their host country and connect them with their home countries. Hence, one
would expect the migration effect to work mainly through skilled migrants. We test

     9. The coefficients of the gravity variables change to some extent (compare column 1 with column
2), because the migration variable is correlated with the gravity variables (e.g., see Artuc et al. [2015]).
In fact, Artuc et al. (2015), which is our source of migration data, use gravity regressions to interpolate
missing data.
     10. The Poisson estimator increases the sample size by adding observations with zero loans.
However, the rise in the sample size is moderate for two reasons. First, we include only country pairs
that have positive migration flows. Second, countries that do not borrow from at least two lending
countries are dropped due to the fixed effects. Hence, conditional on having positive migration and at
least two lending countries per each borrowing country, the share of country pairs with zero loans is
roughly 11 percent of the sample. In addition, the Poisson estimator imposes adding-up constraints and
gives a larger weight to larger observations (Fally 2015).

this hypothesis by comparing the coefficients of skilled migrants versus unskilled
migrants in the gravity model.
    Table 2 re-estimates the gravity model by distinguishing between skilled and
unskilled migrants. Skilled migrants are defined as migrants with at least college
education. The results strongly indicate that the migration effect is driven primarily by
skilled migrants, because only skilled migration is significant. This holds for the OLS
(column 1) as well as for the Poisson (column 2) regressions. The hypothesis that
these coefficients are identical is rejected at significance levels of 5% for the OLS and
15% for the Poisson estimators. Note that the correlation between skilled migration
and unskilled migration is 0.93, which is extremely high. Consequently, the standard
errors of the estimated coefficients are large, which explains the relatively high P-
values.
    Columns (3)–(5) report the robustness of the results to interactions of the
borrowing country dummy i with a dummy for groups of lending countries g. We
consider three groups of lending countries: Anglo-Saxon countries, continental
Western European countries, and the rest of the world. To do so, we introduce a fixed-
effect specific to i and g in addition to the fixed effect of the lending country j. This is
a highly demanding test, because it ignores all variations in loans to country i between
lending countries from different groups. Namely, country i must borrow from at least
two different countries that belong to the same group in order to contribute to the
regression results. As a result, the size of the sample falls by about 10%.
    The small sample size and limited within-group variation, together with the high
correlation between skilled and unskilled migration, eliminate the skill differential
effect obtained in columns (1) and (2). To resolve this problem, we extend the sample
size as much as possible, by using log 1  x  instead of log x on both sides of the

regression. This transformation introduces zero values for skilled and unskilled
migration, which are omitted from the previous specifications. Consequently, the
sample size increases from 1,303 to 1,833, as reported in column (5). In that extended
sample, we are able to replicate our initial result that the skilled coefficient is positive,
significant, and higher than the unskilled one.
    One may be concerned that the effect of migration on financial flows captured in
our regressions may, in fact, be mediated through trade. Since migrants stimulate
trade and trade affects financial flows, a correlation between migration and financial


                                             11
flows is expected even if there is no causal effect. However, to explain our differential
effects for skilled versus unskilled migrants, it should be the case that skilled
migration has a stronger effect on trade than unskilled migration. We tested this
hypothesis by running the same regressions on export (instead of loans) and found no
difference between skilled and unskilled migration (appendix table S.6).11
   The skill dimension is explored further below.

                                       Cultural Proximity

We next examine the migration effect on countries that are culturally close to each
other compared to countries that are culturally distant. Our conjecture is that
migration should have a stronger effect on financial flows between countries that are
culturally more distant. We therefore add interaction terms between migration and
cultural proximity variables, such as common language, common colonizer, and
common legal origin. We expect a negative coefficient on these interaction terms. We
also include interactions of migration with distance, because distance is also a proxy
for information frictions. These interactions should have positive coefficients, as
migration should be more important for distant countries.
   Table 3 presents the results for the Poisson regressions (similar results are
obtained with OLS, appendix table S.7). The results show clearly that the migration
effect is smaller for countries that are culturally or physically closer to one another.
Hence, the presence of migrants is mostly critical for financial flows between
countries that are culturally/physically more distant. Interestingly, the interaction with
language turns out the most significant and robust among the cultural interactions and
remains significant when all the interactions are included together in column (4).

                                Financial Flows Versus Trade

The lower panel of table 3 presents similar regressions for exports (instead of loans).
Overall, the interaction of migration with physical distance remains positive and
significant in the export regressions as in the loan regressions. However, the
interactions with the cultural variables are either insignificant or have the wrong sign.
For instance, the interaction with language in the export regression (column 1) is
positive rather than negative. This stands in contrast to the loan regressions where the
interaction with language is significantly negative. This test indicates that the

   11. Aubry et al. (2016) found a similar result on a much larger sample.

                                                 12
differential effect of migration on financial flows across different levels of cultural
proximity reflects informational frictions that are stronger for financial flows than for
exports.

                                 Skill-Proximity Interaction

In this section, we ask whether the stronger effect of skilled migrants is magnified
when home and host countries are more distant physically and culturally; that is, we
look for the interaction between skill and distance (Grogger and Hanson 2011 and
Beine et al. 2011).12 Since informational frictions increase with (physical and cultural)
distance, we expect that the presence of skilled migrants will be even more important
when countries are more distant. We therefore introduce an interaction between the
stocks of skilled and unskilled migrants, rather than the total stock of migrants, with
our measures of physical and cultural distance. The results are shown in table 4. The
coefficient of the interaction for skilled migration and distance is larger than for
unskilled migration across all specifications (see columns [1]–[4]). Namely, the
impact of skilled migration on financial flows is rising with distance faster than the
impact of unskilled migration. Similarly, interactions between skilled/unskilled
migration and common language/colonizer/legal are in general more negative for
skilled migrants (except for one case in column [4]). These results suggest that skilled
migration is more effective than unskilled migration between more distant countries.
Similar findings are obtained in OLS regressions (appendix table S.8).

                             Short-Term and Long-Term Bonds

Table 5 replicates the baseline migration regression of table 1 (column 5) using
different financial data. The dependent variable is cross-country investment in short-
term bonds and long-term bonds instead of international bank loans. The migration
coefficient is positive and significant in most specifications, which shows the
robustness of the results to the use of various financial data. The results for short-term
bonds are somewhat weaker, though not statistically different from the long-term
bonds. We explore this point further in section IV, where we distinguish between
developed and developing countries.

                    IV. DEVELOPED VERSUS DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

The migration effect is likely to be more pronounced for developing countries, where
information imperfections are more pervasive. Migrants who move from these
countries to other countries convey with them information on their origin countries
that is otherwise hard to obtain. We test this hypothesis by adding interactions of the
migration variable with a dummy variable for developing country status.13
   Table 6 re-estimates the benchmark regression by allowing the migration
coefficient to vary across developed and developing countries. Here we see a
difference between the OLS estimator and the Poisson estimator. While the OLS
estimator shows positive though not statistically significant effects for the interaction,
the Poisson estimator is positive and highly significant. Recall that the OLS estimator
omits country pairs with zero value for the dependent variable (loans, in this case). By
contrast, the Poisson estimator accounts for the zero values. This suggests that the
significance of the interaction in the Poisson regression is driven mostly by the
extensive margin.
   This is apparent from the composition of the sample. In the OLS regression there
are 427 developed borrowing countries. This number hardly changes in the Poisson
regression. However, the number of developing borrowing countries increases from
1,024 in the OLS sample to 1,157 in the Poisson sample. Namely, the main change
between the two samples is the introduction of new country pairs, where the
borrowing country is a developing country that does not borrow from the lending
country (hence the value of loans is zero for that pair).
   A similar result is obtained when we re-estimate the bond regressions by adding
an interaction with a developing country dummy. The results are reported in table 7.
Again, the OLS estimator does not reveal any pattern across developed/developing
countries (see columns [1] and [2]). However, the Poisson estimator, presented in
columns (3) and (4), shows clearly that investment in long-term bonds in a developing
country is larger if the investing country hosts migrants from the developing country.
This effect is mute when we look at short-term bonds, which we judge as less
information sensitive than long-term bonds. Note that the Poisson regression

                                              14
introduces 728 new country pairs with developing borrowing countries, compared to
the OLS sample, and only 248 country pairs with developed borrowing countries.
Hence, here again the main effect comes from the extensive margin.
    Overall, these results are consistent with our hypothesis that migrants enhance the
flow of information across countries, which facilitates cross-border financial flows.14




                                         V. CONCLUSION

This paper investigates the role of migration as a determinant of international
financial flows. We introduce migration into a standard gravity model and find a
strong correlation with financial flows. Our results are consistent with the view that
migration affects bilateral financial flows through the information channel. Indeed, we
find that the effect of migration on financial flows is strongest where informational
problems are more acute. This is the case when we compare country pairs
characterized by different levels of cultural proximity (e.g., countries sharing versus
not sharing a common language), migrants’ source countries characterized by more
information imperfections (i.e., developing countries), asset types that differ in terms
of informational sensitivity (e.g., short-term versus long-term bonds issued by
developing countries) and types of migrants that differ in their ability to disseminate
information across borders (e.g., high-skill versus low-skill migrants). Overall, our
results suggest that migration contributes to reduce home bias and information
frictions across countries.

    14. When we interact the dummy variable of developing countries with skilled and unskilled
migration separately, the main result is preserved, mainly in the Poisson regressions. Namely,
migration is more important a determinant of financial flows for developing countries. However, we
cannot identify robust differences between skilled and unskilled migrants. These results are available

     This table presents the country sample of the regression in Table 1, Column (5). The other OLS regressions use subsets of this sample, depending on
     missing data. Poisson regressions may include few more borrowing countries due to the inclusion of zero values. The sample of Table 5 is diﬀerent and
     presented in Table S.2. The parentheses show the number of observations where the country is a lending country (the left column) or a borrowing country
     (the other columns). For example, the US is a lender in 145 observations and a borrower in 16 observations. Since the number of lending countries is
     much smaller than the number of borrowing countries, a lending country lends to many borrowers but a borrowing country borrows from few lenders in
     this sample.

  Standard errors are clustered at the borrowing country level. N , L and B denote number of
  observations, number of lending countries and number of borrowing countries. All columns,
  except for column (2), include country ﬁxed eﬀects for countries i and j . Column (2) includes
  ﬁxed eﬀects for lending country j and for ig , where ig implies that country i is the borrowing
  country and the lending country belongs to group g . We distinguish three groups of lending
  countries indexed by g : Anglo-Saxon countries, continental Western European countries and
  other. Data on remittances is taken from Docquier, Rapoport and Salomone (2012). Polity
  is the Polity 2 indicator of the Polity IV dataset.

   This table reports the OLS estimates of interaction terms of migration with the
   following measures of cultural proximity: (1) common language, (2) common col-
   onizer (3) common legal origin. Standard errors are clustered at the borrowing
   country level. N , L and B denote number of observations, number of lending
   countries and number of borrowing countries, respectively. All columns include
   country ﬁxed eﬀects, colonial link, language, legal origin and common border as
   additional controls. Samples for the Loans and Export regressions are the same.
