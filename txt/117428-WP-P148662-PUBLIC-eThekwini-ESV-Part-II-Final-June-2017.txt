The planned reduction in D’MOSS, current D’MOSS
and ideal conservation plan were used in this study as
alternative levels of conservation – minimum, medium
and maximum - in the sceanrios analysed. Figure
3.5 shows the difference between the conservation
options in terms of how much natural open space in a
good condition is conserved and how much land has
been transformed into other land uses, while keeping
other factors in the catchment constant (industries,
households, inhabitants, etc.). The status quo represents
the current situation in the catchment where parts
of the D’MOSS have become degraded. Medium
conservation represents the current status quo situation
had all natural vegetation in the catchment not been
degraded.

V.	 SCENARIO MODELLING AND RESULTS

5.1	 Overview
A number of models were used during the scenario
analysis to determine the potential benefits of different
combinations and extents of green urban development
interventions (Figure 5.1). Inputs into the models
included the extent and quality of natural and semi-
natural areas, the extent, design and performance of a
range of green urban development engineering solutions
for flood attenuation and water quality amelioration,
and the amount and design capacity of conventional
conveyance and waste water treatment infrastructure.
In addition, assumptions were also made regarding the
management of solid waste.

   by using a user defined Event Mean Concentration (EMC). The Event Mean Concentration is a case of Rating
   Curve Washoff where the exponent is 1.0 and the coefficient represents the washoff pollutant concentration
   in mg/L. In each case build-up is continuously depleted as washoff proceeds, and washoff ceases when there
   is no more build-up available. The EMCs for TSS, TP and TIN were derived from literature and applied to the
   different landuse categories. Model subcatchment parameters were derived by area weighting the various land
   use parcels within each subcatchment. The modelled runoff flows were coupled with EMC values to estimate
   the concentration and total load of TSS and nutrients at different points in the catchment. The data can also
   be applied in PC-SWMM to determine the water quality volume to be catered for in stormwater management
   devices, such as source controls and detention basins.

   The percentage contribution of bed load and suspended sediments to the total sediment load is different for each
   catchment. For this study suspended sediment loads were multiplied by a factor of 1.25 in order to account for
   bed load. This is the factor generally applied in South Africa (Msadala et al. 2010, after Rooseboom 1992).

   The Umhlatuzana and Umbilo Rivers and other stormwater outfalls within the U60F catchment discharge
   directly into Durban Harbour. In the PC-SWMM model, there were 79 harbour outfalls in total. In addition to the
   outfalls, pollutant loads were simulated at a number of water quality monitoring stations situated throughout
   the catchment. A total of five monitoring stations on the Umhlatuzana River, three stations on the Umbilo
   River, and one station on the Mkumbaan River were included as points of interest. Monthly water quality data
   collected by the eThekwini Water and Sanitation Department were used for calibration and validation of the
   model. Simulations were run for a one-week period from the 1 – 7 July 2014 at a two second time interval, and
   the simulated values were within reasonable range of the measured values.

   The assumptions regarding untreated urban runoff quality, and the effects of stormwater interventions are
   outlined in Appendix 2.

   The qualitative assessments carried out in this project considered the metrics used in Present Ecological
   State (PES) assessments of turbidity (for which TSS is considered a surrogate value, see Appendix 6) to infer
   qualitative change in river condition as a result of scenarios involving attenuation of runoff and the provision of
   riparian corridors and buffers. Changes in TSS data produced by the model were used to infer (but not quantify)
   changes in sediment transport and erosion.
   In addition to limitations in the applicability of TSS data in inferring catchment-scale erosion and sediment processes,
   the following limitations must also be considered with regard to the approach taken to assessment of the impact of
   the different scenarios on river condition, and in particular, on river water quality, in this study, namely:
    The assessments are limited to TP, TSS and TIN and do not take account of other variables such as ammonia-
      nitrogen, various heavy metal concentrations; bacteria, salinity;
    The lack of data for other important water quality parameters means that interacting parameters are not
      considered (e.g. the influences of dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature and (in the case of some heavy metals)
      water hardness); and
    The lack of data regarding the organic component of TSS and the proportions of total ammonia and
      orthophosphate comprising TIN and TP respectively.
   All threshold values, guidelines, metrics and assumptions used to assess river ecosystem health are outlined in
   Appendix 6.

Box 5.3 Summary of the flood modelling method (details in Appendix 3)

   SWMM5 is an integrated, physically-based model that was selected for this purpose based on a review of a
   range of possible modelling options and discussions with eThekwini Municipality’s Catchment, Stormwater
   and Coastal Management (CSCM) department. CSCM had recently completed the migration of completed
   HEC-RAS hydrologic models of the EMA to SWMM5.

   GIS subcatchment data available for this project from the eThekwini Municipality (EM) flood studies were in
   the order of 1 km2 and larger. The subcatchments were further discretised into smaller subcatchments, in
   the order of 0.2 km2, within the U60F catchment. A spatial analysis tool was then used to process the flow
   paths, watershed boundaries, and river centre lines. The outlet points for the model were then identified
   and selected; i.e. estuaries and stormwater infrastructure.

   EM flood models, based on geometric HecRAS files, were imported into the PC-SWMM model. The
   stormwater network shapefile for the catchment was incomplete and contained numerous errors and
   inconsistencies. These networks were amended where possible. A Stormwater Management System audit
   (visual inspection and assessment) of all stormwater infrastructure, recently carried out by the eThekwini
   Municipality, produced a number of new shapefiles that were imported into the model and connected to
   exisiting stormwater networks and flow paths. was included where availabale. The original stormwater
   shapefile was merged with the new SMS shapefiles and both were connected to the HECRAS and WDT flow
   paths.

   Available current GIS landuse files (e.g. zoning files, D’MOSS) were collated and reviewed. These files were
   concatenated into one consistent landuse polygon shapefile and the landuse classifications were reviewed
   and summarised into a common set of landuse conventions. The resulting shapefile was ‘groundtruthed’
   using aerial imagery for the U60F catchment. A number of input parameters are required for SWMM5.
   These include hydraulic parameters, soil infiltration properties, rainfall and water quality parameters.         Figure 5.8	   SWMM model of the U60F catchment including flow paths (yellow and red lines), detention basins (green squares), WWTWs (larger

   DEFRA reports have found that project savings could have been far greater if the SUDS layout had been
   considered earlier, or upfront, in the development process. It is assumed that for this study the source control
   interventions were designed and implemented in the catchment as part of new build developments, i.e. it was
   assumed that when the buildings and parking areas were developed the source controls were part of the design
   process and were and not retrofitted, thereby reducing unit costs.

      collect urine and faeces separately and include a special
      toilet seat or pan. The faeces are collected in two collection
      vaults for extended storage in order to dehydrate the faeces
      for treatment and safe handling (Rieck & von Muench 2011)

(i.e. at the beginning and the end of the hydrograph) and
will result in a higher removal rate.

A3.2	 Points of interest for scenario analysis
The Umhlatuzana and Umbilo Rivers and other
stormwater outfalls within the U60F subcatchment
discharge directly into Durban Harbour. In the SWMM
model, there are 79 outfalls in total (Figure A3. 9). The
peak flows and flow volume were estimated for each
scenario for a 2, 5, 10 and 20-year return period. The
effectiveness of GUD measures was not estimated for
floods above a 20-year return period, as it is known that
GUD interventions have little impact on larger floods.

Groundwater was not included in the modelling.
Insufficient data were available to incorporate any
accurate representation of groundwater flows.
Therefore, measured flow/water level data was used to
infer the groundwater as baseflow. Groundwater inputs
vary seasonally, therefore the ‘baseflow’ was estimated
during summer and winter periods and incorporated into
the model as a time series where possible.
