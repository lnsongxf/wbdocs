THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

Mauritius is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new                Legal form: Private Limited Liability Company
firm. These are identified by Doing Business through
collaboration with relevant local professionals and            Paid in minimum capital requirement: MUR 0

Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,           Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita
along with the associated time and cost. These
procedures are those that apply to a company
matching      the    standard     assumptions      (the
“standardized company”) used by Doing Business in
collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

       Register at the Registrar of Companies and Reserve a unique
       company name

       Searching for a unique company name can be conducted at the Office
       of the Registrar or online for free. Name reservation costs MUR 100 but
       is not mandatory as per the amendments brought to section 31 of the
       Companies Act 2001 through the Business Facilitation (miscellaneous
       provisions) Act 2006.

       To register, the entrepreneur then completes the company
       incorporation form and the business registration form including the
       relevant business details and submits them either online or to the
       Registrar of Companies after payment of fees has been affected either                      MUR 3,000 as

       application forms can be downloaded from the Registry's website:
       http://companies.gov.mu. The entrepreneur then obtains the Business
       Registration Card which includes the unique identifier (business
       registration number) and the Certificate of Incorporation.

       Upon incorporation, the Registrar of Companies updates the online
       Central Business Registration Database with the details of the registered
       companies. The Mauritius Revenue Authority, Local Authority
       (Municipality) & the Ministry of Social Security are connected to the
       Central Business Registration Database system, which is located at the
       Registrar of Companies. Therefore, once a company is incorporated, it is

      Obtain building and land use permit

      As of October 1, 2006, a single permit, the building and land-use permit
      (BLP), has replaced both the development permit and the building
      permit. The authority for execution and enforcement of the Building
      Act and of the Town and Country Planning Act is the local authority of
      the town or district where the relevant establishment is to be built or
      the land to be developed.

      Every application for a building and land-use permit must be in
      accordance with provisions of the Building Act, the Town and Country
      Planning Act, and the Planning and Development Act of 2004. The
      following documents are required in addition to the application:

      • Copy of the title deed or copy of the lease and planning clearance
      from the Ministry of Housing and Lands if for state land
      • Consent of owner and copy of the owner’s national identity card
      • Copy of the national identity card of the applicant
      • Three sets of plans, comprising site and location plans, layout,
      elevations, and sections
      • Public notification by way of plate display and notice in two daily
      newspapers (for development within residential zones)
      • Consent of neighbors (not required in this case because it is
      industrial). Consent is required if the distance between the new building
5     and neighboring constructions is less than 1 meter for one-story            21 days      MUR 65,530
      buildings and 1.5 meters for two-story buildings.
      • PER/environmental impact assessment (EIA) license for scheduled
      undertakings: The PER is for small projects, while the EIA is for larger
      ones with a potential environmental impact. Neither applies to the
      warehouse assessed in the Doing Business case study.
      • All plans must be signed by the draughtsman for buildings of less
      than 250 sq. m. in floor area and must include the name and address.
      The total floor area is to be indicated on the site plan, while the floor
      area for each level is to be indicated on the corresponding floor plans
      • For buildings of 150 sq. m. or more in floor area, all plans are to be
      signed by a registered professional architect, including the architect’s
      name, address, VAT registration number, and registration number with
      the Professional Architects Council. The total floor area is to be
      indicated on the site plan, while the floor area for each level is to be
      indicated on the corresponding floor plans. The application form can
      be obtained from the Planning Department of any local authority, Small
      Enterprises and Handicraft Development Authority (SEHDA), the Board
      of Investment, or the Ministry of Local Government, or it can be
      downloaded from various Web sites, including the Web sites of the
      agencies mentioned above.

      In accordance with the Local Government Act 2011, applications for the
      building and land-use permit that are in accordance with the act and
      guidelines should be reviewed within 14 working days of the date of

      receipt of the application. Upon approval of the Executive Committee,
      the building and land use permit is issued.

      The costs associated with the application for the dual permit include an
      application fee of MUR 500, plus charges computed based on land area
      as follows:
      • MUR 10.00 per sq. m. for areas of 250 sq. m. or less
      • MUR 20.00 per sq. m. for areas ranging from 251 to 500 sq. m.

the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes
the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
        economies with a population of more than               The seller requests a pretrial attachment to

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
in different ways. Higher-income economies tend to look           procedures faster. What reforms making it easier (or
for ways to enhance efficiency by introducing new                 more difficult) to enforce contracts has Doing Business
