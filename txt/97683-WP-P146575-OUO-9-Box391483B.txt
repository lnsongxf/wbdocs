                                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.      Recent history around the world has revealed that ICT can play a crucial role in
economic and social development of societies at all levels of development. ICT improves
communication and the exchange of knowledge and information necessary for development
processes. In other words, ICT has revolutionized the way the society, businesses, and the
government interacts, working procedures and processes, as well as product innovations. “As an
accelerator, driver, multiplier, and innovator, ICT is a powerful if not indispensable tool in the
massive scaling up and inter-linkages of development interventions and outcomes.”1

2.      ICT based solutions can be enabling for the growth paradigm, but for ICT to contribute
to innovation and development, supply and demand side issues need to be addressed. On the
supply side, ICT solutions are enabled by the ICT industry consisting of telecommunications to
create the infrastructure, producers of products, content and services for ICT users, and a workforce
with technical skills. Demand for ICT solutions derive from the need to change operations and do
things better. For example, global competition encourages private sector producers to make and
service things better by using ICT solutions. Additionally, citizen needs (including business)
encourages the public sector to be predictable, consistent, transparent and responsive using ICT
solutions. The paradigm is depicted below.

3.      Signs the Internet ecosystem is performing include: (i) a high rate of Internet usage in the
main cities and rural areas, (ii) an innovative ICT industry which exports and serves the domestic
economy, (iii) graduates at the tertiary level interested in ICT as a profession, and (iv) digital services
taking off across the public and private sector with a large proportion of citizens and businesses. ICT
has a role to integrate the pillars to form the basis of an interactive, competitive eco-system that is
mutually reinforcing along its key lines.

4.       The benchmarking exercise in Chapter 1 reveals Sri Lanka’s notable strengths and
weaknesses on the supply side. Sri Lanka’s strengths include: (i) a successful telecommunications
sector which is providing high level of access and affordable prices, (ii) a small but growing ICT
industry that has shown strong signs of international competitiveness, and (iii) a sophisticated literate
work force, particularly in the ICT sector, that has grown almost 20 percent a year for a decade. The
obvious gap in Sri Lanka’s development toward a knowledge economy stems from the lack of
tertiary trained knowledge workers caused by low levels of tertiary enrollment as well as the
departure of many tertiary educated workers during the years of conflict.

5.       On the demand side, in business and at the individual level, Sri Lanka records lower
than expected rates of ICT usage, given the country’s level of income, size and aspirations.
Despite a growing ICT literacy, the ranking for usage in the international benchmarks has been
falling and now is 120th in the world. Less than a fifth of Sri Lanka’s population is using the Internet,
and only 10 percent of households have direct access to the Internet. Within the country, indicators
show a clear pattern of usage across the provinces and districts which reflect the usefulness of the
Internet. However, as a whole there are indications that ICT use has not yet reached the “take -off”
stage in Sri Lanka as it has in other knowledge oriented economies.

6.      Accordingly, policies supporting increased use of ICT in business, government and all
of society are integral to a strategy of fostering knowledge and innovation based growth. As a
starting point, the supply of telecommunications services described in Chapter 2 has been relatively
successful in Sri Lanka to date by bringing various forms of connectivity to all parts of the island and
all segments of society. The policy of encouraging private sector competition through low barriers to
entry has served the economy well by fostering a rapidly growing, sophisticated telecommunications
sector.

7.       Recognizing the role of technology and broadband access on standards of living, it is
appropriate to consider ways to modernize the policy, legal and regulatory framework. Efforts
to develop a comprehensive broadband policy would provide an opportunity to clarify roles, rights
and responsibilities of the various public and private entities involved in increasing broadband from
its current low level. Specific reforms to modernize licensing, update the spectrum policy and set
standards for the Universal Fund are also needed to bring them in line with technological
developments.

8.       Beyond the telecommunications sector, supply and demand side considerations must be
addressed to enable the private sector to play a greater role in ICT development. On the supply
side, the growth of the ITES/BPO and the software production sectors of the economy demonstrate
the budding success and international competitiveness of a knowledge based industry. It also
provides a potentially strong supply base for ICT solutions in many areas of the Sri Lanka economy.
                                                    ii
However, the suppliers of ICT solutions and equipment are generally foreign owned and export
oriented which leads to a dichotomy between the growing supply of ICT services and the limited
domestic demand. Stronger domestic demand for ICT is an integral part of a business environment
that fosters international competitiveness through productivity gains.

9.      Digital government and on line services can help deliver public services while and
improving public sector governance,. Digital services are the outcome of a program of service
delivery anchored in public administration reform in either a whole of government form, or at a
decentralized “project based” level. Public services can also encourage the public to engage in greater
ICT usage. The laying of the horizontal infrastructure and the start of a basic institutional framework
has prepared Sri Lanka for the introduction of public service and information applications, some of
which have already been showing great results. A recent jump in the availability of on-line, digital
services is a positive sign of efforts that may lead to increased usage and a start toward a knowledge-
oriented society.

10.      Policy makers in Sri Lanka, like those around the world, are concerned with ensuring
that the new drivers of competitiveness are a part of the development strategy. However, Sri
Lanka’s first mover advantage in opening and transforming its economy has placed it in a fortuitous
position of having the luxury to take a holistic and comprehensive approach to ICT development. Such
a strategic approach can at once build on past strengths, apply lessons from Sri Lanka and around the
world, and enable any course-corrections based on these lessons. The Government’s role in this
process, therefore, is to ensure: good network infrastructure (discussed in Chapter II), a good
business environment (discussed in Chapter III.), and public and semi-public services (Discussed in
Chapter IV.

11.    To support such a strategy, the summing up chapter provides a set of issues to consider in
when developing ICT aspects of the blueprint for long term competitiveness. Following the supply
and demand paradigm for innovation and ICT solutions, a series of policy recommendations are
made at a strategic level to prompt further study and consideration. The recommendations are
formulated to enable additional unbundling and drilling down as a part of a broad based
competitiveness, innovation and ICT strategy, should one be pursued.

                            CHAPTER I: SRI LANKA IN THE WORLD OF ICT

A. Introduction

1.      Recent economic history has revealed that ICT can actively play a crucial role in
economic & social development of societies at all levels of income and development . ICT has
revolutionized the way the society, businesses, and the government interact, introduced new working
procedures and processes, and spurred new forms of product innovation. Through massive
improvements in communication and knowledge exchange, there is established evidence of the
positive impact that Internet access has on the development of society and the economy. It can
happen through many mechanisms and across wide and varied situations. (Box 1.1).


                        Box 1.1: E-Transformation Stories from Around the World
        In Talin, Estonia, citizen e-services have become a routine: e-elections, e-police, e-healthcare,
        e-banking, e-tax declarations, e-school, etc. Nearly 100 percent of public services for both
        businesses and citizens are available online - making the “e” prefix unnecessary.

        In Santa Cruz, Bolivia, brokers would pay the farmers after selling the produce to the markets
        often shortchanging the farmers in the villages. Now with information sourced from the
        Internet and an email account, the radio program ‘El Correo del Agricultor’ (The Farmer’s
        email) broadcasts market price lists.

        In Andhra Pradesh, India, Project eSeva (e-services) is bridging the digital divide in the
        district of West Godavari in the province and helping the position of women in the
        communities. Facilities are available to citizens via web-enabled rural kiosks.

        In Wamunyu, Kenya, the Learning Resource Center (LRC) has enabled teachers with no
        computer knowledge to become active IT users, incorporating material/information available
        on the Internet in their learning materials, while students have become more active learners.

        In Nugeoda Delkanda, Sri Lanka, the Nugeoda Delkanda Land Registry has implemented an
        e-land register project. The transaction, which took two days and two visits, now takes 30
        minutes in one visit.

2.      In addition to wide societal benefits, an ICT embedded development process can bring
economic dividends in the form of better jobs, higher wages and technical skills. “As an
accelerator, driver, multiplier, and innovator, ICTs are powerful, if not indispensable, tools in the
massive scaling up and inter-linkages of development interventions and outcomes.”2 For example,
one often cited research shows that a 10 percent increase in broadband penetration is correlated with
an average of 1.3 percent increase of GDP.3 ICT’s dramatic impact is based on new ways products
are able to be produced (Box 1.2).

    The World Bank, 2009 Information and Communication for Development, Chapter 3,
                                    Box 1.2: ICT and its Impact on the Firm4

      ICT has changed how goods are produced and sold and how services are organized and delivered.
      Some jobs have become obsolete while new jobs have been created. More importantly, ICT has
      transformed the organization of production itself by enabling a finer degree of specialization of the
      production process and allowing it to be more fragmented than in the past. (Robert Baldwin 2006, The
      Second Great Unbundling).
      Now competition and trade occur at a finer level – at the level of tasks being performed by workers –
      leading to the offshoring of some production strategies as opposed to the entire production process. The
      unbundling of production allows firms to exploit comparative advantage to a greater extent than in the
      past. Emerging markets have joined the supply chain of multinationals at different stages of the
      production process. Some jobs which were considered non-tradable before (telephone operators, data
      entry) are now being offshored and new theoretical frameworks are being introduced to study these
      effects.
      Recent research has shown that firms have changed the organization of global supply chains. ICT
      has affected the incentives of multinationals to reshape their supply chains by the drop in monitoring
      costs since software allows headquarters to acquire information and monitor the production process in
      real time, worldwide. Therefore, with low ICT adoption, the headquarters of a company will find it
      optimal to acquire a firm only in routine-intensive industries where monitoring is not so important. ICT
      adoption increases the number of mergers in harder to monitor industries to a greater degree.
      Information access and communication positively impact organizational structure and time
      management. When access to information is cheaper and faster, time and presence can be allocated
      more efficiently. For example, doctor’s time and presence is economized as nurses diagnose and
      prescribe through the use of ICT systems, teacher can be in more places at the same time, and workers
      can solve problems through collaboration in ways never before considered



3.      “In Sri Lanka, international connectivity and access to high-speed, inexpensive
internet is sine qua non in developing a vibrant innovation system.”5 Sri Lanka’s society has
embraced ICT enabled development outcomes, including (i) inclusive growth, high value
employment and technology based exports, (ii) delivery of public services, particularly to the poor
and rural areas, and (iii) efficiency, effectiveness and transparency of public spending. ICT based
innovation is expected to help realize these goals by allowing the public and private sectors to be
efficient and effective while improving access to public and business services by all citizens.

4.      The public has interest in the enabling conditions for a successful paradigm: access to
infrastructure, a conducive environment for innovation, and access to digitally based services.
The following chapters develop this paradigm by unbundling the use of ICT in Sri Lanka for
innovation and service delivery. The rest of chapter I places Sri Lanka within the remarkable
advances in ICT across the world. Chapter II examines telecommunications as the backbone to ICT
access. Chapter III examines ICT as an innovator for industry as well as an innovating industry.
Chapter IV describes efforts to incorporate ICT based solutions to improve the delivery of public
services in Sri Lanka. Finally, Chapter V summarizes and considers various ways ahead.

B. Global Trends in ICT

5.       By the end of 2013, there were as many mobile telephone subscriptions as people on the
planet, with 100 percent of the world’s population covered by a mobile signal. More importantly,
in 2013 almost 40 percent of the world’s population was using the Internet which, in some parts of
the world, has become almost as ubiquitous as the mobile-cellular telephone. Still, while 250 million
people came on line in the past year, there still remain 4.4 billion people who are not yet using the
Internet. It is projected that by 2017, nearly half of the world’s population (3.6 billion out of 7.6
billion people) will be connected to the Internet.6

6.      Just as or more significantly, access to broadband – primarily through mobile
technology and hand set based services - is expanding at break-neck pace. Of the world’s total
inhabited areas, network coverage will increase to 85 percent in 2017, up from 79 percent in 2012.
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates that by the end of 2013 there were
around 2 billion mobile-broadband subscriptions corresponding to a global penetration rate of almost
30 percent. At recent trends, consensus estimates are that an additional 500-900 million people will
join the online ranks by 2017, expanding the online population to 3.2-3.6 billion users7.

                                   Box 1.3: World Wide Growth of Data8
            Over 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created daily. 90 percent of the world’s stored
            data was created in the last two years alone. One hour of customer transaction data at
            Wal-Mart (2.5 petabytes) provides 167 times the amount of data housed by the Library
            of Congress. Digital data created, replicated, or consumed will grow by a factor of 30
            from 2005 to 2020, doubling every two years. By 2020, 5,200 gigabytes of data will
            exist for every person on earth. Much of this data growth is traversing IP networks.
            From 2012 to 2017, total traffic over IP networks will grow threefold but mobile data
            traffic will grow 13 fold. Between 2012 and 2017, seven billion more devices will join
            the already 12 billion devises connected to the Internet.


7.       In particular, penetration of the Internet in developing country households has more
than doubled in the last five years.9 The growing availability of mobile technology and the
incredible growth of data and information content have empowered citizens of emerging economies
in ways never imagined. Innovations, such as the rise of cloud computing have reduced competitive
differentials in the availability of technology across all types of firms while low entry barriers in the
digital space have sparked creativity and given rise to a class of young entrepreneurs around the
world. With the appropriate recipe, the opportunity to find new ways to create value by better and
more efficiently organizing the use of natural, financial, and human resources will lead to virtuous
circles of unimaginable welfare gains for countries that choose to participate.

8.     Still, even as broadband subscriptions and the share of households with Internet access
grow, the current digital divide between developed and developing countries remains striking.
Broadband subscriptions in developing countries doubled over the past two years and Internet penetration

rates increased from 4.4 percent in 2010 to almost 20 percent by end 2013. However, even with these
impressive rates of growth, online access in the developing world remains far from the 75 percent Internet
penetration rates reached in developed countries. Additionally, the higher bandwidth, fixed (wired)
broadband – critical to advanced commerce and communications - reached a quarter of the developed
world and only 6 percent of the developing countries population. (Figure 1.1) In other words, 3.2 to 4.2
billion people, more than half of the global population, are forecasted to be off line in 2017, three quarters
of which are concentrated in 20 developing countries.10

C. Access, Affordability and Literacy in Sri Lanka:

9.      In Sri Lanka, notable achievements have also been made during the past decade in
bringing ICT into society from an almost negligible starting point. Access has been driven by the
telecom sector and its footprint of activities spanning the nation. In addition to having access to
quality broadband services, growing internet usage has also been a function of affordability and the
rising IT literacy in the country. On the demand side however, the Internet is not being used enough
by businesses to implement innovative productive methods or citizens to gain access to public and
consumer based digital services. Access, affordability and literacy as drivers of Internet usage are
presented here, followed by an overview of Internet usage at a national scale and across the various
parts of Sri Lanka. The discussion on internet usefulness for firm productivity and citizen services is
taken up in Chapters III and IV, respectively.

       1. Network Coverage (Access)

10.     Sector reforms and high rates of private and public investment have enabled increased
coverage, improved affordability, and widened adoption of telephone services. By 2010, almost
the entire population was covered by a mobile signal offering either voice or voice and data services,
and using technologies of 2.5G, 3G and even 4G in some instances. In 2013, mobile phone
penetration in Sri Lanka exceeded 100 percent with unique mobile subscribers covering around 60
percent of the population. As in the rest of the world, mobile telephony in Sri Lanka has far
outstripped fixed line, which has been declining in use in recent years. More importantly, usage in
Sri Lanka’s is related directly to broadband access through mobile as opposed to fixed-line means.

11.     Broadband subscriptions are growing in Sri Lanka but more slowly than for telephony
due to high cost of hardware, slowly emerging content, and low levels of ICT literacy. While the
share of the population with an active broadband subscription tripled in the past years, it reached only
6.5 percent. Three quarters of the subscriptions were mobile as opposed to higher bandwidth fixed
line technology11 (Figure 1.3).

                                               Figure 1.3: Broadband in Sri Lanka, 2010-2013
                                                                     per 100 people




                   Source: ITU


12.      When Sri Lanka’s growth in broadband access is viewed on a global scale, the
achievement is less impressive than the penetration achieved in other dynamic countries.
Certainly, Sri Lanka, along with India and Maldives, has been able to increase penetration of mobile-
cellular telephones and broadband at a higher rate than other South Asian countries.12 However,
when comparing rates in mobile and fixed line with 26 other comparator countries, it is apparent that
Sri Lanka will need to grow much more quickly in order to catch up with some of the fast advancers
like Mexico, Vietnam, Turkey and Georgia (Figure 1.4).


11
   There is no single definition of “broadband”, or the data rates (speed) of a broadband connection. Indeed, different
technologies indicate different broadband speeds. At the low end, for example, transmission speeds of 256 kbps can
be considered broadband. However, 3G broadband can be 0.4Mbps, and 4G/LTE can be as high as 100Mbps.
12
   Not only is broadband and telephone penetration higher, mobile ownership is higher in Sri Lanka (45-50 percent)
than South Asia’s average (30 percent) and for the developing countries as whole (40 percent ) GSMA Intelligence.

2. Internet Affordability

13.     An aspect of the Sri Lanka ICT sector that is at once attractive from the consumer’s
view and curious from a market perspective is the affordability of some broadband segments.
In absolute terms, according to the ITU Sri Lanka provides the least expensive connectivity in the
world for mobile (handset and computer based) and fixed broadband. When normalized by income
per capita, the affordability of broadband in Sri Lanka is in the top 25 percentile for mobile
broadband, and the top 40 percent for fixed broadband (Table 1.1).

14.      Whether the price structure is sustainable based on the current model of industry
structure and competition is in question both by the industry and the regulator. There is a sense
that the effort at achieving short term affordability may hinder achievement of longer term ICT goals.
While some degree of cross-subsidy may be a part of the business model at early stages of
development, the sustainability of the business model may be challenging as discussed in greater
detail in Chapter II.


                                                             6
        3. ICT Literacy

15.    ICT adoption in everyday life enables people to participate in the information society,
but requires basic digital literacy to get started. Digital literacy is defined as a set of skills and
knowledge required to participate in ICT activities – the basic knowledge of using a computer.
Creating demand for digital content, and therefore ICT services, requires high levels of ICT literacy
and adequate human capital.

16.     Sri Lanka, like other countries, has made the adoption of ICT a key priority. ICT
outreach has improved by undertaking literacy programs and developing facilities with Internet
access throughout the nation. The Annual Report of the Ministry of Finance and Planning 2012 notes
the progress in Sri Lanka’s ICT literacy. From a low of 8 percent in 2005, literacy doubled by 2010
to 20.1 percent and increased to 35 percent in 2012. Still, in a country with a 90-percent literacy rate,
even a 35 percent ICT literacy rate indicates that universal ICT literacy remains far off.

17.      In addition, while ICT literacy has increased to 35 percent nationwide, some provinces
recorded dramatic increases while others improved ICT literacy surprisingly slowly. Western
provinces are now almost at full ICT literacy, while the North Central and Central provinces
recorded rates in the 50 percent range. The ICT literacy rates in the Northwestern and Southern
provinces, however, remained well below the national average. Moreover, the 2012 census revealed
that three quarters of the population are unable to use a computer, with the distribution relatively
evenly divided between men and women (74 and 78 percent, respectively). More surprising is that 63
percent of the urban population claim to be unable to use a computer compared to 78 percent of the
rural population.13

        4. Internet Usage

18.     Internet usage as a function of broadband access, service affordability, and IT literacy
has been growing rapidly but from a very low starting point. Even with a relatively early start
and rapid growth in recent years, Sri Lanka lags comparator countries in internet usage. ITU
estimates that just over 18 percent of the population and only 10 percent of households were using
the Internet in 2012, starting from less than 2 percent in 2004 (Figure 1.5). In the last three years of
that period, the number of mobile Internet users doubled each year, but even after this rapid growth,
only a fifth of the population was reported to be using the internet - compared to almost three times
that on the telephone.).14

  Conservative estimates does not take into account internet users without a proper data package, and moreover,
considers workplaces, internet cafés and household fixed lines as a single connection.

19.     The rapid growth in individual and household usage is, at first glance, impressive for a
developing country – particularly one which barely used the Internet less than 10 years earlier. The
growth is a reflection of positive factors in the Sri Lanka market including: (i) broad coverage of the
3G signal, (ii) falling hand-set prices, (iv) improved literacy, (v) low prices for some Internet
packages, and (vi) rising incomes. Indeed, Sri Lanka’s usage, in terms of percent of individuals using
the internet, has surpassed India and Pakistan, which had higher usage to start, as well as Indonesia
and Mongolia (Figure 1.6).

20.     While Sri Lanka’s rising ICT penetration is at first glance impressive, it would not be
wrong to expect more for a country with Sri Lanka’s aspirations. There is Internet in only 10
percent of households after 10 years. Although most lower-income and lower-middle income
countries posted low usage scores in 2002, Sri Lanka has been able to raise its usage ranking from
118 in 2002 to only 115 in 2012. Given the rapid progress shown by countries like Philippines,
Kenya, South Africa or Georgia, who started with low penetration in 2002 but recorded Internet
usage levels of 35-45 percent of the population, it would seem that Sri Lanka’s Internet penetration
could have been higher (Figure 1.7).

     Note: Province is shown with district name: Northern (N), Western (W), Eastern (E), Central (C ), Southern (S), North
     Central (NC), North Western (NW), Sb (SB) and UVA (U)


            5. ICT Use across Sri Lanka

21.     An important insight to usage and access of the Internet comes from an analysis of
district level data provided by the 2012 census. Patterns of usage can be seen which have
implications for the ways the Government and industry may wish to promote usage. Just under a
quarter of households in Sri Lanka say they access the Internet.15 Of this around 16 percent of
households say they access the Internet from home or the office, while the other 8 percent access the
Internet from places outside the home or office, communication centers, Nenasalas (public sector
Internet access points), or a small number of “other.”

22.     The average masks important differences across districts and provinces with regard to
the share of households accessing the Internet and place for its access. In Colombo and its
neighboring districts in the Western province (Gampaha and Kalutura) about 47 percent and 25
percent of households, respectively, are accessing the Internet – mostly through household and office
access. However, the Northern and Eastern provinces - the more conflict affected areas - have a
greater number of households actually accessing the Internet.

23.     In fact, of the eleven districts above the national average in accessing the Internet, only
Colombo, Gampaha and Kandy are not post-conflict, minority districts. Importantly, these post-
conflict districts do not access the Internet from the home or office due partly to the large fixed cost
of hardware. Instead, access is obtained mostly from Communication Centers (private Internet cafés).
Figure 1.8 shows the very low penetration of computers in the home in the districts with the highest
usage.




15
  This is not the same as having access to the internet in the household, which was responded to as around 10
percent, as in the ITU data. Instead, this corresponds more closely to individuals using the internet, which is 18
percent of the population in the ITU data and 24 percent of households in the census – though some double counting
may be possible from the census.
                                                                  9

 Source: 2012 Census.
 Note: Province is shown with district name: Northern (N), Western (W), Eastern (E), Central (C ), Southern (S), North
 Central (NC), North Western (NW), Sb (SB) and UVA (U).


24.      The conclusion to be drawn from the dichotomy of usage and access outside of the home
is that it is content that matters in terms of drawing people to the Internet. It can be postulated
that districts which access the Internet more than the national average are those in which the
population has an interest in contacting diaspora outside the country. The fact that this population
travels to communication centers in order to do so, supports the following conclusions:

       Use of the Internet depends mostly on having a concrete reason to use the Internet,
       Access to the Internet does not always depend on having a computer in the home,
       Private sector solutions have sprung up to meet the demand for access, and
       In some places, there may be hardware, if not literacy, constraints to Internet use.

D. Benchmarking the state of Sri Lanka’s ICT Development

25.    Two international benchmarks are relevant for examining Sri Lanka’s performance
with regard to ICT adoption, and the progress made over the years. The World Economic
Forum’s Network Readiness Index (NRI) measures the preparedness of a country to exploit the
opportunities offered by ICT. The second index is ITU’s ICT Development Index (IDI), which is
widely used to compare and evaluate ICT uptake. The NRI is the index most widely used for
benchmarking purposes in Sri Lanka.

26.     Currently, Sri Lanka ranks 76th in the world, up from 86th in 2006-07, based on a 20
percent increase in the NRI score over eight years. Sri Lanka is now in the same neighborhood as
Mexico, South Africa, Indonesia and Thailand. The 20 percent increase in Sri Lanka’s score rivals
other fast movers in the world, such as Georgia (30 percent increase), Mongolia (28 percent) and
Vietnam (13 percent), as well as fast movers that started at low levels, including Bangladesh, Kenya
and Moldova. At the same time, the ranking of other important countries in the Asian region fell,
including India (44 to 83), Pakistan (84 to 111), Philippines (69 to 78), Indonesia (62 to 64) and
Thailand (37 to 67) (Figure 1.9).

Within the index however, big differences are found among sub-components, revealing varying
strengths and weaknesses in Sri Lanka’s access to, and use of ICT. The enabling Environment
component improved from 81st to 63rd on the strength of the business and political environment. The
Readiness component, measuring ICT infrastructure, affordability and skills needed to make good use of
ICT, also improved in a similar fashion with the ranking going from 87th to 64th reflecting Sri Lanka’s
inexpensive connectivity.). The weakest part of the index is attributed to the critical areas of Usage, where
Sri Lanka’s scores and rankings have been low and falling in recent years. In 2012 Sri Lanka ranked 112th
out of 147 countries in terms of usage of ICT by individuals, falling nine places since 2007. Usage by
business and by government improved and ranks 50th and 43rd in the world, respectively (Figure 1.10).

27.     The IDI index, which focuses more on actual uptake, paints a slightly more challenging
picture for Sri Lanka. The current ranking of 107 out of 151 countries places it as the South Asia
regional leader, apart from the Maldives, but leaves it in the bottom quartile worldwide. More
importantly, the absolute score doubled to 2.66 in the period from 2002 – 2007, raising its global
rank from 99 to 104. Over the next five years, however, Sri Lanka recorded a fall to 107 in the IDI
global ranking. (Figure 1.11).

and good labor force. However, they reflect the low tertiary enrollment and a small rise in usage from
none at all. (Figure 1.12). The lack of movement in the scores over the time period when other countries
were advancing rapidly means that the ranking did not change much over the decade. Access remained
around 104 ranking in the world, Usage rose slightly to 114, and Skills actually fell from 85 to 90. Issues
surrounding each of the components - access, usage and skills, will be examined in more depth in this and
subsequent chapters.

E. Conclusions

29.      Today’s world is divided more in terms of technology than by other factors. Without
Internet access and ICT services there is a fear that economic development will be hampered, and as
a result, marginalized regions and nation-states will remain trapped in a disadvantaged situation. To
avoid this situation Sri Lanka has embarked on an ambitious endeavor to increase ICT access and
usage. If successful, the country is likely to reap its benefits in the near future.

30.     However, international benchmarks underscore the “ICT paradox:” low cost internet,
high overall literacy, and advanced technology, but relatively low ICT literacy and internet
usage. In particular, (i) successful attempts are being made to enhance the broadband footprint in
the country, (ii) public sector programs in education and ICT outreach have helped build ICT literacy
in the country, and (iii) Sri Lanka is one of the most affordable places for Internet connectivity in the
world, providing competitive prices for mobile broadband and fixed broadband.

31.     Yet, the country has room to more fully utilize its ICT’s potential. The principal sign of
this perception is the consistently low usage of ICT. Ranked 81st in the NRI Usage rankings, Sri
Lanka has made slow progress since 2006-07, improving by a mere 5 places in the global ranking. Of
particular concern is the conflict between low usage by individuals (ranked 112) and the demand of a
knowledge oriented society.

            CHAPTER II: TELECOMMUNICATIONS: THE BACKBONE FOR A DIGITAL ECONOMY


A. Introduction

32.     Innovation is supported by a technology ecosystem. The system starts with infrastructure, is
made possible with connectivity, and includes transformational applications developed for citizens,
businesses, and government. The chapter unbundles this paradigm by beginning with the
telecommunication and connectivity dimension. In doing so, the chapter will (i) describe the policy
context in recent years, (ii) summarize market and regulatory developments, (iii) identify policy issues in
expanding broadband Internet services, and (iv) suggest a way forward.

33.     Expansion of broadband has the potential for dramatic impact on the Sri Lankan
economy. As ITC becomes affordable, accessible and useful, growth becomes inclusive.
Connectivity enables competitiveness of the IT based services (ITBS) sector16, new ways for public
services to be delivered, and social interaction through new methods. Reliable connectivity is
necessary not only for a growing ICT industry, but also for services and even for traditional
manufacturing sectors. Most importantly, increased broadband penetration and Internet adoption
throughout the society is a pre-requisite to a vibrant innovation ecosystem.
            “The telecommunications sector is a backbone of the Sri Lankan economy and shows
            potential to benefit from growth of the services sector and the untapped global ICT
            market. The impact goes beyond the local ICT market, expanding into traditional sectors
            such as agriculture and manufacturing… the telecommunications sector led by the
            private sector is an impetus for the national economy.17

B. Recent Development in the Sector

34.      Since 1989, important changes have taken place to develop the telecommunications sector.
Partial de-regulation and public-private investment have been spurred by broad-based reforms,
including: (i) enabling of competitive service provision; (ii) restructuring of SLT, the now partially state-
owned incumbent; and (iii) creation of a regulator to license telecommunications services, manage and
license the radio spectrum, implement price regulation, and protect consumer interests (Box 2.1)

35.     Mobile penetration has been rapidly rising from 17 percent in 2005 to 92 percent in
2012, as compared to fixed telephony which has gone from 6 percent to 18 percent, (Figure 2.1).
Similar to the trends around the world, penetration of mobile has outstripped the declining fixed line
telephone. By 2010 the entire population was covered by a mobile signal, and by 2013 mobile phone
penetration in Sri Lanka had reached 120 percent (although the number of unique mobile subscribers
is undoubtedly much less - estimated at around 60-80 percent of the population).

36.     In terms of providing broadband connectivity, as the backbone for the internet,
significant progress has been achieved by the set of telecommunications operators. Sri Lanka
currently has one of the most dynamic and competitive telecommunications sectors in the region and
compares well globally in terms of access, prices, and quality of services offered. In particular:

          Telecommunications service prices, particularly data prices, have fallen to some of the lowest
           in the world. Service providers, including the incumbent, compete fiercely on pricing and
           packaging for most segments of the data market.

          Sri Lanka is a technologically advanced market in the region and introduced high-speed third
           generation (3G) networks before other South Asian countries. It has introduced 4th Gen
           (LTE) networks and is in initial stages of ICT convergence: merging of voice, data, and
           media. The country’s first fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) broadband service was launched in
           major markets. 18

          International investments have been attracted as a positive feature of the sector’s
           development. ICT competitiveness of the country increased based on the experience of global
           players in building and operating advanced telecommunications networks while introducing
           managerial talent, financial capacity, and technological excellence.




18
  Industry executives expect that through FTTH, users will be able to get access to high-speed Internet access, video
on demand, Wi-Fi, VoIP, live feeds, online education, online gaming, teleworking, video conferencing, etc. without
bandwidth limitations
                                                         15
37.      Still in terms of uptake in the home, the number of “households with access to the Internet”
has grown from 2.4 to 10.3 percent, but still remains stubbornly low by global benchmarks, (Figure
3.2). Despite the early technological advances, the numbers fail to keep pace with countries which started at
the same place such as Kenya, Mongolia, Vietnam, and Georgia. Sri Lanka’s penetration remains just ahead
of large countries with challenging access conditions, such as India and Indonesia with access of 9.5 and 6.5
of total households, respectively. Therefore, in contrast to mobile voice, Sri Lanka’s performance with
penetration of the high speed Internet, though growing, has been much lower than levels in much of the
world.

C. Structure of the Market

38.      Sri Lanka's telecommunications sector is small by global standards with a fairly large
number of providers for an island with a population of 20 million. The boom in mobile telecoms
services has served to develop the sector to advanced levels as described above. The end of the
island's civil war in 2009 is providing opportunity for an expansion to previously underserved areas
boding well for the sector's continued growth in broadband over the next few years.19

39.     The sector currently consists of seven operators collectively providing the range of
telecommunications services. Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT)20, Lankabell, and Dialog provide fixed
services (including fixed broadband; and Dialog, Mobitel,21 Etisalat, Hutch, and Airtel provide
mobile services (including mobile broadband). Three private operators, Mobitel, Dialog and Etisalat,
control the bulk of the mobile market with a combined market share of almost 80 percent in October
2012, though the market did become less dominated by Dialog and Mobitel (Figure 3.3).

40.     The sector remains strongly influenced and led by SLT, not only through its traditional
support to backbone infrastructure development, but also in retail as the second largest mobile
operator with 22 percent market share, the largest fixed line operator with 44 percent market share,
and the largest broadband operator with 79 percent market share.22 Moreover, SLT controls one of
two of the country’s cable landing stations with sustained high fees. 23

D. Sustainability of the Business Model

41.     Sri Lanka has some of the lowest broadband access prices in the world while
maintaining high investment necessary for advanced technology. The main operators have rolled
out nationally available infrastructure, multiple networks and advanced services, while maintaining
the lowest prices for broadband in the world, (US$ 10/month for 3G). Traditional methods of
maintaining profitability included internal cross-subsidization between voice and data, between
business and consumers, and between high speed and low speed. In addition, while five undersea
cables are operational, international connectivity is costly due to SLT’s monopoly on the landing
stations and gateway facilities. There is a significant amount of fiber in the country but it is
reportedly under-utilized while the rapid increase of wireless broadband from smart phones is
increasing pressure on backhaul capacity.

42.     Consequently, operators in Sri Lanka question the ability to                       Table: 2.1: Households
grow under the current business model despite room for expansion.24.                       Using Internet (%)

   With the advent of 3G and 4G networks and services, there is increasing migration to "smart" (i.e., IP-based)
networks, and access to the Internet will increasingly be via a “smart” device.

                                                            17
43.      New models of competition are being considered with more active sharing of networks
instead of forced competition with infrastructure provision.25. It is important to lower
international segment prices and ensure redundancy, in part by ensuring open access. There is also a
need to bring down domestic leased line prices since the only way to keep broadband prices low over
time is to ensure healthy competition and lower input costs.26

E. Sector Issues

44.     Telecommunications liberalization has been successful in Sri Lanka but the sector’s
technological advances mean that key aspects of the regulatory framework need updating.
There is much to build upon going forward given the expertise on the ground in the form of large,
stable private sector participants in the sector and technically knowledgeable regulators with at least
a decade of experience with a liberalizing market. The market has advanced relatively rapidly within
a policy and regulatory framework that needs to be modernized. There is limited connection between
the successes in the market place and the stated objectives of the regulator.27

45.      A visible manifestation of policy lagging the market is that the quantitative milestones
for the sector are modest in the face of the expectations, on target, but already obsolete.
Broadband penetration rather than ‘data connections,’ and other clear definitions, is needed to
measure the number of users of high-quality services. While the official figures for “Internet and
Email Connections” are not very high, they do not include mobile broadband. Targets also need to be
set for broadband services and universal access to Internet services, including for rural areas 28.

46.     Public-private consultative committees have recommended that an updated policy
framework address the supply side constraints to ensure quality, affordability and access. The
suggested supply side policy issues recommended for further consideration by the relevant
Government bodies and consultative committees include: (i) strengthening and modernizing the legal
and regulatory framework; (ii) introducing competition regulation to address issues of dominance
and cross-subsidization; (iii) modernizing licensing; (iv) rethinking the approach to universal service;
and (v) modernizing spectrum policy.

             1. Legal Framework and Licensing Regime

47.      The current policy and basic enabling legal framework served Sri Lanka well but needs
to be modernized to lay the foundation for the next generation of sector developments. The
legal framework supporting Sri Lanka’s reforms and success over the past 20 years is the
Telecommunications Act, No. 25 of 1991, as amended. It focused on principles of competition, high-
quality service and universal service. However, the current regulatory system focuses on technical
issues from the perspective typified in the analogue, circuit-switched telephony era while today’s
broadband market is dominated by digital, packet-switched, IP-based mobile communications. Such

25
   Lanka Business Online. May, 2014
26
   Given the high cost of infrastructure investments, mobile operators in Sri Lanka have opted to undertake passive
sharing of network elements, whereby infrastructure such as towers and land (for the placement of telecoms towers)
are shared. (Economist Intelligence Unit, October 2013)
27
   For example as expressed in the TRC’s 2006–16 development plan.
28
   Broadband policy targets for 2016 and beyond are modest in terms of speed and coverage and have already been
exceeded by what is available in the market Even the basic concept of what is considered “Broadband” should be
modernized to be characterized as as 5 Mbps and above –the minimum to enable multimedia communication.
                                                        18
convergence in a competitive market place will decrease reliance on technical regulation and put
increasing pressure on economic regulation through the application of general competition principles.

48.     There would also be a significant benefit from modernizing the licensing regime to
facilitate market entry in other segments. The licensing regime for telecommunications is a
product of the Telecommunications Act and defines the rights and obligations of network
operators and service providers, and includes a definition of which services they can offer and
under what conditions. In Sri Lanka, the current technology-specific licensing regime is outdated
and not aligned with current technological or market developments.

49.     The current licensing regime hinders the introduction of new technologies, services and
business models by (i) maintaining archaic industry distinctions that are no longer relevant (e.g.,
different licenses for data communications and telephone services even though IP-based networking
has eliminated technical constraints),29 (ii) hinders fair and transparent regulation and creates
opportunities for regulatory arbitrage, and (iii) has led to perceptions of “ruinous competition”
resulting in TRC setting “floor” prices, especially for mobile voice services.

             2. Competition Principles

50.     Service level and wholesale level competition in the market has been inadequate. There
has been a significant level of “network- or facilities-based competition” between different firms
offering the same services over different networks. However, SLT dominates the Sri Lanka
broadband market, accounts for about 85 percent of subscribers, and controls the fixed line telephone
network - a key channel for broadband delivery. SLT, and to a lesser extent Dialogue, have fiber
backbones. Still issues remain regarding infrastructure sharing, leased lines, and own "international
gateway” access to submarine cable capacity. 30 There also may be regulatory issues concerning
Lanka Bell’s underused cable station and Dialog’s BBG cable under construction.

51.      Competition regulation should be considered as a complement and possible replacement
for the traditional technical regulation that is carried out today. Without a competition law of
general application, the treatment of anti-competitive behavior within the telecommunication/ICT
sector is tasked to TRC under the Telecommunications Act. While TRC is required to “enable a
competitive environment and to protect consumer interests,” this does not necessarily translate into
principles of competition regulation for the sector,31 particularly as TRC lacks independence of
appointment and budget, is not safeguarded regarding conflicts of interest, and is constrained by
limited technical capacity in a fast evolving sector.32


29
   Internet protocol based networking, which is service-neutral – allows any type of service to travel over any type of
network – and has eliminated technical constraints in providing Internet services over telephone lines or cable TV
networks for instance, and even allows Internet service providers to carry high quality voice communication.
30
   Many countries have regulated the opening of the wireline telephone network, which allows service competition
between the incumbent and new entrants to provide voice or broadband services over the incumbent’s network .
31
   Competition enforcement through the Consumer Affairs Authority Act of 2003 is inadequate for the complex
competition issues facing the ICT market. Clarification is needed regarding (i) the definition of anti-competitive
behavior, (ii) whether a complaint could be filed by a competitor, (iii) whether the Consumer Affairs Authority is
the authority to investigate and adjudicate cases, and (iv) a comprehensive system of sanctions.
32
   Hiring practice for TRC staff generally brings staff from state owned enterprises that are bound by civil service
salaries and rules, making it hard to attract and retain high-caliber staff with the proper technical skills.

                                                          19
             3. Universal Access

52.      While Sri Lanka expands broadband services for universal access to the Internet, a key
constraint has been the lack of a strategic approach. Rural connectivity and universal service
issues are important to bridge rural-urban digital divides and even national coverage. Domestic
initiatives are ongoing to expand the reach of high-capacity backbone networks across Sri Lanka
with a focus to improve connectivity and prioritization of service delivery to underserved areas.
However, service goals and identified mechanisms to attain those goals are needed. The existing
funding mechanism - a per-minute levy on incoming international calls - is inefficient, distortionary
and easily bypassed since it is based on an outdated notion of international telephony as a luxury.33

             4. Spectrum Policy

53.     Spectrum policy defines which spectrum is available for various uses, how this
spectrum will be assigned to users, and what the terms and conditions of use are. A
comprehensive spectrum review was undertaken in 2005 leading Sri Lanka to be one of the few
developing countries to have “re-farmed” spectrum.34 However, three important market evolutions
suggest a need to review spectrum policy. First, the rise of wireless broadband requires identification
of new ranges of spectrum for high speed, mobile data services. Second, advances in technology
mean that assumptions about the need to divide and regulate spectrum are being overturned. Wi-Fi
networks, which use unlicensed and unregulated spectrum, have been very successful worldwide.
Finally, the convergence of technologies means that spectrum policy and licenses should be
technology- and service-neutral and should not limit which bands might be used and by whom.

F. Conclusions

54.     The telecommunications sector has much to build on, particularly given the technology
in the country stemming from early policy choices to open up to private participation.
Telephone penetration throughout the country is high and broadband uptake is beginning to take off.
The access to international cables, backbone infrastructure being rolled out by leading companies and
various technologies through which companies are extending service to the “last mile ,” bodes well
for Sri Lanka’s societal and commercial aspirations as a knowledge society. The market boasts
professional expertise on the ground, an experienced regulator, and good dialogue between both.

55.     However, to capture future opportunities, the institutional and regulatory framework
will need modernization to keep up with technology and enable future market contestability.
On the one hand, the regulatory has been technically oriented in its policy and interventions, albeit
without the benefit of key aspects of modern regulation such as operational independence, market
information, and competition principles. At the same time, a number of key policies require
assessment, evaluation and updating, including enabling legislation based on a modern broadband
policy document, a credible program for universal access and demand enhancement, a competition
review of Spectrum policy and a policy on shared infrastructure.

   ‘Spectrum re-farming’ is when government-regulated electromagnetic spectrum is reassigned for services with
higher value. The users of the existing spectrum are forced out, although they may be compensated in some manner.
The frequency bands are assigned to communications services that yield greater economic or social benefit.

                                      CHAPTER III: THE BUSINESS OF ICT

A. Introduction

56.     Globalization and technology have accompanied new forms of production as the
division of labor is spread over countries in a supply chain relationship. These changes have
profound impacts on how firms are organized and how business takes place. Such production
fragmentation divides up the production process into small parts and spreads them out based on
various competitiveness considerations and re-integrates them using information technology,
logistics and advanced process engineering. The integrator in this supply chain is the dominance of
knowledge-intensive activities and ICT based processes, as firms of all types find better ways of
organizing and communicating with the new ICT platforms that now exist.

57.     Therefore, an increased growth trajectory can occur through the virtuous circle of
knowledge-based productivity growth tied to a greater role for ICT in the production process.
ICT in the economy enables productivity improvements in existing activities through better
organization, information, and response time -- the key aspects of international competitiveness.
These innovative firms attract investment for new activities, products and processes, create demand
for technical skills, and encourage the financial sector to take greater risks. Economic expansion,
rising exports and better jobs also result from resources moving to new activities, including an
industry of ICT products and information technology enabled services (ITES).

B. ICT as a Force in Sri Lanka’s Private Sector

58.     Sri Lanka’s budding ICT based economy is small, but growing quickly. The ICT
revolution worldwide has already made Sri Lanka’s traditional strengths in education, accounting,
science and medicine more marketable worldwide. An emerging ICT industry in software, hardware,
consulting, and training is becoming an important knowledge based sector in Sri Lanka and a source
of quality employment particularly for young people. Growing at a robust rate of almost 18 percent
per year from 2003 to 2013, the total ICT workforce reached 75 thousand, including 6 thousand in
Government.35 Employment in IT companies grew from 7.6 to 34 thousand while the ICT workforce
in non-ICT companies increased 6 fold from 6 to 35 thousand (Figure 3.1).

       1. The ICT Industry: BPO/ITES, Software, and Consulting

 59. There are promising signs of new and globally competitive industries in ICT products
 and ICT related services. Among them, activities associated with the Business Process
 Outsourcing (BPO) and IT enabled services (ITES) sector, which along with software exports, has
 achieved almost $600 million of exports per year with turnover of over US$ 1billion. The
 expectation by the industry is that exports of goods and services will rise to $1 billion by 2017 and
 become a top five foreign exchange earner in the country (Figure 3.2).

 60. Its industry association, Slasscom, as well as top international observers agree that Sri
 Lanka is poised as a global player in this industry. Sri Lanka’s geographical location,
 infrastructure facilities, direct access to the Indian market, high quality workforce standards , open
 economy and various free trade agreements make it an attractive outsourcing destination.36 In terms
 of international ranking: (i) A.T. Kearney ranks Sri Lanka in the top 25 in the world for global
 service location, (ii) Gartner’s 30 leading locations for Offshore services has Sri Lanka included
 among the top 10 in the Asia-Pacific region in 2010-2011, (iii) IBM Global Locations Trends
 Report has Sri Lanka ranked at 12th in the top ranking destinations, and (iv) The Global Services top
 100 Global Outsourcing Destinations ranks Sri Lanka among the top 10 emerging destinations.

               Source: Slasscom, Sri Lanka.


61.      Certainly the ICT service industry has grown rapidly since 2005 and is poised to
continue its world class position. ICT service exports have grown to around a quarter of total
service exports over the period – as compared to exports of ICT related merchandise, which in 2012
was just 1 percent of total merchandise exports. At the same time, in 2005, Sri Lanka did not make
the list of the top 40 countries in the A.T. Kearney Location for Global Services Index, and entered at
the 29th position in 2007 when the list was expanded to 50. Sri Lanka has since risen all the way to
16th place in 2009 but fell back to 21st place in 2011 (Figure 3.3).

62.     Still, while the country as a service location remains impressive even in the 21 st rank,
the competitive advantage is primarily centered on cost factors – particularly compensation costs,
(Figure 3.4a). The other two components of People & Skills and the Business Environment is where
Sri Lanka is on the much lower end of the ranking. In terms of the People & Skills indicator, the sub-
indicators covering relevant experience and size of labor force, is holding back Sri Lanka’s ranking
as compared to countries like India, Pakistan, Vietnam and Indonesia. (Figure 3.4b). The low ranking
on the Business Environment component places Sri Lanka with Argentina, Russia, Indonesia and
Pakistan (Figure 3.4c). It is questionable how long Sri Lanka will be able to maintain a competitive
advantage based only on cost in such a rapidly evolving and ever demanding industry.

       2. Adoption of ICT by Sri Lanka Firms

63.      Technology adoption by non-ICT firms seems to be relatively weak in Sri Lanka across
the spectrum of traditional and non-traditional activities. Indicators of technology as compared to
countries in other regions, and even to countries in the South Asia region, provide an impression that
the degree of technology usage by firms is limited and not changing as rapidly. 37 From simple
indicators, such as usage of emails and having own web site, to more complex ones such as quality
certification and use of licensed foreign technology, the Sri Lanka enterprise sector seems to be at the
lower end of the technology adoption continuum (Figure 3.5).

C. Sector Issues

64.       International benchmarking provides a mixed picture with regard to the degree to
which ICT is being adopted in the economy. Although businesses are not adopting technology as
fast as many countries, pockets of export-oriented excellence, in the ICT sector, particularly, are
growing rapidly38. The experience of Israel, renowned for its innovation society and remarkable
outcomes, and an associated reference to Walmart is somewhat applicable to Sri Lanka at its current
juncture. The description of successful knowledge activities and lagging domestic oriented sectorsin
Israel is intended to demonstrate that for pockets of innovation to lead to shared prosperity,
“…strategies should address not only the generation of knowledge but also its destination and
ultimate economic impact” (Box 3.1). Three aspects of the business environment are noteworthy for
these purposes: (i) the role of incentives to innovate, (ii) the investment climate for innovation, and
(iii) the level and growth of technical skills in the workforce.

             1. The Incentive to Innovate

65.     In Sri Lanka, as in the case of Israel, there are mixed incentives for firms to engage in
innovation activities, in particular in the adoption of ICT-based solutions. There are fiscal
incentives for ICT firms and ICT use,39 and the legal system for protection of property rights is
strong in providing protection to copywriting of software.40 On the other hand, the experience of
Israel and others demonstrate that firm level innovation and use of ICT in business is a direct
function of the competitive forces and technology transfer generated by foreign trade and FDI.

66.     In term of the incentives to innovate, Sri Lanka seems ahead of other South Asian
countries but short of the countries in Europe, East Asia and now Africa and the Middle East.
Three important indicators are relevant in this regard. Foreign trade, which had risen to almost 80
percent of GDP fell to less than 50 percent in recent years. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has been
limited to telecommunications and BPO, and has not grown to its potential across services and
manufacturing (Figure 3.6). Finally, related and correlated to the two prior indicators, producer
driven supply chains have seen Sri Lanka as a major component, as indicated by statistical analysis
of imports data covering parts and components.41

        Box 3.1: Investment in ICT and ICT Adoption - The Examples of Israel and Walmart
  Understanding the cases of Israel and Wal-Mart can provide insights on the need for concern over the
  end destination of knowledge generated by innovations, as much as in the innovation per se. Innovation
  has been associated with tremendous technological advances that have taken place and in particular in
  ICT. The preeminent General Purpose Technology (GPT) of our era is undoubtedly ICT, and as such it
  is enabling and fostering economic growth in developed countries, as well as in many transition and
  developing countries.

  The Israeli economy is a world renowned success in innovation, particularly in ICT. Yet, the benefits
  from the rapid growth of the High Tech sector eluded the rest of the economy, thus giving rise to a “dual
  economy” and a mediocre growth rate for the economy as a whole. The following facts and figures
  summarize the staggering development of High Tech in Israel;
         The ICT sector grew at an average rate of 16% per year, jumping from 5 percent of GDP in 1990
          to 14 percent in 2000, and contributing a full 1/3 of the growth of GDP in the 1990s.
         ICT exports grew over the 1990s by a factor of 6, reaching $15 billion by 2000, and accounting
          for 1/3 of total exports.
         The Venture Capital sector became the 2nd largest in the world after that of the US.
         Israel stands internationally as number 4 in terms of number of patents per capita granted by the
          US Patent Office to Israeli inventors, after the US, Japan, and Taiwan.
         The R&D/GDP ratio reached a high of 4.6 percent in 2004, the world highest; the number of high-
          tech companies is estimated at 4,000.
         However, as the ICT sector recently grew at an annual rate of 10.5 percent, the rest of the economy
          grew at just 2.3 percent with Total Factor Productivity actually declining.

  In sum, R&D in Israel has been heavily concentrated in ICT and in product rather than process
  innovations. This implies that most of the Israeli economy has not engaged in innovation, even though
  its High Tech sector is remarkably advanced. Furthermore, a great deal of the benefits from those
  innovations flow to firms and users abroad rather than to the local economy because innovations in
  Israel are aimed for the most part at exports, a significant fraction of the R&D is performed by
  multinational labs, and over 40% of startups are financed by VCs.. The gap between ICT and the rest
  manifested itself also in increasing socio-economic inequality, and in fact the overall picture that
  emerges is that of a “dual-economy which may affect the growth potential of the economy by restricting
  the future pool of skilled labor and creating frictions and tensions that are detrimental to growth.”

  In contrast to the Israel example is Walmart. This case illustrates the way ICT can foster economy-wide
  growth not simply and mainly by innovation taking place in the ICT sector itself, but when a wide and
  ever expanding range of other sectors adopt the advancing ICT and consequently improve their own
  productivity. A telling example is the revolution in retailing brought about by Walmart, primarily via
  the massive adoption of ICT-based methods. In fact, the gains in productivity of the retailing sector by
  itself made a sizable contribution to the total productivity growth of the US economy during the second
  half of the 1990s.

  The two cases provide a cautionary tale of the limitations of even the most successful innovation
  strategy. In a global economy, innovation strategies should address not only the generation of
  knowledge, but also its destination and ultimate economic impact.

        2. The Business Environment for Knowledge Based Activities

67.      The investment climate as it relates to ICT and other knowledge based activities has
undergone key changes in the past decade and presents a mixed picture for the private sector.42
On the one hand, the concerns expressed by incumbent firms seem to now reflect the growing pains
of the transition to a more formal, knowledge based economy. Issues with infrastructure - electricity,
roads and transport, and telecommunications - that have been at the forefront of concerns have
improved (although power remains a top issue). However, public administration – tax, licensing, and
land are growing sources of concern as formality becomes more prevalent. Labor regulations have
become less important while apprehension regarding the availability of labor skills is growing,
reflecting constraints of a more sophisticated level of production (Figure 3.7).

68.     A similar picture emerges when looking at the degree to which business rules and
regulations have adjusted over time. In areas such as starting a business, and trading across
borders, Sri Lanka’s already strong time and cost performance has steadily improved. The
improvements, which have taken place in access to credit and protecting investment, are also
important to knowledge based firms. On the other hand, three key areas affecting formality and risk
taking - paying taxes, contract enforcement and insolvency,have remained as challenges and open to
reforms, signaling possible policy issues that need to be investigated. (Figure 3.8).

      3. The Talent Pool and Knowledge Based Skills

69.      International benchmarking revealed a key professional gap for Sri Lanka’s
aspirations for knowledge based activities: advanced technical skills. While the strength and
sophistication of Sri Lanka’s labor force have been cited as having positive traits stemming from a
tradition of mandatory universal education and productive employment, there are gaps in the talent
pool reported not only by domestic firms as described above, but in an international context. Of the
60 countries benchmarked by the EIU Global Talent Index that measures a country’s capacity for
developing, attracting, and retaining talent, Sri Lanka was 59th in 2011 (Figure 3.9). It is projected to
rise by two places in 2015, surpassing Azerbaijan and Algeria while also staying above Nigeria.

70.      The factors behind Sri Lanka’s ranking include a sophisticated workforce, good
environment for talent, and strong compulsory education, but low scores for university
education. Along with the low score for openness and demographics, Sri Lanka’s place in the
rankings is determined by the 0 score for university education and the minimal score for the country’s
ability to attract talent (Table 3.2). This large shortfall in workers with advanced degrees and training
comes from two ends of the system: (i) not enough students in college and beyond, and (ii) too
much of the trained talent residing outside of the country.

71.     The severity of the tertiary education gap, as a binding constraint to Sri Lanka’s
aspirations of being a knowledge-based economy is seen clearly through the gross enrollment
rates for 2012. Sri Lanka’s secondary enrollment rate nears 100 percent and rivals the most
advanced nations, surpassed only by Estonia and Costa Rica among 26 comparators. However, this
achievement is in sharp contrast with tertiary enrollment rate. With 125,000 students passing exam
based qualifications for public university for only 25,000 places, and only 10 percent of university
entrants enrolled in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects, there
are severe supply constraints. Sri Lanka’s enrollment rate is only 17 percent, better only than the four
countries at the lowest end of the secondary scale: Kenya, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Mozambique
(Figure 3.10).

72.     Given the urgency of the issues, the Sri Lanka authorities are urgently focusing on
raising the technical capacity of the workforce in three fundamental ways. First, tertiary
enrollment rates are targeted to rise from the current levels by investing more in terms of capital
expenditures and by attracting a greater number of technical teachers on a full or part time basis in
the 17 universities. Although the Advanced Technical Institutes (ATIs) have been increasing
enrollment and may double the number of entrants, there would still need to be better monitoring of
outcomes. Second, technical skills are being upgraded for all fields so that basic mathematics and
computer science is embodied in all tertiary graduates, regardless of field, with a goal of making
them more ‘employable.’ Finally, a more active role of private and semi-private technical education
outside of the public universities is being pursued along with innovations using distance learning,
massive open online courses, and partnerships with ICT vendors (for example with Intel, Google and
Cisco).

D. Conclusions

73.     The Business of ICT is seen through two lenses. The first relates to a set technology based
firms in the ICT industry that provides employment opportunities, a source of valuable exports and
an incentive for workers to obtain technical skills. The second lens from a development perspective
considers ICT as a tool for all firms to participate in the new economy with new ways of
organization, information sharing and competing. Sri Lanka has made impressive gains in the first
area and now commands admiration as a world player in the international market. The challenge for
policy makers is how to encourage these gains to spill-over to the economy as a whole through
programs and policies that create incentives to innovate, establish a good business environment for
knowledge based activities, and invest in STEM based tertiary education.

                      CHAPTER IV: E-GOVERNMENT AND DIGITAL SERVICES


A. Introduction

74.     Among the many ways society benefits from ICT (e.g. communication, innovation,
entertainment or social media), accessing public services is powerful and transformational.
Digital services provided by and supported by the government, particularly at local levels, stimulate
public demand for the Internet and get the population “on-line.” Success in getting society on line in
turn encourages businesses to innovate by adopting technologies to provide their own digital
services. Governments play multiple roles in the provision of digital services.

75.      The public sector, through policy, regulation as well and government activities plays a
large and positive role in facilitating the use of digitally enabled services throughout society.
The public sector ensures a good network infrastructure (discussed in Chapter II), a good business
environment (discussed in Chapter III.), and public and semi-public services (Discussed in Chapter
IV). A positive role of Government is as an enabler for the private sector and civil society to use
digital services has been through promotion of good governance, awareness building among citizens,
and the facilitation of collective goods (i.e. platforms, cyber security, disaster contingencies, etc.); In
this first role, the public sector establishes policies, regulations and the institutional framework
needed to govern the new world of digital services.

76.     In many countries, the public sector has played a second role to enable and even kick
start ICT use, by demonstrating benefits of ICT based services in serving the public interest.
Geographic dispersion, demands for better public administration, and rising needs of citizens from all
dimensions of society calls for an ICT-based approach in the public sector in order to raise the
effectiveness, timeliness, and safety of the Government response to citizen needs. Therefore, as a
user of ICT for its own efficiency and service delivery, the public sector can strengthen its own
governance and better serve citizens and businesses.

77.     Given the lack of a defined recipe for success, learning from the experience of other
countries can help avoid common mistakes in deployment of e-government systems. These
mistakes can be very costly, particularly at the infrastructure and architecture level. One of the most
commonly cited and admired examples of a government led e-governance approach to public sector
services has been the case of Estonia, which, along with Singapore, finds itself at the top end of
practically all rankings associated with the adoption, usage and application of ICT solutions. The
much heralded case of e-Estonia is provided below (Box 4.1).

                                  Box 4.1: Country Profile – Estonia
When Estonia declared its independence in August 1991, few would have predicted that in the short span of
15 years Estonia would rank as one of the leading countries in the networked economy. The power of
visionary political leadership combined with strong public-private partnerships has been demonstrated in
Estonia’s rapid transformation over the last decade. Today Estonia has become a role model and has
triggered a surge of interest in the potential of ICT for development within other nations. Estonia cannot rest
on its laurels, however. It faces significant challenges in sustaining its position of e-leadership in the
networked economy of the future.
“The key message we can teach is that e-government is not only making governance more effective and
transparent, but it gives the possibility to develop a real partnership between the government and people”.
— Mart Laar, Prime Minister (1992–2002) of Estonia.
Policy Goals
    •   E-services: developing e-services for citizens, the business sector, and public administration.
    •   E-democracy: creating ICT solutions that can help the development of e-democracy.
    •   Public-sector: increasing the effectiveness of the public sector.
    •   E-education: increasing the computer literacy of the population.
    •   E-security: improving and developing the Information Technology Security Policy.
    •   International reputation: A nation with rapid and effective ICT development.
    •   E-involvement: increasing the opportunities for society to use ICT and digital solutions.
E-Services
       Income tax declaration: Electronic ID cards provide a safe way to access private data so that citizens
        can declare their taxes, have constant access to their files and submit VAT requests online.
       Social security: Forms and regulations about the social security system are accessible on the
        Estonian social fund website. A dedicated portal gives practical information about social rights and
        obligations of people living in Estonia as well as tips to deal with Estonian institutions.
       Family subsidies: The online Parental Benefit service allows people to submit applications for the
        family support program. The entire system is connected to different state databases and eliminates
        the need for citizens to submit data already known by the state.
       Medical insurance: Electronic ID cards allow citizens to use e-services available through the
        national portal to check the validity of their health insurance, their address (and if necessary they
        can correct it), the name of their family physician, and the payment of sickness benefits.
       Library services: The complete catalogue of books available in Tallinn libraries is available online.
        It is also possible to reserve the books online.
       Education: It is possible to enroll online in higher education institutions. The processing, decision-
        making, and informing students of their acceptance (or otherwise) is made in a single environment
        on the Internet.
       E-voting: Voters use the Internet for voting in local elections. Voters are authenticated through their
        electronic ID cards and their selections are confirmed with their digital signatures.

B. Benchmarking Sri Lanka’s Accomplishments in Digital Government

78.      By benchmarking Sri Lanka’s experience with digital government against its
international peers, the various components can be unbundled and analyzed, keeping in mind
that all experiences are unique. The United Nations (UN) international survey of e-government for
the 193 Member States of the UN provides a useful basis for assessing the e-government in Sri
Lanka. The survey benchmarks countries every other year to present a systematic assessment of the
efficiency, effectiveness, transparency, and accountability involved in public service access and
citizen participation. Three of the five sub-indices are highlighted for the analysis - infrastructure,
human capital and on-line services.

79.     During the early years of Sri Lanka’s E-Government program, the index rose more
slowly than its peers, and so Sri Lanka experienced a sharp fall in global rankings. The index
started at 0.39, ranking it 95th in the world in 2005, and rose to 0.42 in 2008 and then to 0.44 in 2012
(Figure 4.1). Since other countries’ index rose faster in that period, Sri Lanka’s global ranking fell 20
places to 115th in the world. In 2014 Sri Lanka’s index rose to 0.54 and led to a remarkable 41 place
jump to 74th in the world. As a result, Sri Lanka’s e-Government program is ranked well ahead of
other South Asian countries and in the neighborhood of market leaders such as Egypt, Turkey,
Moldova and Mexico.


                                 Figure 4.1: E-Government Index (2005, 2008, 2012 & 2014)




     Source: United Nations Public Administration Network, E-Government Surveys.


80.     Unbundling the components of the e-Government index reveals important dimensions
of Sri Lanka’s e-Government program. The sub-index covering infrastructure improved early in
the program, rising from a very low level of 0.04 (ranked 135) in 2005, to 0.19 (ranked 116) in 2012
and then to 0.24 in 2014. (ranked 118).43 Sri Lanka remained ahead of other South Asian countries
and at similar levels to Mongolia, Thailand and the Philippines. Other comparator countries including
Mexico, Turkey, and Moldova achieved scores above 0.3, while Vietnam, which started at Sri
Lanka’s level, reached a score near 0.4 (Figure 4.2). On the other hand, the decline in the sub-index
covering human capital is also significant as the absolute score deteriorated between 2005 and 2014
and caused the ranking to drop 23 places from 97 (0.83 score) to 120 (0.74 score).

43
  The increased ranking was on the back of a rise in Internet penetration from 158 th to 127th (2 to 12 per 100 people)
and mobile usage from 115th to 110th (26 to 83 per 100 people).
                                                                    32

 Source: United Nations Public Administration Network, E-Government Surveys.


81.     The recent improvement in the e-Government index reflects, primarily, a dramatic
jump in sub-index covering on line services. In 2008, Sri Lanka ranked 81st in the world but the
index fell through 2012. However, in recent years, considerable effort was made in establishing the
online portal which now offers 108 e-services for citizens, 51 e-services for businesses and 10 non-
residence related e-services. The portal’s extensive mobile and SMS options make the services,
information and government forms easily accessible to anyone in the country. As a result, Sri
Lanka’s ranking for online services jumped to 38th in the world alongside strong e-government
countries, Mexico and Malaysia, and ahead of Costa Rica and Mongolia (Figure 4.3)


                       Figure 4.3: Online Service Sub-Index (2005, 2008, 2012 and 2014)




 Source. United Nations Public Administration Network, E-Government Surveys.


82.      A decline in the human capital sub-index is noteworthy and calls for further
examination given the tertiary education issues discussed in Chapter III. Between 2005 and
2012, Sri Lanka’s ranking fell 23 places from 97 (0.83 score) in 2005 to 120 (0.74 score). The fall
reflects the global trend of falling human capital scores for the most countries since 2008, but in Sri
Lanka’s case the fall was further than most and so the ranking fell as well. Despite the tremendous
increase in ICT literacy, the low and declining enrollments rates at the tertiary level, discussed in the
previous chapter was the principal source of the weakness in the human capital sub-index
                                                    33
83.     The benchmarking confirms that better infrastructure and improved online services are
necessary but not sufficient conditions for increased participation by the population. Between
2008 and 2014, the e-participation sub- index declined from 0.145 to 0.099. E-participation as “next
generation” public administration is a more advanced stage of online service and is the result of
adoption of a digital approach for public sector interaction with citizens. However, despite the
availability of services and accessible infrastructure, the e-participation sub- index declined from
0.145 to .099 between 2008 and 2014 – a paradox which requires investigation in order to understand
reasons behind the low level of citizen participation.

C. Digital Government and Services

84.      Digital government can foster efficient service delivery, a responsive business climate
and good governance if accompanied and driven by reforms in public administration. Across the
world, public administration reform has been a powerful process of transformation for governments
toward goals of efficiency, accessibility and transparency. E-government and the associated digital
applications can help to foster this process by increasing the speed of operations and managing the
increasingly complex government services and administration. In doing so, E-Government also fosters
predictability, certainty, and cost effectiveness regarding government regulatory functions which is a
key dimension of a conducive business climate. Finally, digital government becomes a key element in
a citizen centric approach by allowing two way interactions between citizens and government in
which there is improved service delivery to citizens and improved feedback to government.

85.       ICT applications can contribute to the goals of improved public administration and
service delivery in a multitude of ways and through various configurations. While the number of
approaches to the deployment of digital services is as high as the number of countries who have tried, a
few principals are commonly held. First, ‘back office’ efficiency starts with good internal processes
and interconnectivity within the public sector. Second, ‘front office’ digital delivery of public service
can provide the benefits of inclusiveness, equal access, and lower transactional costs for citizens.
Business Process Reengineering (BPR) is an important element of both, as paper-based processes
yield to a new way of operating in which technology drives how customers are served and
institutions are run. As a result, the red-tape and cashier level corruption that is so annoying to
business is reduced. Moreover, e-government contributes to greater ICT penetration and literacy as
citizen interaction with government increasingly happens “online.”

86.      Optimally, citizen engagement with Government through digital means involves a
virtuous circle of experimentation, feedback and adjustment (Figure 4.4). Specifically, this
approach requires (i) a policy and regulatory framework
that is calibrated to an overarching vision, (ii) a strong, Figure 4.4: An Interactive Conceptual
accountable and transparent set of institutions to             Framework for Digital Services
implement the policy, (iii) infrastructure and shared
services to enable the interactions needed for service
provision, and (iv) ultimately, an expanding set of good,
reliable and cost efficient public sector services for
businesses and citizens. Citizen feedback then provides
the force which causes the wheels to turn. The
framework as it has been applied to digital services in
Sri Lanka is described in more detail below.
                                                       34
       1. The Policy and Institutional Framework for Digital Government

87.     Based on the vision of a knowledge based society in the public and private sectors, Sri
Lanka was an early mover in seeing the power of ICT to enable public service reform. Given
the perceived positive externalities and the national interest from ICT adoption in society, the
Government led the early stages of the ICT adoption effort as a facilitator, demonstrator, and
catalytic force to foster societal change. In 2003, a unique ICT law was passed in Sri Lanka which
was designed to set up an inclusive, extensive and powerful institutional and legal framework for
reforming government and consequently bringing to bear ICT in the country. The law sought a
comprehensive ICT Policy for the country along with an action plan to implement it though an
oversight committee of high level Government officials, a consultation mechanism with industry and
academia, and a body of dedicated technical specialist drawn from the private sector.

88.      The institutional framework was set up over the 2003-09 period with a view to
implement the ICT Law in concert with a program of public administration reform. The
Memorandum on “Re-engineering Government” was issued in 2006 as the policy framework the
digital government program. The policy was meant to be (i) a requirement on public entities to
ensure quality public service delivery using all ICT channels, particularly through mobile
technology, (ii) a comprehensive architectural framework for managerial and organizational aspects
of governance and service provisioning specified along with rules regarding ICT usage, and (iii) a
program of ICT capacity building for public sector employees.

89.     However, the policy and institutional framework lacked the necessary force for a
comprehensive transformation program to be carried out as envisioned by the ICT law. The
program introduced the National Administration Reform Council (NARC) in 2009 as a high level
body to coordinate public administration reform, but it never met. Under the NARC plan, Ministerial
Reform Cells (MRCs) were meant to design and drive administrative reform programs for each
ministry. Chief Information Officers (CIOs) would support MRC driven plans with ICT solutions.
Improved service delivery was to result from Business Process Re-Engineering (BPR) in the public
agencies, which would be automated by application of ICT based solutions (Figure 4.5 and Box 4.2).

                Figure 4.5: Sri Lanka’s Conceptual Architecture for Digital Government




                                                 35
90.     The institutional framework, while a new approach in 2003, was not easy to activate,
particularly as effort to mobilize a top down program of public service reform was not
successful. The NARC and MRCs did not activate and public service reform did not materialize
consequently. Simultaneously, policy memoranda were unable to provide the catalytic force needed
to push through novel administrative reforms and better service provision. Through the policy, the
champions tried to mobilize support for e-transformation, define priorities in applying ICT to
government processes, strengthen coordination, and specify standards for ICT usage in the public
sector, but lacked the institutional backing needed for such a comprehensive change in Government.

       2. Horizontal (Shared) Services

91.      The horizontal or shared services form the critical building blocks for e-government
systems on a national level. In Sri Lanka, horizontal services consist of many layers for use across
the government in order to support government wide interaction and coordination. Indeed, the strong
effort to build government wide infrastructure, coupled with the national outreach, is reflected in Sri
Lanka’s strong scores for infrastructure. The principal horizontal systems which have been set up
over the past decade are: (i) the network, (ii) the portal and gateway, (iii) the network operations
center, (iv) the interoperability framework, (v) e-authentication, (vi) e-payment, (vii) local language
enabler, and (viii) the government cloud services. Each is described below.

      Lanka Government Network (LGN) is the underlying information infrastructure that connects
       all government organizations. It enables cost-effective and secure provision of Internet,
       Email and IP based voice services, and addresses government’s LAN network.

      The Lanka Gate Infrastructure comprising country portal, Internet and mobile payment
       gateway (Lanka Gov. Payment Service), SMS gateway—collectively provide an enabling
       infrastructure for rapid deployment and integration of electronic services.

      A centralized Network Operation Center (NOC), functions as the government operator with
       LGN and LGC as public infrastructure to ensure good sustainability and low costs.

      Lanka Interoperability Framework (LIFe), establishes general data architecture and standards
       for data exchange for the government of Sri Lanka. Lanka Gate is presented as the next
       generation interoperability framework to build collaborative government v2.0.

      E-authentication requires the Department General of Registrar digitizes all registries under
       development since 2006 while. The introduction of the “eID card,” will enable holders to
       securely authenticate themselves when using an online service.

      E-payment is advanced and regulated with institutions created for e-payments to work
       securely in different ways based on a conducive environment established by the regulators.

      Local Language Enabler Standardization of electronic use of languages in Sri Lanka’s
       language environment was needed to increase nationwide accessibility.

      Lanka Government Cloud (LGC) is a private government cloud (launched in August 2012)
       that offers storage and capacity to public sector clients in a cost-effective and timely manner.

                                                  36
        3. Digital Services

92.      Along with good infrastructure, the improvements in the everyday life of citizens from
e-Government is ultimately based on relevant digitally provided services. Services and
regulatory functions delivered electronically contribute to good governance while the quality of
service provision rises. At the same time, interactive public service delivery would improve ICT
literacy and increase use of the internet. The public, government, and businesses would be
encouraged to use ICT based on the key principals driving the digital service provision:

       Client-focused rather than organization-centered processes,
       Government accountability for service level standards to its clients,
       Electronic sharing of data across agencies,
       Separation of service delivery (front-end) from transaction processing (back-end),
       Online, user-friendly, distance-neutral information and services to citizens, and
       Transparency in government operations.

93.      When Sri Lanka began introducing e-government in 2003, the concept of digital
services by Government was novel and unknown to the population. The approach was to seek
early wins through digitizing high profile life events such as access to birth and death records,
pension payments, and burdensome transactions. The Colombo Municipal Council (for payments of
property, trade and business taxes), the Employment Trust Fund (for ETF member management
service, viewing ETF balances, viewing claim application status) and the e-Revenue License (the
first transactional digital service) were chosen as a good place to start (Box 4.3).


                          Box 4.3: Public Sector Digital Services - A Good Start
  Colombo Municipal System. The online rate payment system that was introduced in the Colombo
  Municipal System has enabled Colombo city residents to pay Rates, Trade Tax, Tax on Business, Market
  Rental, House Rental, Shop and Boutique rental and Hawkers rental. This 24 hour e-service has allowed
  tax payers to make payments via Internet or mobile easy cash, thus saving time and hassle

  Western Province Motor Commissioner’s Department. The e-Revenue License (the first transactional
  e-service) created the path to accepting electronic payments for government services. Implemented in the
  Western Province (2010) where approximately 5000 revenue licenses in 38 DS offices have to be
  renewed on a daily basis and is now being replicated in the other provinces. With automation, all DS
  office are connected by LGN, and the issue of a license has been reduced to 90 seconds on average.

  Department of Land Commissioner. A majority of the land is owned by the state and managed by the
  Land Commissioner, who delegated land identification and preparation of land alienation proposals to
  the respective Land Field Officers of the Provincial Land Commissioner attached to DS offices.
  Previously a citizen’s land application required the Field Officer to visit the location and submit his
  recommendation to the Divisional Secretary who in turn submitted the same to the Provincial Land
  Commissioner and thereafter to National Land Commissioner for approval. This process took 6 months.
  With automation, the time for approval has been reduced to 2 weeks and the applicant can track progress
  of the application, receive an alert message on the mobile phone at each of the approval stages. Land title
  deed extracts can be obtained in 30 minutes as compared to 2 days prior to this intervention.
                                                       37
94.     Since then, e-services were initiated by various agencies – some based on nthe
centralized system and some based on a parallel network. Despite the lack of a broad based effort
at public service reform, digital services were launched by ministries which themselves championed
specific activities and outcomes. For example, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Higher
Education, Inland Revenue, Customs Administration, the Foreign Ministry and the Central Bank are
each pursuing key digital services at different stages of implementation and launch.

      The Ministry of Education implemented a school network (Schoolnet) and provides primary
       connectivity to schools. The network offers services to parents, students, and teachers.

      The Ministry of Higher Education launched the National Online Distance Education Service
       as a dedicated nation-wide telecommunication network connecting participating universities
       within a targeted set of 26 access centers.

      The Inland Revenue Agency is putting in place two phases of automation using the RAMIS
       system for online filing and payment through a service, goods and training turnkey
       partnership with the Singapore Government.

      The Customs Administration has introduced a modern system of declaration and clearances.
       The ASYCUDA World system is now being fully implemented for both imports and exports,
       and trades as well as coordinates with online payments that go directly to commercial banks.

      The Department of Motor Vehicles has engaged in an innovative public private partnership
       with a private company to provide laser-printed drivers licenses that have now expanded to
       fully automated processing on line for limited locations.

      The Foreign Ministry has introduced the Electronic Travel Authorization which allows a visa
       to be prepared in minutes and approved in a matter of hours from abroad. There are multiple
       stakeholders benefiting from this innovation which is unmatched in most countries.

      The Central Bank of Sri Lanka is championing Doing Business with facilitation by the central
       ICT agency and implementing in partnership with the delivery of business regulatory services.

95.     In most cases, the recipe for success included a set of common elements: (i) formulation
of an objective (i.e. payment mechanisms for the unbanked population), (ii) profit-oriented service
delivery bodies mobilized taking the lead (i.e. telecommunications companies), (iii) regulators being
involved in the early stages to guard the public interest, (iv) a private clearing company to provide
the digital certificate framework (i.e. Lanka Clear), and (v) support from centralized experts to help
orchestrate the various aspects and supply technical input .

96.      Examples of public-private partnership also exist in Sri Lanka with the case of
mobile payments illustrating how transforming lives can derive from a collaborative approach.
(Box 4.4). The case represents a notable success deriving from a multi-stakeholder approach that
covers both public and private sectors. It, and other shining examples from Sri Lanka and around the
world, provides important lessons regarding the delivery of public or private electronic services in
the internet era. Provision of services typically involves a focus on (i) the purpose and beneficiary,
(ii) an open platform for innovation, and (iii) participation of multiple stakeholders from all areas.

Box 4.4: Public-Private Partnerships for Digital Services: The Case of Mobile Payments

Using digital financial services to move towards a cashless society facilitates commerce and
payments throughout the economy by eliminating the expense and burden of cashing-in and
cashing-out and carrying physical cash and documentation.

More than 10 million mobile phone users can now send and receive money, settle utility bills,
and make payments for other goods and services using mobile money accounts directly from
their mobile phones if they wish. There is also a huge potential for electronic remittances
transfers via mobile phone and other electronic means. Inward worker remittances were about
US$2,850 billion in 2013 and represents almost 9 percent of Sri Lanka’s GDP.

Sri Lanka’s banking and telecommunications sector introduced one of the best systems of
mobile money and payments for person-to-person, person-to-business, and person-to-
government payment transactions in the South Asia region. The objective is to facilitate
electronic payments among the common man using even the simplest (2G), least expensive
mobile phones.

In order to facilitate this process, it is necessary to have relevant laws that govern e-transactions
and mobile (m) transactions to develop the confidence by businesses and persons that these
transactions are legal and secure. Under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2005 and in
the regulation of 2007, the Central Bank supervises service providers managing a payments
system, including licensed cellular mobile telephone operators. In addition to the Payment
Systems Law, e-transactions and m-transactions are facilitated through the e-Transactions Act,
2006.

As result, Sri Lanka boasted favorable initial conditions with the launch of mobile money,
including (i) a high level of access to traditional payment services (69 percent of the adult
population compared with the South Asia average of 33 percent), (ii) a strong financial
regulatory framework, (iii) a good payment system infrastructure to support electronic money
for e-commerce and e-government, and (iv) high penetration of mobile phone service.

The partnership between the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and the TRC coupled with the custodial
banking approach to risk management enabled the market to be open to both bank and non-
bank providers. Such a level playing field for banks and non-bank providers allowed the
telecommunications companies or Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to launch their own
mobile money deployment and help provide services to the unbanked.

Dialog Axiata, the largest private telecoms operator, was awarded the first license to provide
mobile money services in April 2012 and the custodian bank-based mobile payment services
was introduced in 2013. In 2014 Dialog partnered with Etisalat, to offer in Sri Lanka, the
world’s first ever end-to-end interoperable mobile payment system with common merchant
partners, top up/withdrawal agent networks, and a uniform consumer experience.

D. Sector Issues

97.     Success and failures in the twelve years of experience with digital services have
provided important lessons to help Sri Lanka move to the next phase of service provision. As
the country moves forward, a new cycle of ICT policy design could consider an open and
participative approach based on international experience. Three key considerations to take into
account from global experience are: (i) optional approaches to service delivery in light of important
successes from decentralized efforts, (ii) the need to actively raise the uptake of service use by
citizens, and (iii) the value of clarity in key parts of the legal framework for digital services

           1. Optional Approaches to the Development of Digital Services

98.     Public service delivery as a whole was not institutionalized nor incentivized, so only
public organizations which had strong motivation were able to succeed with digital services.
Despite the ambitious vision and high capacity at the center, widespread commitment at the
implementation level was not strong enough to pursue digital services in a broad based fashion. A
strong set of horizontal platforms were developed and infrastructure deployed at the center, but a
limited set of “vertical” services (applications) were actually launched by ministries. The centralize
approach to digital services led to only 14 public service reengineering projects of which only 5
were implemented. Approximately 48 interactive e-services that have been offered by 22
governmental organizations in Sri Lanka, 33 were launched by the central ICT agency instead of
the responsible agency ministry.44

99.     Alternative approaches to public service delivery may be considered depending on a
range of critical operational issues. Based on the large investment in horizontal infrastructure
already made and the good start in launching a few services, some momentum has been achieved,
However, going forward, alternative approaches to an ambitious national plan could be considered.
Lessons from international experience offers some guidance for implementing digital services:

          Develop a strategy for motivating improved service delivery at a decentralized level,
           following multi-stakeholder consultations to assess citizen demand.

          Implement a policy, institutional and regulatory framework that allows for flexibility by
           defining roles and responsibilities for participants with minimal compliance requirements.

          Incentivize service delivery and ICT champions through national public service awards to
           stimulate champions and competitions among high level public officials.

          Develop a monitoring and evaluation framework to foster conformity to policy decisions,
           allow for measurement of progress and to inform revisions as the need for change arises.

           2. Raising the Level of E-Government Participation by Citizens

100. Public initiatives sought to increase the accessibility, uptake and promotion of the use of
technologies. Standardization of electronic use of languages with information available in three

languages, Nenasalas access centers, schools and universities networks, and introduction of “life
event” applications are examples of efforts to increase adoption of the Internet in everyday use and
improve the quality of life of everyday people. By providing online services in demand, the
government plays a role in promoting Internet usage and stimulating demand for access.

101. However, indicators from multiple sources suggest that a lack of relevant online
services and content is one reason Internet adoption is low. Formal monitoring of e-government
compliance, confirmed by third party reviews, underscore impressions from the international
benchmarking exercise in terms of limited uptake of services.45. Principles to consider include:

        Apply citizen centric principles at the implementation level, including (i) access to public
         information necessary for participation, (ii) bottom-up citizen engagement to foster local
         ownership, (iii) open platforms, encouraging environment and incentives for innovation to
         help avoid stagnation, and (iv) up-to-date institutional capacity to increase quality in delivery.

        Communicate reform objectives, over and over. Communication and awareness promote the
         benefits of digital services, in terms of ease of use and reliability. This increases trust and
         demand for public e-services while fostering digital interaction. Campaigns with heavy
         repetition of simple messages through many venues and media channels are the best.

        Pursue of participatory methods with public feedback. Participatory methods can help
         policymakers set priorities, encourage more citizens to ‘buy in’ to programs, increase
         satisfaction levels and thus augment the chances of successful policy outcomes. 46

        Foster multi-stakeholder engagement. An open approach toward policy and reform design
         improves ownership and engagement of stakeholders. When the transformational agenda is
         ‘owned’ by the stakeholders involved, and services demanded, ICT usage follows naturally.

         3. Completing Key Enabling Aspects of the Legal Framework

102. There has been a strong effort to develop a legal and regulatory framework for digital
services in Sri Lanka. Certainly, the level of services taking place in pockets around the country
demonstrates that the legal system supports digital services and electronic payments. There are a
number of aspects however, which if addressed, could have an important positive impact on business
use of ICT as well as citizen confidence in the system. Each is described in turn:

        The Electronic Transactions Act (ETA), the main instrument governing domestic and
         international e-Commerce, eliminates barriers by establishing legal certainty. Even though the
         law is largely based on good practice, the rules around legal recognition of electronic signatures
         is murky, as is the case in many countries. The Act could allow for recognition of foreign
         certificates and provide an authority to accredit certification providers.47

   Two recent initiatives were launched to increase citizen engagement that could be scaled up: (i) a citizen
engagement portal featuring forums and discussion panels, and (ii) an open data portal that contains 89 dataset.

(1996) and Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts (also promulgated by

                                                       41
        For data protection and data privacy, no single law exists, although there are provisions
         inserted in other laws such as the Telecommunications Act and criminal law. A Data Protection
         Code of Practice would provide appropriate guidelines for the public and private sector.
         Without it data protection and privacy would be widely uncovered by legislation.48

        Successful combatting of cyber-crime requires a comprehensive framework for both the
         identification of computer crimes and respective procedures for the investigation into and
         prevention of such crimes which is provided by the legislation. One such procedure is the
         admissibility of electronic based evidence which needs reconciliation with the ETA.

E. Conclusions

103. Sri Lanka recognized early on the potential benefits of digitally delivered services in the
public and private sector. However, the ambitious vision was only partially implemented due to the
inevitable constraints which accompany broad-based reform programs as well as the common, but
often unforeseen, pitfalls that a new technology can bring. Still, despite the irregular pace at which
the program for digital services proceeded and the implementation lags that characterized much of its
history, achievements were made that lay the foundation for successful expansion in the future. In
particular, critical horizontal infrastructure was established, a high level of technical capacity was
built, ICT literacy increased, and some important services were rolled out to the citizens of the
country. Most importantly, crucial lessons were learned that will serve as both warnings and
guideposts while future approach to digital services are considered.

                          CHAPTER V: SUMMING UP THE WAY FORWARD

A. Introduction

104. Sri Lanka has set its sights high based on a conviction that the ICT sector is critical to
support world class innovation and transformation of public services. The countries with which
Sri Lanka competes are strong and sophisticated in the service industry. Sri Lanka can be also, but
the evidence is that more needs to done to strengthen the underlying ecosystem for innovation and
ICT adaptation. Sri Lanka’s benchmarking exercise reveals its strengths, in terms of costs and ease
of business model. However, these advantages may not be sustainable given (i) the speed of ICT
adoption in the world, (ii) the eventual technical convergence of voice, data and video, and (iii) the
intensifying competitive landscape in the global economy today. To meet these challenges, removal
of supply side bottlenecks as well as innovative ways to increase ICT demand need to be considered.

105. Specifically, a competitiveness, innovation and ICT strategy that would lead to an ICT
policy and legal framework for an inclusive modern economy may be appropriate. The
objective of the strategy would be to assess the ability and willingness of the private sector to
improve bandwidth to serve rural areas, develop applications, and utilize ICT in its daily operations.
As part of the assessment, a series of stakeholder engagements would help validate and expand on
the assessment’s conclusions. The final strategy would prepare the ground for a modern ICT policy
to articulate and institutionalize public sector commitment across the range of policies deemed
integral to the national development approach. Collaborative policy design can start with an updating
of the old telecommunications policy into a modern ICT policy in order to specify responsibilities,
transform relations with citizens, and increase transparency, accountability and outreach.

B. The Overarching Challenge - Unbundling the Broadband Paradox

106. Chapter I identified the “broadband paradox” in Sri Lanka by benchmarking access to, and
use of, ICT in various facets of the economy across a range of countries based on all of the available
international indicators. Subsequent chapters shed light on the apparent paradox that emerged from
the exercise. However, given the central role of broadband access and use in determining the way
forward in the next phase of ICT sector development, the following facts underscoring the broadband
paradox should be monitored on a regular basis:

      The broadband footprint is expanding as 4G LTE technology is available and the incumbent
       telecommunications company has launched the first “fiber-to-the-home” broadband service.

      The Government helping to build ICT literacy across the country through a range of
       innovative programs and projects to mirror Sri Lanka’s remarkable overall literacy rates.

      Sri Lanka is one of the most affordable places for Internet connectivity in the world,
       providing competitive prices for mobile broadband and fixed broadband.

      Yet the overall, utilizing ICT is low for government, private sector and individuals, but most
       apparent at the individual level.



                                                  43
C. Sector Recommendations

107. Based on unbundling the supply and demand paradigm for innovation and ICT solutions,
recommendations for sector policy are made at a strategic level for further consideration.

   Policy and Regulatory Environment

      Review the state of competition, market structure, regulatory approach and business models
       of telecommunications operations in the broadband market. Consider issues impacting ICT
       goals such as pricing, entry, infrastructure, spectrum management, and last mile provision.

      Based on a new ICT policy, strengthen and modernize the legal and regulatory framework,
       including the licensing regime and spectrum policy, to introduce competition regulation and open
       access policy. Incorporate universal service recommendations in licensing.

   Technical Skills

      Identify gaps, set ambitious targets, and partner with the private sector to raise technical skills in
       the economy. Carry out analysis of current and future supply of technical graduates to help chart
       the way forward.

      Carry out crash efforts to raise tertiary enrollment targets and rates in STEM subjects
       through expansion of CS departments, leveraging IT vendor courses, university participation
       in the global innovation networks, and leveraging diaspora education

   Public Services

      Evaluate ongoing pilot projects for public service delivery based on a stock taking of current
       levels of service delivery, priorities, outreach, satisfaction levels and ownership by providers.

      Consider institutional structures to mobilize public service reforms based on concrete service
       targets and public service awards to incentivize champions. Base the associated implications for
       the government ICT sector on citizen needs and defined priorities for public administration.

      Run information campaigns to support implementation of e-services. An open approach to
       policy design shows citizens and businesses that the Government is forward-looking,
       committed, and has a specific plan to improve quality of life. Adoption tends to follow

   Business Environment for Innovation

      Initiate efforts to collect better data on ICT in the economy, covering trade, production,
       consumption, access, usage, cost and performance.

      Analyze innovation activities and the ICT use in business in relation to the drive for international
       competitiveness at the firm level for Sri Lanka.

      Deepen key business reforms, for example, using ICT solutions to improve judicial processes
       for commercial cases through process re-engineering and automation of court processes.
