Executive summary
This report concerns the use of locational data from mobile phones for enhancing
the science of delivery in development programs. The report can be summarized in a
series of key numbers:

1  There is one objective of this report—to enhance the science of delivery by using
locational data from mobile phones. In this context, the “science of delivery” is
defined as evidence-based experimentation, and locational data is one of the toolsets
becoming increasingly available and useful for this purpose.

2 There are two main audiences for this report. The primary focus is on development
practitioners, who are looking to use the locational data toolset to provide a more
scientific approach to their work. The secondary focus is on policy-makers, particularly
in developing countries, who have development challenges they wish to solve, and who
may wish to use locational data for that purpose.

3 There are three main ways in which locational data is used:
    »» Locational data recorded by device users (consumers). The main tool would
       be maps and other navigational aids that combine location-finding services,
       such as GPS, with data stored on the phone, such as maps.
    »» Locational data recorded by service providers (operators). The main tool here
       is call data records that can be passed on by operators to researchers.
    »» Locational data recorded by third parties (neither the user, nor the operator),
       as part of a survey, or to report incidents. This is the main focus of the
       applications presented in chapter 4 of this report.

4 There are four main technologies used to generate locational data, as discussed in
chapter 2:
    »» Cell tower triangulation; the least accurate, but the most widely available;
    »» Global Positioning System (GPS), which uses satellites to locate a user;
       currently the most accurate, but largely restricted in use to smartphones and
       tablets.
    »» WiFi Positioning Systems (WPS), which use WiFi networks to provide

       pressure, heat and infrared sensors, to locate

       campus. This is the most accurate of the

chapter one
Introduction
      More than 70 percent of the world’s inhabitants now own a small computer, better
known as a mobile phone. Those phones typically possess more computer processing
power than the Apollo rockets that went to the moon in the late 1960s, yet can easily
fit in a pocket. This report is about one specific capability of today’s mobile phones—
namely, the ability to locate a phone, and therefore its user, in space and time. For the
purposes of this report, this ability is referred to as “locational data” though in practice
it relates to a range of capabilities. These include the ability of the user to locate him
or herself in geographical space, and to track his or her progress. The locational data
from multiple devices can also be recorded to show, for instance, how individuals move
through a city at different times of day and night, sometimes in real-time.

1.1 How locational
data can be used
    In this report, two specific types of locational data are analyzed:
     »» The active, or intentional, generation of survey data as part of a development
        intervention. Survey data can be geotagged, timestamped, and meshed with
        other spatial data, allowing, for instance, survey data to be shown on a map
        along with the time when it was recorded. Five specific examples of active
        collection of locational data in development projects are discussed in the first
        part of chapter 4.
     »» The passive, or ancillary, collection of locational data, for instance through
        the analysis of mobile call data records (CDRs). Where operators can be
        persuaded to release anonymized call data for research purposes, this Big
        Data database can then be used, for example, to optimize traffic planning
        or to study the response to a natural disaster. Three specific examples of
        the passive collection of locational data, and its use for development, are
        illustrated in the second part of chapter 4.
    In general terms, there are three types of location finding used by mobile devices:
using the cellular network of base stations for triangulation, using Global Positioning
Systems (GPS), and using WiFi positioning (WPS). A fourth broad type of location
finding—Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS)—is beginning to emerge, but is not studied

     Following this broad introduction to the topic in
 chapter 1, the next chapter explores the technology
 behind locational data. Chapter 3 presents the
 methodology followed in this research, and chapter 4,
 which is the heart of this report, then presents a series
 of mini case studies of how it is actually being used in
 a representative sample of different development fields.
 This is the “evidence-based experimentation” which
 can be harnessed to improve the science of delivery,
 and examples of both active and passive collection of
 locational data are presented. Finally, chapter 5 examines,
 in broader terms, the longer term potential of locational
 data as a development tool, once smartphone ownership
 becomes more widespread. Already, as shown in figure
 1.1, shipments of new smartphones will exceed those of
 feature phones in 2014, and by 2017, smartphones will
 account for more than 80 percent of all new phones sold.
 During the period from 2009 to 2017, the average selling
 price of new smartphones will have halved from US$360
 to US$180 per unit, while functionality (e.g. battery life,
 screen size, memory, operating system, etc.) will have
 improved significantly.
     At some stage during 2014, the number of mobile
 subscriptions will exceed the number of people on the
 planet, at just over 7.3 billion. With new smartphones
 arriving on the market at more than one billion a year,
 it won’t be long before a majority of the installed base
 of phones in use around the world has GPS, mapping
 functions and a touchscreen as standard. That will become
 a game-changer in terms of their development potential.
 Thus, while the pilot programs and applications described
 in this report may appear experimental in nature, the
 potential exists for fairly rapid scaling up. But first, their
 social and economic value for development needs to be
 proven in action.

How do locational technologies work?

2.1 A brief history of
locational technologies
    There are three main location tracking technologies in use worldwide: cell tower
triangulation, Global Positioning System (GPS), and WiFi Positioning System (WPS).
These are described briefly below.


2.1.1 Cell tower triangulation
     In today’s developing world, not all phones are smartphones (see figure 1.2); this
means that not all mobile phones have the immense technological capabilities which
many users in developed economies are growing accustomed to. Such capacities include
location-finding technologies, such as GPS, built directly into the handset. Nonetheless,
phone companies faced this constraint prior to the advent of GPS-enabled phones and
developed other techniques that enable call tracing. One such method—cell tower
triangulation—was introduced by mobile phone companies aiming to aid emergency
response teams in locating callers if communications were lost, as well as for tracking
down wrongdoers.
     Cell phones operate as two-way radios; various towers and base stations are
arranged on a grid to form networks. These networks comprise different cells around
wireless towers from which radio signals are sent and received to and from cell phones
(see figure 2.1). This three-way relationship allows phones to communicate with their
nearest tower as the base station monitors the signal strength produced by the phone.
When moving between cells, base stations in different cells recognize a diminution
or a gain in signal strength originating from handset-specific cellular-identification
frequencies (cell-IDs). Towers in the cell which the phone is leaving transfer the signal
to towers in the cell which the phone is entering (this is called a handover and it is a
distinguishing feature of cellular mobile networks).
     Computers connected to the cell base station can determine locations based on
the measurements of signal that the station is recording. These measurements include
the angular approach of the signal to the cell towers, the time it takes for the signal
to travel between multiple towers, and the strength of the signal when it reaches the

2.1.2 Global Positioning System (GPS)
     Given the relatively low level of positional accuracy
associated with cell tower triangulation, mobile phone
manufacturers and operators looked to utilize more
efficient technologies for enabling location-based
services. A particular technological advancement was the
incorporation of the mobile phone as a GPS receiver. As
with many other functions, such as camera, calculator or
web browser, GPS was originally added as a premium
feature but is now standard, even in lower-cost feature
phones.
     Although there are a number of GPS platforms in
use, or in development, the most popular system is called

     Mobile applications provide a wide array of data-
collection capabilities depending on the phone. In
smartphones and some newer feature phones, these
capabilities allow for media files—such as images/raster
files and audio—to be collected and geotagged with GPS
coordinates (latitude/longitude). Almost all phones—
including older feature phones—have applications which
allow other qualitative data (such as digital questionnaires
and forms) to be geotagged when populated in the field.
Applications (like Poimapper from Pajat Solutions Ltd.;
see section 4.1) permit forms to be customized in a way
that allows users to be very specific in the type of data
they are capturing, filtering (i.e. usually through metadata
tags), and recording prior to geotagging the data.
     Typically, data collected in the field is updated and
edited offline prior to being uploaded into central databases
with which the collection tools interact directly. These
databases, or content management systems (CMSs), can
be accessed from the “cloud” (i.e. using remote databases
accessible from the Internet), on the local premises at a
data center, and in some cases, offline, where the device
has sufficient memory storage to create a data cache.
Some CMSs, like GeoNode.org (utilized by a number of

chapter three
a conceptual framework for
studying locational data applications

     While the science of delivery can be improved using a variety of innovations,
technologies, and techniques, the focus of this study is on how it can be enhanced
by using applications and other software-based solutions that use locational data on
mobile phones. The focus is on general-purpose mobile phones rather than specialized
devices (such as GPS trackers) and on consumer-market devices which are affordable
to the broad mass of users.
     This question is answered by presenting applications and real-life cases where the
applications have been used. The applications presented are related to mobile phones
and their ability to track the phone and its user, using at least one of the technical
possibilities presented in the previous chapters. The presentation of applications, and
cases where they have been used, is carried out in sections 4.1-4.4. These are then
presented and compared with each other in section 4.5. The tables presented in section
4.5 are intended to provide a diagnostic tool to assist potential users in identifying
which of the applications reviewed is best to use for different objectives and in different
aid delivery programs. In addition to applications and cases presented, location-based
Big Data can also be used, for example, in development-related research and policy-
making. In section 4.6, some cases where Big Data has been used successfully in
development interventions are presented.
     When reviewing applications, cases and Big Data solutions, three frameworks
are used to provide a conceptual framework. First, learnings gained from the
implementation of Ushahidi following the Haiti Earthquake Project (Morrow et al,
2011) are used. Second, when presenting the applications and the case studies, and
when making qualitative comparisons, an ISO standard called SQuaRE (Software
product Quality Requirements and Evaluation) is used as a loose framework. Third,
implementation challenges are briefly discussed. Since these three frameworks consist
of a large number of factors, an umbrella synthesis framework, consisting of two
simple research questions, is built from them and presented in section 4.5. Because
of the nature of this research, the frameworks are applied in an agile manner. They
provide a backdrop for presenting and benchmarking applications and case studies,
but are followed in an interpretative qualitative manner.

case studies of locational data
    This chapter presents a series of mini case studies of mobile applications that
use location-based data for enhancing the delivery of development assistance. It also
presents real-world cases where the applications have been used, and analyzes the
applications presented in a series of comparative tables. The applications are reviewed
based on the synthesis framework provided in chapter 3.
    The survey data applications presented are Poimapper, Ushahidi, CommCare,
CommTrack, and Taarifa. While there are other applications that use locational data
for development aid purposes, some pre-selection had to be made, for a number of
reasons. These five applications were selected, based on the following criteria:
     »» They provide a representative view on the use possibilities of different mobile-
        based technologies described in chapter 2.
     »» They have both similarities and clear differences with each other, and can be
        relatively easily compared.
     »» They have already proven successful in documented real-life cases, and they
        show good potential for replication and scaling up.
     »» They are among the better known and documented applications.
    In addition to the aforementioned survey data applications, there are also cases
where Big Data approaches have been used to enhance the science of delivery. While
Big Data and its use cases are not directly comparable to the survey data applications
presented, they nevertheless provide an interesting possibility to develop research and
policies to improve societies. Various sample cases are explored in section 4.6.

4.1 Poimapper

4.1.1 Overview
    Poimapper is an application for collecting location-based point-of-interest (POI)
data, developed by Pajat Solutions Inc, a Finnish software company, in cooperation
with Plan International. Poimapper is a tool for “collecting and utilizing point-of-
interest (POI) data with cost-effective mobile technologies”.
    Poimapper is a multiplatform application, which is used to collect, view and share
data gathered about POIs. Poimapper is typically used by field workers, experts, or

    During the pilot, it was observed that custom
forms built for smartphones worked well initially, but
when field workers ventured into more distant districts,
some problems with the offline mode of Taarifa were
discovered. For example, it was not possible to switch
between different survey forms when in offline mode.
This problem was later addressed and served as a good
example of connectivity problems in rural Africa and a
demonstration of the flexibility of the Taarifa platform

east, mainly toward Nairobi, Kenya’s capital. Using this
information, according to the research team, “would yield
the biggest benefit nationally.” This is important research,
since one million people die from malaria each year
globally, and 90 percent of the deaths are children under
five years, living in sub-Saharan Africa (Medical News

     While Wesolowski et al. see some limitations in their
approach—the study can only measure mobility among
phone owners and in regions where there are phone
networks, and cannot showcase migration across borders
(Wesolowski et al., 2012)—nevertheless the research is
important and influential. It could be used, for example,
by public health officials. They could send geographically
targeted text message warnings to the phones of people
traveling to high-risk malaria areas, suggesting they use
a bednet, and thus help reduce the spread of malaria
(HSPH News, 2012).

5.1 Using locational data to
enhance the science of delivery
    This report has provided insights about the many features of a mobile phone,
specifically the technologies which empower users to locate themselves in space and
time, to collect and visualize locational data, and to interface with computer databases
and maps in “the cloud.” Together, these capabilities serve to enhance the “science of
delivery” when employed in a development context. Specifically, they assist in applying
experimentation-based evidence to improve development aid process outcomes.
    Chapter 2 of this report provides the technological underpinning to location
tracking, based on three particular tracking technologies: cell tower triangulation,
GPS (Global Positioning System) by satellite, and WPS (WiFi Positioning System).
The selection of which technology to use for a particular application will depend
on the availability of data, the degree of accuracy required, and the location of the
user (e.g. indoors/outdoors, urban/rural, etc). It will further depend on the degree of
sophistication of the mobile devices used.
    In addition to the technical solutions which cell tower triangulation, GPS, and
WPS can provide, simple innovations in mobile phone use can also be used to pinpoint
locations. For example, SMS text messages sent by a user from a certain location can
contain a code, or other piece of geo-specific information. This code can be tied to
a certain known location—an election site, for example, as presented in Uchaguzi-
Kenya referendum monitoring project presented in section 4.2.2.
    Chapter 3 presented a methodological and conceptual framework for the
benchmarking of specific cases carried out in Chapter 4. Several mobile applications
and real-life use cases were highlighted that have recently been used to enhance the
delivery of development assistance.
    The applications presented were Poimapper, Ushahidi, CommTrack, CommCare,
and Taarifa. The similarities and differences between the different applications are
summarized in the benchmark crosstabs presented in section 4.5.
    In addition to the five benchmarked applications, some potential uses of location-
related Big Data—drawing upon very large samples sizes of data—were explored.
Section 4.6 focused on three cases where Big Data was used in research related to

54                                                      Using Locational Data from Mobile Phones to Enhance the Science of Delivery
                         This report looks at the different ways in which locational
                         data from mobile devices can serve to enhance the science of
                         development assistance. In particular, the report shows how
                         locational technologies work and how they can be used for
                         tracking users. The report looks at four different use cases
                         of mobile survey data in detail—Poimapper, Ushahidi, Dimagi
                         and Taarifa—and also examines a number of ways in which
                         Big Data, notably mobile call data records, have been used
                         for development purposes. The report provides an analytical
                         framework, based on the Millennium Development Goals, to
                         examine which global development challenges may be most
                         amenable to a locational data approach.




The report has been prepared with generous funding by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs
of Finland. It was written jointly by the Media Lab Helsinki at the Aalto University
School of Arts, Design and Architecture and the World Bank Global Transport and ICT
Global Practice. The Global Practice provides clients with infrastructure and policies to
improve connectivity and competitiveness, link people to markets and social services to
stimulate economic growth, increase climate resilience and reduce carbon footprint.
