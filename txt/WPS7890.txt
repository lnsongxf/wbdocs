Does Mobile Money Use Increase Firms’ Investments? Evidence from Enterprise Surveys
in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania


1. Introduction
Investment, or the acquisition of assets with the expectation of future returns, is one of the pillars
of firm growth. This view has been widely accepted from earlier models of economic development.
In the seminal Harrod-Domar model, for instance, the rate of growth of output is in tandem with
the rate of growth of investment, assuming constant capital to output ratios (Harrod, 1993; Domar,
1946). That is, investment in fixed assets is directly associated with output growth. The role of
investment as a driver for firm growth has been also at the core of a vast empirical literature.
Several studies have highlighted how certain types of investments -including investments on IT,
R&D, and innovation, can enhance firm productivity (see Syverson, 2011 for a review), increase
exports (Liu and Lu, 2015), and promote overall economic growth and development (De Long and
Summers, 1993).

The role of private investment for development is particularly important for Sub-Saharan African
countries given the low rates of economic growth and high poverty rates in the region (Ouredraogo
and Kouaman, 2014). Even for those economies where recent growth rates have picked up, initial
low levels of development make the case for considering how to accelerate investment levels.
Against this backdrop, several developing countries have witnessed a dramatic transformation in
their financial systems due to the emergence of mobile-phone-based technology for the delivery
of financial services (also known as mobile banking or mobile money). The dramatic rise of mobile
money use has important implications for the private sector, potentially providing expansion
opportunities. An important question that arises is whether the use of mobile money has any
relationship with firm outcomes, specifically private investment.

The use of mobile phone financial services has rapidly increased during the past years spreading
outside of the well-known and successful experience of M-Pesa in Kenya and besides the original
person-to-person use. At the end of 2015, mobile money services were available in 93 countries -
with a total of over 411 million registered accounts and 134 million active users (GSMA, 2015).
Mobile money services are currently used by individuals to pay bills, by institutions to pay salaries
or make social transfers (Heyer and Mas, 2011), and by firms to pay bills, suppliers, and employees


                                                                                                    2 
or to receive payments from customers. At the firm level, the use of mobile money has been
originally promoted by SMEs -mainly retailers, which started offering mobile money to their
clients as a method of payment (Higgins et al., 2012). More recently, however, mobile money
penetrated beyond the retail-customer relations towards digitizing the entire business-to-business
value chain (IFC 2014). An interesting characteristic of the mobile money penetration at the firm
level is the higher intensity of mobile money use as compared to individual use. In Kenya 80% of
firms that use mobile money report using it once per week or more, compared to an average overall
use of twice per month (Higgins et al., 2012). The same evidence is found in Tanzania by a study
on mobile money use by SMEs (Bangens and Soderberg, 2011).

In parallel with the increased use of mobile money, an increasing body of literature has analyzed
the impact of mobile money usage for both households or individuals and firms. At the household
and individual level, the use of mobile money has been shown to reduce travel costs (Aker et al.,
2013; Bangens and Soderberg, 2011); to increase welfare, by helping smoothing unexpected
income shocks (Jack and Suri, 2014); and to increase security (Wright et al., 2014). Mobile money
has also been shown to increase remittances, improve financial inclusion, and improve women’s
economic empowerment (Batista and Vicente, 2013; Aker et al., 2011; Morawczynski and
Pickens, 2009; Munyegera and Matsumoto, 2016). Convenience in terms of time savings and
increased safety are reported among the main advantages of using mobile money by firms as well
as reducing the dependence on banks (Bangens and Soderberg, 2011). Mobile money has also been
shown to be associated with a reduction in the cost of salary administration (Blumenstock, Callen,
Ghani, & Koepke, 2015); increased access to different kinds of finance such as trade credit (Beck
et al., 2015) as well as with rising profits among micro-enterprises (Frederick, 2014; Samuel, Shah,
and Hadingham, 2005).

The literature on mobile money use and firm outcomes is nascent and the studies that exist, despite
making important contributions, are characterized by a number of limitations. None of the studies
to our knowledge have examined the relationship between mobile money use by firms and private
investment. Few studies, as mentioned above, have explored the relationship between mobile
money use and firm profitability as well as access to finance, but the data used is typically not
representative of the private sector. Furthermore differences in the methodology of survey design
and data collection across countries render cross-country comparisons indefensible. There has


                                                                                                  3 
 
been only one study to our knowledge (Gosavi, 2015) that has utilized firm-level data that has been
representative of the private sector and allows for cross-country comparisons. However that study
explores the adoption of mobile money and does not explore the relationship between mobile
money use and firm outcomes.

The goal of this study is to empirically investigate the relationship between the use of mobile
money and private investment using firm-level data in three countries in East Africa –Kenya,
Tanzania and Uganda. This study adds to the literature in the following ways: (i) it is one of the
first studies to explore mobile money use by firms and the likelihood of investments, (ii) it uses
nationally-representative firm-level data that follow a consistent methodology across countries
allowing for cross-country comparisons, which is a rarity in the literature, and (iii) it establishes a
positive relationship between mobile money use and investment that is robust across a number of
specifications as well as different measures of mobile money use. The study finds that an increase
in the adoption of mobile money leads to a 16 percent increase in the probability of investment by
the firm. A further in-depth analysis is conducted of the different purposes of mobile money use
and their relationship with the likelihood of investment. The intensity of mobile money use by
each type of purpose and the link with firms’ decision to invest is also explored. The findings have
important implications for policy makers aiming to improve private investment in East Africa.

The paper is organized as follows. The conceptual framework, including theoretical underpinnings
of mobile money use and the state of the empirical evidence is presented in section 2. Section 3
describes the empirical strategy, section 4 presents the main results and section 5 concludes.



    2. Conceptual Framework

From a theoretical standpoint the relevance of mobile money and its effect on investment can only
be explained by relaxing the assumption of perfect capital markets in traditional investment
models. In the neoclassical investment model, for example, in equilibrium investment equals the
rate of depreciation, and in the accelerator model, investment is proportional to the rate of growth
in output. In both cases, capital stock is adjusted instantaneously to its desired level. In the Q theory
of investment, an adjustment cost function is added to the firm’s profit maximization problem with
the resulting outcome that investment is defined by the optimal path to the optimal capital stock.


                                                                                                       4 
 
That is investment occurs as long as the marginal return on capital is greater than the opportunity
cost of capital. In all three models firms are assumed to be able to adjust with zero transaction
costs and no budget restrictions; in all of them as per the Modigliani-Miller theorem (Modigliani
and Miller, 1958) perfect capital markets carry the implication that the firm’s financial structure
has no role in investment decisions.

However, several studies have challenged the assumption of perfect capital markets. Asymmetric
information can lead to credit rationing (Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981) which makes the availability of
capital the main determinant of investment (Greenwald et al., 1984); managerial agency problems
can lead to lower investment if there is lack of internal funds (Jensen and Meckling, 1976); and
transaction costs may make external sources of finance prohibitively costly, forcing firms to rely
on internal funds. The introduction of transactions costs and budget restrictions into a firm’s profit
maximization brings about the need to minimize those costs.

Mobile money has the potential to considerably reduce enforcement costs of every transaction:
time and distance for services rendered can be reduced to an instantaneous transmission of
information; low-cost and consistent record keeping of transactions can increase trust and nurture
better terms and conditions as business transactions are repeated, thereby potentially increasing
the volume of operations; and lower outstanding liquidity balances are required for the same level
of business activity. Even the risks of non-payment for goods and services rendered can be reduced
to almost zero provided that the mobile service provider keeps updated records on all its users and
their available funds. Resources freed thanks to the reduction on transaction costs can thus be
allocated to better uses, potentially increasing investment levels. Even though from a theoretical
standpoint, transactions cost reductions or greater liquidity could affect negatively investment
levels, by raising the return on savings that would favor holding financial assets over physical
investment (Bencivenga, et al. 1995), one can assume that this effect is negligible in developing
economies with limited markets for financial assets.

The literature does provide empirical support for the role of mobile money in reducing transaction
costs and improving liquidity, although the final link with investment is missing – a gap in the
literature this study intends to fill. With poor infrastructure and under-developed banking sectors,
accessing banks in developing economies may involve time consuming travel costs as well as
waiting in line time costs. Mobile money use has been found to circumvent such transaction costs

                                                                                                    5 
 
especially in Africa (Aker et al., 2013; Jack and Suri, 2015). The reduction of such costs and the
ease of money transfer via mobile money improves the liquidity of the firm as cash flows through
the firm at a faster rate (Bangens and Soderberg, 2011). There is an established literature that has
identified the positive effect of improved cash flows on investment (Kadapakkam et al., 1998) and
one can hypothesize that sufficient increases in cash flows induced by mobile money may lead to
the same outcome of increased investment. Furthermore the reallocation of time away from dealing
with financial transactions, including managerial time, to more productive activities can lead to
increasing profitability (Frederick, 2014), potentially leading the firm to pursue growth
opportunities through investment.

Beyond reduced transaction costs, there are other channels that have been empirically uncovered
by which mobile money use could indirectly lead to increased investment. Using a dynamic
general equilibrium model with heterogeneous entrepreneurs, imperfect credit markets, and the
risk of theft, Beck et al. (2015) find that mobile money use increases the use of trade credit which
in turn improves firm performance. The wider literature has documented the role of trade credit,
via reputation effects, in increasing access to external sources of financing such as bank financing
(Alphonse et al., 2006; Buckart and Ellingsen, 2004). Increases in access to finance, in turn, can
facilitate investment (Rajan and Zingales, 1998; Levine et al., 2000; Demirguc-Kunt and
Maksimovic, 1998; Cull and Xu, 2005). Finally, the use of transaction, saving, and financial
operations data from the digital financial services platform allows to generate credit scores and
evaluate and price credit risk. This can help to overcome the so-called collateral technology hurdle,
which has hindered the development of credit markets in Africa (Ndung’u, Morales, and Ndirangu.
2016).

       3. Empirical Strategy

Data
The data source used in this paper consists of firm-level surveys for Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda
conducted by the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys with most of the information referencing fiscal
year 2012.4 The sample used for analysis covers a total of 1,228 manufacturing and services firms
                                                            
4
  The same set of questions on the use of mobile money was included in the Enterprise Survey conducted in 
Zambia as well. The data for Zambia, however, show a very low rate of adoption with only 25 firms out of a total 
sample of 720 using mobile money. Given the small sample of mobile money users, Zambia is not included in the 
analysis.  

                                                                                                                    6 
 
(573 firms in Kenya, 289 firms in Tanzania, and 366 in Uganda) with 5 or more employees. The
Enterprise Surveys were conducted in all three countries using the same sampling methodology –
stratified random sampling – along with a common questionnaire. Three levels of stratification
were employed for each country: firm-size, sector of activity, and location within the country.
Weights are used to ensure that the sample is representative of the non-agricultural, non-mining
private sector of the economy.5

Before exploring the relationship between mobile money use and investment, we provide some
basic statistics to explore why firms have or have not adopted mobile money, and what types of
firms tend to adopt mobile money for transactions. The latter has already been explored in depth
(Gosavi, 2015) and thus we do not delve into details in the analysis. So why has mobile money
been adopted by firms? Through the Enterprise Surveys, managers and owners of firms in Kenya,
Tanzania, and Uganda provided responses as to why they have or have not adopted mobile money.
Despite some heterogeneity in the ranking, the most cited reasons for mobile money adoption
across the three countries are reducing costs and risks of transactions and satisfying costumers’
requests (Table 1). Concerning the reasons for non-adoption, the majority of non-adopter firms in
Kenya cited large payments that were difficult to undertake using mobile money. In Tanzania and
Uganda the most frequently cited reason is non-adoption by customers or suppliers.

What types of firms tend to adopt mobile money? In table 2 we present comparisons of averages
between firms that use mobile money for transactions and those that do not. As expected, firms
that use cell phones for operations are more likely to adopt mobile money; while larger and older
firms are less likely to adopt mobile money for transactions. Manufacturing firms and firms that
are part of a large company are also less likely to use mobile money, while a higher percentage of
firms tend to adopt mobile money if they are in the capital or main business city. Firms that use
mobile money tend to have higher labor productivity than firms that do not, although this
difference is not statistically significant. In summary, mobile money adopting firms tend to be
smaller, younger, concentrated in the service sectors, and are located in main business or capital
cities.

Dependent variable
In the Enterprise Surveys, firms were asked whether any fixed assets such as machinery, vehicles,
equipment, land, or buildings were purchased (new or used) in fiscal year 2012. The amount spent
on purchases of fixed assets was also collected. Thus, there are two dependent variables. The first
is a binary variable that takes on a value of 1 if the firm purchased any fixed assets, and 0 if it did
not. The second is the amount of expenditure on the fixed assets. For the three economies, 42
percent of the firms purchased fixed assets, with Tanzania having the highest (54 percent) followed
by Kenya (46 percent) and finally, Uganda (28 percent). Kenyan firms spent the most on fixed
assets with a mean of USD 1,205,834, followed by Tanzania (37,200 USD), and Uganda (22,422
USD). Summary statistics are presented in table 3.



Main explanatory variables
The main explanatory variable is a binary variable that takes on a value of 1 if a firm has used
mobile money for any transaction, and 0 if it has not. For the three East African economies in the
sample, 54 percent of the firms have used mobile money for transactions. Across countries, the
percent of firms using mobile money ranges from 50 to 60 percent, with 50 percent in Kenya, 57
percent in Uganda, and 60 percent in Tanzania.

We do consider additional measures of mobile money use in order to capture whether the purpose
for which mobile money is used matters. In the sample considered for analysis, 9 percent of firms
use mobile money to pay employees, 24 percent to pay suppliers, 23 percent to pay utility bills,
and 36 percent to receive payments from customers. There is heterogeneity across the three
countries. In Uganda, 28 percent of firms use mobile money to pay suppliers, which is higher than
Kenya (20 percent) and Tanzania (25 percent). For paying utility bills using mobile money,
Tanzania has the highest percentage of firms (41 percent) followed by Uganda (21 percent) and
Kenya (16 percent). There is little variability in both the percent of firms using mobile money to
receive payments from customers and pay employees across countries, although far more firms
use mobile money to receive payments from customers than to pay employees. Between 35 and
38 percent of firms receive payment from costumers via mobile money (i.e. 38 percent of firms in
Uganda, 36 percent in Tanzania, and 35 percent in Kenya) and about 10 percent of firms in Kenya

                                                                                                     8 
 
and Uganda use mobile money to pay employees, while the corresponding figure for Tanzania is
7 percent.

Thus far most of the measures of mobile money usage have been based on the frequency of use,
but not the intensity of use. For instance, firms can indicate that mobile money was used for
transactions, but such transactions could be of small or large amounts, and accordingly have
differential impacts on the likelihood of investment. Four variables are used to capture intensity of
mobile money (means presented in parenthesis): the percentage of total labor cost paid using
mobile money (3.35 percent), percentage of raw material cost paid using mobile money (3.90
percent), percentage of utility bill paid using mobile money (6.35 percent), and percentage of
annual sales from customer payments using mobile money (5.53 percent). Do note that all these
variables also take a value of 0 if no mobile money was used at all or if the specific function was
not carried out. Regarding percentage of labor cost using mobile money, Uganda has the highest
with 4.8 percent followed by Kenya (2.8 percent) and Tanzania (2.3 percent). There is not much
difference in the percentage of raw material cost paid for using mobile money across the three
countries with Uganda and Tanzania having the highest (4.1 percent) and Kenya having the lowest
(3.7 percent). Similarly the variation across the three countries is small for the percentage of annual
sales from customer payments paid by mobile money: Kenya – 5.7 percent, Uganda – 5.3 percent,
and Tanzania – 5.4 percent. The pattern changes somewhat with regards to percentage of utility
bill paid using mobile money with Tanzania having the highest figure at 10.8 percent, followed by
Uganda at 6.2 percent and Kenya at 4.8 percent.



Other explanatory variables
The degree of credit worthiness of a firm can influence its level of investment through the ability
to access finance. While information on credit worthiness is directly unavailable, several proxies
are used instead. The credit worthiness of a firm can be determined by its existing access to finance,
such as already having a loan or the array of financing options available, the history with debt, the
productivity of the firm, and also its outward orientation. The size of the firm, the age of the firm,
and even the location of the firm can also in some sense proxy some level of credit worthiness.

Beyond credit worthiness, larger firms may have different investment needs than smaller firms
and thus firm size can influence investment (Cull and Xu, 2005). More importantly, large firms

                                                                                                     9 
 
may have greater access to resources and networks to carry out investments than small firms.
Similarly, firms from different sectors may have different investment requirements -
manufacturing firms may be more likely to invest in fixed assets than retail firms. Older firms may
be less likely to invest as upgrading old technology is difficult and less likely, and opportunities
of investments to take advantage of economies of scales are likely to have been long past (Cull
and Xu, 2005). On the other hand, older firms may have access to networks that ease the ability to
access funds for investments. Along similar lines, multi-establishment firms may have greater
access to resources that enable investments. The same applies to firms located in major cities. The
vast resources available, including access to financial institutions such as banks in cities increases
the opportunities to invest.

Firms that extensively used technology may be more likely to invest in advanced technologies. A
valid critique of mobile money is that it may be correlated with the level of technology orientation
of the firm, and therefore any finding of a positive correlation between mobile money use and
investment may reflect a broader tendency for the firm to use technology. Thus the level of
technology use by the firm should be captured to obtain clean estimates of the effect of mobile
money use on investment. Finally, manager characteristics may be positively related to investment
(McMillan and Woodruff, 2002; Cull and Xu, 2005). Optimistic and more experienced managers
may be more likely to invest, and thus manager characteristics such as experience should be
captured in the empirical specification.

To this end, the empirical specification controls for firm characteristics such as size, age, location,
sector, whether the establishment is part of a multi-establishment firm, and manager experience.
Several proxies are used for credit worthiness. First, if the firm did not pay its debts on time,
restructured outstanding liabilities, filed for insolvency or bankruptcy, or applied for state aid, then
the firm is considered to have an unfavorable credit record. A dummy variable is included in all
specifications that takes the value of 1 if the firm has an unfavorable credit record and zero
otherwise. Second, several additional variables to capture firm access to finance are used such as
whether the establishment has a checking or savings account, a loan or line of credit, the percentage
of working capital financed by banks, and the percentage of working capital financed by supplier
credit, and the average distance from banks. Firm productivity is captured as the log of sales per
worker. Outward orientation of the firm is accounted for by two variables - whether or not firms


                                                                                                     10 
 
export and whether firms have foreign owners. Technology use is controlled for by a dummy
variable that captures whether or not a firm uses email to interact with clients or suppliers given
the complementary nature of mobile money and email use. As a robustness check, an additional
variable -whether the firm has ISO certification – is also used to capture the use of technology by
the firm. Finally, country fixed effects are included to account for time invariant country-specific
omitted variables.



    4. Estimation results

Results with the binary outcome of whether or not a firm invested in fixed assets are presented in
table 4. All results are based on Probit regression models using survey weights. Column 1 of table
4 presents a parsimonious specification with a simple regression of investment on mobile money
use. A positive relationship is uncovered, statistically significant at the 1 % level of significance.
This specification omits a number of variables, many indicated to be important determinants of
investment as mentioned in the empirical strategy section. Thus the findings are susceptible to
omitted variable bias. In column 2 of table 4 a more comprehensive specification is employed
utilizing a number of control variables consistent with the arguments presented in the empirical
strategy section. The positive relationship between the use of mobile money and investments is
retained, statistically significant at the 1% level of significance. In terms of magnitude (not
presented in the table), using the full specification in column 2 the results indicate that the use of
mobile money increases the probability of investing by 0.16. In other words, the use of mobile
money for transactions results in a 16 percent increase in the likelihood of investing. Of the other
covariates considered, only four are found to be statistically significant. Larger firms and firms
that are located closer to banks are more likely to invest. These results are statistically significant
at the 1% level of significance. Furthermore, firms that tend to use supplier credit are more likely
to invest. All three factors in some sense capture the ability to access finance, and thus their
positive relationship with investment is expected (Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic, 1998; Cull
and Xu, 2005). The one odd finding is that firms located in the capital city are less likely to invest.
However this finding is statistically significant at the 10% level and is not robust.

An important concern of the findings is that they may just be capturing the use of cell phone
technology in general. However, the former is unlikely given that 90 percent of the firms use cell

                                                                                                    11 
 
phones in contrast to 54 percent of firms using mobile money (table 3). Regardless, in column 3
mobile money use is substituted with the use of cell phones in general for operations. The findings
show no statistically significant relationship between cell phone use and investment. This in a
sense can serve as a falsification test lending some validity to the relationship uncovered between
mobile money use and investment. In column 4 of table 4 we include both mobile money use and
cell phone use in general and the statistical significance of the coefficient of mobile money use is
retained at the 1% level of significance. There is an unexpected negative coefficient for cell phone
usage on investment, however this finding is statistically insignificant at all conventional levels.
In column 5 we further test whether mobile money use is a proxy for technology in general by
including whether or not a firm has ISO certification. Another variable included is the proportion
of time managers spend dealing with government regulations, in case mobile money use is a way
to avoid bureaucracy prevalent in the economy. Although the coefficient for mobile money retains
its sign and significance, with even a positive and statistically significant coefficient for ISO
certification, this finding is only used as a robustness check given the drop in the number of
observations.

Thus far the relationship between mobile money use in general and investment has been
established. Table 5 extends the analysis by exploring the relationship between the likelihood of
investment and the purpose of mobile money use. Four purposes of mobile money are explored –
payments to suppliers, payments to employees, payments from customers, and payments for utility
bills. The results presented in table 5 indicate a positive and statistically significant (at least at the
5 percent level) relationship between investment and all purposes for mobile money use but for
the use of mobile money to pay utility bills. The relationship is positive but statistically
insignificant at all conventional levels of significance. This may imply that the simple use of
mobile money for utility payments may not substantially ease cash flows or raise profitability to
warrant investments. Of course, the intensity of use of mobile money for utility payments will
provide a clearer indication if this is the case (results presented later). In terms of magnitude,
mobile money use for payments to suppliers results in a 27 percent increase in the probability of
investments. This is followed by payments from customers at a 21 percent increase in probability
of investment and payments to employees at a 17 percent increase in probability of investment.




                                                                                                       12 
 
Thus far the results have explored whether or not mobile money has been used, but not the intensity
of use. Thus the following explanatory variables are considered: percent of total labor cost paid
using mobile money, percent of raw material cost paid using mobile money, percent of utility bill
paid using mobile money, and percent of annual sales from customer payments using mobile
money. As presented in table 6, all four variables have a positive and statistically significant
relationship with the likelihood of investing. All results are statistically significant at the 1 % level
apart from utility bills, which is significant at the 5 % level. The finding regarding percentage of
utility bills paid using mobile money is interesting as it implies that just the use of mobile money
to pay utility bills has no effect on investment (as indicated in table 5) but the intensity of use of
mobile money to pay utility bills may increase the likelihood of investment. The intensity of mobile
money use for raw material purchases has the highest association with the likelihood of investing.
This provides some confirmation of the importance of the supply chain in influencing the intensity
of mobile money use (IFC 2014; Higgins et al., 2012).

Thus far the estimations have been based on the binary outcome variable of whether or not a firm
has invested in the last fiscal year. In tables 7 through 9, we repeat the estimations in tables 4
through 6 but by using the amount used to purchase fixed assets as the dependent variable. Table
7 mimics the findings of table 4, with mobile money being positively and statistically significantly
related to the amount spent by a firm on the purchase of fixed assets. Table 8 is consistent with
most of the findings in table 5 – mobile money used to pay suppliers and receive payments from
customers are positive and significantly related to investing, while mobile money use for paying
utility bills is not. The only finding that differs is that mobile money use to pay employees is not
significantly related to the amount invested. However, tables 6 and 9 are virtually identical in
findings, indicating that the intensity of mobile money use for any of the four purposes is positively
and statistically significantly related to investing.

Robustness checks: Instrumental variables

There are concerns that the variable of interest - mobile money – may be endogenous. Given the
data limitations, endogeneity cannot be completely overruled. However, to provide some sense of
robustness of the findings, the results of column 5 of table 4 are re-estimated using an instrumental
variables approach. For instruments we use the density of mobile money agents, and microfinance
institutions (MFIs) within a 5 km radius. Note that while we expect a positive correlation between

                                                                                                      13 
 
a higher density of mobile money agents with the adoption of mobile money, there is a possibility
that the presence of MFIs could substitute for mobile money use due to the ease of access to other
forms of liquidity.

The findings are presented in table 10, with the first 2 columns based on the binary outcome
variable of investments and the third and fourth columns based on the continuous variable of
amount invested. As can be seen, the positive and statistically significant relationship between
mobile money use and the probability of investment as well as the amount invested is retained. As
expected, the density of mobile money agents is positively and significantly correlated with the
adoption of mobile money. The density of MFIs is negatively correlated with mobile money use,
implying that MFI access may be a substitute for mobile money use, although this finding is not
statistically significant at all conventional levels of significance. The overidentification test does
not reject the null hypothesis that the instruments are valid for both estimations. We also reject the
null that the question is under identified. This provides some credibility to the findings. However,
the instruments are weak with a low F-statistic of 3 for the first-stage regressions. Although this is
not sufficient to argue for causality given the weak instruments, it does add to the robustness of
the correlation between mobile money use and investment.



    5. Conclusions

The explosion of mobile money use in developing economies gives one pause for thought on the
possible effects it can have on the formal private sector. One side of the argument is that mobile
money mainly serves the informal sector and thus may help micro and small entrepreneurs,
implying no tangible benefits for the bigger firms operating in the formal private sector. The flip
side of the argument is that mobile money makes significant dents in financial costs and liquidity
and increases credit worthiness for formal firms, and that its existence has positive repercussions
for various outcomes. This study provides some support for the latter by documenting the positive
correlation between mobile money use and investment for three countries in East Africa – Kenya,
Tanzania, and Uganda. The finding is robust to different measures of mobile money – from
intensity of use to purpose of mobile money use.




                                                                                                   14 
 
This is however just one aspect of the story. The effects of mobile money on the formal private
sector is still ripe for research. Several questions remain unanswered regarding various aspects of
firm outcomes including productivity and profitability. Much of this research has been restricted
by the lack of reliable data that hampers inferences both at the country-level and across countries.
Thus there is an urgent need to promote data collection ventures to provide nationally
representative data following a consistent methodology across countries. The Enterprise Surveys
is an ideal example of the type of data needed.

Finally, policy makers may be able to draw larger inferences about technology in general from
studies on mobile money and the formal private business sector. The introduction of mobile money
may have similar attributes as other forms of technology, and the findings garnered from the
mobile money literature could provide useful in informing the potential impact of new
technologies. Given the importance of technology in development, research on the interaction
between technology and the private sector is crucial. We hope this study encourages further
research in this area.
