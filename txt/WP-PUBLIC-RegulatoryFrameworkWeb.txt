  We note that, in contrast to the approach of merely agreeing to cooperate in implementing the respective parties’ NDCs envisaged by
Article 6(1), should countries decide to aggregate their respective NDCs and meet those NDCs jointly (as may be the case for the EU member
states), then such joint compliance is catered for by Article 4(16–18). Arguably, therefore, the EU ETS model of aggregating compliance
under the Kyoto Protocol would fall within Article 4 while its measure of linking to Switzerland would, under the Paris Agreement, fall under
Article 6(1).
