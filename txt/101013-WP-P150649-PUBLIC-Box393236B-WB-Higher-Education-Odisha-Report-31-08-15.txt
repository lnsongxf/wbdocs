 Centurion University of Technology and Management (CUTM): An example of blending education with skills
 development in Odisha
 CUTM is a unique private State University in Odisha. The institute is focused towards imparting appropriate and
 relevant education. Their objective is to broaden the definition of University to include skills development. Even in
 research, the focus is more on action research projects.
 The University is trying to implement a faculty led governance system. This implies faculty led admissions, research
 and other reforms. Faculty councils to deliberate and decide on courses, grading pattern and blending of skills
 component are held every month. Faculty development programs are conducted regularly every weekend. Also,
 domain knowledge trainings are held such as courses on New Age Teaching on innovations in teaching methods.
 The focus is on practice- oriented pedagogy.
 The autonomy of the institution allows it to be market oriented and develop a skill-based curriculum which is
 a new and worthwhile approach for creating relevant knowledge base and preparing students for employment.
 Curriculum is revised every 3-4 years. Faculty, students and alumni are involved in this process. The University has
 also developed online course content and makes MOOC courses available to students.
 Besides general courses, the University runs various short term skill development courses through its social outreach
 entity, Gram Tarang, and also runs Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs). Students undergoing these courses also have
 the facility of taking the Board examination for XIth and XIIth standards from CUTM which has a tie-up with National
 Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) of Government of India, for this purpose. The students of certificate, diploma
 and degree courses share the same hostels and frequently work jointly in the workshops. This inculcates a spirit of
 inclusion among the two groups which are very different socially and economically.
