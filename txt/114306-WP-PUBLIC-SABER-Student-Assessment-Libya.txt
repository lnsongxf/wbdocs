             1. Classroom Assessment
                 In Libya, formal, system-level documents provide guidelines for classroom
                 assessment. In addition, system-wide resources, such as scoring criteria and rubrics
                 for grading and reviewing students’ work, are available for teachers. Some system-
                 level mechanisms are in place to ensure that teachers develop skills and expertise in
                 classroom assessment, including school inspection and teacher supervision.
                 However, classroom assessment practices are generally considered to be weak, and
                 teacher evaluations tend to provide little useful feedback to students.

              2. Examinations
                 The End of Secondary Education Exam is administered to students in grade 12 with
                 the main purpose of student selection to higher education institutions. The examination
                 covers eight basic (core) subjects: Islamic education, Arabic language, French
                 language, English language, Mathematics and Statistics, Information Technology,
                 Principles of Public Administration, and the Writing Process, as well as elective
                 subjects depending on the student’s track. The examination has been operating on a
                 regular basis since 1989, and funding for the examination is allocated by the
                 government, covering some core activities such as examination design and
                 administration. The Examinations Department, which carries out the End of Secondary
                 Education Exam, is adequately staffed and has some of the required facilities to carry
                 out the examination. However, inappropriate behavior surrounding the examination is
                 high, as, for example, copying from other candidates and leakage of the content of an
                 examination paper prior to its administration tend to occur.

             3. National Large-Scale Assessment (NLSA)
                 Libya does not have an NLSA program, and it does not have plans to institute one in
                 the near future.

             4. International Large-Scale Assessment (ILSA)
                 Libya has not participated in an ILSA, and it does not have plans to do so in the near
                 future.




As of November 2015, in-country validation of this report had not taken place. Information on Libya’s assessment system was
 collected in April 2013, prior to the current conflict period. Consequently, the findings in this report reflect the status of the
                                 country’s assessment system prior to the current crisis situation.

Introduction
Libya has focused on increasing student learning outcomes by improving the quality of education in the country. An
effective student assessment system is an important component to improving education quality and learning outcomes
as it provides the necessary information to meet stakeholders’ decision-making needs. In order to gain a better
understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of its existing assessment system, Libya has decided to benchmark this
system using standardized tools developed under The World Bank’s Systems Approach for Better Education Results
(SABER) program. SABER is an evidence-based program to help countries systematically examine and strengthen the
performance of different aspects of their education systems.


What is SABER-Student Assessment?
SABER-Student Assessment is a component of the SABER program that focuses specifically on benchmarking student
assessment policies and systems. The goal of SABER-Student Assessment is to promote stronger assessment systems that
contribute to improved education quality and learning for all.

National governments and international agencies are increasingly recognizing the key role that assessment of student
learning plays in an effective education system. The importance of assessment is linked to its role in:
(i)     providing information on levels of student learning and achievement in the system;
(ii)    monitoring trends in education quality over time;
(iii)   supporting educators and students with real-time information to improve teaching and learning; and
(iv)    holding stakeholders accountable for results.

SABER-Student Assessment methodology

The SABER-Student Assessment framework is built on the available evidence base for what an effective assessment system
looks like. The framework provides guidance on how countries can build more effective student assessment systems. The
framework is structured around two main dimensions of assessment systems: the types/purposes of assessment activities
and the quality of those activities.

Assessment types and purposes

Assessment systems tend to be comprised of three main types of assessment activities, each of which serves a different
purpose and addresses different information needs. These three main types are: classroom assessment, examinations,
and large-scale, system level assessments.

Classroom assessment provides real-time information to support ongoing teaching and learning in individual classrooms.
Classroom assessments use a variety of formats, including observation, questioning, and paper-and-pencil tests, to
evaluate student learning, generally on a daily basis.

Examinations provide a basis for selecting or certifying students as they move from one level of the education system to
the next (or into the workforce). All eligible students are tested on an annual basis (or more often if the system allows for
repeat testing). Examinations cover the main subject areas in the curriculum and usually involve essays and multiple-
choice questions.




                                                                                                                           2
SYSTEMS APPROACH FOR BETTER EDUCATION RESULTS
 LYBIA ǀ SABER-STUDENT ASSESSMENT                                                         SABER COUNTRY REPORT |2015


Large-scale, system-level assessments provide feedback on the overall performance of the education system at particular
grades or age levels. These assessments typically cover a few subjects on a regular basis (such as every 3 to 5 years), are
often sample based, and use multiple-choice and short-answer formats. They may be national or international in scope.

Appendix 1 summarizes the key features of these main types of assessment activities.


Quality drivers of an assessment system

The key considerations when evaluating a student
assessment system are the individual and combined quality
of assessment activities in terms of the adequacy of the
information generated to support decision making. There
are three main drivers of information quality in an
assessment system: enabling context, system alignment,
and assessment quality.


Enabling context refers to the broader context in which the
assessment activity takes place and the extent to which that context is conducive to, or supportive of, the assessment. It
covers such issues as the legislative or policy framework for assessment activities; institutional and organizational
structures for designing, carrying out, or using results from the assessment; the availability of sufficient and stable sources
of funding; and the presence of trained assessment staff.


System alignment refers to the extent to which the assessment is aligned with the rest of the education system. This
includes the degree of congruence between assessment activities and system learning goals, standards, curriculum, and
pre- and in-service teacher training.


Assessment quality refers to the psychometric quality of the instruments, processes, and procedures for the assessment
activity. It covers such issues as design and implementation of assessment activities, analysis and interpretation of student
responses to those activities, and the appropriateness of how assessment results are reported and used.


Crossing the quality drivers with the different assessment types/purposes provides the framework and broad indicator
areas shown in Table 1. This framework is a starting point for identifying indicators that can be used to review assessment
systems and plan for their improvement.


Table 1: Framework for building an effective assessment system, with indicator areas
The indicators are identified based on a combination of criteria, including:

x   professional standards for assessment;
x   empirical research on the characteristics of effective assessment systems, including analysis of the characteristics
    that differentiate between the assessment systems of low- versus high-performing nations; and
x   theory — that is, general consensus among experts that it contributes to effective assessment.




                                                                                                                             3

 LYBIA ǀ SABER-STUDENT ASSESSMENT                                                      SABER COUNTRY REPORT |2015


Levels of development


The World Bank has developed a set of standardized questionnaires and rubrics for collecting and evaluating data
on the three assessment types and related quality drivers.


The questionnaires are used to collect data on the characteristics of the assessment system in a particular country. The
information from the questionnaires is then applied to the rubrics in order to judge the development level of the country’s
assessment system in different areas.


The basic structure of the rubrics for evaluating data collected using the standardized questionnaires is summarized
in Appendix 2. The goal of the rubrics is to provide a country with some sense of the development level of its assessment
activities compared to best or recommended practice in each area. For each indicator, the rubric displays four
development levels—Latent, Emerging, Established, and Advanced. These levels are artificially constructed categories
chosen to represent key stages on the underlying continuum for each indicator. Each level is accompanied by a description
of what performance on the indicator looks like at that level.

x   Latent is the lowest level of performance; it represents absence of, or deviation from, the desired attribute.
x   Emerging is the next level; it represents partial presence of the attribute.
x   Established represents the acceptable minimum standard.
x   Advanced represents the ideal or current best practice.

A summary of the development levels for each assessment type is presented in Appendix 3.


In reality, assessment systems are likely to be at different levels of development in different areas. For example, a
system may be Established in the area of examinations, but Emerging in the area of large-scale, system-level
assessment, and vice versa. While intuition suggests that it is probably better to be further along in as many areas as
possible, the evidence is unclear as to whether it is necessary to be functioning at Advanced levels in all areas.
Therefore, one might view the Established level as a desirable minimum outcome to achieve in all areas, but only aspire
beyond that in those areas that most contribute to the national vision or priorities for education. In line with these
considerations, the ratings generated by the rubrics are not meant to be additive across assessment types (that is, they
are not meant to be added to create an overall rating for an assessment system; they are only meant to produce an overall
rating for each assessment type). The methodology for assigning development levels is summarized in Appendix 4.

Education in Libya

Libya is an upper-middle-income country in the Middle East and North Africa region. GDP per capita (current US$) was
$10,456 in 2009. However, the conflict in 2011, which led to the removal of Muammar Gaddafi at the head of the
government, had significant economic effects, disrupting oil production on which the economy has been reliant.
Consequently, economic growth contracted by 60% in 2011. However, real GDP growth doubled in 2012 and the trend
was expected to continue throughout 2013, as the country rebuilds.

The Libyan education system is comprised of pre-primary education (two years); primary education (six years); and
secondary education (six years). In 2011, 99.9% of youth (aged 15-24) were literate, compared to a regional average of
89.9% in the Arab states.

Libya’s education sector is currently coping with challenges arising from the 2011 conflict, during which 40% of its schools
were damaged. The country has prioritized several key areas for development in its education sector, based on the results
of the 2012 Nation-wide School Assessment. The Ministry of Education conducted the assessment with the support of
UNICEF and nongovernmental organization ACTED to collect comprehensive baseline data on the status of the education
sector after 2011. The priority areas chosen by policymakers include collecting up-to-date data to inform education
planning, management, and finance; promoting early childhood development by applying relevant learning and
development standards for children aged 0-6 years; and developing three-to-five-year investment plans to enhance the
learning environment for children in the country.

Detailed information on Libya’s student assessment system was collected using the SABER--Student Assessment
questionnaires and rubrics. It is important to remember that these tools primarily focus on benchmarking a country’s
policies and arrangements for assessment activities at the system or macro level. Additional data would need to be
collected to determine actual, on-the-ground practices, particularly by teachers and students in schools. The following
sections discuss the findings for each assessment type, accompanied by suggested policy options. Appendix 5 provides
detailed, completed rubrics for each assessment type.

Classroom Assessment

Level of development: EMERGING

Formal, system-level documents provide guidelines for classroom assessment in Libya. These are the Rules of Grades
Distribution for Courses in Basic Education for the School Year 2012-13 and the Rules of Grades Distribution for Courses in
the Secondary Education for the School Year 2012-2013. These documents are updated annually and are available online
at the Ministry of Education’s website.


In addition to these documents, some resources are available at the system level in Libya to support teachers in their
classroom assessment activities. Apart from textbooks or workbooks that provide support for classroom assessment,
teachers can access scoring criteria and rubrics for students' work, as well as a document that outlines what students are
expected to learn in different subject areas at different age and grade levels. Although this document does not make clear
the level of performance required of students, another official curriculum or standards document specifies what students
are expected to learn.


Some system-level mechanisms are also in place to ensure that teachers develop skills in classroom assessment, as school
inspection or teacher supervision includes a component focused on classroom assessment. However, pre-service and in-
service teacher training opportunities which cover classroom assessment topics are not available. At the same time, not
all teacher training programs include a required course on classroom assessment.


In addition, classroom assessment practices are considered to be weak, and are generally perceived as providing little
useful feedback to students. Limited mechanisms to systematically monitor the quality of classroom assessment practices.
For example, although classroom assessment is a required component of a teacher's performance evaluation and school
inspection or teacher supervision is in place, an external moderation system that reviews the difficulty of classroom
assessment activities and the appropriateness of scoring criteria, or government funding for research on the quality of
classroom assessment activities are not in place.


Classroom assessment information is required to be disseminated to some key stakeholders in Libya, including parents,
students, schools, and occasionally school inspectors. However, schools and teachers are not required to disseminate
classroom assessment information to the school district or Ministry of Education officials.


 Libya also has limited requirements for using classroom assessments to support student learning. Policies require that
classroom assessment activities are used to inform parents about their child's learning, as well as to help determine
student grades. However classroom assessment activities are not required for diagnosing student learning issues,
providing feedback to students on their learning, or planning next steps in instruction.


Suggested policy options:

1. Introduce a variety of system-level mechanisms to ensure that teachers develop skills and expertise in classroom
assessment. For example, introduce legislation for instituting yearly in-service teacher training opportunities in classroom
assessment that are made available to all teachers on a regular basis. Additionally, review existing pre-service training
mechanisms and adjust them to ensure that teachers receive sufficient training in classroom assessment.



                                                                                                                          6

2. Introduce varied and systematic mechanisms to monitor the quality of classroom assessment practices. For example,
allocate government funding for conducting system-wide reviews on the quality of classroom assessment practices in
Libya and for identifying steps on how to improve them.

3. Establish policies that require teachers to use classroom assessment activities for a variety of activities which promote
and inform student learning. For example, mandate that classroom assessment activities be used to diagnose student
learning issues and provide feedback to students on their learning.

Examinations

Level of development: ESTABLISHED

Libya has administered the End of Secondary Education Exam to students in grade 12 on a regular basis since 1989. The
examination is used to determine student admission to university or other higher education institutions. It covers eight
basic (core) subjects, including Islamic education, Arabic language, French language, English language, mathematics and
statistics, information technology, principles of public administration, and writing, as well as elective subjects, depending
on a student's track.


The Ministry of Education authorized the End of Secondary Education Exam through a formal policy document, which
addresses some key aspects of the examination. It describes the purpose of the examination and authorized uses of
results; specifies who can sit for the examination; and identifies rules about examination preparation. However, it does
not outline governance, distribution of power, responsibilities among key entities, or state funding sources.


 The government allocates regular funding for the End of Secondary Education Exam, which covers some core examination
activities, including examination design and administration, and data analysis. However, funding does not cover data
reporting, long- or medium-term planning of program milestones, staff training, or research and development activities.


The Examinations Department, a unit within the Ministry of Education, has been responsible for running the End of
Secondary Education Exam since 1989. It is adequately staffed with full-time and permanent staff and has some facilities
needed to carry out the examination effectively, such as adequate communication tools.


The education system offers some opportunities that prepare for work on the examination. For example, the University
of Tripoli offers a graduate program specifically focused on educational measurement and evaluation. However, there are
no non-university or university courses on educational measurement and evaluation available.


Teachers have opportunities to learn about the examination through up-to-date compulsory courses or workshops. In
addition, teachers are involved in some examination-related tasks, such as selecting or creating examination questions.
They are not involved in other tasks, such as selecting or creating examination scoring guides, or scoring the examination.


Limited mechanisms exist to ensure the quality of the examination in a systematic way. While internal and external reviews
are in place, the process does not include pilot or field testing, translation verification, or external certification or audits.
Inappropriate behavior is reported to surround the examination process. For example; leakage of the content of an
examination paper or part of a paper prior to the examination, copying from other candidates, and using unauthorized
materials such as prepared answers and notes, all occur during the examination process.


Students who do not perform well on the examination have a number of options. They may retake the exam, attend
remedial or preparatory courses to prepare to retake the examination, or repeat the grade. Students cannot opt for less
selective schools, universities, or tracks.
Suggested policy options:




                                                                                                                               8

1. Ensure a wide range of opportunities that prepare for work on the End of Secondary Education Exam. For example,
develop an internship program in the examination office or establish non-university training courses on educational
measurement and evaluation.

2. Ensure the credibility of the examinations by putting in place appropriate preventive and reactive measures against
inappropriate behavior. Clearly communicate these measures to key stakeholders, and consistently enforce them. For
example, strengthen protocol around the confidentiality of the examination paper to prevent its leakage prior to
administration of the exam. Introduce provisions that make it more difficult for candidates to use mobile phones to receive
assistance while taking the examination.


3. Establish varied and systematic mechanisms to ensure the quality of the End of Secondary Education Exam and monitor
its consequences. For example, put in place external audits to review the quality of the assessment and conduct regular
focus groups of key stakeholders to monitor the consequences of the examination.

National Large-Scale Assessment (NLSA)

Level of development: LATENT

Libya has never carried out a national large-scale assessment and has no plans to do so in the future. No policy document
pertaining to such assessment is available in Libya.


Suggested policy options:

1. Build momentum around the importance of regular, system-level assessment of student achievement levels and related
factors.

2. Create policy documents that support national large-scale assessment activity; ensure a recurrent, stable government
budget to fund large-scale assessment activities; and strengthen the organizational structure required for regular large-
scale assessments.

International Large-Scale Assessment (ILSA)

Level of development: LATENT

Libya has never participated in an international large-scale assessment. Some stakeholders in the country has expressed
an interest in participating in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2015. However concrete
steps have not been taken to participate in this, or any other, ILSA in the next five years. In addition, Libya has no policy
document addressing participation in ILSA.

Suggested policy options:


1. Build momentum around the importance of internationally comparable, system-level assessment of student
achievement levels.

2. Establish a plan and take concrete steps to participate in TIMSS or PIRLS 2015 in order to benchmark performance in
the country and develop some national expertise in large-scale assessments.

Appendix 4: Methodology for Assigning Development Levels


1. The country team or consultant collects information about the assessment system in the country.


2. Based on the collected information, a level of development and score is assigned to each dimension in the rubrics:


    x   Latent = 1 score point
    x   Emerging = 2 score points
    x   Established = 3 score points
    x   Advanced = 4 score points

3. The score for each quality driver is computed by aggregating the scores for each of its constituent dimensions. For
example:


The quality driver, ‘Enabling Context,’ in the case of ILSA, has 3 dimensions on which a hypothetical country receives the
following scores: Dimension A = 2 points; Dimension B = 2 points; Dimension C = 3 points. The hypothetical country’s
overall score for this quality driver would be: (2+2+3)/3 = 2.33


4. A preliminary level of development is assigned to each quality driver.


5. The preliminary development level is validated using expert judgment in cooperation with the country team and The
World Bank Task Team Leader.


For scores that allow a margin of discretion (i.e., to choose between two levels of development), a final decision has to be
made based on expert judgment. For example, the aforementioned hypothetical country has an ‘Enabling Context’ score
of 2.33, corresponding to a preliminary level of development of ‘Emerging or Established.’ Based on qualitative
information not captured in the rubric, along with expert judgment, the country team chooses ‘Emerging’ as the most
appropriate level.


6. Scores for certain key dimensions under ‘Enabling Context’ (in the case of EXAM, NLSA, and ILSA) and under ‘System
Alignment’ (in the case of CLASS) were set as ceiling scores, i.e., the overall mean score for the particular assessment type
cannot be greater than the score for these key dimensions. These key variables include formal policy, regular funding,
having a permanent assessment unit, and the quality of assessment practices.

Classroom Assessment: Development-level rating justifications

1. The Center for Educational Curricula and Research in the Curricula Department at the Ministry of Education authorized the Rules of Grades Distribution for
Courses in Basic Education for the School Year 2012-13 and the Rules of Grades Distribution for Courses in the Secondary Education for the School Year 2012-2013
documents, which provide guidelines for classroom assessment. These documents are updated annually.

2. The documents are available online at the Ministry of Education's website and are also distributed to teachers.

3. Some system-wide resources are available to support teachers in classroom assessment activities. These include textbooks or workbooks that provide support
for classroom assessment, scoring criteria and rubrics for students' work, and a document that outlines what students are expected to learn in different subject
areas at different age and grade levels. Other materials are not available, however, including a document that outlines the level of performance that students
are expected to reach in different subject areas at different grade or age levels; item banks of examples of multiple-choice or open-ended questions; online
assessment resources; and computer-based testing with instant reports on students' performance.

4. An official curriculum or standards document specifies what students are expected to learn, but the level of performance required is not clear.

5. School inspection or teacher supervision with a component focused on classroom assessment is in place to ensure that teachers develop skills and expertise in
classroom assessment. Other system-level mechanisms are not available. These include pre-service and in-service teacher training; online resources on
classroom assessment; opportunities to participate in conferences and workshops; and item development for, or scoring of, large-scale assessments or exams.
At the same time, not all teacher training programs include a required course on classroom assessment.

6. Classroom assessment practices are generally considered to be weak. Classroom assessment activities very commonly rely on multiple-choice, selection-type
questions and mainly gauge the ability of students to recall information. Teachers often do not use explicit or a priori criteria for scoring or grading students'
work, and it is common to observe errors in grading or scoring. In addition, parents are poorly informed about students' grades. Classroom assessment activities
generally provide little useful feedback to students, and tend to be used as administrative or control tools rather than as pedagogical resources. However the
uneven application of standards for grading students' work and grade inflation are not serious problems.

7. Limited required systematic mechanisms are in place to monitor the quality of classroom assessment practices. For example, classroom assessment is a
required component of a teacher's performance evaluation, and school inspection or teacher supervision is in place. However the system does not provide for
an external moderation mechanism that reviews the difficulty of classroom assessment activities or the appropriateness of scoring criteria. The government
does not have national reviews of the quality of education that include a focus on classroom assessment, or offer funding for research on the quality of
classroom assessment activities.

8. Classroom assessment information is required to be disseminated to some key stakeholders, including parents, students, schools, and occasionally school
inspectors. However, schools and teachers are not required to disseminate classroom assessment information to school district or Ministry of Education officials.

                                                                                                                                                                19

9. Limited requirements specify how classroom assessment should be used to support student learning. Educators are required to use data gathered from
classroom assessment activities to inform parents about their child's learning, as well as to help determine student grades. However they are not required to use
the information for diagnosing student learning issues; providing feedback to students on their learning; planning next steps in instruction; or providing input to
an external examination program.

Examinations: Development-level rating justifications

1. The End of Secondary Education Exam is administered to students in grade 12 with the main purpose of determining admission to university or other higher
education institutions. The examination has been administered since 1989 and covers eight basic (core) subjects: Islamic education, Arabic language, French
language, English language, mathematics and statistics, Information technology, principles of public administration, and writing. The examination also covers
elective subjects, depending on a student's track. Subjects in the first track are economics, accounting, political science, and behavioral science principles; subjects
in the second track include history, geography, principles of sociology, and psychology; and subjects in the third track include advanced mathematics, physics,
chemistry, and biology.

2. The Ministry of Education authorized the examination through a formal policy document.

3. The policy document authorizing the examination is available to the public.

4. The policy document addresses some key aspects of the examination. Specifically, it describes the purpose of the examination and authorized uses of results;
outlines procedures for special and disadvantaged students; and outlines procedures for investigating and addressing security breaches, cheating, or other forms
of inappropriate behavior. The document also specifies who can sit for the examination; identifies rules about examination preparation; explains the format of the
examination questions; and explains the alignment of the examination with curricula and standards. However, the policy document does not outline governance,
distribution of power, responsibilities among key entities, or state funding sources.

5. Although policymakers, educators, students, and parents support the examination, and teachers are neutral to it, it is unclear whether the media, think tanks
and nongovernmental organizations, universities, or employers support it.

6. Stakeholder groups have made coordinated attempts to improve the examination.

7. Leadership in charge of the examination generally welcomes efforts to improve the examination.

8. The government allocates regular funding for the End of Secondary Education Exam.

9. Funding covers some core examination activities, including examination design and administration, and data analysis. However, it does not cover data reporting,
long- or medium-term planning of program milestones, or staff training.

10. Funding does not cover research and development activities.

11. The Examinations Department has been responsible for running the End of Secondary Education Exam since 1989.

12. The Examinations Department is a unit within the Ministry of Education and is not accountable to an external board or agency.

13. Examination results are recognized in Libya and by more than two certification or selection systems abroad, including those in Jordan and Egypt.

14. The examination office has some of the required facilities to carry out the examination. These include a secure building, storage facilities, and adequate
communication tools. It does not have computers for all technical staff or the ability to back up data. It is unclear whether the examination office has access to
adequate computer servers.

15. The examination office is adequately staffed with full-time and permanent staff to carry out the examination effectively, with minimal issues. Problems have
been reported over omission of curricular topics, poor training of test administrators, and unclear instructions in administering the examination. The exam has not
seen errors in data processing or examination questions; errors in scoring which lead to delays in reporting results; or delays in examination administration due to
issues in the design of examination questions.

16. Some opportunities are available to prepare educators to work on the examination. The University of Tripoli offers a graduate program specifically focused on
educational measurement and evaluation. Funding is available for attending international programs, courses, and workshops on educational measurement and
evaluation. However, the examination office does not offer internships, nor are non-university or university courses available on educational measurement and
evaluation.

17. There is a clear understanding that the examination measures national school curriculum guidelines or standards.

18. Stakeholder groups largely accept what is measured by the examination. However, some teachers and policymakers have expressed concern that the
examinations are only cognitive-based, and do not assess behavioral, emotional, social, or psychological aspects of development.

19. Comprehensive materials to prepare for the examination are available and accessible to all students. These include examples of the types of questions that
are on the examination and information on how to prepare for the examination. After taking the exam, students receive a report on the strengths and weaknesses
of their performance. The Questions Committee at the Examination Department has made 5,000 sample questions in each subject available to teachers and
officers in charge of the Questions and Examinations Committee. These questions are also distributed to schools and students. In addition, examinations from
previous years are published in official newspapers. Although these materials are available to prepare for the examination, the framework document explaining
what is measured on the examination is not available.

20. Up-to-date compulsory courses or workshops on the examination are available to teachers.

21. Teachers are involved in some examination-related tasks. For example, they are involved in selecting or creating examination questions, administering the
examination, and supervising examination procedures. However, they are not involved in selecting or creating examination-scoring guides, scoring the
examination, acting as a judge, or resolving inconsistencies between examination scores and school grades.

                                                                                                                                                                 28

22. A comprehensive, high-quality technical report on the examination is available to the general public.

23. Limited systematic mechanisms are in place to ensure the quality of the examination. While internal and external review or observers are in place, pilot or field
testing, translation verification, and external certification or audits are not.

24. Inappropriate behavior surrounding the examination process is high. For example, leakage of the content of an examination paper or part of a paper prior to
the examination; impersonation (when an individual other than the registered candidate takes the examination); copying among candidates; and the use of
unauthorized materials, such as prepared answers and notes, by test takers. Other inappropriate behavior include collusion among candidates via mobile phones
or the passing of paper notes; intimidation of examination supervisors, markers, or officials; the issuance of forged certificates or the alteration of results
information; and the provision of external assistance via the supervisor or mobile phone.

25. All stakeholder groups perceive the examination results as credible.

26. All students can take the End of Secondary Education Exam; there are no language, gender, or other equivalent barriers.

27. Most stakeholder groups use examination results in a proper way.

28. Student results are confidential. Only the student and persons with a legitimate, professional interest in the test taker can know the results.

29. A variety of options are available for students who do not perform well on the examination. Students may retake the examination, attend remedial or
preparatory courses to prepare to retake the examination, or repeat the grade. However, students cannot opt for less selective schools, universities, or tracks.

30. Some mechanisms are in place to monitor the consequences of the examination. These include a permanent oversight committee and expert review groups.
However, the system does not provide for funding for independent research on the impact of the examination; studies that are updated regularly, or regular focus
groups or surveys of key stakeholders.

International Large-Scale Assessment (ILSA): Development-level rating justifications

1. Libya has never participated in an international large-scale assessment. Some stakeholders in the country expressed an interest in participating in the Trends in
International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2015. However, the country has not taken any concrete steps to participate in this, or any other, ILSA in the
next five years. This set of facts provides us with sufficient information to determine the development level of ILSA in Libya, and the remainder of the ILSA rubric
is intentionally left blank as a result.

2. Libya has not taken concrete steps to participate in an ILSA in the next five years.

3. Libya has no policy document addressing participation in ILSA.

4. This option does not apply to this dimension.

       The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER)
       initiative produces comparative data and knowledge on education
       policies and institutions, with the aim of helping countries
       systematically strengthen their education systems.          SABER
       evaluates the quality of education policies against evidence-based
       global standards, using new diagnostic tools and detailed policy
       data. The SABER country reports give all parties with a stake in
       educational results—from administrators, teachers, and parents to
       policymakers and business people—an accessible, objective
       snapshot showing how well the policies of their country's education
       system are oriented toward ensuring that all children and youth
       learn.

       This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of student
       assessment.
