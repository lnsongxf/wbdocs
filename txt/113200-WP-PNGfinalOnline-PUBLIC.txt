    Justice for the Poor is a World Bank research and development program aimed at informing, designing and supporting
    pro-poor approaches to justice reform. It is an approach to justice reform which sees justice from the perspective of the
    poor and marginalized, is grounded in social and cultural contexts, recognizes the importance of demand in building
    equitable justice systems, and understands justice as a cross-sectoral issue.

    Justice for the Poor research reports are aimed at development practitioners, partner governments, researchers, and others
    interested in justice reform. Research reports are reviewed by at least two external referees who are independent of
    the program.

Executive Summary

Although Papua New Guinea’s (PNG) urban settlements and mixed neighborhoods have a reputation for endemic
violence, many local observers report some improvements in urban safety and security over recent years.
These are attributed to both political-economic factors, including economic growth, an improved employment
outlook, and the successful removal of former raskols, or criminal gangs, by business-oriented settlers, and
also to institutional factors, such as the failure of criminal gangs to become institutionalized and the ability of
local leadership to prevent the escalation of ethnic conflict and youth-related crime.

The first phase of research under Urban Safety in Port Moresby and Lae, Papua New Guinea (P152112) (NL-TA)
in 2015 was exploratory, intended to guide future engagement under the World Bank’s technical assistance
program rather than provide conclusive findings. It comprised over 200 individual and group interviews,
conversations, and observations during 2015 with people in Port Moresby’s ethnically and socially mixed settle-
ments and villages, including Tokarara, Sabama, and Vabukori (see map in section 2.1).

The research applied an “institutional capabilities” approach. Rather than focus on the stigma and govern-
ance deficit associated with settlement violence and the weakness of formal law and order, it set out to identify
how people create safety by recognizing what already works, day to day, across much of the city, concentrating
on two institutions: markets and mediation. This report focuses on mediation in mixed settlements, where
the majority of the population of PNG’s cities live. Three dimensions of institutional capability are considered:
i) efficiency (accessibility, affordability, timeliness, and sustainability), ii) power and authority, and iii) outcomes
and legitimacy. Although the results are preliminary, as this initial investigation focused on “what is there
and how it works,” the research reveals significant differences in outcomes for different groups that need
further clarification.


What is neighborhood mediation?

Neighborhood mediation is an established, locally recognized practice in which a community leader or
organization brings together different parties in an explicitly neighborhood venue to negotiate and agree on a
settlement acceptable to the people living there. This settlement would then be reinforced by these participating
actors, producing local “peace and good order.”

Consistent with convention, the report distinguishes between the functions and forms1 of mediation institutions.
Function refers to the purposes or kinds of disputes that mediation deals with, in other words, the problem the
institution aims to tackle. Neighborhood mediation addresses everyday conflicts: youth and ethnic fights, family
and marital disputes, and so forth. It is also moving into functionally new areas of dispute over land and property,
employment opportunities, and conflicts with public authorities and formal sector commercial actors.

Mediation may occur through a range of forms of organization, including local territorial committees (komitis)
and courts (cots) operating at various levels of scale, each of which might have a place-specific relationship
with the police or other agencies of the state. The report shows that neighborhood mediation is growing in
significance to urban residents, who regard it as an effective, legitimate way of handling problems related to
prosperity and security. The report also points to a number of challenges.

     How does neighborhood mediation work?

     Neighborhood mediation relies on the necessity of personal engagement and self-help in sorting out local,
     family, and communal issues. This means being ready to defend interests by enrolling and mobilizing the support
     of relatives and ethnic group members. Parties call on their recognized community leaders to assist in resolving
     a dispute rather than follow a process they are unsure of, such as going to the police.

     People approach mediation not just as individuals but as a member of a communal group. Each group brings
     beliefs about both justice in general and how it relates to the particular case. These beliefs and perspectives
     are explicitly recognized as reflecting the kastom (tradition or custom translated into modern contexts) or pasin
     (fashion) of the group that reaches back to the rural homeland of the original migrants, for example “pasin
     bilong Sepik,” or “the Sepik way.”

     When a relative or friend is involved in a dispute, considerable time and money will need to be invested
     by others. Local mediation events involving dozens or even hundreds of participants over several hours are
     common. Because of this heavy cost, there is also pressure to avoid disputes and to respond quickly in the event
     of a small but potentially escalating incident.

     Payments of fees embody respect for the authority of the mediators and support for the process. They are often
     handed over with a word of thanks to the mediator. Mediators set standard fees (30–100 kina [K30–100], or
     about US$8–40) for a mediation hearing to be paid either in advance or at settlement. Some mediators can ask
     high fees because of the scope of the authority they bring. Compensation can be considerable, especially where
     it reflects the expectations of Highlander groups.

     Neighborhood mediation combines the personal authority of a number of participants, including the two
     sides to the mediation, their families and kin, and the mediators themselves. At the same time, it invokes and
     appropriates a range of locally available forms of authority, many drawn from the state. All convene with the aim
     of reaching a consensus or agreement, and the broad and active participation of stakeholders lends authority
     and durability to outcomes.

     The mediators are typically urban communal leaders, now referred to as leadermen (or female leadermeris).
     Leadermen commonly have the basic respect of both their own ethnic and other local groups and are often
     appointed by the (urban/ethnic) communities themselves, having already played leading roles in organizations
     inside and outside the locality. They may be former sportspeople, church elders, community (or badged)
     policemen, ward councilors or komiti members, business people, or public servants. All of these associations
     can add to their authority, as can their personal skill and performative prowess, and to the authority of the
     mediation process itself.


     What organizational forms does neighborhood mediation take?

     Mediation processes and mechanisms are expressed through diverse forms of organization operating at
     significantly different levels of scale. Most prominent are local territorial komitis and courts, in particular the
     Village Courts, all of which are associated with the police in various ways. Although komitis can perform at a
     citywide scale, the largest number are found between the ward and its subunits, such as blok (ethnic compound)
     or street level. Although komitis perform well in representing ethnic differences, at the same time, they are
     less than inclusive in terms of representation across age, class, or gender differences. Nevertheless, komiti
     mediation is usually timely, accessible, affordable, and flexible and can happen on the next suitable occasion at
     any convenient place (for example, Sunday after church, under the large tree).

     Often, komiti members, or individuals who operate individually as komitis, will be approached to mediate cases.
     In this, they resemble Village Court magistrates, who often mediate as individuals. This type of mediator will
     typically ask members of other komitis or people with authority from outside the settlement to join him or her.



VI   “Come and See the System in Place”
The ability for dispute parties to approach individuals like this is crucial to mediation’s self- regulation. Parties
in many locations are not strongly bound to individuals or even exclusively to their own ethnic group leaders.
They can choose a mediator with a strong reputation, who charges reasonable fees and is available on a regular
basis as a local professional with some trappings of official or komiti recognition. That person can then bring in
or grasp local or outside authority, creating a team or panel of mediators needed to reach across differences of
ethnicity, territory, and class.

Village Courts and their magistrates have a significant role in mediation. The courts convene once a week to
deal with family and local disputes, that is, disputes arising in their territorial jurisdiction: adultery, violence,
swearing, unpaid loans, unruly competition in markets, and youth. Courts routinely combine mediation and
adjudication, often within the same case. Outside the weekly sittings, magistrates are often in high demand as
mediators by virtue of their respected standing and ability to access and grasp the formal order-writing authority
of a gazetted court.

Police collaborate and compete with local mediators, offering quick solutions and powerful coercive backup to
those who can afford these services. Many police live in settlements, and thus as members of the neighborhood
maintain social relations and obligations. Many cases are mediated on the front steps of the police station, often
quickly by lone ranger officers operating in neighborhoods regardless of the location of their residence or the
station to which they are posted.

Competition between different mediators can be seen as having a positive effect in that people are free to choose
the most accessible, affordable, and reliable mediator. But it also creates weakness. Police may lack incentives
to support local mediators and sometimes be motivated to undermine their decisions. Police involvement in
neighborhood mediation thus sometimes adds uncertainty and unpredictability.

       How does mediation deal with gender-based violence?

       The initial research on which this report draws was not designed to assemble the large portfolio of cases needed
       to assess mediation’s capability around gender-based violence (GBV). However, as GBV features in all forms of
       mediation institutions, the research was able to ask extensive questions about how GBV comes to mediation
       and to describe cases whose outcomes raise important questions.

       It is clear from cases, observations, and interviews that public neighborhood mediation can be a powerful
       weapon for unmasking GBV abuse and creating a public discourse on the problem (and also for occasioning
       public shame for the perpetrators). Dealing with GBV, mediation institutions compare reasonably well with
       the Village Court processes, though they lack the authority to issue court orders and there is no compulsory
       official female participation. Mediation is regarded as necessary in cases where families as well as individuals are
       affected and want to have a voice, as it allows time for families to deliberate on and agree to the settlement;
       without this, the issue will not be resolved.

       However, mediation in GBV cases also raises problems. Sexual violence cases, which legally should not be heard
       at the village level, are regularly transacted through mediation, despite the fact that mediation can and regularly
       does divert formal criminal justice proceedings, even where the victim desires them. This means that cases are
       heard in situations not primarily focused on the victim’s rights but also on the interests of families, the inherited
       frameworks of custom, and the need for conflict to be resolved in win-win ways. Initial research suggests that
       this can weaken the rights of the victim to seek criminal prosecution of, and court order protection from, the
       perpetrator and often subordinates these rights to the interests of wider family and kin. Although there are some
       women mediators, the vast majority are men, operating within male-dominated structures (and frequently, local
       relationships) that are not trusted by or accessible to women and whose processes are not always entirely public.

       Women in GBV contexts therefore need access to pathways beyond mediation. Two-track proceedings,
       involving both mediation and criminal proceedings led by police, are seen by many as desirable but in practice
       are complicated and hard to achieve. The effect of police involvement in GBV mediation is often to divert, or
       try to divert, a criminal investigation.

       Conclusions and recommendations

       The vision of the PNG government’s 2000 National Law and Justice Policy and Plan of Action for building
       the capability of restorative justice in PNG is being institutionalized within the practices of neighborhood
       mediation. The longer-term work of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), including the Peace Foundation
       Melanesia, also continues to bear fruit. Now is a good time for policy makers to revisit mediation—and especially
       neighborhood urban mediation—and see how it is functioning, how it may or may not be fulfilling the restorative
       justice vision, and importantly, whether the positive trajectory can be sustained.

       The following recommendations are highlighted:

       •	   Enable leadermen/meris, mediators, Village Court officials, and district-, ward-, and lower-level governments
            to consolidate and improve their mediation practices and develop mediation’s scope and reach at the
            local level. Help them to better define their different roles (mediation, adjudication, arbitration) and levels
            of authority. Find ways to bring their experiences and “best practices” into the national and regional
            development of mediation capability.

       •	   Ensure that oversight by national policy and regulatory bodies protects neighborhood mediation’s flexibility
            and inclusiveness. To help achieve this, create a research partnership and capability within relevant agencies,
            including the Constitutional and Law Reform Commission and the Department of Justice and Attorney
            General’s Restorative Justice Unit.




VIII   “Come and See the System in Place”
•	   Create more public awareness of good practices and outcomes from mediation, thereby reducing the
     stigma of mediation, and building recognition of its capabilities and what makes it work best.

•	   Address mediation’s risk and problem areas, including with respect to serious crime involving GBV. Initiate
     a policy learning process, critically addressing women’s involvement in GBV mediation, on komitis, and with
     police.

•	   Explore ways that police engagement in mediation can be addressed to provide more predictable outcomes
     and minimize the disruption of local mediation processes.

1.	 Introduction: the Story in Summary


   Box 1.1. A Neighborhood Mediation Case, Observed in Port Moresby, Early 2015

   The case this morning is of alleged adultery, a long-term affair, which came to a head two nights
   ago. The plaintiff and his wife stand opposite each other, across a fenced residential backyard, each
   surrounded by supporters, with the alleged male adulterer sitting at a third angle of the triangle, next
   to his own wife. There is a mix of ethnic groups and social classes: the wife is Papuan, holding down
   a formal sector job; the husband, currently jobless, is from the southern Highlands; her lover, also
   jobless but educated, is from the New Guinea islands. Nearly 100 people attend. The mediator, an
   ethnic leader from Morobe province, former sporting great, retail manager, and member of the ward’s
   law and justice committee, sits up front with his assistant, a local public servant. He stands and slowly
   rehearses the familiar rules of neighborhood mediation, gesturing over a table piled with case files
   and a Village Court rule book. He speaks in measured tones, weaving together authority, showing it
   through the raised platform and stack of files… but also pointing out its true source: “It is the group’s
   responsibility to come to an agreement; the mediator can only help.” If the groups fail to create the
   shared authority of a mediated agreement, the case will be referred up to the “full bench”: the local
   Village Court with its five mandated local magistrates. “All clear on that?” he asks, scanning for nods
   and bowed heads. “Alright.” Everyone present has been enrolled in the process, from the storytellers
   to those there to “witness” and add their weight to procedures. Papua New Guinea (PNG) law may
   not regulate what happens now, but a boundary has been crossed: we are now “in mediation.”

   Each side tells its story; anyone present is able to speak, for as long as it takes. Stories have been
   rehearsed; contrasting accounts emerge and are variously corroborated and countered. The wife had
   not been at the place where they agreed the husband would pick her up because she had been sent
   across town on work duties, as she had tried to explain on the phone to a husband often violent, now
   increasingly shrill. The wife later returned by an unusual route “because I was fearful of my husband’s
   rage” and his jealousy over her alleged lover, a jealousy that had lasted five years. She recounted the
   public screaming match and ugly beating he gave her when she finally arrived at the bus stop (within
   minutes of the lover). The lover said little but that he was sick of allegations and wanted the thing
   cleared up. His own wife sat, silent and embarrassed, beside him. The husband agreed with the lover—
   it was time for this public shame to end. Just a day and a half later, a summons had convened the sides
   for a process that for a small fee and the social costs of mobilizing witnesses, would assemble enough
   authority to avert more fighting between the partners or their families.

   The two sides address their histories and explanations to the mediator, but he again puts the issue
   and its questions back to the attendees. “They must be the ones to make this work.” With the lines
   between the stories clearly drawn, he asks them to break into discussion groups to weigh the evidence.
   Fifteen minutes later, he asks what the groups have decided. A witness comes forward on the
   husband’s side, saying she had seen the couple together elsewhere recently. A murmur goes through
   the crowd; a consensus, already emerging, has been underscored. The husband stands, close to tears,
   “The marriage is over,” he says. The wife concurs, saying she had wanted it so for a long time. There
   is a pause of calm, almost shock. The mediator advises the next steps: formal annulment and settlement
   negotiation to be conducted at the family court, a level higher than the Village Court, based on the
   mediation outcome. It appears for a moment as if things might end there. But there is animated

      discussion among the husband’s family, and a woman relative gets to her feet, angry. Lunging,
      swinging her fists, she berates the wife and her lover for the shame they have brought to his own wife
      and children but mostly to the husband, long driven to distraction by the affair. She demands
      compensation for him: “I am going to fight you. I want to kill you. Look what you have done to him.
      He loved her!” The speaker runs fists high toward the lover, is pulled back. The groups surge toward
      each other. The mediator shouts for calm; he stands and declares K500 (US$175) immediate
      compensation to be paid by the wife and the lover to the husband to cover the costs of the family
      court hearing.

      The mood changes immediately; the groups back off and confer. The husband’s relatives seek
      guidance from the mediator as to interim arrangements for residence, children, and household goods,
      and as to precisely what needs to be paid by when. The relative apologizes to the mediator for the
      disruption, and the lover goes to the husband and shakes his hand. The lover’s own wife sits, still,
      alone beside him. People start to leave, talking easily among themselves. Some small banknotes,
      totaling around K50, are volunteered from both sides, tucked into the exercise book the mediator
      uses to record the decision. The next event, the handover of a cash settlement for an assault from the
      Sunday before, quickly takes the stage.



    1.1 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MEDIATION
    TO URBAN SAFETY AND SECURITY
    This report examines the capabilities of mediation                             and security in PNG then is dealing with this basic

    cities live and work.2 In these mixed settlements,
    both the formal sector employed (referred to in PNG                            This challenge is formidable in urban PNG because
    as “working class”) and informal sector residents live                         of the ways conflict is embedded in social and other
    in multi-generational households clustered within                              differences that the state and other organizations
    ethnic compounds or sub-ward bloks. They are                                   struggle to regulate. Violence related to ethnic
    widely stigmatized as zones of illegality and refuges                          differences is often spectacular; PNG is highly
    of criminality.3 It is a matter of public record that                          diverse, and ethnic loyalties are catalyzed by minor
    minor disputes in these areas—whether between                                  property crime, perceived disrespectful behavior, or
    buai (betelnut) or street sellers around markets,                              alcohol-fueled disorder, frequently resulting in deaths
    groups within a school, parties to a traffic incident,                         and/or houses being burned. Gender differences,
    or drunken youths—can rapidly escalate into                                    often involving control of scarce household finances,

  Box 1.2. Crime and Violence Trends in Port Moresby Settlements: Views from Above and Below

  We can’t see any reason why things could be getting better. The police are still in serious crisis. Crime
  statistics are hopeless, and murder rates are high. Corruption is everywhere, and institutions are weak.
  The traditional and village authority breaks down in the urban context, into entrenched ethnic
  violence. The settlements are still growing: they are still no-go zones and hotbeds of crime and
  violence. If you think there’s any settlement that is getting better, what’s its name? What could possibly
  be improving things? Security researcher, Canberra

  Are things better here [in Sabama, a notorious, ethnically mixed settlement] than they were 10 years
  ago? Of course. Look around. Ask people. Do you see any raskol [criminal] gangs here? No, you see

   and tested in Lae under Urban Safety in Port Moresby and Lae, Papua New Guinea (P152112) (NL-TA).
10	 This distinction has become clichéd and is often difficult to sustain in practice. However, it can be a useful corrective to the predominant
    approach in development practice, namely the tendency to evaluate institutions in terms of the presence or absence of formal characteristics
    thought to define “the right institution.” A recent summary of the emerging convention is in Andrews, Pritchett, and Woolcock, “Doing
    Problem Driven Work.”
11	 See J. G. March and J. P. Olsen, “Elaborating the ‘New Institutionalism,’” in The Oxford Handbook of Political Institutions, ed. S. A. Binder,
    R. A. W. Rhodes, and B. Rockman (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), 3. “An institution is a relatively enduring collection of rules and
    organized practices, embedded in structures of meaning and resources that are relatively invariant in the face of turnover of individuals and
    relatively resilient to the idiosyncratic preferences.”

    relation to functions. See A. Apsan Frediani, “Sen’s Capability Approach as a Framework to the Practice of Development,” Development in

    17	Neighborhood mediation is in many respects a pulling together of public authority that is capable in the absence of the state and is
       bolstered by references, implicit and explicit, to the “idea of the state.” Neighborhood mediation institutions define their credibility by
       vindicating their non-state status and, on the other hand, by adopting the administrative regalia of the state (tables, summons forms, orders,
       stamps, etc.), indicating how the state should behave if it were present. Neighborhood mediation institutions are similar to what are defined
       elsewhere as “twilight” institutions. See C. Lund, “Twilight Institutions.”

     2.2.2 How it works:
     neighborhood mediation’s core mechanisms
     Self-help and agency
     in neighborhood law and justice
     Neighborhood mediation relies on a strong sense
     of the necessity of personal engagement and self-
     help in sorting out issues. This means being ready
     to defend your interests, not least by enrolling and
     mobilizing the support of relatives and ethnic group
     members. It means actively recruiting authority figures
     (community leaders, police) as well as garnering the
     symbols of authority from outside your settlement
     (such as a police occurrence book number, a medical
     certificate from the hospital); it also means moving
                                                                             Two youths reconcile after a compensation payment, agreed the

     The basis for these actions has been established                      protecting their loyalty to those they live with locally
     by ongoing investment on everyone’s part in local                     and to the overall processes of mediation that make

        People coming to the city tend to congregate in their ethnic groups. In the settlements, they live to-

        speak on your behalf, someone you and others can go to. You need that person, they are essential.

        The community appoints the leaders, and they become the komiti, or the go-to people when there is
        trouble. They are not fools, they appoint the ones who have got the wisdom, these are the kinds of
        people they look at and appoint. There are some registered mediators, I mean registered VC [Village
        Court] officials, there are others who live in the particular communities, and are selected and ap-
        pointed by them. If they are selected by the community, that’s alright, we know they are traditionally
        recognized. But only the VC officials can write formal settlement orders. Should the mediators all be
        registered? Well, they have to be recognized, that’s most important. And if anything goes wrong…
        well, perhaps they should be registered for the sake of peace. Village Court official

        tell me who are the leaders in that part of the city I need to deal with. It’s not one system; issues can

      30	The metaphor of “grasping authority” is a convenient but also slightly limiting way of conveying what is implied. As will be explained, it
         involves (i) collecting and assembling authorities (the classic image of grasping) but also (ii) combining them in potentially new ways, (iii)
         resulting in the emergence of new forms of authority. The emergence of ol lidaman, a resolutely urban and reportedly recent institutional
         role, may be one instance of the latter point.

The grasping of authority in PNG neighborhood                                apart from state forms of public authority—in
mediation therefore has at least three dimensions.                           other words, autonomous and communal but

         in both homogenous and heterogeneous settlements, including June Valley and Kaugere, next door to Sabama. See N. Oram, Colonial
         Town to Melanesian City, Port Moresby 1884-1974 (Canberra: ANU-E Press, 1976). Goddard’s (2009) history of Village Courts captures much
         of the pre-independence conservative judicial concern about the kind of justice these komitis and cots were delivering. See M. Goddard,
         Substantial Justice: An Anthropology of Village Courts in Papua New Guinea (New York: Berghahn Books, 2009). After some official and
         judicial reticence, Village Courts have been recognized and councilors have become ward-level actors, with various komitis forming at
         subward levels. June Valley is reputed to have an especially dense formation of komitis. Local explanations of this relate to the agency of
         the Village Court chair in supporting komiti formation right down to very local levels and in providing support during the tenure of Moresby
         South MP Dame Carol Kidu as Minister of Community Development, during which time CDCs sponsored many subcommittees, including
         law and justice.

     38	 This research did not track the trajectories (or what are commonly called patterns of resort) of the victims/survivors of GBV, but rather focused
         on how GBV cases that came before neighborhood mediation organizations were dealt with. The ongoing research in Lae is more explicitly
         concerned with trajectories, including in relation to courts, police, and special purpose bodies such as the female sexual violence units.
     39	 Bridging ethnic difference is in fact another area where mediation is encountering challenges. Although mediation is enabling new urban
         identities to be negotiated from ethnic differences, within this it is important to observe that Highlanders engage enthusiastically, whereas Port
         Moresby’s indigenous Motu Koitabans (and other Coastal peoples) frequently feel disadvantaged and vulnerable in mediation and related
         compensation, and that Highlanders use and prefer mediation because of the scale of settlements it enables them to achieve.

    Village Court magistrates’ bench, they are still the preferred venue for women; most complaints are brought by women, and Village Courts

Box 3.3. Does Mediation Produce Good Out-
comes for Women?

In terms of outcomes for women, I think they
are better in mediation [than in court]. A
woman can have plenty of witnesses and
supporters there with her, speaking. Her
family can all be there and know they will get
a say. Family is the main person who stands
by the victim; they can come out and speak,
and they have seen it all. They can tell you,
“Ever since they were married he’s been
bashing her—let the mediators consider
that!” They can demand that the mediators
consider a wider range of opinions; anyone
there can do that. Police mediator (male)

In mediation you get the woman’s people
involved and the husband’s people involved.
They need to be involved; bride price has
been paid, so there’s pigs and compensation
going to be involved. It’s an agreement and
therefore it has to be settled in mediation.
There’s no written law in there, it’s an
understanding; where there is an agreement
it has to be mediated. It’s better for the
woman in the event she is attacked in the
hearing; she has supports from her own
people, she will talk more freely. From the
others, honesty and truth will be there at the          A mediation convenes at short notice in a public market, presided

        A returning husband violently assaults his wife:
        The husband left his wife two years ago, and went off with another. Then he decides to come back to
        the wife. But he asks her in the night, “While I was gone, did you go with another man?” She tells him,
        “After a time, OK, there was this one man who was very persistent…” When I saw the situation, she
        has been very badly cut up, all up her arms, and worse. Even mutilation of the private parts…. The
        husband’s relatives come and see me, saying “We need to do something, or this is going to be a
        murder case. Husband and wife come from the same Highlands village—there’ll be a tribal fight over
        this, there’s bride price involved.” I say, “Take this guy in to the police now and have him charged!”
        [But no prosecution eventuated; fears over communal violence resulting in the Highlands meant it
        remained within mediation.] We need guidelines for mediators in such cases; the family wanted
        mediation, but this needs to go through the court too. Mediation and law have to come together; for
        the rest of the relatives, for continuity of life, mediation must take place. But it hasn’t happened in this

  Box 3.5. Medecins Sans Frontieres’ Assessment of Risks of Hybrid Justice and GBV in PNG

  Inadequate or inappropriate responses from the country’s hybrid system of formal and traditional
  justice, and the dysfunction of the protection system, are putting survivors’ lives and health at risk.
  Patients’ experiences expose a culture of impunity, and a continuing reliance on traditional forms of
  justice to solve serious family and sexual violence cases. The widespread tradition of ‘compensation’,
  whereby either money or pigs are paid to victims’ families for crimes committed, means that
  perpetrators often remain within their communities, exposing survivors to the threat of repeated
  violence.

  Box 3.6. GBV and Mediation: Mediators and Other Village Court Officials Speak

  I am certainly noticing that the issue of [increased awareness of] family and sexual violence is making
  an impact, a very positive one. But it’s not yet always spilling over into the things getting reported on
  at the police station, or in the formal court system. Generally speaking, for abuse of women, children,
  cases do come more frequently before mediation than the courts. The law does have an impact. We
  remind people about the law. Each time before we go to mediation we say “Be warned: the law now
  is much more powerful for women and children. Any assault, however minor, will be taken seriously.
  You’ve got the Child Welfare Act now, taking care of these ones.” Sabama mediator (male)
  Most of the vendors here have been bashed, most of the market women are on their second, third
  marriage, because of that. If there’s a family matter, and a woman in the market, beaten up by her
  husband, I ask them what is happening. We have a referral pathway to the police station. We can
  bring them in there. If the husband comes back in the market situation, if he’s very violent, I’ll get the
  police involved, and he will be charged. If it can be mediated, I will. I don’t take them to the VC, I leave
  the [market] clerk on duty, I bring them here [to the market office/ former VC site] and we talk. If I see
  it’s just jealousy, I tell them to sort it out, and to go buy something, coke, Fanta, for reconciliation.

  4.1 MEDIATION AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE


    Box 4.1. Mediation and Restorative Justice: since 2000

    Papua New Guinea has a distinct advantage in restorative stakes... Our nation’s many traditions and
    customs provide a rich foundation for the development of a homegrown system of justice best able
    to meet the changing needs of the people… The idea of finding out what a particular community’s
    security needs are… extends far beyond community policing. It entails learning from the traditional
    view that sees crime more as an injury to the [victim], rather than as an injury to the government or the
    state. A restorative justice approach sees criminal justice as involving the victim, the offender, and the
    entire community in its processes, [and] as an opportunity to repair the damage caused by the conflict.

40   “Come and See the System in Place”
Mediation Capabilities in Papua New Guinea’s Urban Settlements   41
42   “Come and See the System in Place”
Annex 1: Research Methods

This exploratory and formative piece of research used primary ethnographic and qualitative methods to examine
neighborhood mediation practices: observation, participation, case studies, and group and individual interviews.
It developed and validated initial findings through triangulation and qualitative sampling strategies, including
snowball sampling and sampling for difference and redundancy. At the same time, it applied theoretical and
analytic approaches (drawn largely from international/comparative political science, urban political economy,
and historical institutional analysis) to predict and explore patterns of institutional development and capability.

These investigations enabled a wealth of empirical materials to be assembled. Only the most illustrative of
these, however, could be used in the body of the report itself. Initial conclusions drawn in the report, though
preliminary, reflect the balance of the full range of materials and perspectives assembled.

•	   Given the complete absence of studies in this area within Papua New Guinea (PNG), mainly due to access
     and safety issues but also stigma, as well as the access and safety issues for this study itself, it was crucial that
     formative work, framing analyses, and empirical exploration be conducted flexibly. Researchers needed to
     be able to secure access and at the same time respond to new, presenting perspectives where these came
     to light. They needed to make clear that they were not looking in the first instance to criticize or stigmatize
     local mediation processes, nor to enable others to discipline them from formal law and justice positions.

•	   Research began with an extended series of conversations with local people in public spaces (markets,
     churches, shops, bus stops) and private homes and moved from these contexts to a series of more structured
     individual and group interviews and the development of case studies in public sites, homes, workplaces,
     and businesses. It continued with observations at mediation events, at which extended interviews were
     conducted/carried out with the main actors and a number of other participants.

•	   Relevant PNG and international literature was consulted, and the researchers’ considerable experience of
     community-level organization in relation to law and justice drawn on. But descriptive and analytic framings
     were also approached flexibly and developed through well-known exploratory and formative investigative
     techniques.

•	   These techniques included both triangulation and snowball-, difference-, and redundancy-based sampling,
     as well as ongoing dialogue and iterative analysis. Snowball sampling, where a member of one group
     with whom rapport and a level of communication and trust have been established is asked to introduce
     researchers to others who might inform the research, has the advantage for researchers entering the field
     for the first time of being able to draw on the trust established with one group or interviewee in order to
     engage others. It works particularly well in intense social contexts such as PNG markets and settlements,
     providing researchers with the basic safety of being known and under the care of known local actors.
     Short of entering under full armed official escort (which would impose constraints of its own on research
     reliability), there is simply no alternative to this kind of relational approach during entry and to some extent
     ongoing research in and around settlements.

•	   For obvious reasons, snowball sampling needs to be complemented by other sampling techniques,
     including, in this case: i) applying triangulation (a technique that validates data by deliberately seeking
     different perspectives from multiple sources to cross verify, with the differences based on accepted social
     science parameters), ii) using multiple points of entry and research team mixes50 (not becoming dependent


50	 At various points in the process, the core research team included two expatriate social scientists, a PhD-trained woman anthropologist who
    is highly experienced in Port Moresby settlements, two elder researchers, a resident in the settlements, and a youth researcher drawn from
    a local nongovernmental organization (NGO).

          on or captured by one person, group, or site), iii) sampling for difference (ensuring that the qualitative
          sample includes the full range of points of view), and iv) sampling to redundancy (pursuing these techniques
          until little or no new material and perspectives come to light). In urban PNG’s mixed settlements, differences
          that matter include, at a minimum, ethnicity, gender, class, age, and duration of residence, and this research
          actively sampled for these differences at every point. To some extent, as below, sampling and questions
          were based on analytic framings found to be significant elsewhere.

     •	   Common issues in this kind of research include the predominance of perspectives from (older, male, educated,
          dominant ethnic) leaders themselves and the difficulties in accessing those most vulnerable or peripheral
          to power. This research indeed focused on understanding in the first instance the institutional mechanisms
          themselves and focused its attention on those intimately involved in mediation: mediators, komiti members,
          local leaders, and Village Court officials, as well as those participating as parties to mediation events.
          Around these parameters, which certainly favored older males, initial triangulation and sampling for ethnic,
          gender, age, and class difference as described above occurred, with interviews and focus groups at and
          around each site deliberately involving only women, youth, or ethnic minorities. As there was more limited
          participation in this initial research from those not immediately involved in (but often powerfully affected by)
          mediation processes, the need for further research, especially involving those vulnerable and peripheral to
          mediation processes, is strongly stressed.

     •	   Single interviews with strangers in these kinds of contexts produce results with very low reliability. Within
          both neighborhoods and the research team, this research was informed by ongoing iterative practices of
          reflecting together on emerging findings (in groups, individually, in review of writing and conversation).
          Clarifications were often sought and different perspectives explored, and time for reflection enabled all
          sides to sharpen their sense of what was happening and what needed further, wider investigation. Following
          these protocols respectfully within local settlement contexts meant that interviews needed to be flexible in
          terms of attendees, since family members would want to be in the conversation and some would want to
          dominate. Multiple and iterative conversations involving different individuals and groups, and careful use of
          group and researcher splitting to enable different kinds of voices to emerge, were used throughout.

     •	   Altogether, more than 200 separate individual and group interviews of this kind were performed across
          the two sites, with smaller numbers (n=40) at Vabukori. Twenty-three case studies of varying detail were
          compiled. Conversations occurred in the familiar mix of Tok Pisin and English within which much of this “local
          public” business is pursued. Translation was available on both sides. Overall, researchers were pleasantly
          surprised and impressed by both the eagerness of locals to talk and the ways their discourse reflected
          obvious local development of critical perspectives and widely shared understanding of what is happening
          in neighborhood mediation processes. Variously or even randomly encountered people at very diverse sites
          would use highly similar language to describe what local leaders are doing in mediation.


     Theoretical and analytic perspectives

     •	   Researchers inevitably bring to new sites a sense of what has been important elsewhere, and this shapes
          methods and practices. The researchers involved in this study had longstanding interests in a range of
          relevant fields: political economy, institutions and state formation, urban studies, local law and justice,
          and social and ethnographic analysis. Perspectives on political economy, state formation, and local-based
          imitation of the state are strongest in African contexts, urban violence in (Latin) American. Although there is
          a vast ethnography of tribal and rural PNG, material focused on urban life is much sparser (though typically
          of high quality) and not heavily informed by analytic perspectives on either urban political economy or
          institutional formation.




44   “Come and See the System in Place”
•	   Michael Mann’s influential framing of infrastructural power51 was important to this study. Although this
     framing has been largely applied to macro-level political analysis of the ability of state and state-related
     public authorities to grasp power and resources centrally and extend them to the edges of territorial
     authority, the authors felt this same analysis had explanatory value when applied to more micro-territorial
     contexts (settlements, markets) and to the infrastructural power of institutions that functioned at and beyond
     the edges of effective state rule. This study’s use of grasp and reach represents some theoretical/analytic
     innovation, the success of which readers can judge for themselves. It introduces an element of power
     and authority and thus insists on questions of legitimacy (something uncommon in much New Institutional
     analysis). Its operationalization in terms of measurement remains limited, but it (uniquely) demands that
     questions of power and capability against functions, rules, roles, and resources be described, explained, and
     assessed. The processes as well as the “grasp” and “reach” of crucial aspects of institutional capability—
     such as regulatory power, authority, and legitimacy and the ability to enroll actors and sustain resourcing—
     are all central to the analysis.
