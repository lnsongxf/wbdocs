         Key Water and Sanitation Sector Challenges
         XXFinancing       compliance with European Environmental Acquis. Croatia committed to comply with
              the European water-related directives by 2023. Total investment needed is estimated at close to
              € 3.75 billion.
         XXEnsuring    the affordability of future tariffs. Construction and operation of the new infrastructure
              to comply with Environmental Acquis will require substantial tariff increases, which might become
              unaffordable for lower-income part of population.
         XXImplementing      successfully the Aggregation Reform. The Government has decided to merge
              the municipal utility companies into 20 regional utilities (Uredba o granicama uslužnh područja
              NN67/14). Focus on actual efficiency gains and better services will be crucial for success.
         XXStrengthening     the regulation in the water sector. The Water Services Council is the economic
              regulator exclusively for water and sanitation services. Despite the well-developed legal and
              regulatory framework, the Council is still in the process of fully deploying its regulatory reach.

Economy. Croatia, which joined the EU on July 1, 2013, is a middle-income country with limited inequalities
and poverty issues. Croatia has 4.25 million inhabitants, according to World Bank Development Indicators 2015.
Fifty-eight percent of the population lives in urban settings, and the country is relatively densely populated at 75.6
inhabitants/km2. At US$20,904 GDP per capita, Croatia is considered a high-income country; the overall economic
situation is, however, challenging, with unemployment around 18% and GDP declining over the last 5 years (World
Bank 2015). With a Gini coefficient around 34, and an insignificant proportion of population living in extreme poverty,
Croatia’s socioeconomic inequalities are fewer than many countries in the region. The percentage of vulnerable
minorities (largely Roma) is low, at 0.4% (DZS 2011).

Governance. Croatia, a parliamentary republic with strong local governments, has 21 counties, including the City
of Zagreb, and 556 towns and municipalities (DZS 2012). Counties perform activities of regional significance not
assigned to bodies of state administration by the constitution and legislation. Towns and municipalities in Croatia
represent the lowest level of self-government and perform activities of local significance, including the provision of
public services such as water and sanitation (DZS 2012).

Water resources. Croatia is a water-rich country split between two river basin districts, the Danube basin and the
Adriatic basin. With around 24,495 m3 of renewable water per capita per year, Croatia is a water-rich country (FAO
Aquastat 2015); surface water quality is, however, a concern, particularly with respect to nutrient pollution in the
Danube basin. The entire Danube basin, and limited parts of the Adriatic basin, are classified as “sensitive areas” in
the context of the EU Water Framework Directive (EC 2000). In addition, rainfall is highly seasonal, and in the summer
some watercourses, especially on the Adriatic side, have significantly decreased runoffs. Heavy seasonal rainfalls
can also produce severe flooding, mainly in the southern part of Slavonia. They cause power outages, landslides,
and damage to the infrastructure, affecting water and wastewater services and resulting in possible drinking water
shortages. Only a small portion of all available resources is actually used, and although climate change is expected
to have a negative effect on both water availability and water demand, no specific strategies have been implemented
(MZOIP 2003, 2013).

Water supply sources. Water supply comes mainly from groundwater (96%). Surface water provides 4% of overall
drinking water supply. Most rivers flow into the Danube or one of its tributaries. The Danube River (coming from

Hungary) and the Drava and the Sava Rivers (coming from Slovenia), which are the major tributaries to the Danube,
flow through Croatia. The reduction of industrial activity and the decline in the use of fertilizers and pesticides in
agriculture have considerably eased the pollution in surface water sources. However, the quality of rivers in the
Pannonian watershed is normally lower than desired due to bacterial pollution, with the worst situation encountered in
the Sava River. Groundwater resources are abundant and represent about 96% of total drinking water supply (ICPDR
2015). Despite water abundance, there are quantity problems at key localities such as the Adriatic islands, which have
poor water resources. The quality of groundwater is generally considered good throughout the country. The reports
on the state of the sea and its water quality indicate that a considerable part of the Croatian portion of the Adriatic
Sea is oligotrophic and clean, but the ports of big cities and the industrial zones along the coast are at some locations
polluted by organic and inorganic substances.

Policy-making and sector institutions. The sector is controlled at the national level. As shown in Figure 2, local service
providers are regulated and controlled by a constellation of national-level actors, the most important of which are:

XXThe   National Water Council, which is a group of 10 members representing sector professionals and policy makers
   and tasked with proposing water policies. National Water Council members are appointed by the Croatian
   Parliament for four years (WB&DE 2012).
XX The Ministry of Agriculture, which is responsible for water policies including those related to water services (WB&DE 2012).

  (WB&DE 2012).
XXThe Water Services Council, which was established by the 2010 Water Act and which is responsible for economic

  and service quality regulation. Members of the council are nominated by the government and appointed by
  the Parliament to a five-year term. The 9 members of the council are experts on water supply and wastewater
  sewerage, water management, the economy, public finance, or other fields (WB&DE 2012).
XXThe National Institute of Public Health, which monitors the quality of drinking water (WB&DE 2012).

Capacity and training. Large utilities are key players in staff capacity building. They tend to attract qualified and
competent employees with high levels of education. They play a key role in developing staff training and can be
considered a driving force for staff capacity enhancement. However, since the water services management staff is
appointed by municipal representatives, it is often replaced according to political cycles. Hence, management staff
turnover is high, whereas technical staff turnover remains low. To a lesser extent, the national Croatian Water &
Wastewater Association, created in 1972, provides training, technical assistance, and knowledge exchange activities
(workshops, conferences, journal) to water sector stakeholders.

Economic regulation. Economic regulation is mandated by law, but is still incipient. The 2010 Water Act mandated
creation of the Water Services Council, an agency that also serves as the economic regulator exclusively for water
and sanitation services (Croatian Parliament 2009; 2011; 2013). The council does not formally license operators, but
it reviews and approves any tariff revision before it can be consented to by local governments. Economic regulation
is based on the cost recovery principle and a price-cap approach, with a requirement that tariff structures consider
subsidy schemes in case an expected water bill is over 2.5% of average household income. The council also monitors
service quality and performance through the collection of a series of performance indicators. Despite the well-
developed legal and regulatory framework, the council is still in the process of fully deploying its regulatory reach; it
has developed instruments for that purpose, including specific by-laws on performance standards, but those have
not yet been widely applied. As a result, regulation still needs to be strengthened in terms of human and financial
resources, and also by the introduction of a benchmarking platform, currently under development with the assistance
of the World Bank.

Ongoing or planned reforms. The 2010 Water Act has initiated a significant sector consolidation and
modernization process, which is ongoing. In Croatia, service provision was traditionally a local issue, and the
sector was largely atomized. The 2010 Water Act (and a separate Water Financing Act) was passed as part of
the country’s harmonization with the European Water Framework Directive and daughter directives, but it also
created a legal basis for a significant aggregation process, which should culminate in the more than 150 local
utility companies being aggregated into around 20 regional providers, generally along county borders. Water

services areas have been established within which the government will recognize only one service provider
(Croatian Parliament 2009; 2013). The change is expected to allow more effective European Funds absorption,
create cross-subsidies between smaller and larger cities, and further professionalize service providers.
The process of merging and aggregating existing providers requires local government consent though, and
implementation should start in 2015, with completion by 2016, according to the Government of Croatia. But
with the national elections and change of government by the end of 2015, the timeline of implementation sector
reform is becoming increasingly uncertain.

Equity of access to services. Access to water and sanitation by the Roma population needs to be improved.
The access rate to water and sanitation facilities for the bottom 40% of the population is high, at 98% and 93%,
respectively, and 95% of the poorest share of the population (living on less than $2.50 a day) has access to piped
water supply and 90% has access to flush toilets (World Bank 2015). However, according to a UNDP 2011 survey,
35% of the Roma population does not have access to an improved source of water, and 45% does not have access to
improved sanitation (UNDP Bratislava 2012).

Service infrastructure. Croatian wastewater infrastructure needs upgrading. The water network, which is 4 times
as long as the wastewater network, is aging—most of it was installed more than 50 years ago—and its performance
could be improved, since the leakage rate is as much as 40%. Among the 141 wastewater treatment facilities, 46%
are equipped with preliminary and primary treatments, 51% with secondary treatment, and only 3% with tertiary
treatment. The expected deadline for full implementation of articles 3 through 7 of the Urban Wastewater Treatment
Directive is December 31, 2023.

Quality of service. Service quality in Croatia is generally very good by regional standards. Water service is
continuous, and drinking water quality is mostly in compliance with national and European standards. Although
effluent treatment quality is not yet measured in a consolidated manner, most of the wastewater treatment plants are
relatively new and can be expected to operate as designed.

Customer satisfaction. The satisfaction of the population with the service provided in their city (per the
international Gallup Poll) is correspondingly high, at 82%. This number is significantly higher than in most
countries in the region.

Overall efficiency. The efficiency of public water and sanitation service providers is a remaining issue in Croatia.
At 44%, nonrevenue water is much higher than best practices in Western Europe, and driven as much by technical
as by apparent losses. Commercial practices are largely sound with universal metering, despite a billing collection
ratio of around 90%, on average. With an average of 3 staff per 1,000 connections, the sector is less productive than
international best practices of 1 and 2, but more productive than the region overall.

Recent trends. No significant progress has been made on the efficiency agenda over the last 10 years. Most of the
indicators mentioned above show no significant improvements, except in the field of collection rate, which appears to
have steadily increased, as shown on Figure 4, at least for the limited subset of 10 utilities for which year-by-year data
are available.

Investment needs. Current investment levels are lower than needed to achieve compliance with the EU
acquis; they cover only around one-third of the levels necessary to achieve the country’s commitments in terms
of meeting the European environmental acquis. EU Cohesion Funds will partly cover the difference, since they
usually fund 70% of EU-financed capital expenditures. But tariffs are expected to continue rising in the future
to help cover the difference. An estimated €0.85 billion investments are needed to achieve compliance by 2023
with the Drinking Water Directive and another €2.9 billion investments are needed to comply with the Urban
Wastewater Treatment Directive.

Investments. Investment levels in the sector are high compared to the region. Around €33 per capita are
invested every year. Those investments are financed predominantly from national sources, in addition to which
tariffs play a significant role. The largest share (70%) of this investment goes toward wastewater management
(sewer extension and wastewater treatment plant construction), which is consistent with the country’s ambitious
EU harmonization goals. Investment levels and source and use of funds have not varied dramatically in recent
years (Figure 7).

Cost recovery. Seventy percent of services providers in Croatia recover their operational costs from tariffs, and
there is no national operational subsidy scheme in place (except for specific cases, such as small islands without
local water supply). As shown on Figure 8, however, significant cross-subsidies between residential and industry
tariffs exist, with industrial tariffs up to 50% above residential tariffs.

Water Sector Sustainability
and Main Challenges
To evaluate and reflect the sustainability of services in the region, an overall sector sustainability assessment was done
taking into account four main dimensions: access to services, quality of services, efficiency of services, and financing
of services. Each of these dimensions is measured through three simple and objective indicators. For each indicator,
best practice values are established by looking at the best performers in the region, and the countries closest to those
best performers are deemed to have a more mature sector. A more complete description of the methodology to assess
sector sustainability is included in the Annex of the State of the Sector Regional Report from the Danube Water Program.
The outcomes of this assessment for the Croatia water sector are displayed in Figure 9, which also shows average and
best practices in the Danube region. The Croatian sector sustainability score is 72, which is above the Danube average
sustainability of 64. The assessment shows that on average, the country performs well in terms of access to piped water
and flush toilets, continuity of service, nonrevenue water and customer satisfaction. The main deficiencies of the Croatia
water sector identified through the sector sustainability assessment are the wastewater treatment coverage and the
operating cost ratio (Figure 9).

XXFinancing    compliance with the European Environmental Acquis. As part of its Accession Treaty, Croatia
  committed to comply with the European water-related directives gradually comply with until 2023. The total cost
  of this effort is estimated at around € 3.75 billion, requiring almost triple the current levels of investments. In
  addition to financing challenges (which EU funds might partly alleviate), the implementation capacity of the water
  utilities, themselves in the midst of an aggregation process, is a limiting factor and it is expected that meeting the
  commitments of the country will be challenging.

XXEnsuring   affordability of future tariffs. As shown in this note, the current tariff levels in Croatia are already close
  to reaching affordability concerns, especially for lower-income households or in more impoverished parts of the
  country. The construction and operation of the new infrastructure to comply with the environmental acquis, as well
  as application of cost recovery principle will require substantial tariff increases, which might become unaffordable
  for the lower-income segment of population. These concerns have been taken into account in the Multi-year
  Program of Construction of Municipal Water Works (Voda 2014). Appropriate mitigating mechanisms will be
  needed, in parallel with a renewed effort by the regulator to drive the operators’ performance toward ever more
  efficient levels.

XXImplementing   successfully the Aggregation Reform. The government has decided to promote a regionalization
  process for the current municipal utility companies to aggregate providers into around 20 regional utilities

  (Uredba o granicama uslužnh područja NN67/14). The main drivers of this effort are the need to absorb EU funds
  more effectively, and to cross-subsidize the operation of water, and particularly wastewater, systems in smaller
  settlements, which might find compliance with the new EU standards expensive. The process is an important
  opportunity for the sector to develop modern, efficient service providers, but this will require particular attention
  from the Water Services Council (through its regulatory reach) and the line institutions promoting the reform.

XXStrengthening   regulation in the water sector. The Water Services Council is the economic regulator exclusively for
  water and sanitation services. Despite the well-developed legal and regulatory framework, the Council is still in the
  process of fully deploying its regulatory reach. It has developed instruments for that purpose, including specific by-
  laws on performance standards, but those have not yet been widely applied. As a result, regulation still needs to be
  strengthened in terms of human and financial resources, and also by the introduction of a benchmarking platform,
  currently under development with the assistance of the World Bank.
