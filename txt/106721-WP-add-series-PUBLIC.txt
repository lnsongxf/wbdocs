   Box 1: Pioneering New Data Collection Technologies during the Liberian Waterpoint
   Infrastructure Survey

   During the 2010-11 Waterpoint Infrastructure Survey in Liberia, WSP was one of the first agencies worldwide to
   successfully use smartphone based mobile-to-web data collection applications at national scale. WSP has since
   advised on one particular application (FLOW), and has used this and similar applications (Fulcrum, DoForms) at
   scale both in Liberia and subsequently in Sierra Leone, the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of
   Congo (DRC). These applications have helped provide proof-of-concept for a new best-practice in large-scale
   survey data collection.

   Relying on smartphones equipped with touchscreen, camera and GPS, which have become available for less
   than US$100 in the past five years, this new best practice in field surveying offers at least four advantages over
   traditional pen and paper methods: time and financial savings, greater ease of use, improved data safety and
   accuracy, and better management control.

   Financial savings can be substantial. The primary source of financial savings from mobile-to-web surveying is the
   reduction in surveying time and the abolishment of manual transcription of data from paper forms to computers.
   In the Liberia and Sierra Leone projects, it is estimated that eliminating post-survey transcription alone saved up
   to 5.7 percent of project costs and over 600 workdays, more than offsetting hard- and software costs.     

   Cost-savings are closely related to data safety: loss or spoilage of questionnaires can cause enormous re-
   surveying costs. Mobile-to-web data collection apps minimize this risk by allowing regular back-up to an online
   dashboard. This is a major advantage not only over pen and paper, but previous “PDA” devices without network
   connection. Regular data uploads from the field can also be a critical advantage if rapid availability of data is
   required in emergencies such as the recent Ebola epidemic. A further benefit of uploading data regularly is that it
   enables near-real-time tracking of the performance of surveyors by survey management.

   Data accuracy can also increase by using mobile-to-web surveying, not just due to the elimination of transcription
   errors, but due to the automatic recording of GPS coordinates, the ability to photograph or scan certain complex
   items instead of capturing them by typing (or example. bill numbers during the customer enumeration), and
   because mandatory fields can prevent accidental incomplete questionnaire submissions.

   As WSP’s work in Liberia has shown, such off-the-shelf apps are viable, indeed, highly advantageous even in
   the complex environment of fragile states. The many advantages of smartphone-based surveying apps – from
   significant cost savings, to more accurate data, greater ease of use, better data safety and more accurate, real-
   time project monitoring – constitute a real step forward in survey administration.

   Box 3: Joint Sector Reviews: a mechanism to promote sector learning and transition to
   country-led development

   Joint Sector Reviews (JSRs) are an established mechanism for prioritization of sector action in many developing
   countries and across a number of sectors including health, education, agriculture, energy and water. They are
   generally designed to jointly review (donors, government and civil society) the implementation of sector plans or
   to assess sector performance and to agree on actions to address constraints in implementation or to improve
   performance on a half-yearly, annual or biennial basis.

   JSRs were established in the early 1990s as part of implementing sector-wide approaches (SWAp) a term used
   in development circles but closely linked to Program-Based Approaches (PBAs), part of an OECD-wide move
   towards monitoring sector outcomes rather than inputs or outputs. Though the JSR has its origins as a review
   mechanism within the SWAp, today they are carried out in contexts without a formal SWAp.

   Though little research has been done on the impact of JSRs in the WASH sector, JSRs have been in use in the
   health and education sectors for over 20 years and were experience1points valuable for alignment of partners
   with the sector policy, strategic plan and budget. They are important fora for sharing information, discussing
   strategies, policy dialogue with a wider audience and with a comprehensive view on the sector as a whole. JSRs
   have a potential to improve plans, mobilize additional resources and promote mutual accountability.

   Persistent challenges reported in the health and education sectors include:
    •	 The timely availability of good quality data as well as national capacity to perform strategic analysis.
    •	 How to ensure that relevant JSR recommendations are integrated in decentralized plans.
    •	 How to balance between a drive for more participation and good technical and policy discussions.
    •	 How to ensure meaningful participation and further develop mutual accountability in the context of a growing
        tendency among donors to ask for a direct attribution of results.
    •	 How best to integrate meaningful aid and development effectiveness criteria in monitoring performance.
    •	 How to get tackle institutional and systemic issues.
