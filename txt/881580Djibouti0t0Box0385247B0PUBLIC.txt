I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:

       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Djibouti
        perceive the Bank;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Djibouti regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Djibouti;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Djibouti;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank ’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in Djibouti; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Djibouti.

       Use data to help inform the Djibouti country team’s strategy.



II. Methodology
In June-July 2012, 220 stakeholders of the World Bank in Djibouti were invited to provide their
opinions on the World Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President and the office of
the Prime Minister; the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a
ministry, ministerial department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on
World Bank-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs; community-based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the
judiciary branch. A total of 118 stakeholders participated in the country survey (54%).

Respondents received questionnaires via post or courier and returned them accordingly, or
completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency. Respondents were asked
about: general issues facing Djibouti; their overall attitudes toward the World Bank; the World
Bank’s effectiveness and results; the World Bank’s knowledge; working with the World Bank;
the World Bank’s future role in Djibouti; and the World Bank’s communication and information
sharing in Djibouti.

Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are identified
throughout the survey report.

II. Methodology (continued)
A. General Issues facing Djibouti: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Djibouti is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, and which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth in Djibouti.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Djibouti, Bank staff preparedness, the
   extent to which the Bank should seek to influence the global development agenda, their
   agreement with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the
   Bank is an effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the
   sectoral areas on which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the
   Bank’s greatest values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most and least effective
   instruments in helping to reduce poverty in Djibouti, with which groups the Bank should
   work more, and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in Djibouti, the extent to which the Bank
   meets Djibouti’s need for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the Bank’s level
   of effectiveness across twenty-seven development areas, such as economic growth,
   governance, public financial management, food security, health, energy, and others.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge/research, the areas on which the Bank should focus its research
   efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge/research, including
   how significant of a contribution it makes to development results, its technical quality, and
   the Bank’s effectiveness at providing linkage to non-Bank expertise.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Djibouti’s institutional capacity, and
   providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Djibouti: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Djibouti’s development in the near future and to
   indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Djibouti.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, their access to the Internet, and their usage and evaluation of the
   Bank’s website. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to
   Information policy, past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement
   that they use more data from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy .
   Respondents were also asked their level of agreement that they know how to find information
   from the Bank and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Djibouti, and their geographic location.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
    For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the office of a Minister were
       combined with those from the office of the President and the office of the Prime Minister;
       consultants working on Bank-supported projects were combined with respondents from
       PMUs; respondents from bilateral agencies were combined with those from multilateral
       agencies; respondents from the financial sector/private banks were combined with those
       from private sector organizations; respondents from private foundations and trade unions

       Parliamentarian were included in the “Other” category. Note that there were no
       respondents from independent government institutions, CBOs, faith-based groups, and
       the judiciary branch.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness
Specific Areas of Effectiveness
    There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings of the World Bank’s
        effectiveness across two of these twenty-seven areas of development: energy and poverty
        reduction. Respondents from the office of the President/Prime Minister/Minister, local
        government, and NGOs/private foundations/trade unions tended to have the highest
        ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness in these areas whereas respondents from the media
        and academia/research institutes/think tanks tended to have significantly lower ratings.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Djibouti, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-seven specific areas of
effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.
       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Djibouti. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at energy;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at communicable/non-communicable diseases;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at education;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at basic infrastructure;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at job creation/employment; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at poverty reduction.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Djibouti, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at rural/agricultural development;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at monitoring and evaluation;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at poverty reduction; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at energy.
