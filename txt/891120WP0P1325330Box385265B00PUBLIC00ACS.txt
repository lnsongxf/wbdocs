Executive Summary

Mexico’s policies to achieve low-carbon growth and green development are remarkable. The
country has started a number of efforts to develop adequate policy frameworks in several areas
including the energy sector, transportation and industrial policies, and forestry and natural
resources management. Mexico’s Climate Change Law and the National Strategy on Climate
Change envision changing the upward trend of Mexico’s CO2 emissions towards a total decline
of emissions of 30% by 2020, and 50% to 2050 from its business as usual. Achieving these
ambitious policy goals is, however, challenging for the country and will require many distinct
efforts to mainstream climate change in policy design. While institutional efforts are remarkable,
implementation, enforcement, and careful economic analysis will be critical to effectively reduce
emissions while allowing for sustainable development.
        Energy and climate policy are of course at the core of Mexico’s effort. Mexico has
enacted laws for energy conservation and to accelerate the energy transition toward clean energy
sources. The policy evaluated in this study is part of Mexico’s policy framework to promote
renewable energy. While renewable energy has higher capital costs than some of the fossil fuels
alternatives, they come along with several environmental benefits. Among these benefits are the
reduced health impacts of air pollution and climate change. However, many of these benefits do
not have a dollar value, and are therefore most of the times not taken into account in the
decision-making process. These “unvalued” benefits not taken into account in production and
consumption decisions are called externalities. Valuing these impacts is important, as it can help
leveling the field for renewables. Adding these external costs to fossil fuel alternatives in
principle could be beneficial to renewable energy competitiveness.
        The Ministry of Energy in Mexico, SENER, has issued a Methodology to incorporate
external costs of electricity generation. While external costs are not privative of fossil energy,
Mexico’s government has started this process by focusing on the external costs on health and
climate change, two of the main impacts of energy use. This study analyzes the potential of this
new policy to help Mexico in its energy and environmental goals. In particular, this policy
establishes a new legal mandate to incorporate environmental externalities in investment projects
evaluation, the electric system operation and capacity expansion planning.
        First, we present an overview of power generation in Mexico. The country is
transitioning away from fuel-oil generation and investing heavily in natural gas fired power.
Currently, 46% of the generation is powered by natural gas, 9% by coal, 24% by conventional
thermal units and the rest by hydro and a small share of nuclear and geothermal energy.
Electricity demand is expected to grow at a 4% rate on average. To meet growing demand, and
replace old power plants, Mexico’s investments plan for the coming two decades accrues to

                                                ix
US$109.7 billion. This economic and sectoral context highlights the need for policies that will
promote clean energy choices. If the replacement and new infrastructure to meet growing
demand were carbon intensive, it would be difficult to achieve stringent mitigation targets such
as the ones proposed by Mexico.
        Chapter 2 describes the legal framework, as well as the proposed institutional process for
internalizing environmental externalities. The Ministry of Energy and the Federal Commission
of Electricity are responsible of internalizing externalities of electricity in the short, medium and
long-term decision-making process. The implementation of the policy requires key inputs from
the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT). In particular, SEMARNAT
needs to provide estimates for the value of pollution in $/MWh.
       Chapter 3 describes the methods used in Mexico to assess external costs, as well as the
data availability. Mexico has conducted 2 main studies to assess externalities of power
generation. The first study used simplified methods and found an average value of 0.5 US¢/kWh.
The second study used improved methods and estimated a 3.6 and 2.7 US¢/kWh value in critical
zones. Building on Mexico’s experience and on previous work of the World Bank, we present in
Annex B a summary of the methodologies used and key recommendations to improve the
methods.
        Chapter 4 evaluates the policy and its potential to promote renewable energy. Using the
available information in Mexico, we assess the impact of the new policy in a) the evaluation of
investment projects, b) the economic dispatch of power plants and c) capacity expansion
planning. First, we describe the procedure to evaluate investment projects in Mexico, the critical
role that socioeconomic evaluation has both in deciding whether the project takes place and in
approving its financing, and the new role of externalities in the evaluation process. CFE and
SENER will be adding external costs in project evaluation and also including any financial
instruments, emissions taxes or credits, into the financial evaluation of projects. Secondly, we
look at four case studies representative of real cases under evaluation in Mexico, where we
analyze investments in wind, hydro, geothermal and combined cycle gas turbines. We find that
including the external costs was marginally beneficial for the hydro and combined cycle projects,
but play a more critical role in the geothermal and wind project. In particular, the wind project
presented a positive net present value only after adding externalities.
         To assess operational and long-term investment decisions, we develop two models to
illustrate the potential changes of adding externalities. Our models are only for concept
demonstration, and are calibrated to one of the electric regions of Mexico (Central-West region).
We demonstrate that adding externalities in short-term operational decisions could change the
electric system dispatch. There are two important findings from our modeling of economic
dispatch: a) more generation is shift to non-critical areas (as classified by the Mexican
environmental standard that sets emissions limits to combustion equipment) considering the fact
that environmental health effects are geographically differentiated and higher in critical areas and
                                                 x
b) adding CO2 at a $23 usd/ton did not change the merit order of the technologies analyzed in
this particular system, and therefore did not change further the dispatch. The results are
particular to this system configuration, and only illustrate some of the potential results of the
policy implementation. These finding suggests that two critical important components of the
policy are to distinguish external costs by region and also to further differentiate technology
vintages. The policy currently allocates the same costs to technology categories (same external
costs per MW for all combined cycle units, all fuel-oil units, etc.). It would be important to
further differentiate by units to have a more realistic pricing and effects in the economic dispatch
of the system considering differences in the efficiency of the units.
       Regarding the modeling of the capacity expansion decision, we ascertain that, at the
current level of external costs estimates in the Mexican studies, the technologies chosen for
capacity expansion do not change. This result is limited and specific to the system studied, but do
show that under some circumstances, the externality costs will not be enough to trigger
technological change.




        The results of the capacity expansion decision highlight the importance of improving the
methods to value externalities and to select the social cost of carbon to consider an adequate
price that reflects total costs to society. Our study suggests that a combination of policies could
be needed to further incentivize low-carbon generation, such as externalities with emissions
targets or renewable portfolio standards. Again, these modeling results are just an illustration of
possible dynamics and do not intent to quantify or prescribed particular policies. Our
conclusions serve the purpose to inform the externality policy design and elicit important system
interactions that should be consider for improving this policy.
       At the end the report presents some recommendations and areas of improvement of
SENER’s methodology. Some of the recommendations include i) the definition of a work plan
for improving externalities valuation and publish official Guidelines, ii) evaluate approaches to
estimate the social cost of carbon and evaluate trade-offs, iii) improve the valuation of health
outcomes, iv) estimating the value of external costs of generation associated with ozone, v)
building capacity for model building and maintenance and vi) aligning environmental regulation
and economic instruments with the application of environmental externalities.

The World Bank has assist Mexico in identifying mitigation options, and in evaluating policies
with high mitigation potential in critical sectors. Certainly, one of these key sectors to reduce
emissions is the decarbonization of the electricity system. Delivering low-carbon power systems
require the implementation of new policies that adequately balance costs and benefits of
mitigation. Mexico has moved forward advancing its legislation and developing specific
instruments to trigger technological change in the power sector. We consider this policy to be of
interest to other developing countries looking for policy options to balance costs and benefits of
renewable energy.

Chapter 1. Introduction

Electricity presents a paradox when it comes to meeting the challenge of climate change,
representing the largest and fastest-growing source of carbon dioxide (CO2) while holding the
key to potential solutions for a more efficient, less carbon-intensive economy. Energy experts
and economists agree that many proposed solutions to mitigating the effects of climate change
are concentrated in the power sector. These include greater use of renewable-energy sources,
increased end-use efficiency (ranging from that of fossil-fuel plants to household appliances),
and nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage. In addition, the electrification of transport
and heating and cooling systems might provide a way to move other sectors toward a low-carbon
future. How such decarbonization—generation without net CO2 emissions—will occur hinges
on policy decisions.
        A stated objective of Mexico’s National Energy Strategy for 2013–27 is diversifying and
optimizing the nation’s electricity capacity, with the goal of internalizing environmental
externalities while maintaining energy security. The Energy Reform of 2008 includes two key
pieces of legislation designed to ease the country’s transition to a less fossil fuel–intensive
economy: one law promoting the use of renewable energy and the other promoting energy
efficiency. The former explicitly mandates the incorporation of externalities for energy planning
and environmental regulation and incentive mechanisms for renewable energy. To enforce this
law, Mexico’s Ministry of Energy (SENER) published the Methodology for the Valuation of
Externalities of Electricity Generation in December 2012. Hereafter refer to as SENER’s
methodology (to distinguish it from other methodologies referred to in the text).
        Externalities are costs or benefits from an economic activity not reflected fully in market
prices. For example, pollution creates damages that affect third parties but that are not
considered in the market prices of economic activities nor compensated. Economists consider
this problem a market failure, because too much of the polluting activity takes place with respect
to an optimum where all costs and benefits are taken into account. Internalizing externalities in
this context is the process by which producers or consumers are regulated or incentivize to
consider these social costs in their economic decisions and adjust their production and
consumption accordingly.
        In the case of electricity, different technologies impose different costs to society. For
instance, fossil fuel power plants emissions cause damages in human health due to the adverse
effects of air pollution and can have other potential impacts in other economic activities such as
fisheries, crops, materials and tourism, due to acidification of soils and water bodies, as well as
landscape impacts. Also, CO2 emissions cause climate change externalities. External costs are
not restrictive of fossil fuel energy. Big hydroelectric facilities need to create dams, which by

                                                1
disrupting the natural flow of rivers could have negative impacts in the local and regional
ecosystems. Wind and solar farms require large extensions of land, which could have negative
impacts on the landscape. Also, wind farms could impact negatively some bird species.
Internalizing externalities of electricity is the process by which these costs or benefits are added
to the electricity prices, either by reflecting them as costs for producers or consumers.
        One of the problems to include externalities into decision-making is that very often these
negative effects are not quantified nor valued. In general, there are no markets for these
emissions or taxes that reflect the social damages of pollution. Estimating these values requires
studies to estimate the damage costs. Current state of research shows that the impacts on health
and climate change are critical components of the external costs. The Mexican government has
decided to start the process of internalizing externalities limiting the analysis to health and
climate change impacts. However, Mexico does envision adding more impacts as more
information on other external costs become available in the country. Thus, the present study is
limited to internalizing costs of health and CO2 emissions. We consider that a follow up study
on methods to value other external costs would be valuable as Mexico expands the scope of its
policy, and acknowledge that our study is limited in scope to these two types of impacts. In
Annex C (table C.1), we show the external costs of energy impacts by category and pollutant that
are more often discussed in the literature as identified by the ExternE study.
       Worldwide, various policy instruments have been designed to incentivize clean energy
production; however, the mandate to incorporate environmental externalities into the planning
and operation of a full power system is unique.

        The concept of internalizing externalities has always been at the core of environmental
policy. Hence, many countries have developed approaches to value pollution and to consider the
social and environmental costs of energy choices in policy design. While the idea of pricing
pollution is generally accepted as a sound policy principle, placing a concrete dollar value on the
damage of pollution is challenging. In particular, the methods to estimate non-market values of
air pollution and climate change emissions from the power sector are data-intensive and require
the use of models to track pollution, assess the damages and methods for economic valuation.
Particularly for climate change, valuation techniques and models need to be improved to better
assess the social cost of carbon. For this reason, most of the previous work on externalities
valuation has been conducted primarily in developed economies.
        Both the European Union and the United States have used life cycle analysis to estimate
externalities from electricity technologies. Extensive research has been conducted on the
valuation side since the 1990s. In Europe, the ExternE project has estimated electricity
externalities in different European countries (European Commission. 2005). In the US, the
National Research Council updated the values of externalities from electricity generation and
                                               2
examined them in the context of the so- called hidden costs of energy (National Research
Council, 2010). Among the uses of damage costs are the assessment of new environmental
standards and policies, project valuation and justification of green tax policies (EPA,1999; EIA-
DOE, 1995; OECD, 2001a&b; Égert, B. ,2011).
       Along with the increasing attention to the climate problem, the interest on assessing
environmental externalities of conventional pollution has spurred research in developing
countries. Acknowledging the importance of co-benefits of climate policy-for example the
reduce impact of conventional pollution- has become an area of opportunity to move forward
climate action in the developing world.


        Because Mexico’s power-system structure allows for highly centralized planning, the
country could set a precedent for how large state-owned enterprises can move forward with
sound methods to incorporate environmental costs into their investment decisions and send a
market signal to their private-sector partners, the independent power producers (IPPs), about the
value of clean technologies. Many developing countries rely on IPPs to deliver their electricity,
with various private-participation schemes. Such innovative legislation in a large developing
country like Mexico could provide a real-world example of the benefits and challenges of such a
policy. The policy we assess in this study, put forward by the Mexican Government, falls into the
national mitigation policies that try to incorporate local, regional and global benefits in the
decision-making process. Thus, while the concept is not new, its application in the power sector
in Mexico and the proposed policy framework can provide a useful example for developing
countries looking at the implementation of sustainability policies for the electric sector.



Study Purpose and Objectives
This study aims to evaluate the impact of the new methodology developed and used by SENER
to internalize environmental externalities. Specific objectives are to identify (i) barriers to
implementing the methodology and (ii) ways to improve it. The study builds on previous work
on environmental externalities undertaken by SENER, as well as other ministries (e.g., Ministry
of Finance and Public Credit [SHCP] and Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources
[SEMARNAT]). It complements previous work undertaken by the World Bank’s Energy Sector
Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), which has assisted Mexico in its efforts to design
polices for low-carbon growth (e.g., World Bank 2010a; ESMAP 2010). SENER and CFE will
apply this method to internalize externalities in their decisions regarding the investment and
operation of the power system in Mexico.

Chapter 2. Mexico’s Policy Context for Incorporating
           Externalities

Power Sector Overview
Mexico’s primary energy production depends heavily on hydrocarbons. According to the
Ministry of Energy (SENER), total energy production in 2011 was 9,185 PJ, of which
hydrocarbons accounted for 89 percent (SENER 2012a). Of that amount, oil and natural gas
represented 73 percent and 26 percent, respectively. Renewable energy comprised 7 percent of
primary energy production, of which biomass supplied 55 percent and hydropower and
geothermal each accounting for 20 percent. Coal comprised 3.2 percent of total production,
while nuclear energy accounted for 1.2 percent. A large oil exporting country, Mexico exported
3,137 PJ of its energy production in 2011, mainly in the form of crude oil. Energy imports,
which are growing, accounted for 2,269 PJ, of which gasoline and natural gas represented 36
percent and 30 percent, respectively, followed by diesel and gasoil at 13 percent and coal at 8
percent. After accounting for losses and net trade, Mexico’s total primary energy supply was
8,399 PJ, with 1,049.6 PJ of that amount used for electricity generation.
        As of January 2013, Mexico’s electricity sector had a total installed effective capacity1 of
52,974.2 MW (SENER 2013), 76 percent of which was owned by the Federal Electricity
Commission (CFE), the state-run electric utility, and the remainder by independent power
producers (IPPs). In 2011, the country’s electricity system generated 2.59 TWh, 59.6 percent of
which was generated by CFE and the remainder by the private sector. Currently, natural gas
technologies (primarily combined cycle) account for 34 percent of total installed effective
capacity, while conventional thermal and hydroelectric plants comprise 28 percent and 22
percent, respectively, followed by coal and dual coal/fuel oil at 5 percent each, nuclear at 3
percent, geothermal at 2 percent, and wind at 1 percent (Figure 1). In 2011, natural gas
accounted for 46 percent of electricity generation, followed by conventional thermal (mainly
fuel-oil powered) at 18 percent, hydro at 14 percent, and coal at 9 percent; nuclear and
geothermal accounted for 4 percent and 3 percent, respectively (Figure 2). Altogether, non-fossil
fuel technologies produced 21 percent of electricity in 2011.

Investment Outlook
CFE and SENER are in charge of planning future expansions of the electricity sector,
considering both demand growth estimates and fuels and technology requirements. By law,
SENER publishes a 15-year plan (perspective) for the power sector each year, outlining the
government’s programs in electricity infrastructure investment. According to this plan, demand
for electricity over the next decade will increase by 4 percent a year, reaching 480 TWh in
generation by 2026. Meeting this demand will require 44,532 MW in expanded system capacity,
of which 10,795 MW would come from projects not yet committed to any particular generator
(private or public) or technology.
       For the 2012–26 period, the investment plan totals about US$109.7 billion2. Of this
amount, 52 percent is for new generation facilities, 20 percent for the distribution network, 14
percent for transmission, 13 percent for maintenance, and 1 percent for other public investment
(CFE 2012).
        Mexico has three main modes of capacity investment: public works, financed public
works, and IPPs. Public works are paid directly from the government out of public budget,
financed public works are included in the budget and approved by Congress, but will be financed
and paid by services provided by the resulting infrastructure, and the IPPs are financed by the
private sector. Of the total investment needs for 2012–19, 70 percent will come from the scheme
for financed public works, 25 percent from IPPs, and 5 percent from the federal budget for public
works (Table 1). Public works will account for 67 percent of new investment in transmission
and 88 percent of investment in distribution. The government expects that 74 percent of IPP
investments will be in natural gas combined cycle (CC) plants and the rest in wind farms.
Investment in financed public works will be allocated to natural gas CC plants (42 percent), new
hydro plants (23 percent), new wind farms (19 percent), and 16 percent (other technologies).
Two-thirds of budgetary expenses will be allocated to maintenance and one-third to new hydro.
(See Table 1 below, and Annex B for further details on investment requirements).
The National Electricity System is the country’s largest fuel consumer and thus its main point
source of emissions from polluting agents. It accounts for 80 percent of coal consumption, 77
percent of the heavy fuel oil (combustóleo) used (with approximately 4 percent sulfur content),
and 35 percent of the natural gas consumed. The resulting air pollution from the electricity
sector consists of 1.05 million tons of sulfur dioxide (SO2), 337,810 tons of nitrogen oxides
(NOx), 68,950 tons of particular matter (PM10), 58,271 tons of fine particulate matter (PM2.5),
72,402 tons of carbon monoxide, 7691 tons of volatile organic compounds (VOC), 3,671 tons of
ammonia (NH3) and 3,295 tons of black carbon and 84.5 million tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent (CO2e) (SEMARNAT, 2013). The growth in emissions will depend on the selected
technologies for system capacity expansion.

        Expected electricity demand growth will require Mexico’s energy sector to expand
natural gas use by 3.7 percent per year; pipeline distribution will originate from domestic and
U.S. sources, as well as liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals. The country has limited
coal reserves, located mainly in the north; thus, coal will be imported to meet power-plant
demand in southern regions (Map 1). According to planning documents, the fraction of clean
gas and clean coal shown in Figure 3 refers to gas and coal generation with carbon capture and
storage. Clean generation could also include renewable sources, nuclear, and other technologies.

Policy Mandate to Internalize External Costs and the New Methodology
Mexico’s National Energy Strategy to transition from heavy dependence on hydrocarbon-based
electricity generation adheres to both environmental and energy-security objectives. Three
statutes provide the legal basis for applying this methodology: the Law for Harnessing
Renewable Energy and Financing the Energy Transition (LAERFTE), the Electricity Public
Service Law (LSPEE), and the General Law on Climate Change (LGCC). The LAERFTE
mandates the following:
       The Ministry of Energy, with the opinion of the Ministry of Treasury and Public Credit, the
       Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, and the Ministry of Health, shall elaborate a
       methodology to value externalities related to electricity generation, coming from renewable and
       non-renewable sources at different scales, as well as the public policies to which this Law refers
       related to these externalities. Based on that methodology and public policies, the Ministry of
       Environment and Natural Resources will design the mechanisms for environmental regulation to
       harness renewable energy (LAERFTE, Article 10).

In addition, the LSPEE mandates that
       For the public service of electricity, in the short and long term, electricity shall be produced from
       least-cost sources for the Federal Electricity Commission, considering the environmental
       externalities of each technology, and also providing optimal stability, quality, and security of the
       public service (LSPEE, Article 36bis).

Furthermore, the LGCC states that
       The national mitigation policy for climate change should be instrumented gradually, promoting
       and enhancing national capabilities for mitigation and adaptation, as well as the adverse effects of
       climate change, and prioritizing the sectors with greater abatement potential, leaving at the end
       those of higher costs, in addition to taking care of the international agreements taken by Mexico.
       In the case of policies and activities that imply or transfer a cost to the private sector or society in
       general, and for which no international funding is available for implementation, these policies
       could be implemented in two phases, when there is an area of opportunity for the regulated
       entities:
       I.       Enhancing national capabilities where policies shall be implemented on a voluntary basis,
       with the objective of strengthening capabilities of the regulated sectors, considering:
       …g.      Analysis of the electricity generation sector, including external social and environmental
                costs, as well as the costs of emissions in the selection of sources for generating
                electricity (LGCC, Article 32).
       In order to reduce emissions, the Agencies of the Federal Government, the States, and the
       Municipalities, within the scope of their competences, shall promote policies and mitigation
       actions in the corresponding sectors, considering:
       …d.     Including the costs of the environmental and social externalities, as well as the costs of
       emissions, in the selection of sources for electricity generation (LGCC, Article 34).

        On December 14, 2012, Mexico published the Methodology for the Valuation of
Externalities of Electricity Generation in Mexico, which substitutes for SENER’s earlier efforts
to initiate accounting for electricity externalities using CO2 costs in new investment projects.
The new methodology includes the impact of local and regional pollution, including SO2, NOx,
and PM10. It also extends the requirement of accounting for externalities beyond the planning
process to encompass system dispatch and evaluation of new investment projects. This allows
policy makers to consider all available options, taking into account the cost of pollutants
produced per kilowatt-hour generated. The method’s stated objective is “valuing the
externalities associated with electricity generation by using different energy sources at different
scales in the system” (section 1.3). In accordance with the legal framework, the method “will
allow for evaluating the environmental impact of the development plans of electricity generation
projects, which will impact the expansion plans of the system and the economic dispatch in the
short run.” In the document’s “Scope and Objective” section, SENER establishes that only
externalities that differ significantly from zero will be considered, emphasizing the need to
include the external costs imposed on health.
        The document’s “Definitions” section includes terminology to operationalize the process.
Externalities are defined as “positive or negative impacts associated with electricity generation,
caused by the provision of a good or service, that impact or could impact a third party in Mexico
locally, regionally, or globally over the short, medium, and long term; these externalities occur
when the cost paid for a good or service differs from the total costs of damages or benefits in
economic terms.” Other key terms and definitions include displaced energy, defined as energy
substituted by the new project, incremental energy, meaning additional energy associated with
the new project, and financial instruments, which refer to carbon credits and/or carbon taxes.
        The method describes the process that the Federal Government of Mexico is to follow for
incorporating externalities. The four government entities with competencies in the process are
SENER, SEMARNAT, CFE, and SHCP. SENER establishes the methodology, coordinates with
the entities, and includes IPP emissions in the evaluation of externalities. SEMARNAT provides
information on the external costs associated with the various pollutants per technology, conducts
a financial analysis of the CO2 value in regional and international markets to provide the dollar-
per-ton value to use in the valuation process, and facilitates use of annual emissions reports from
the CFE and IPPs. CFE elaborates the reference costs and parameters for formulating
investment projects (COPAR), including information on the cost of externalities (new
procedure), and uses these to develop the electricity sector’s 15-year investment plan, known as
the Electricity Sector Infrastructure Investment Program (POISE). CFE competency is to
include externalities in system dispatch by adding external costs to the computation of total
variable costs. Finally, externalities have to be included in the elaboration of investment projects
that CFE submits, with SENER approval, for SHCP evaluation. Socioeconomic evaluation of
the projects is to include all pollution costs, while financial evaluation is to include CO2 revenues
from regional or international markets. SENER’s schematic representation, including the
                                                 11
responsible entities throughout the process, is highlighted below (Figures 4–8). Annex A
provides a full translation of the method for those interested in the technical and legal details.

Critical Steps and Potential Barriers to Implementation
As the above description of the methodology implies, critical steps, outlined below, are required
for its implementation:
      SEMARNAT must provide updated values for the costs of externalities from the various
       technologies for electricity generation. The method requires updated analysis every three
       years. The values estimated will eventually determine the overall impact of the policy.
      CFE must prepare the electricity sector’s emissions inventory with IPP information. This
       will require extensive collaboration with SEMARNAT and SENER to access
       environmental performance information from the annual operating records (COAs) of the
       various facilities and IPPs.
      CFE must include these costs in the investment projects submitted to SENER and SHCP
       for approval.
      SHCP and SENER are required to evaluate investment projects in a timely manner, and
       CFE’s overall planning process must be aligned with their evaluation.
      Policy timelines are short; the method requires that external costs be included in the 2014
       planning process, which leaves little time for coordination.
        To identify potential barriers to implementing these critical steps, this study conducted
interviews with officials from SENER, SEMARNAT, CFE, and SHCP. During the interviews,
officials expressed their concerns about the models and methods required to estimate the value of
pollution, inter-institutional coordination, specifics on the legal wording of the method, and
budgetary constraints to conducting the needed studies. Some stakeholders expressed their
concern about the potential overall impact of the policy on electricity tariffs.



                                                      14
         Clearly, the first critical step in moving forward with policy implementation is ensuring
that studies to estimate the valuation of pollution in the country are based on sound methods.
SEMARNAT has made substantial progress in this area. Two available studies, currently in the
process of being updated, include VoE estimates in dollars per ton of SO2, NOx, and PM10 for
pollution produced by selected power plants in the country, including critical areas. CFE,
SENER, and SEMARNAT have various databases available, based on their work in analyzing
emissions of the electric power sector. Also, detailed power-plant data from a tri-national
collaboration project of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Commission for
Environmental Cooperation is available and open to the public. However, no single official
dataset is available explicitly for evaluating externalities. Setting up a standardized procedure is
critical for estimating the sector’s emissions inventory and providing access to the stakeholders
involved. Such a method requires ongoing annual updating, which could present a bottleneck if
detailed COA information is required. Given the need for annual updating of the emissions
inventory, simplified estimation methods, such as emissions factors, might be preferable to COA
information, which entails a lengthy process. Evaluating IPP emissions using COA report data
could also present a bottleneck since explicit authorization may be required and data use limits
could apply.
        Since 2006, CFE, SENER and SHCP have been using the externalities studies of
SEMARNAT to conduct cost-benefit analyses of socioeconomic projects, particularly to
evaluate the potential benefits of renewable energy and more recently the displacement of older
power plants with more efficient fossil-fuel generation. This means that substantial expertise has
been developed in the planning and investment units of these entities. However, implementation
of this policy would expand the use of externalities in project evaluation, and some discussion
would be needed to address issues of adding the external costs to new fossil-fuel generation
projects, particularly the initial ones evaluated.
        Incorporating externalities into the COPAR and POISE are new procedures for CFE, and
time would be required for implementation. However, previous experience in using externalities
for project evaluation could facilitate the process. If CFE is provided data on the VoE, then the
additional costs, like all other variable costs, could be included in the process. SENER and
SEMARNAT would have to provide CFE the VoE numbers in a timely manner, and internal
coordination of CFE areas would be required to ensure timely delivery of the emissions
inventory to the planning area. Ideally, this should be a standardized internal process, conducted
annually, to better equip CFE areas to comply with their new responsibilities (Figure 9).

The method aims to have a long-term planning impact by incorporating externalities into
COPAR, while the respective medium- and short-term impacts are expected through analysis of
concrete infrastructure programs and its addition to the economic dispatch of the system. Given
the importance of VoE to this process, the next chapter presents the information required for
these studies and the current data available in Mexico to identify potential bottlenecks, as well as
areas for improving VoE computation methods.

Chapter 3. Valuation of Externalities

Energy production and consumption are essential for economic development and therefore the
goal of energy policies is to supply fuels and electricity to meet growing demand while
minimizing costs. However, these policy objectives face constraints related to the impact of
energy-polluting emissions on human health and the absorptive capacity of the environment
more generally. Energy production and consumption cause local, regional, and global
externalities, mainly associated with the use of fossil fuels. At local and regional levels, a main
concern is the health-risk exposure of vulnerable populations to criteria pollutants (those that are
toxic and/or that can have a negative impact in human or ecosystems’ health), which can result in
acute and chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and related illnesses. At the regional
level, a major environmental concern is the effect of sulfates and nitrates from acid rain on
ecosystems and agricultural crops, as well as material damage. On a global scale, the foremost
challenge is greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
       Evaluating the new methodology for Mexico’s electricity production matrix requires
estimating the value of such externalities. Building on earlier studies of the Mexican government
(SEMARNAT and ECLAC 2004 & 2007) and previous World Bank work to assist the Mexican
government in identifying methods to evaluate externalities (World Bank, 2010b), this chapter
describes the methods and data that could serve as the basis for policy implementation.

Methodology
Mexico’s studies on external costs of energy have followed the methodology Impacts Pathway,
developed by the European Union for the research project Externalities of Energy (European
Commission. 2005). To quantify and monetize external costs, this methodology requires four
consecutive steps that follow the route of pollutants from the emissions starting point to the
endpoint where damages are caused (Figure 10). E



The first step is characterization of the emissions source, including a detailed analysis of the
emissions inventory and facilities (e.g., release of pollutants, stack heights, and temperature and
velocity of flows). The second step is dispersion analysis, which estimates the pollution
concentration in ambient air and deposition in ecosystems. The third step involves risk
assessment and quantification of impacts, applying exposure-response functions to estimate units
of damage (e.g., number of cases of bronchitis or restricted activity days). Finally, the fourth
step is valuation of externalities, which considers the valuation of market and non-market goods;



                                                17
economic valuation techniques are applied to non-market goods to estimate society’s willingness
to pay (WTP) in order to avoid external costs (e.g., hedonic wages and contingent valuation).3

The methodology relies on modeling techniques to quantify the environmental damage, and data
from emissions, epidemiology studies and economic costs. Annex B Modeling Framework and
Methodology provides detailed descriptions of the underlining economic modeling framework
and of each step in the valuation process. Each of the methodology steps mentioned in Figure 10
is described fully in the Annex, citing relevant literature in each of the methods. It also describes
the specific models used in Mexico, identifying the main developments and areas of opportunity
to improve the methods used. Table 2 provides a summary of the models used in Mexico, as
well as a summary of main data requirements. While the description of the steps involved in
analyzing externalities is very important, plenty of literature exists regarding these methods,
therefore interested readers should look for details in the Annex and on the literature cited on it.
Following we focus rather on describing the available data in Mexico, as well as the externalities
estimates of the Mexican government.

Review of Data Available in Mexico
The data available in Mexico for valuing externalities was first compiled in the above-mentioned
studies by SEMARNAT and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean
(ECLAC). In order to internalize external costs, SEMARNAT is in the process of updating
these studies. This section presents the externalities figures currently available in Mexico and
presents updated data for some of the critical parameters of the valuation.
Meteorological Data and Regional Dispersion Domain
The National Meteorological Service provides local meteorological data required for numerous
variables, ranging from mean temperature, wind direction and velocity, precipitation, and solar
radiation to mixture height, cloud cover, and land use. This information is available and is
updated hourly for the network of 184 stations in the country. CFE also gathers meteorological
data in many of its power plants. The data for the National Meteorological Service and from
CFE can be used for local-dispersion modeling. For the analysis of regional dispersion,
information is required for a large geographic area. This data normally comes from international
datasets of re-analysis data4. ECLAC calibrated the Windrose Trajectory Model (WTM) for an
area covering Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean islands, and Florida (Figure 11) using
reanalysis data of 5 years           .

dataset available to all countries in the region for research purposes. The dataset is described in
the subsections below.

                                             925 mbar (approximately 800 m above sea level).
Precipitation
Available data on precipitation in the WTM comes from the Global Precipitation Climatology
Centre (GPCC) and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), Version 2 Combined
Precipitation Data Set. The GPCC source is a free-access dataset with quality-controlled data for
some 7,000 monitoring stations; it has global data from 1986–present, at resolutions of 2.5 and 1.
The GPCP dataset contains remote sensing data in addition to measurements, and has a
2.5 resolution.
Emissions
The WTM requires that each cell in the domain contain emissions data on SO2, NOx, and NH3 in
order to estimate the background concentrations needed to run the program’s chemical
transformation modules. SEMARNAT and ECLAC updated data for Mexico’s energy sector
emissions as part of the study (SEMARNAT and ECLAC 2007). Energy-sector emissions, from
CFE and Pemex (Petróleos Mexicanos), were updated for the 2005 reference year. Emissions
from the rest of the grid vary.
       ECLAC’s database has used various emissions datasets. For SO2 and NOx emissions, the
Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) was used,i while data on NH3
emissions used the Ammonia International Emission Inventoryii and the Global Emissions
Inventory Activity (GEIA).iii Datasets on NH3 emissions, which are quite difficult to capture at a
global scale, used 1990 and 1995 data, with respective resolutions of 0.5 and 1 . The NH3
background level is critical to estimating nitrates and sulfate reactions. The WTM requires
background concentrations of ozone (O3) and hydroxyl radicals (OH); for the region, the ECLAC
team recommended the following default values: 40 ppb (O3) and 1.3 million mol per cm3 (OH).
Exposure Response Functions (ERF)
The available data for ERF was compiled originally by the World Bank in a meta-analysis of
epidemiological studies in Mexico, in the context of health impacts valuation for Mexico City.
McKinley et al. (2003) and SEMARNAT and ECLAC (2004, 2007) have use the values for
increased risk of exposure coming from the WB meta-analysis updating information for baseline
health statistics. Table 3 presents the IRRs and baseline information, with original sources.

Economic Costs
Mexico’s National Institute of Public Health has conducted research to value the impacts of
smoking in respiratory diseases, which may serve as a proxy for estimating air pollution
damages. The main reference for morbidity impacts is a detailed study conducted jointly by the
National Institute for Public Health and the National Institute of Ecology, with technical
cooperation from the USEPA, to value the health impacts as co-benefits in the metropolitan area
of Mexico City (McKinley et al. 2003). 5 Other studies in Mexico have used data coming from
international studies, adjusting costs using the differences in purchasing power parity. Table 4
presents a summary of the unit costs for morbidity and mortality used in Mexico for estimating
externalities.

Value of Statistical Life
No doubt, value of statistical life (VSL) is the most controversial figure used to analyze external
costs. As will be shown in the sensitivity analysis, total external costs are highly sensitive to this
value. Typically, external costs are dominated by those associated with mortality and thus
results of the sensitivity analysis are expected. In general, the approach to value chronic
mortality, using the VSL per case or converting each case to the associated YOLL, is critical for
externalities valuation. To date, only one study has been conducted in Mexico to estimate the
VSL. Because of the importance of the VSL to estimating the external costs of this research, we
briefly describe the methods used in that study in this section.
        Conducted by Hammitt and Ibarrarán (2006), the study used compensating wage
differentials to estimate marginal rates of substitution between income and occupational-injury
risks in Mexico City. The study surveyed some 600 workers to identify their perceived risks of
both fatal and non-fatal occupational injury. The survey was supplemented by actuarial-risk
estimates to prove for consistency. Hedonic-wage regressions were estimated by regressing the
logarithm of the hourly wage on occupational risk and human-capital variables (e.g., age,
schooling, work experience, and sex). The mean age was 33 years, and mean education was 8
years. Experience with current employer averaged 6 years and average monthly wage was
Mex$3,500 (US$350). Estimates of the value per statistical life were in a range of US$235,000–
$325,000 (2002 figures); these values were much smaller than corresponding estimates for
higher-income countries, at US$4–9 million, but were compatible to the few estimates previously
made for lower-income countries such as India (Hammitt and Ibarrarán, 2006).
        Since mortality impacts are the main component of external costs, it is important to
conduct some sensitivity analysis, particularly since few studies are available for this important
figure in the estimate. Transferring the VSL from U.S. studies would give a total value of
US$560,000 (2000 figure), and chronic mortality would be estimated at US$13,327 per YOLL.
By comparison, transferring the VSL from EU studies would result in a value of $17,485 per
YOLL. Thus, the Value of Statistical Life is in the lower side of the range of values that would
usually be used in this type of studies, in the case that there were no reference studies in the country.
The discount rate used was 3 percent, a commonly accepted discounting parameter for health
policy.

Externalities
As explained, the values of externalities are a result of several processes that transport pollution
from its origin until it has an impact. The total impact is a function of the total emissions, but
also of the meteorology affecting pollution transport and the population density in the areas
where this pollution is emitted. Mexico has a standard to define that defines the emissions limits
for combustion equipment (NOM-085). This regulation defines critical and non-critical areas.
Critical areas are those very densely populated such as the metropolitan areas of Mexico City,
Guadalajara and Monterrey, or that are critical due to the high levels of pollution emitted by
industry which can result in violations of the ambient levels of pollution that are consider
adequate to protect human health or the environment.
The available externality estimates for power plants in all the country and for power plants in
some critical zones are presented in Tables 5 and 6, respectively. Estimates for power plants in
all the country are based on simplified methodologies that aimed at having a first approximation
of the external costs, while those for critical zones utilize more complex models. Models using
the simplified method estimated lower externalities costs as a result of more conservative
assumptions.

        The 2004 study of SEMARNAT and ECLAC estimated externalities for power plants
located throughout Mexico, including main facilities in critical areas; while their 2007 study
estimated externality costs for only two critical zones (Tula and Salamanca), using various
models to account for interactions with oil-refining facilities in the respective areas. The 2007
study estimated externalities in the higher portion of the confidence range of the 2004 study,
which used simplified methods. The average national cost for externalities was US$0.50 per
kWh, with cost per ton of SO2, NOx, and PM10 averaging $489, $332, and $873, respectively.
Currently, SEMARNAT is updating these studies using the simplified methodology of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), with the SIMPACTS model.
Encompassing Climate-Change Externalities
Analysis of climate-change externalities requires a separate in-depth, integrated-assessment
modeling exercise detailing damages and mitigation costs. Since climate change is a global
impact, the methods require a global analysis encompassing not only the electricity or energy
sector, but also the impacts derived from other sectors of the economy, along with other social
and ecosystem impacts. There are many problems of using cost of mitigation and price of
carbon in current markets as a proxy for the social cost of carbon (SCC) (See World Bank
2010b). Currently, SENER proposes using a method that considers an annual review of the
regional or international carbon markets to set a value on the carbon externality. The main
problem with this approach is that the current value of carbon credits is a poor estimate of the
real marginal damage to the economy and other unvalued Earth-system impacts that accrue from
CO2 emissions.
        Integrated assessment modeling has been used to estimate climate impacts, and extensive
research has been devoted to estimating the social value of 1 avoided ton of emissions. For
example, the Dynamic Integrated Climate Economy (DICE) model of Nordhaus (2008), the first
integrated assessment model focused on the climate issue, provides mitigation paths to climate
change, estimating an optimal carbon price or tax of US$27 per MT (2005 figure). By contrast,
the British government’s Stern Review (Stern 2006), which estimated climate-change
externalities using the Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse Effect (PAGE) model, resulted in a
carbon cost of $320 per MT. Such divergence in modeling results stem from different model
assumptions, particularly with regard to the discount rate used for inter-temporal valuation and
the slope of the mitigation costs and damage curves (Mendelsohn 2007; Dasgupta 2006).
        The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) literature review revealed a
median carbon cost of $45 per MT; however, the ranges were quite large. The IPCC review
showed that stabilization scenarios at about 550 ppm CO2e by 2100 imply carbon prices rising to
20–80 US$ per tCO2e by 2030 and to 30–155 US$ per tCO2e by 2050. For the same
stabilization level, studies since the Third Assessment Report that account for induced
technological change lower these price ranges to 5–65 US$ per tCO2e in 2030 and 15–130 US$
per tCO2e in 2050. In its second study of externalities, SEMARNAT used a value of $29;
                                               25
however, the costs of climate change were not incorporated into the final estimates and were
only used for comparison with total health impacts.
        In many countries, pricing carbon has been a long-standing policy goal. The major
policy exercise is perhaps the European Union allowance trading system derived from the EU
commitment to the Kyoto Protocol. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) carbon market
is also a reference of policy implemented; still in its infancy, the policy instrument is fragmented
as CO2 prices fall short of estimating the SCC. Despite not having been a signatory to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the U.S. administration has
made some efforts to estimate the SCC for regulatory purposes. For example, the EPA used it to
enforce new Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards to increase vehicle fuel
efficiency. Table 7 provides averages for several discount rates, as well as an overall average
since the expert panel formed to analyze methods for computing the SCC did not agree on a
single rate, given the open discussion in economics about adequate value for discounted future
social benefits.

       Note: The values for the social cost of carbon are dollar-year and emissions-year specific.


       Studies conducted by the World Bank have typically used a value of US$23 per tCO2.
For our 2006 reference year, power-plant emissions were 84,513.50 million tCO2. Using the $23
reference estimate for a ton of carbon yields US$1.943 billion in total costs associated with
climate change. Using an uncertainty interval of $5 per ton of carbon (conservative estimate) to
$320 per ton of carbon (high estimate of the Stern Report) yields a range of $433 million to
$7.375 billion in external GHG emissions costs for Mexico’s power sector.

Key Recommendations
Improving these estimates will require efforts on a number of fronts. These include improving
emissions inventories by increasing the frequency of measurements in major power plants, along
with increasing the meteorological monitoring of power plants and making the findings public
for research use. In addition, models should be calibrated for estimating ozone. Furthermore,
research is needed to improve the ERF, particularly for chronic mortality, and to estimate the
VSL by contingent valuation, particularly for environmental improvements. Finally, evaluating
climate-change policy requires state-of-the-art global models with regional detail in order to
account for the impacts of various policies at regional and global levels.

Chapter 4. Internalizing Externalities

SENER has established processes for internalizing the external costs of investment projects into
short- and long-term planning, economic dispatch of the system, and the cost-benefit analysis
stage of project submission. This chapter analyzes these processes in order to better understand
the feasibility of using the methodology and identify potential barriers to implementation. The
sections that follow describe the ongoing policy process and, based on the experience of four
case studies, how investment decisions have been affected by including external costs. The four
case studies refer to the analysis of four investment projects in different electricity technologies:
a) a natural gas combined cycle, b) a geothermal power plant, c) wind farm and h) hydro power
plant. To evaluate the use of externalities in the economic dispatch of the system and long-term
expansion we run two simulation models.

Including externalities in the Economic Evaluation Process
Currently, the long-term investment planning process for the electricity sector is the 15-year
POISE, described in chapter 2 (Figure 9). Once the POISE has been decided, the specifics of
each project are analyzed in detail. Each year, CFE prepares and SENER authorizes projects in
accordance with the overall strategic energy-sector plans and programs defined by the POISE.
Externalities are used to include some of the environmental benefits of renewable energy
projects in the socioeconomic evaluation of projects. SHCP, which has oversight responsibility
for the sector, approves the investment projects under a particular financial scheme.
Project Financing
About 70 percent of projects are financed through the Investment Projects with Deferred
Expenditure Registration (PIDIREGAS) scheme, while 5 percent are public works projects—
mainly hydroelectric and system maintenance projects—which are funded directly through
federal budget allocations (Figure 12).

        PIDIREGAS is a long-term financing scheme for infrastructure development used by the
Mexican government to supplement investments in the oil and electricity sector. It works on a
deferred financing schedule. To qualify for execution under PIDIREGAS, a project must
generate enough resources from the sale of goods and services to cover the incurred financial
obligations. Projects are paid with revenues generated during their operation and require the
signature of a long-term contract for energy sales (or associated good or service). Under the
scheme, the federal government assumes the investment risk since PEMEX or CFE sign the
contract as guarantee, while private investors recover their investment within an agreed time
frame.
        Federal guidelines for projects under the PIDIREGA scheme cover comprehensive
socioeconomic and financial-performance evaluations (Table 8). SENER’s methodology
establishes that externalities of local, regional, and global pollution should be used in the
socioeconomic evaluation, whose objective is to decide whether the project should take place.
The underlying concept is that the government can maximize social welfare by taking the overall
stream of costs and benefits into account, considering market values and externalities.

        The objective of the financial evaluation is to ensure that the project can generate enough
income to cover debt and payments. To demonstrate this payment capacity for each year of
operation, a special requirement covering both financial costs and capacity payments is included.
SENER’s methodology indicates that any financial instrument (i.e., either carbon credits or
taxes) should be considered in a project’s financial evaluation as revenue or expenses associated
with the particular technologies (Figure 13). Since Mexico has started applying carbon taxes to
some fossil fuels, these should be reflected in the cost of new projects.

Experience in Evaluating Emissions Externalities


To internalize externalities, new investment projects must submit as part of their evaluation
package a Study on Avoided Emissions. CFE’s Sub-directorate for Programming provides
annual data for all projects on expected displaced generation and resulting avoided or added
emissions. To estimate displaced generation, CFE runs its systems operation model twice—the
first time without the new generation project (i.e., reference case) and the second time with it.
       Defining avoided emissions is not a straightforward process since net total emissions
depends not only on the new technologies evaluated but also on the location of the power plant
and the resulting generation it could displace. For example, Mexico’s National Electricity
System covers five areas (Map 2), with diverse generation mixes and various transmission
interconnection capacities between regions. If a new project displaces generation originating
from an older conventional steam turbine powered by fuel oil, the displaced emissions will be
higher than if the new project were to displace hydro or combined cycle (CC) technologies. A
system-wide analysis to evaluate generation displaced by the new projects is appropriate, and is
the procedure already followed by CFE.

All projects follow the same procedure to estimate displaced energy, incremental energy, and
resulting avoided or added emissions. The next step is to estimate their value of externalities and
add this value to the total benefits normally considered in Mexico for the Cost Benefit Analysis.

CFE has included environmental externalities in the economic evaluation stage of some of the
projects presented for authorization to SHCP. We present four case studies showing how
investment decisions have been affected by including external costs. We use information
provided by SENER on recently evaluated projects. The case studies include geothermal, wind,
hydro and combined cycle technologies. For reasons of confidentiality, actual information from
these projects is scaled so that it is merely representative of any projects using similar
technologies in the areas where these projects were proposed. Annex D presents the details of
the calculation of displaced energy and the Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA) for each of the case
studies. Table 9 shows a summary of the main figures of the BCA.

The projects differ in total investment and benefits given their different size and the regions they
are located. Figure 14 shows a breakdown of the projects’ benefits. For all projects the main
benefit is a net reduction in production costs for the overall system. The reason is that all the
projects are displacing more expensive generation from old units. The second component of
benefits accrued to the projects is system security. System security is evaluated considering the
minimum reserve requirements to guarantee system reliability and security. It considers a
reserve margin to meet coincident peak demand and an operating reserve criterion for load
following purposes. These criteria are established for the different regions and give CFE the
portfolio of plants that would be optimal for the system expansion. The project accounts from
benefits for the amount of firm capacity contributed to reach these margins in a particular region.
In this case, the hydro project, given its size and firm power capacity, credits a big share of its
total benefits from this service, followed by the combined cycle project. In contrast, the wind
project has zero benefits in this category and the geothermal project only accrued 4% of its total
benefit from increased system security. Environmental benefits from reduced emissions
accounted for 18% of total benefits for the wind case study, 10% for geothermal, 7% for hydro
and 4% for the combined cycle project. It is important to highlight that without accounting for
environmental externalities the wind project would not have taken place.

We compare the four cases in terms of the total environmental benefits and emission reductions
per MW installed. The wind project reported the highest environmental benefits in dollars per
MW installed, followed by the geothermal project. The hydro project reported half of the
environmental benefits per MW installed than the wind project. The combined cycle project has
the lowest environmental benefit per MW (See Figure 15). It is important to highlight that the
overall ranking is dependent on the VoE considered for each of the impacts, which differs by
region. Some power plants are closer to highly populated areas, which increase the total health
costs. It is important to consider too that the cost associated with CO2 emissions was different for
the different projects. The reason for this difference in the price of CO2 is the fluctuating
behavior of the market of CO2, and the different assumptions that CFE and SHCP consider to
estimate the social cost of carbon at the time the project were evaluated6. Figures 19 and 20 show
the breakdown of the total emissions avoided per MW installed for each of the case studies. We
can see that even though the emissions reduced by the MW of the hydro plant are higher the total

for the combined cycle project the value was 8.5 $/ton CO 2.

The above is a standard formulation of the capacity expansion problem with the additions of
external costs to Variable Costs (Eq. 4), following SENER’s Methodology for internalizing
externalities. The model minimize total discounted value of system costs, Z, considering total
fixed costs in each period, FC(t), variable costs, VC(t), and capital costs, CC(t) (See Eq. 2). The
model decides the number of units to install, N, in each period t by technology type g. Total
variable costs, VC, include fuel costs, health externalities and CO2 externalities (See Eq.4).
Capital costs consider a Capital Recovery Factor, CRF (See Eq. 5). The usual balance
constraint, that supply needs to meet demand each block load d and period p, is imposed.
Following SENER’s electricity demand growth estimate, we consider demand grows at a rate of
3.4% per year, k, (See Eq. 8). Total system capacity, including conventional and renewable units,
must be greater than power demanded each load block, d (See Eq. 6 and 7). Emissions from each
of the pollutants are estimated using emissions factors (See Eq. 10).

We run 2 scenarios: baseline (no externalities) and policy scenario with externalities. Following
we present the main results for each scenario and highlight key implications for Mex ico’s policy.
Finally, we run two sensitivity scenarios to the externalities price and to different renewable
energy potential.

Sensitivity analysis to renewables learning rates and to the discount rate


We investigate the sensitivity to critical parameters in the investment decision. First, one
important component determining the policy impact has to do with the cost of renewable energy
technologies considered. In our baseline scenario, we consider the costs for capital investment
for wind and solar of 1866 and 2985 $/kW, as used by CFE for planning purposes. However, it
is well known that costs for renewables have been decreasing over the last years, with important
cost reductions achieved as global installed capacity increases. We introduce an exogenous
decreasing trend for capital cost reductions for wind and solar. We use two scenarios for the
learning curves of renewables. First, we consider a conservative estimate following the World
Energy Outlook modeling assumptions that considers that future learning rates for the period
between 2010 to 2035 of 5% for geothermal, 5% for wind onshore, and 17% for solar PV at large
scale. We also use a more optimistic scenario for cost reductions of renewables, following the
estimates of the International Energy Agency (IEA) Technology Roadmaps (IEA, 2013 and
2010). In the case of on-shore wind, the IEA considers that capital costs could decrease 25% by
2050. For solar utility scale photovoltaic systems, the IEA expects that large-scale utility system
prices can drop to $1800/ kW by 2020 and $800/kW by 2050. These estimates consider high
investments on research and development, a working assumption of the policy scenarios of the
technology roadmaps. To explore illustrative results of these trends, we impose exogenously a
decreasing cost of capital for the renewable energy technologies to match these targets.


                                                        58
Also, we conducted sensitivity to the discount rate. A 12% discount rate is high and penalizes
capital-intensive technologies. We use a 7% discount rate instead, as a reference number
typically used for renewable energy public investment projects in the US. We found that the
carbon and health externalities values needed to trigger changes in the investment decision
decreases significantly in all the scenarios, considering both learning and lower discount rate,
particularly on the high learning curve scenario. However, the carbon and health externalities at
the value currently consider by the Mexican government were not enough to change the
investment decisions.
We analyze the combination of externalities and a 35% renewable portfolio + externalities and
found, as expected, that considering future technology cost reductions and lower discount rates
significantly reduce the policy cost. Figure 30 shows the difference in costs from the renewable
portfolio standard policy, with high discount rate and no technological learning, and the
sensitivity analysis with lower discount rate and cost reduction estimates. This policy simulation
also outperformed the cap and higher externalities case, adding to the importance of considering
future technology trends and lower discount rates. Interestingly, we find that capital cost
reductions in the upper range of years of the evaluating period did not decrease the costs of the
program as much.

Summary Remarks
In this chapter we laid out the new process to internalize externalities in project valuation, and
we analyze Mexico’s experience using four case studies. Adding externalities was beneficial for
the new power plant investment projects. In particular, we found that accounting for
externalities can promote investment in renewable energy projects that would have otherwise not
taken place. By developing two models to analyze the dispatch and capacity expansion decisions
under the new policy, we found out that a) adding externalities affect the short-term dispatch
decision switching generation from critical to non-critical areas and b) accounting for

Chapter 5. Conclusion

The main objective of this paper was to evaluate the impact of the new methodology to
internalize environmental externalities in Mexico. Also, throughout this study we had two sub-
objectives: find barriers that prevent the methodology to be implemented and identify areas of
improvement of the methodology. To conclude, we present conclusions and recommendations.


Evaluation of the methodology


This study shows that the methodology published by SENER on December of 2012 to include
local, regional and global pollution can be implemented in Mexico. We show that Mexico has
already experience using externalities in the evaluation of investment projects, and that this
method has proven useful in incentivizing investment in cleaner technologies. While these
actions show the determination of the country to incorporate externalities in decision-making,
critical steps remain for the internalization of externalities in the economic dispatch and in the
long-term planning of the system, as established by SENER’s methodology.
In this study we show that the methodology can be applied in the economic dispatch and capacity
expansion decisions, and that its implementation could change the selection of units operating
and technologies to invest in. While some approximations were needed, we believe enough
information has been developed in the country to move forward with the implementation of this
methodology. As shown in the four cases examined and on the modeling results, the costs of
electricity generation rise and therefore further discussion of how to account for these new costs
is needed in Mexico.
If Mexico moves forward with this implementation, it could set an example of how big state-own
enterprises could use sound methodologies to incorporate environmental costs in their
investment decisions, as well as sending market signals regarding the value of clean technologies
for their partners in the private sector, the independent power producers. Many developing
countries rely in this type of companies to deliver their electricity, with different schemes of
private participation, and therefore, this innovative legislation in a developing country the size of
Mexico could provide a real world example of the benefits and challenges of such a policy.
While having an economy-wide carbon tax or trading scheme for the overall economy would be
preferable, this approach is a promising policy to internalize environmental costs in power
generation.

Barriers that prevent implementation
Promoting investment in clean technologies including renewable sources of energy and carbon-
reducing technologies is everything but a simple methodological exercise. It has much more to
do with policies and regulation driving the financing of the extra investments needed to secure
the environment benefits / mitigate externalities. To internalize externalities, stimulating an
active dialogue among the stakeholders seems as important as ensuring quality methodological
work. For this reason, the main barriers of implementation identified in this exercise are in the
arena of stakeholders’ interaction and ensuring adequate financing of incremental costs. As
highlighted in the document new responsibilities for different stakeholders arise for the
implementation of this methodology, and adequate stakeholders interaction is needed to prevent
barriers halting implementation. The complexities involved in the implementation along with the
multiple agencies that need to be involved in the application of the methodology can constitute
administrative barriers slowing down the policy process. Some of the concerns expressed by
government officials and the public during the consultancy process include:
   1. Stakeholders disclose concerns regarding the overall impact that this policy could have in
      electricity tariffs, which was not a topic addressed in SENER’s methodology.
   2. CFE needs to include the VoE in the investment projects presented for approval to
      SENER and SHCP. As shown in this analysis, the incorporation of these values could
      accelerate the replacement of inefficient equipment using fuel oil, and coal, potentially
      affecting CFE finances that owns and operates directly this infrastructure.
   3. SHCP and SENER need to align long-term planning and investment projects evaluation
      in order to make sure that they are in consent, as differences could result in suboptimal
      decisions, in this case particularly as it refers to environmental costs.
   4. SEMARNAT needs continuous assistance to provide updated values for the costs of
      externalities from different technologies for electricity generation. The methodology
      established by SENER requires updated analysis every 3 years. This is a critical step for
      implementation, and the values estimated will evidently determine the overall impact of
      the policy. For this reason, SEMARNAT will need resources to build capacity on this
      matter. The time needed to update these values and the uncertainties around the
      estimates were mentioned as potential barriers.




                                               62
Recommendations and areas of improvement of the methodology
A detailed description of areas of improvement of the methodology to estimate the VoE is
presented in each of the method steps in Appendix C and in the previous report (World Bank
2009). Here we highlight the ones we consider could have the more dramatic impact and
therefore should have special attention during the implementation and future actions:
a) Define a work plan for improving externalities valuation and publish official Guidelines
This work plan could include the development of guidelines for each of the different steps of the
methodology, stating in each one, the models and information that should be used for regulatory
purposes. The variety of methods to estimate externalities could lead to different results and
therefore it is important to standardized and set transparent guidelines so that the authorities and
the power producers know what are the models and methods to be applied in the process. This
could include the elaboration of a special Guidance on Treatment of the Economic Value of a
Statistical Life, a Guidance on the Use of the Social Cost of Carbon and the definition of
regulatory models to be used for pollution dispersion.
For example, in the US, the Office of Management and Budget has primary responsibility for
coordinating and reviewing regulatory analyses across federal agencies and sets guidelines for
conducting cost-benefit analysis including non-market values. Different agencies follow these
guidelines and further define the values needed in their regulations. For instance, the US
Environmental Protection Agency set guidelines and define the regulatory models to be used in
preparing economic analysis of environmental regulations and policies. These procedures are
published as official documents and are available to the public online. Models to be used for air
pollutants dispersion are made available online as well. This favors transparency and allows
anyone interested in overviewing the process to have an accurate way to understand/reproduce
the analysis. This work will favor not only the process of internalizing externalities in the
electric sector, but also the comparison between different investment options in environmental
protection and climate change mitigation. It also serves the purpose of facilitating further
development and improvement of methods by the academic community. In Mexico, the SHCP
could provide this executive guidance, and SEMARNAT and SENER could further define in
their respective areas values to assess environmental costs, publish the guidelines and
procedures, and update them as information becomes available.
b) Cost of Carbon
The methodology mandates SEMARNAT to annually send to SENER a proposal of CO2 prices
to use. Therefore, SEMARNAT needs to evaluate approaches to estimate the social cost of
carbon and evaluate trade-offs. SENER however establishes that this analysis should be based
on regional or international markets. We believe this could harm the application of the
methodology, since current prices in the carbon market do not reflect the real social cost of
carbon. For this reason, we recommend to establish a shadow price that could serve the purpose

                                                63
of valuing carbon more reasonably. In previous studies of the World Bank a value of $23
usd/ton of CO2 has been used. For the financial evaluation of the projects, a market value is
adequate, but not for the socio-economic evaluation or system planning. As discussed in
Chapter 3, recent studies have updated the value of the social cost of carbon in the US used for
policy analysis to $39 dollars per metric ton of CO2 (using a 3% discount rate) and the
international literature as assessed by the IPCC Third Assessment Report shows a range for the
implicit price of carbon from 5 to 65 US$/tCO2eq in 2030 and 15 to130 US$/tCO2eq in 2050.


c) Improve the valuation of health outcomes:
        Several recommendations were derived on this specific issue, since health outcomes
constitute the main component of external costs. Currently, health externalities in Mexico fall
into the low range of externalities found in developing countries. The measures to improve this
valuation could include:
      Conduct more studies with different methodologies to estimate the Value of Statistical
       Life (VSL) in Mexico, including WTP studies.           The external costs are typically
       dominated by costs associated to mortality and therefore the approach to value chronic
       mortality is a key number in the valuation. Currently, there is only one study in Mexico
       with an estimate of US$235,000 a value much smaller than corresponding estimates for
       higher-income countries, which are in the range of US$4-9 million. In the US, for
       instance, several studies are used to recommend a figure for regulatory purposes (the
       USEPA recommends a central estimate of $7.4 million ($2006) for all regulatory analysis
       of environmental regulation).
      Conduct a valuation study of medical health costs in different levels of service in
       Mexican institutions, this will allow to better capture de costs of morbidity in different
       areas of the country
      The Unit of Economic Analysis of the Ministry of Health in Mexico, recommended the
       following regarding the use of health and population statistics:
           o Use of the new information systems for incidence data. Considering that these
             systems capture only the public sector hospitals, and therefore could be
             underestimating the total cases they also recommended the use of different
             statistics and weighting other institutions for a better approximation (Hospitals of
             Health Assistance (SSA), Hospitals for the workers of the public sector (ISSTE),
             private hospitals, etc.)
           o To value productivity loss, they recommend the use of the value for lost salaries
             of the Circular from the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) instead of
             the Household National Income and Expenditure Survey’s minimum wage. The

                                               64
               use of the minimum wage currently used by SEMARNAT will undervalue the
               total impact
           o Use the codes of the Ministry of Health system (CIE 2008) to be precise on the
             diseases that are reported, as well as on the incidence rates
           o For population, use CONAPO mortality statistics since it is important to smooth
             the curves used, a treatment INEGI data does not have
           o Consider the use of the World Bank Methodology (World Bank Group, 2006), for
             risks factor and Burden of Disease Framework, which is used by the Health
             Ministry to evaluate health policies impact


d) Clarification of the definition of externalities to be considered:
Different definitions of externalities in the Mexican Laws (LGCC, LAERFTE and LSPEE) are
used, which could be misleading in the implementation process. For example, sometimes the
Laws refer only to environmental impacts, and sometimes they require the internalization of
social and cultural externalities as well. Clarifying the definitions and scope is important. It is
recommended to prioritize the externalities and include in the working plan for valuation
different phases so that information can be use as studies to value other impacts become
available (but do not prevent the use of available information on already valued impacts). In the
future, other externalities other than human health impacts could be included. In particular,
damages to sensitive ecosystems or relevant resources to local communities (fisheries, tourism,
etc.)


e) Valuation of Ozone.
Estimating the value of external costs of generation associated with ozone has not been done and
could be an important reference for the VoE, particularly given that the expansion of the electric
system is mainly driven by the use of natural gas which NOX emissions (ozone precursor) are
important (more important than SO2 or PM, the main health problem for fuel oil or coal power
generation)
f) Discount rate, technological learning and indexing the externalities
As shown in our modeling exercise, using a lower discount rate and considering expected
technological learning from renewables is critical to reduce policy costs. Also, SENER’s
methodology indicates that the externality studies need to be conducted every two years. In
addition to updating the studies, for planning purposes, we recommend to allow external costs to
follow a growing pattern following at least the inflation rate. Otherwise, our modeling results
show that the costs of externalities being flat contribute less and less in the long-term capacity

                                                 65
expansion problem. In practice, the values should reflect the welfare losses which would
increase both as the economy increases and also as income increases (it is well documented that
as income increases the willingness to pay for environmental quality increases).
g) Valuation of other environmental externalities
We recommend conducting studies that can inform on the external costs of other technologies,
including hydropower and other renewables. Some of this external costs studies will need to
develop frameworks to value ecosystem services. For this, we recommend building on the
Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services project (WAVES) an initiative
supported by the World Bank to enhance green accounting and considering the value of the
environment in policy design. In particular, the methodologies used to value biodiversity losses
and disruption/loss of natural ecosystems can be useful to develop cases for impacts of energy
infrastructure projects in Mexico.
h) Valuation of Energy Security
While Mexico emphasizes the need to include energy security constraints in energy planning,
there are no methodologies to incorporate this important consideration. Incorporating
externalities to diversify the energy matrix of the country can contribute to energy security, and
therefore some methodologies could be developed to consider this important relationship.
i) Standardization of emissions calculation and use of information technology to have an open
dataset of emissions
The goal of this standardization should be to have an annual update of the emissions inventory to
use in this exercise available to all stakeholders, preferable online and accessible timely for the
implementation. In the methodology published, there are several steps dedicated to information
flow. We recommend having a practical approach of how these emissions should be computed
and using methods that will allow comparability within years and technologies, as well as,
opportune data. Using information from the COAs in this regard could add unnecessary time
constraints. In addition, since these emissions will have a value, it is important that all power
plants and stakeholders have access to the numbers use for transparency purposes. For this, an
open online dataset could be built.Also we recommend having guidelines for estimating NO x
emissions that do not use the “maximum” limit established in the bidding or tender process or the
standard NOM-085 environmental maximum limit. As explained, this could be imprecise and
make the valuation process incomparable between different bidding processes and/or send
incorrect signals to minimize NOX emissions. Given that the system expansion is planned with
natural gas technologies, correctly assessing the impact of NOx should be prioritize.




                                                66
j) Private sector participation
After Energy Reform in Mexico, and the expected increased participation of the private sector in
electricity markets, we recommend to clarify how this methodology will apply to new private
generators. While there is a mention of IPPs in the methodology published, it is not clear what
adjustments should be made to consider the emissions of all electricity generators.
k) Conducting uncertainty analysis to the costs of externalities
Given the uncertainty ranges reported in the valuation studies for health impacts and the size of
the ranges reported in the literature for the social cost of carbon, conducting uncertainty analysis
in the application of this policy is recommended. In particular, using models for decision
making under uncertainty could be useful such as stochastic. In the case of carbon prices,
sensitivity analysis could be useful as well, considering different levels of carbon prices
corresponding to different discount rates.
l) Building capacity for model building and maintenance.
 As explained in chapter 3 and 4, several models are required and some of the models used in
Mexico could be improved. A research program and technical assistance to gradually improve
the estimates of externalities is a desirable next step to improve the methodology. Both models
for estimate pollution dispersion and models to value costs should be built, parameterized to the
conditions in Mexico, and maintain so that the data and assumptions represent as accurately as
possible local conditions.
m) Aligning environmental regulation and economic instruments
Finally, it is recommended that the application of environmental externalities be aligned to the
overall environmental regulatory framework applied to the sector. For instance, the sector has to
comply with several command-and-control instruments such as: emissions standards,
environmental impact assessment, and local air quality programs. In addition, other programs
such as the Special Program on Climate Change and the Special Program on Renewable Energy
could require specific emissions reductions/technology adoption from the sector. While this has
not yet been discussed in the context of the application of the externalities methodology in
Mexico, it is recommended to align instruments so that they work together, reinforce each other
and do not impose excess burden on the power sector. As shown in Chapter 3, the combination
of policies is critical to incentivize investment in clean technologies.
       In sum, this study showed that SENER’s methodology could be applied, and accelerate
adoption of cleaner technologies. It identifies potential barriers of implementation, areas of
improvement of the methodology, and derived recommendations to move forward with the
policy implementation. The study is timely also because it responds to the objectives of the
National Energy Strategy 2013-2027, which was recently published by the Federal Government
of Mexico.

Annex A. Method to Value Externalities for Mexico’s
Electricity Generation



1.        Scope and Objectives
  1.1. This document establishes the methodology that the electricity Supplier should follow to value the
       externalities associated with electricity generation in Mexico that impact the economy, society,
       the environment, and health, considering the different technologies and energy sources.
  1.2. The Supplier for this Methodology refers to Article 2, section XVI of the Code of Regulations of
       the Electricity Public Service Law (LSPEE).
  1.3. The Ministry of Energy developed this Methodology based on Article 10 of the Law for
       Harnessing Renewable Energy and Financing the Energy Transition (LAERFTE), Article 16 of
       the LSPEE, and Articles 32 and 34 of the General Law on Climate Change (LGCC) in order to
       accomplish the objective of valuing the externalities associated with electricity generation, by
       using various energy sources at different scales in the system.
  1.4. The valuation of environmental and social externalities associated with electricity generation
       included in this Methodology will allow for evaluating their impact on the development plans of
       electricity generation projects, which will impact the expansion plans of the system and the short-
       run economic dispatch of the power plants.
  1.5. To implement this Methodology, consideration should only be given to the positive and negative
       impacts that can be estimated through proven and accepted methods based on technical,
       economic, and environmental criteria and whose values differ significantly from zero. In
       accordance with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), health and climate
       change are the only impacts covered by these criteria. However, the application of this
       Methodology does not prevent consideration of other impacts that could be estimated with these
       criteria in the future.
2.        Definitions
  2.1. Displaced energy. Energy that will be substituted by the new generation project under
       consideration. The Supplier shall indicate the distribution of locally or regionally displaced
       energy.
     2.2. Electricity for public-service use. Energy derived from Supplier-owned power plants,
          independent power producers, or imports from the Supplier through long-term contracts.
          Generally, this energy includes all generation sources considered in the Electricity Sector
          Infrastructure Investment Program (POISE). Exceptions to this definition are the occasional
          Supplier purchases of energy from auto-generators, co-generators, small producers, importers,
          and electric utilities in other countries.
  2.3. Incremental energy. The energy generated by the new project under consideration.
  2.4. Externalities. The positive or negative short-, medium-, and long-term impacts, whether actual or
       potential, associated with electricity generation caused by the provision of a local, regional, or
       global good or service on a third party in Mexico. Externalities occur when the cost paid for a
       good or service differs from the total costs of damages or benefits in economic terms.
  2.5. Environmental and social externalities. These externalities are those associated with electricity
       generation with positive or negative environmental and social impacts, generated from the
       production or consumption of a good or service for which there is no compensation or payment of
       costs or benefits from the good or service. Externalities that manifest environmental, social, or
       health impacts are not excluded.
  2.6. Electricity Emissions Inventory. A study conducted by the Supplier, based on yearly operational
       parameters, including the fuels used by its power plants, independent power producers (IPPs), and
       small producers, that shows the emissions of pollutants associated with the various fuels used to
       meet the demand for electricity for public-service use. The inventory should include emissions
       from hydropower, geothermal, and other non-fossil fuel energy sources. In addition, the
       inventory should include the emissions of other operators when such information is available.
  2.7. Financial instruments associated with the emissions of pollutants. The mechanisms that allow an
       entity to receive an income or pay a financial cost as a result of the emissions of pollutants or
       actions to reduce those emissions. These refer to carbon certificates, which create a financial
       income, or a carbon tax promulgated by law, which could generate a financial cost. The financial
       costs of these instruments could differ from the value of the impacts created by the produced or
       prevented pollution associated with the financial instruments.
  2.8. Methodology. Valuing Externalities Associated with Electricity Generation in Mexico.
  2.9. MWh. Megawatt hour.
  2.10. System. National Electricity System.
  2.11. Supplier. Federal Commission for Electricity (CFE), as referred to in Article 2, section XVI of
        the LSPEE Code of Regulations.
     2.12. Pollutants. Nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; total suspended particulates (TSP); and greenhouse
           gases (GHGs), which include carbon dioxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and sulfur
           hexafluoride.
3.        Data Estimation for the Methodology
     3.1. The methodology requires the following data:
                                                     69
     3.2. To quantify pollutant emissions from the various technologies considered in electricity system
          planning, the Supplier will annually include the quantity of pollutant emissions per megawatt
          hour for each technology in the COPAR document, “Reference Costs and Parameters for the
          Formulation of Investment Projects in the Electricity Sector.” These numbers will be estimated,
          considering the emissions inventory of the electricity-sector power plants operated during the
          previous year. For technologies not in use in the country, the Supplier should use the numbers
          provided by the equipment manufacturer or those recognized by international or national
          institutions as the reference values.
     3.3. For pollutant impact valuation, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources
          (SEMARNAT), in coordination with the Ministry of Energy (SENER) and other responsible
          federal agencies, will develop studies to measure the local and/or regional short-, medium-, and
          long-term impacts (in pesos per ton of emissions) associated with electricity generation on
          Mexico’s economy, society, environment, and health. These studies should emphasize the
          valuation of environmental and social impacts, using official information sources, and should be
          updated at least every three years.
     3.4. For the valuation of financial instruments associated with pollutant emissions, SEMARNAT will
          send a document to SENER with the expected short-, medium-, and long-term mitigation values,
          based on regional or international markets where Mexico’s electricity projects are eligible or the
          fiscal regimes in which they are applied. This study should be updated annually.
     3.5. The Supplier will develop the Electricity Emissions Inventory based on the annual operational
          parameters and fuels used for generating electricity for public-service use.
     3.6. For projects operated by IPPs, SENER will obtain the emissions from the annual operational
          reports that they present to SEMARNAT.
4.        Supplier Application of the Methodology
  4.1. Electricity Sector Planning
          4.1.1. The POISE shall incorporate the Environmental and Social Externalities according to
                 Article 36bis of the LSPEE and Article 34 of the LGCC.
          4.1.2. For the new power plants, the Supplier shall use the unitary values in tons per megawatt
                 hour for each pollutant and technology. In addition, the Supplier shall use the values of
                 the Electricity Emissions Inventory for operational power plants.
          4.1.3. SEMARNAT shall give the supplier, through SENER, the unit values of the
                 environmental and social impacts per region and the unit values of the financial
                 instruments associated with pollutant emissions in pesos per ton of pollutant. Those
                 values will result from the studies that SEMARNAT shall coordinate for this purpose. In
                 cases where no values are available, the Supplier will present a proposal to SENER to
                 resolve them.

                                                      70
     4.1.4. The Supplier will compute the environmental and social externality per unit of pollutant as
            a proportion of the environmental and social impacts that are not currently compensated or
            redistributed.
     4.1.5. For each pollutant, the Supplier shall multiply the unit values from section 3.2 (in tons per
            megawatt hour) by the unit values of the environmental and social externality from section
            3.3 (in pesos per ton), the result of which shall be added to the variable costs of generation
            for each technology and fuel for the elaboration of POISE.
4.2. Dispatch of Electricity-Sector Units for Public Service Use
     4.2.1. The environmental and social externalities shall be incorporated into the dispatch of the
            electricity-sector units that will be used as a variable cost excluding the externalities that
            are not a function of the total energy generated (for example, the emissions caused by the
            reservoirs of hydroelectric plants).
     4.2.2. The Supplier will use the unitary values of the Electricity Emissions Inventory in tons per
            megawatt hour for each pollutant and power plant in operation. In the case of new power
            plants, the Supplier will use the reference values of COPAR for each particular case.
     4.2.3. SEMARNAT shall give the Supplier, through SENER, the unit values of the
            environmental and social impacts per region and those of the financial instruments
            associated with pollutant emissions in pesos per ton of pollutant. Those values will result
            from the studies that SEMARNAT shall coordinate for this purpose. In cases where no
            values are available, the Supplier will present a proposal to SENER to resolve them.
     4.2.4. The Supplier will compute the environmental and social externality, per unit of pollutant,
            as a proportion of the environmental and social impacts that are not currently compensated
            or redistributed.
     4.2.5. For each pollutant, the Supplier shall multiply the unit values from section 3.2 (in tons per
            megawatt hour) by the unit values of the environmental and social externality from section
            3.3 (in pesos per ton), the result of which shall be added to the variable costs of
            generation. The result should be the total variable cost used in the assignment and
            dispatch of units. As a result, the short-term total cost will include the environmental and
            social externalities.
     4.2.6. According to Article 36bis of LSPEE (definition of economic dispatch) and Article 34,
            section Id of LGCC (selection of electricity generation sources), the Supplier shall use the
            least cost electricity, considering its associated environmental and social externalities, and
            it should provide optimal stability, quality, and security.
 4.3. Cost-Benefit Analysis of Investment Projects for Electricity Generation
     4.3.1. The environmental and social externalities shall be incorporated into the socio-economic
            evaluation of the program or investment projects considered by the Supplier.
                                                  71
       4.3.2. In the socioeconomic evaluation, the following aspects shall be included:
                  •   The quantification and valuation of environmental and social externalities
                      associated with electricity generation, with local, regional, and global impact
                      caused by the program or project in the short, medium, and long term.
                  •   The quantification of the benefits or costs of environmental and social externalities
                      associated with electricity generation by the new program or investment project
                      shall be calculated as the difference in energy displaced (situation without the
                      project) and incremental energy (situation with the project) for each environmental
                      and social externality.
                  •   For the valuation of those impacts, the values per ton of pollutant, defined in
                      sections 3.3. and 3.4 of this Methodology, shall be considered.
                  •   For income derived from carbon markets (foreign currency coming into the
                      country), the quantification of greenhouse gases shall be done according to the
                      additionality principle established by the Kyoto Protocol or in any other specific
                      International Agreement. The price per ton of carbon shall be quantified
                      accordingly to section 3.4 of this Methodology.
       4.3.3. In the financial evaluation, the additional revenue derived from reduction in greenhouse
              gas emissions shall be considered in agreement with the Kyoto Protocol or any other
              specific International Agreement. The price per ton of carbon avoided shall be quantified
              as specified in section 3.4 of this Methodology.
5.     Application of the Methodology for the IPP
  5.1. Each year, SENER will request from SEMARNAT information on pollutant emissions for each
       IPP with projects in operation, as specified in section 3.6. This information shall be sent to the
       Supplier for incorporation into the Electricity Emissions Inventory.

Annex C. Modeling Framework and Methodology

While the theoretical grounding of externalities valuation is mainly in the field of welfare economics
and the theory of externalities, input information is also required from other fields in order to assess
environmental costs and benefits. For example, valuation of externalities (VoE) requires input data from
point sources (e.g., emissions inventories and flow characteristics), modeling of pollutant dispersion,
health and environmental risk evaluation, and economic valuation. To make these assessments,
integrated models are commonly used; these models use interdisciplinary approaches based on
knowledge of (i) the physical processes that generate and disperse pollutants and (ii) economics for
providing policy makers information.
Economic Modeling
The economic model for analyzing the problem can be traced back to the classic model of Baumol and
Oates, which maximizes consumer utility in the presence of an externality (Muller and Mendelsohn
2007). In this model, the utility function depends on the good demanded and the disutility of pollution.
Firms (K) produce goods and emit pollutants (e). The emissions are dispersed in the environment and
reach consumers (J). Emissions from firm k results in a concentration (zjk) to which consumer j is
exposed.
       We wish to solve the problem such that making one consumer better off does not make any other
worse off. This is expressed as follows:
                                          max (        1   ,   2   ,   3   ,...,    , )
                                             *

                                              . . ( , )£0                    ( = 1,..., ),

                                                 å         £å                ( = 1,..., ),        [1]
                                                 =1            =1

                                                      ³ 0,          ³ 0,           ³ 0 "( , , )
                                                   ³                         ( ¹ *)

where U(X,z) is the utility function of individual j, zj is total exposure to pollution of consumer j (sum of
all concentrations generated by emissions from all firms [sum of k = 1 to K]),8 xij is the amount of good
(i) consumed by individual j, Fk(Y,ek) is the production function of firm k, yik is the amount of good (i)
                                                                                       -
produced/used by firm k, ek is emissions of pollutant e released by firm k, and is the initial level of
utility of all other consumers.


8
    For each consumer, the disutility or damage is the result of aggregate exposure to pollution, regardless of the source ( k).
       The Lagrangian is expressed by the following equation:

                   -                    æ          ö
       = ål ( -        ) - åm           çå
                                   + åv ç      -å ÷÷
                                                                                 [2]
          =1              =1         =1 è =1    =1 ø
The Langrarian multipliers are , , and .

Therefore, differentiating with respect to ek, the optimization conditions are as follows:


       ¶      æ ¶ öæ ¶ ö æ ¶ ö                                                   [3]
         = åç l   ÷ç ÷ - çm  ÷
       ¶   =1
              è ¶ øè ¶ ø è ¶ ø

        Marginal damage (first right-hand term) is the sum across all consumers in society (J) because it
is a public good due to an emission of ek. As Muller and Mendelsohn (2007) point out, although the
economic model sums for all consumers, spatial differentiation will be important because the
concentration decreases rapidly with distance from the source and because consumers care only about
total concentration, regardless of the original emitting source. Marginal cost (second right-hand term)
shows the resources needed to reduce one unit of e, given the market output of firm k. The optimal
condition equates marginal costs to marginal damages; the condition shows the efficiency criterion for
society, considering the externalities of pollution.
       As described by Muller and Mendelsohn (2007), modeling of multiple pollutants requires an
extension of the Baumol and Oates model that not only requires summing for different pollutants but
also demands a more complex treatment of the synergies and chemical transformation of the pollutants
once released into the environment. We consider that consumers are exposed to a list of pollutants el (l
= 1,…, L) that differ from the original list of emissions (M) generated by firms. In this case, a single
emission can result in increased concentrations of several pollutants (zlj). The marginal damages are
expressed at follows:
                                             æ ¶ öæ ¶     ö
                               (   ) = ååç l     ÷ç       ÷                    [4]
                                       =1 =1 è ¶ øè¶      ø

       Information on the treatment of secondary pollutants will be detailed in the dispersion analysis.
From an economic perspective, it is important to highlight these complexities, which can change the
optimal emission levels of pollutants with higher associated risks, as both primary and as secondary
species.
Integrated Assessment Modeling
As shown above, externalities are a function of a number of variables, including emissions level,
resulting concentrations (in a spatial basis), population distribution, and disutility assigned to the

                                                     77
damages. Valuation of external costs thus requires information on the physical nature of air pollution,
health impacts, and social value assigned to the damages.
        The United States and Europe have used integrated assessment modeling to evaluate air-
pollution damages for decades. For example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) used such techniques to conduct cost-benefit analyses to amend such environmental policies as
the Clean Air Act of 1990 (EPA 1999). The ExternE project, the more comprehensive evaluation of
energy externalities in the European Union (European Commission 2005), has estimated the external
costs of electricity across a broad range of technologies for various country cases.9 The main results,
involving multi-year efforts of several European scientific research centers, show that energy
externalities (per kilowatt hour) are 2–10¢ for coal; 5–11¢ for oil; 2–5¢ for biomass; and less than 1¢ for
hydro, PV, and wind.
       Ongoing efforts to improve the integrated assessment method and policy applications include the
AirClim project (Alcamo et al. 2002), which analyzes linkages between air pollution and climate change
in Europe; the RAINS project for acid-rain control (Schöpp et al. 2005); the Integrated Assessment for
Fine Particles in Europe, conducted by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)
(Amann et al. 2001); and local-scale development and application of the OSCAR Air Quality Modeling
System (Sokhi et al. 2008). Relevant studies in China and Cuba ratify the need to evaluate externalities
in the developing world, showing that the impacts of air pollution are a serious concern with a high
social-welfare cost (Jiang et al. 2008; Wei et al. 2009; Aden and Sinton 2006; Turtós Carbonell et al.
2007).

Methodology Steps


Characterization of the Emissions Source
To characterize the emissions source, data must be compiled on the location of the point source,
emissions inventory, stacks dimensions, and emissions parameters (e.g., temperature and velocity of the
pollutant flow). Locating the point source involves using a Geographic Information System (GIS),10 as
well as establishing whether the source is urban or rural (population density within 50 km of the source
is a commonly used criterion). Establishing the urban or rural source is also important for dispersion
modeling since cities have a potential heat-island effect and because some dispersion models work better
in rural areas, where infrastructure friction is less of an issue.
       The approaches for analyzing emissions inventories are generally classified as top-down or
bottom-up.iv A top-down approach uses sectoral data to estimate emissions based on emissions factors
that consider fuel characteristics, while a bottom-up approach uses a detailed analysis of current

   Figures of the ExternE project’s national implementation phase and the damages a ssessed are available online
(http://www.externe.info/).

   GIS was used to process the information.
                                                      78
technology and flow measurements at each emissions point. Clearly, the latter approach provides a
more thorough analysis, yet requires information from each unit and process at a level not always
available. Thus, depending on the information provided by each power plant, the emissions inventory
represents more or less accurately the annual flow of pollutants. For example, available technology
allows for instantaneous emissions tracking using continuous emissions monitoring (CEM) equipment,
which reports hourly on the pollutant concentrations and quantities emitted. With the help of
information technology, such systems can report facilities’ emissions at each point in time. This
technology has been widely used in the U.S. since it was first required under Title IV of the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990, which established the market-based Acid Rain Program.v To date, power
plants in Mexico have not used CEM, and inventories are usually done using top-down approaches;
more recently, however, CFE and SEMARNAT have been working jointly to improve and combine
methods.
        Emissions-inventory techniques have important implications for valuing externalities since
emissions constitute the main input for estimating damage. However, the uncertainties of various
techniques are well understood and key parameters are known (e.g., measurement of content of S). In
this study, available inventories are generally fine for estimating total damage since externalities are
calculated yearly using an annual estimate. Emissions considered in the damage-cost function include
sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), and sulfate and
nitrogen aerosols.
Dispersion Analysis
Atmospheric dispersion modeling, the mathematical simulation of how air pollutants disperse in the
ambient atmosphere, is used to predict the downwind concentration of air pollutants emitted from such
sources as industrial plants and vehicular traffic. Clearly, the real trajectory that pollutants follow is a
function of complex processes and specific conditions at the moment of emission. Thus, models have an
explanatory power, but cannot be expected to reproduce exactly all of the factors affecting
concentrations.
        One should keep in mind that model estimates and actual concentrations may differ. At the same
time, models do a good job of estimating the direction and potential level of pollution, which is why
they are widely used globally to set regulatory emissions-control strategies. In terms of evaluating
externalities, concentration estimates allow for assessing the potential impacts of a source, given its
location and meteorological conditions.
        The most common dispersion model follows the Gaussian dispersion equation, which assumes
that the pollutant has a normal probability distribution. Gaussian models are most often used to predict
the dispersion of continuous, buoyant air-pollution plumes. They may also be used to predict the
dispersion of non-continuous air-pollution plumes, known as “puff models.” The general Gaussian
equation is expressed as follows (Barratt 2001):


                                                    79
                                                                         [1]

where C is the concentration of emissions in grams per cubic meter (g per m3) at any receptor, Q is the
source pollutant emission rate, in grams per second (g per s); u is the horizontal wind velocity along the
plume centerline, in meters per second (m per s); f is the crosswind dispersion parameter; σy is the
horizontal standard deviation of the emission distribution, in meters (m); σz is the vertical standard
deviation of the emission distribution, in meters (m); and g is the vertical dispersion parameter, where g1
is the vertical dispersion with no reflections, g2 is the vertical dispersion for reflection from the ground,
and g3 is the vertical dispersion for reflection from an inversion aloft.
         Gaussian models reproduce with high certainty the dispersion of pollutants within the local
domain of the emissions source. Regional dispersion in the 50–1,000 km range is better reproduced
using models that incorporate the transport of pollutants and their transformation into secondary
pollutants in the atmosphere (Jacobson 1999). Regional dispersion models have two distinct types of
flow-field specifications: Lagrangian and Eulerian. The Lagrangian dispersion model, which
mathematically follows pollution-plume parcels as they move in the atmosphere, models the motion of
the parcels as a random walk process. It then calculates the air pollution dispersion by computing the
statistics of the trajectories of a large number of the pollution-plume parcels. The model uses a moving
frame of reference as the parcels move from their initial location. The Eulerian model focuses on
specific locations in the space through which the fluid flows. Like the Lagrangian model, it tracks the
movement of a large number of pollution-plume parcels as they move from their initial location;
however, its frame of references is a fixed three-dimensional Cartesian grid (Barratt 2001).
        The Lagrangian equations combine the principles of conservation of momentum with
conservation of energy. One might think of the main Lagrangian equation in the following general
terms. In the model’s specifications, all fluid parcels are defined by a vector field a, with a time-
independent for each fluid parcel. Often, a is chosen as the position of the parcels at some initial time t0.
In the Lagrangian description, the flow velocity v(a,t) is related to the position X(a,t) of the fluid parcels
(Hadlock 1988):




where v is the flow velocity, x is the position of the fluid, t is time, and u and v are related through
                   , where a is the vector field.
        The Lagrangian and Eulerian specifications of the kinematics and dynamics of the flow field are
related by the substantial derivative (also called the Lagrangian derivative), specified in the following
equation:


                                                     80
        The total rate of change of some vector function F as the fluid parcels moves through a flow field
described by its Eulerian specification u is equal to the sum of the local rate of change and convective
rate of change of F. A more detailed analysis of Lagrangian mechanisms and their equations can be
found in Barratt (2001) and Jacobson (1999).
Dispersion Models Used by SEMARNAT
The first SEMARNAT study, in collaboration with the United Nations Commission for Latin America
and the Caribbean, applied simplified methods developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA), under the SIMPACTS model, to conduct a national assessment of environmental externalities.
The Industrial Source Complex, version 3 (ISC-ST3), was the underlying dispersion model for
evaluating local externalities (within 50 km from specific power plants). The SIMPACTS model
approximates estimated regional impacts, and relies on deposition patterns and equations derived from
case studies in Europe rather than detailed dispersion modeling. The second SEMARNAT study used
the AERMOD model for local domain dispersion in specific critical zones and the Windrose Trajectory
Model (WTM) to analyze regional domain dispersion. The three dispersion models are briefly described
below.11
        Industrial Source Complex, version 3 (ISC-ST3). The ISCST3 model is a steady-state
Gaussian plume model, which can be used to assess pollutant concentrations from a wide variety of
sources associated with an industrial complex. This model can account for the following: settling and
dry deposition of particles; downwash; point, area, line, and volume sources; plume rise as a function of
downwind distance; separation of point sources; and limited terrain adjustment. It was the regulatory
model in the US until 2005, when SEMARNAT studies were conducted. ISC3 operates in both long-
term and short-term modes. It runs in two versions: short-term and long-term. In general, the model
accepts simple meteorological data, which makes the implementation easier. The short-term version
will require only hourly average wind patterns. The long-term version does not require detailed hourly
data, and instead can approximate using average annual meteorological information. Consequently, the
resulting concentrations of the long-term version of ISC3 are only annual and cannot hourly estimates.
        AMS/EPA Regulatory Model (AERMOD). The United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), in collaboration with the American Meteorological Society (AMS), developed
AERMOD, the regulatory model now used in the United States. Detailed information on this model can
be found in the EPA’s Technology Transfer Network Support Center for Regulatory Atmospheric
Modeling (EPA 2009). AERMOD is used to estimate concentrations of criteria pollutants within 50 km
of the emissions source. The model incorporates planetary boundary layer theory; turbulence structure

11
  It is beyond the scope of this study to describe the three models in detail; however, it is useful to understand the main
computer models involved in estimating the concentration used in the damage function.

and scaling concepts, including treatment of both surface and elevated sources; and both simple and
complex terrain. To acquire a more complete understanding of dispersion patterns in densely populated
areas, AERMOD was used for emissions sources in only two critical zones, as defined in the 1994
SEMARNAT Regulation NOM-085.12
        AERMOD consists of three sub-models: AERMOD Mapping (AERMAP) preprocessor,
AERMOD Meteorological (AERMET) preprocessor, and AERMOD. AERMAP incorporates complex
terrain information using digital elevation data of the U.S. Geological Survey. The digital elevation
model (DEM) for Mexico was used, along with land-cover, geo-referenced grids for the study areas.
Land-use classes required by AERMAP were specified, using 2000 data from the National Institute of
Statistics and Geography (INEGI),13 as well as the EPA’s user’s guide for AERMAP. AERMET
requires in-situ meteorological data from a reference station and upper-air information.vi For sites where
information was unavailable, simpler modeling techniques were used. The preprocessor requires land-
use information to estimate albedo and surface stiffness. Land-use cover data of the country was used to
select appropriate parameters, referring to the EPA’s AERMET user’s guide.
        Windrose Trajectory Model (WTM). The WTM was developed by Alfred Trukenmüller
under the ExternE project to estimate energy externalities in the European Union (Trukenmüller and
Friedrich 1995). WTM is a Lagrangian, climatologic, receptor-oriented model with a windrose
trajectory of 24 sectors (15º each). The mixing layer has a height of 800 m. The dispersion is modeled
using a long-term process description of emissions, dispersion, physical and chemical transformations,
and deposition. Each cell is computed as the average of the 24 trajectories that arrive at the same cell,
weighted by the wind frequencies in each sector. Each trajectory is followed by 96 hours before arriving
at the end cell. The process considers all sources that affect a single receptor; this is key to capturing
reactions derived from secondary pollutants, such as sulfates and nitrates.
         The WTM requires the following information:
        Forty-nine values representing probabilities of wind trajectories in 24 possible directions of 15º
         each and 24 values of mean wind speed (m per s) in each direction and a mean value of wind
         speed for each cell.
        Average annual precipitation.
        Low and high emissions of NOx and SO2 (high emissions are from stacks of at least 100 m).


12
   SEMARNAT Official Regulation NOM-085 (1994) on Atmospheric Contamination indicates that, for fixed fossil-fuel
sources (solid, liquid, gas, or any combination thereof), maximum allowable levels of emissions should be established for
smoke, total suspended particulates, SO2, and NOx; requirements and conditions should be set for operating units heated
indirectly by combustion, while maximum allowable SO2 emission levels should be set for units heated directly by
combustion.

   Shadings in digital elevation models are at a scale of 1: 250,000.

      Emissions of ammonia (NH3).
      Elevation of each cell (center).
      Total population.

Model Limitations
The model used in the simplified methodology is no longer considered state of the art in the U.S., having
been superseded by AERMOD in 2005, at least for the regulatory analysis. AERMOD is better than
ISC3 Short Term (ST), particularly for simulating plume growth rates and interaction of the mixing
layer. It also includes improved algorithms for simulating downwash.
        Both AERMOD and WTM consider one structure for the vertical layer of the atmosphere that
extends from the ground level to the planetary boundary layer. As mentioned previously, the WTM is a
climatologic model, meaning that all data is annual, with cells of 55 x 55 km. The meteorological data
is obtained from large international datasets. AERMOD does not consider the formation of secondary
species; thus, it is not possible to use this model to evaluate the impact of sulfates and nitrates in the
local domain. Regional models tend to overestimate secondary pollutants in the vicinity of the
emissions source. WTM is limited in that it provides information only at selected heights and does not
allow for modeling ozone and other such pollutants, which require a photochemical module. While
AERMOD is the preferred model for local pollution analysis, other models are preferred for simulating
regional pollution dispersion.
       Using the simplified methodology, SEMARNAT was able to study 13 power plants, which at the
time represented 77 percent of the power sector’s total SO2 emissions and 67 percent of its NOX and PM
emissions. Only two critical areas were studied using the detailed dispersion models for local and
regional impact assessment.


Risk Assessment and Impact Quantification
To demonstrate the damage relationships between pollution concentrations in the environment and
expected impacts, the integrated assessment method relies on the existing available health and
environmental impact data from epidemiologists and environmental health experts. After reviewing the
existing literature on health and ecosystems impacts, the ExternE project provided an updated summary
on the potential environmental impacts from energy generation (European Commission 2005) (Table
C.1).

       One key element of the damage-cost function approach is the Exposure Response Function
(ERF) (Figure 30). Health damages, which constitute more than 90 percent of the total impact of
environmental pollution,vii have been estimated in several international studies (European Commission
2005; Muller and Mendelsohn 2007; EPA 1999). Because of the dispersion models used, it is also
necessary to focus on the impacts of PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NOx, sulfates, and nitrates. Unfortunately, the
models implemented for Mexico to date have not been able to estimate ozone; thus, this pollutant must
be omitted from the analysis for the time being. It should be highlighted that including the impacts of
ozone would certainly increase external costs.

         The ERF relates the ambient concentration of the pollutant to the resulting impact on a receptor
or at-risk subgroup (e.g., adults, children or crops). For health impacts, ERFs are straight lines with no
threshold; that is, the line passes through the origin at zero concentration. The health impact is
estimated using the following equation:14
                               Ii = j SERFi * Cj * POBj                     [1]
where Ii is the impact in receptor I (number of cases), SERFi is the slope of the ERF (person-
per m3), ∆Cj, is the incremental concentration in location j (                 3
                                                                                 ), and POBj is the at-risk
population in location j (number of persons).
           The slope of the ERF is estimated as follows:

                                                             85
                         SERF = IRR * baseline = IRR* incidence * fPOP         [2]
where IRR (increased risk ratio) is the percentage change in the rate of occurrence of a particular disease
in the at-risk population relative to its nominal rate of occurrence per unit change in ambient
concentration (percent change per μg per m3), baseline is the number of cases per year per person,
including the incidence rate (annual cases per receptor [e.g., adult or child]) and fPOP (fraction [percent]
of the at-risk population).
        The following assumptions in the ExternE 2005 update were used to evaluate the impact of
sulfates and nitrates:
      Toxicity of sulfates = toxicity of PM10 (SERF sulfates = SERF PM10),

      Toxicity of nitrates = ½ of PM10 (SERF nitrates = 0.5 SERF PM10).

Valuation of Externalities
To estimate the total cost of damage in dollars, the associated impacts are monetized. Externalities, by
definition, are the costs or benefits not internalized in market prices, resulting from incomplete
information on external costs, among other reasons. External costs can be associated with market or
non-market values. For example, air pollution can require asthmatics to increase their purchase of
medications and health services. These costs are market prices that can be estimated by applying
commonly-known costing techniques. Since the costs are not taken into account by the pollution
sources, they remain external costs. External costs can also have non-market values. For example, at-
risk adult populations with long-term exposure to PM10 may have decreased life expectancy. Valuation
techniques are needed to capture the value society is willing to incur in order to protect the population
from such exposure and its risks.
Overview and Current Status
Extensive research has been conducted, particularly in developed countries, to capture these values.
Valuing the environment is an inherently complex endeavor, requiring decision-making that might be
questioned on ethical grounds. Economists usually acknowledge the limitations of these techniques to
fully capture the value of the environment, and try to limit the scope of the valuation studies to the
economic value by applying techniques that can provide shadow prices (i.e., those from other market
goods that serve as a proxy for the price of the non-market good or service) or conducting surveys on
consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for a specific environmental good or service (i.e., assessing the
consumer surplus). The underlying assumption in these calculations is that people are able to determine
the trade-off between goods that will leave their welfare level unchanged. Clearly, there are other non-
use values from a clean environment, including both existence value and pure non-use value, as well as
bequest value, option value, and value arising from paternalistic altruism (Foster 1997).
        Much remaining work is needed to improve valuation techniques and incorporate these values
into a comprehensive policy evaluation procedure. Cost-benefit analysis should be part of an iterative
                                                    86
process that allows policy makers to consider all available information at a given point in time and
improve decision-making as more data becomes available. The political process should use the best
economic information available on the costs of policy, including external costs, as well as non-
monetary, non-use and stewardship values, which are non-marketable commodities currently not
captured in externality studies.
        Once the impact has been estimated, external costs are estimated by multiplying each case by its
unitary cost, expressed as the following equation:
                                            Di = Ii · UCi   [1]

where Di is the damage cost of impact I, Ii is health impact i estimated in the previous step (cases per
year), UCi is the unit cost of impact i (dollars per year [e.g., cost of an asthma attack or emergency
hospital visit]).
Monetizing Impacts
This section briefly describes the main cost components included in the externalities presented. For this
study, Mexican institutions used McKinley et al. (2003) as the main reference on cost valuation
techniques, which they applied to health impacts in the country, using the following definitions:
      Cost of Illness (COI). COI studies measure the economic burden of disease. The COI for
       morbidity outcomes can be understood as direct costs of an illness and can include expenditures
       on medication, doctor visits, hospitalization, laboratory tests, and human resources. This metric
       aims to include all incurred costs for an illness or medical attention. The costs can be paid
       directly by the ill individual, public or private insurance, and/or general taxation (McKinley et al.
       2003).
      Productivity Loss (PL). PL uses the difference in output (production) due to illnesses as the
       basis of valuing costs. This value can also be interpreted as the cost or value of the time an
       individual loses from being hospitalized, bedridden, or suffering premature mortality. PL can
       also be calculated for environmental contingency episodes, when industries must temporarily
       close their operations due to air pollution levels. To estimate PL, days lost per case are
       multiplied by the average daily wage. It should be noted that the estimated number of days is
       usually limited to days spent in the hospital. It is reasonable to assume that PL would be
       increased as a result of individuals missing more work days beyond their hospital stay. PL from
       premature mortality can be estimated using X amount of days lost. For example, McKinley et al.
       (2003) uses 260 days lost per premature mortality, applying the Years of Life Lost (YOLL)
       approach; however, in this study, we use the Value of Statistical Life (VSL) approach.
      Willingness To Pay (WTP). WTP can be determined from contingent valuation and
       compensating wage studies, which in theory should account for the full cost of disease to an
       individual, including pain and suffering. Contingent valuation studies rely on an individual’s
       stated preferences through the use of surveys, in which individuals are asked how much they
                                                    87
        would be willing to pay to reduce their risk of mortality or morbidity. Hedonic wage studies rely
        on revealed preferences through analysis of labor market data on wages and risk levels for
        certain jobs. Econometric models are used to determine the amount individuals are compensated
        for added risk in the workplace. These methods for estimating individual preferences rely on the
        concept of consumer sovereignty and people’s ability to make rational trade-offs.
        Traditionally, mortality impact valuation has been done using one of three approaches: (i)
contingent valuation, (ii) hedonic wages, or (iii) human capital. In principle, contingent valuation would
be better applied to environmental impacts since, ideally, individuals would be asked to value a
particular situation considering environmental degradation. The hedonic wages approach is usually
conducted using shadow prices derived from differentials in compensation for certain jobs where
mortality risk is higher. The human capital approach considers the wealth an individual would have
earned during the disability period or that was lost due to premature mortality. The first two approaches
derive a VSL that equals the value of avoiding the risk of one fatal accident or premature mortality due
to pollution exposure.
        Air pollution has both acute and chronic effects on mortality. The former, resulting from short-
term exposure, can be statistically observed within days; while the latter, resulting from prolonged
exposure (e.g., lifetime city dwellers), may only be apparent in the long term. In the case of chronic or
premature mortality, an individual loses years of life due to contamination. The ExternE approach
values only those YOLL and not the complete VSL per case. The reasoning is that air pollution does not
kill you instantly and thus only the proportional part of YOLL should be considered in the analysis of
externalities. Using the European population data, the YOLL for chronic mortality are assumed to be 10
years, while acute mortality is assumed to be 0.5 years of life.
        The equation for estimating the YOLL from the VSL is as follows:
                                            æ                     ö

Case Study 1: Combined Cycle Technology
Mexico’s National Electricity System expects increased power demand in the Northwest to average 3.9
percent a year over the 2010–25 period. In accordance with long-term planning, CFE estimates that an
additional 650 MW will be needed to meet this demand and maintain adequate levels of reserve margin.
To create this new capacity, a combined cycle (CC) technology project was submitted, which included a

        With this data, generation of the plant’s fuel input was estimated. CFE’s planning department
estimated the displaced generation, identifying specific units in the system. Analysis of economic
dispatch of the system determined the avoided emissions per plant resulting from the new facility’s
displacement of fuel-oil generation units (See Table D.2). Total emissions avoided are presented shown
in Table D.3.

Case Study 2: Geothermal Installation
In Mexico’s Southwest, the National Electricity System expects power demand to grow by 3.9
percent a year until 2024 (Map 3). The geothermal project, which will add 50 MW of average
gross annual capacity, is part of SENER’s Special Program for Renewable Energy, whose
primary objective is diversification of power generation sources (Table D.6).

        The socioeconomic evaluation of the project included an analysis of avoided emissions
and a financial evaluation, which included revenue from carbon credits, valued at US$9.939 per
tCO2 for 8 years of the facility’s 30 years of operation (Table D.7). The analysis of displaced
generation and incremental energy is presented in Table D.9.

Economic dispatch modeling with and without the project shows that avoided emissions from the
new geothermal facility over the 2014–43 period would average 846 tons for SO2, 255 tons for
NOx, 58 tons for TSP, and 177,499 tons for CO2 (Table D.8). Economic evaluation of the project
includes the externality cost, using SEMARNAT values, and CO2 costs valued at US$18.35 per
ton. Most of the project benefits would consist of energy savings, while the remainder would
accrue to the environment and system security.

Case Study 3: Wind Farm
Mexico’s National Electricity System estimates demand growth for the Southeast region at 3.5
percent a year over the planning period. The 395 MW wind farm project for this region is part of
the SENER’s long-term energy-diversification strategy. The project investment includes the cost
of 303 wind turbines, with 1,065.92 GWh in annual production, and assumes a 40 percent
capacity factor (Table D.12).

The estimated external benefits from reducing CO2 emissions are based on the avoided fossil-
fuel emissions that would otherwise be produced without the displaced generation. The needed
carbon-credit incentive is US¢12.52 per kWh over the useful life of the central plant facility,
corresponding to US$18.35 per tCO2 avoided. The project will generate 1,065.92 GWh of
energy per year on average, allowing for the capture of $18.510 million in revenue from carbon
credits. In current value, these incentives represent a total of $82.1 million.

The total benefits from incorporating production cost savings and carbon credits (without taking
other environmental externalities into account) have a current value equal to the required project
investment.15 The resulting annual avoided emissions for major pollutants average 3,483 tons
for SO2, 1,275 tons for NOx, 191 tons for TSP, and 607,426 tons for CO2 (Table D.14).16 The
externality benefits from avoided environmental costs equal US$7.2 million a year17.


15
   No World Bank incentives are considered.
16
   The external costs by zone and pollutant average about US¢0.604 per kWh (2009 figure).
17
   It is important to stress the need for carbón-credit incentives, as well as avoided environmental cost, to ensure
project viability.

Case Study 3: Hydroelectric facility


Mexico’s National Electricity System estimates demand growth for the Southeast region at 3.5
percent a year over the planning period (Map 2). The project capacity of 1107 MW requires an
investment of 800 million usd; it is expected to generate annually 1370 GWh, 900 of which are
expected to serve as peak capacity. The basic information of the project is shown in Table D.16.

        The marginal cost of energy considered in the evaluation was 74.74 dollars per MWh.
For the financial assessment of the project a $9.9 per ton/CO2 were considered. The analysis of
displaced generation is presented in Table D.17. The total emissions reductions economic
dispatch simulation were 6520 ton SO2, 1779 ton of NOx, 431 ton of particulate matter and
860,490 ton of CO2 (See Table D.18). The summary of the BCA is shown in Table 18 and the
details of the calculation in Table 19.

  A good compilation of emissions inventories techniques is available from the United States
Environmental Protection Agency Technology Transfer Network at http://www.epa.gov/ttn/
chief/eiinformation.html.
v
  As part of establishing an emissions trading mechanism for SO2, this program created an
economic value for SO2 emissions, thereby making accurate measurement a critical issue.
Arguably, these expensive technologies are needed in all cases; clearly, they provide better
information for estimating pollution damage, among other uses.
vi
  The model runs in three separate stages combined in STAGE1N2.exe and STAGE3.exe
applications.
vii
   Clearly, further research is needed to more fully understand (i) ERFs or an equivalent method
for assessing ecosystem damage and (ii) valuation of environmental damages. It is the authors’
opinion that these are two nascent research areas; thus, the major impacts are on human health,
which is a critical area that has been prioritized.
