    Board responsibilities
    Today’s corporate citizenship — defined by a clear call to environmental, social and governance
    responsibility — links directly to three fundamental functions of boards and their directors’
    duties to the companies and shareowners they serve:
    > Protecting stakeholder rights and interests
    > Managing risk
    > Creating long-term business value


    The following sections explain how these aspects link through the OECD Principles and UN Global
    Compact. The examples of strategies illustrate the business benefits of proactive leadership.


    proTeCTinG sTaKeholder riGhTs and inTeresTs
    The OECD Principles call on businesses to recognize and safeguard stakeholders’ rights,
    including legitimate interests and information needs. These Principles call on boards to be truly
    accountable to shareowners and to take ultimate responsibility for their firm’s adherence to a
    high standard of corporate behavior and ethics.


    Effective corporate governance requires due diligence in rallying the support and commitment
    of the broad network of business stakeholders, including shareowners, employees, customers
    and communities. If stakeholders are adversely affected by a company’s actions, shareowner
    value will suffer. With the growth in pension and insurance funds and other institutional
    investors, shareowners are increasingly also company stakeholders, such as employees or
    customers. Therefore, these groups’ needs are increasingly interconnected.


    The UN Global Compact’s ten principles similarly call on boards to address critical dimensions of
    concern to stakeholders. Boards that recognize the value of a holistic approach to stakeholder
    engagement, particularly in the environmental, social and governance realms, find that
    shareowners are similarly committed to such issues. This includes ongoing communication with

The OECD Principles of Corporate Governance
First published in 1999, the OECD Principles assist governments in improving the legal, institutional and regulatory
framework that underpins corporate governance and ultimately helps preserve financial and economic stability. The
Principles provide practical guidance for corporate governance best practices, including protection of shareowner
rights and board responsibilities, to stock exchanges, investors, corporations, and others. Updated in 2004,
following a spate of corporate scandals, the Principles now contain even stronger recognition of the importance
of stakeholders in corporate governance as well as emphasizing the need for timely, accurate, and transparent
disclosure mechanisms and communication.

    Managing risk
    New understandings of business risk show that boards
    have a legal and fiduciary responsibility to manage
    environmental, social and governance risks. Directors
    need to be informed and prepared to manage these long-
    term concerns alongside typical corporate directives. By
    addressing and managing these risks effectively, boards
    can position their businesses to perform well financially
    and secure a long-term license to operate. By failing to do
    so, boards can undermine their company’s reputation.
