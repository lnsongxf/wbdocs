EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The objective of this study was to go beyond a standard gender review of project design
to increase knowledge of how and to what extent World Bank agriculture projects address
gender issues during implementation. The study introduces a tool to track gender
mainstreaming in the implementation phase of a project. The tool is then used
to review the portfolio of current agriculture projects, establish a baseline,
and suggest targets for gender mainstreaming for the future portfolio.

A TOOL FOR TRACKING GENDER
IN IMPLEMENTATION: QUALITY AT
IMPLEMENTATION
The Quality at Implementation (QAI) tool builds on the World Bank’s corporate-level
analysis of gender integration at the design stage—the review of Project Appraisal
Documents (PAD) that is carried out before a project is approved. In these Quality at
Entry (QAE) reviews, a project is rated “Gender Informed” if the Project Appraisal
Document addresses gender issues.

The Gender in Implementation tracking tool presented here focuses on the World
Bank’s main operational documents—Aide-Mémoires (AMs), Implementation Status
and Results (ISRs) reports, Project Implementation/Operation Manuals (PIMs), and
Implementation and Completion Reports (ICRs)—to determine if concrete gender
actions were included in project implementation. As in the QAE analysis, the QAI
tracking tool analyzes three dimensions of gender. First, are gender issues identiﬁed
or analyzed in studies or reports? Second, are any gender actions undertaken? Third,
is monitoring and evaluation (M&E) gender sensitive (for example, did the project
involve disaggregated data, speciﬁc gender indicators, or special evaluation studies)?
Unlike QAE, in scoring the three dimensions equally, the “gender actions” dimen-
sion is weighted more heavily than the other two in QAI. A project is rated “Gender
Implemented” if the operational documents report on gender actions and include
at least one of the other two gender dimensions.

INTRODUCTION

GENDER MAINSTREAMING IN AGRICULTURE
AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT: WHY IS IT
IMPORTANT?
The World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development (World Bank 2011)
argues that greater gender equality is not just the right thing to do but is
also good for the economy. Greater gender equality can enhance productivity,
improve development outcomes for the next generation, and make institutions more
representative. Women account for 43 percent of the world’s agricultural labor force
(FAO 2011). Increased gender equality in agriculture can signiﬁcantly contribute to
increased production and proﬁts, the adoption of new technologies, and higher house-
hold incomes. These outcomes are important because resources and incomes con-
trolled by women are more likely to be used to improve family food consumption and
welfare, reduce child malnutrition, and increase overall family well-being.

The agriculture sector is underperforming in many developing coun-
tries, in part because men and women do not have equal access to the
resources and opportunities they need to be productive. Across countries
and contexts, women have consistently less access than men to agricultural assets,
inputs, and services and to rural employment opportunities. Increasing women’s access
to land, water, livestock, inputs, education, ﬁnancial services, agricultural extension
information, technology, labor, and rural employment would boost their productivity
and generate gains in agricultural output, food security, economic growth, and social
welfare (O’Sullivan et al 2014). If women had the same access to productive resources
as men, they could increase yields on their farms by 20–30 percent (FAO 2011).

TRACKING GENDER AT THE DESIGN STAGE
(QUALITY AT ENTRY)
At the corporate level, the World Bank tracks gender at the Quality at
Entry stage (QAE) of the project cycle. Before projects are approved, all Proj-
ect Appraisal Documents are analyzed using the QAE methodology, which focuses

A NEW TOOL TO TRACK GENDER IN
IMPLEMENTATION

WHY DEVELOP A NEW TOOL FOR TRACKING
GENDER IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION?
The QAE methodology reﬂects how well gender is integrated into a proj-
ect’s design, but not beyond. The QAE assessment produces a clear picture of
how a project proposes to address gender issues, which is a ﬁrst and signiﬁcant step
for understanding how gender is addressed at the corporate level. The full integration
of gender into the Bank’s lending operations is still a work in progress. No established
methodology and system exist to track gender mainstreaming after the design phase
(that is, during a project’s implementation and at closure, which arguably are the most
important stages of an intervention). It is not known how and to what extent “Gender
Informed” at entry translates into “Gender Implemented” during implementation.

The Quality at Implementation (QAI) tool complements the QAE “Gen-
der Informed” rating with a “Gender Implemented” rating. The QAI
tracking tool, which is based on the QAE methodology, tracks gender mainstreaming
throughout the project cycle, from implementation to completion, by looking at three
gender dimensions: gender analysis, gender actions, and gender M&E.

HOW TO USE THE QAI TOOL TO TRACK
GENDER IN IMPLEMENTATION
The QAI tracking tool can be used to complement the QAE methodology for peri-
odically reviewing and tracking gender mainstreaming during implementation of
projects in the agriculture portfolio (or the portfolio of any Global Practice). The tool
could also be used at the project midterm review to track gender implementation and
identify any support or actions needed to attain successful gender outcomes.

It is worth noting that the QAI reﬂects the status of gender mainstreaming based on
the contents of implementation documents, which vary considerably in their quality

by the limited number of active projects as well as projects rated for the three
gender dimensions. All of the selected projects have almost two years of imple-

FINDINGS OF THE GENDER IN
IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW
This review is informative with respect to general trends and issues in gender imple-
mentation in the agriculture portfolio, but as discussed, the results should be treated
with caution. The sample size is limited; without standardized and in-depth reporting
on gender activities, it is impossible to fully gauge the quality of gender mainstreaming
or of reporting on gender in projects that are rated Gender Implemented. A review
of the entire agriculture portfolio would provide stronger evidence and yield valu-
able conclusions on gender in project implementation. Even so, the overview provided
here, and the insights it oﬀers into emerging trends and regional variation in gender
mainstreaming, represents a useful starting point for examining gender in implementa-
tion. The gender actions documented from the implementation documents and TTL
interviews fall into the eight categories shown in table 3.1.

RESULTS OF THE GENDER IN
IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW BY REGION
On average, 76 percent of the projects were rated Gender Implemented
based on the QAI review. All projects were Gender Implemented in MNA, com-
pared with 89 percent in EAP; 85 percent in AFR; 75 percent in ECA and SAR; and
44 percent in LAC (ﬁgure 3.1).

As members of supervision teams, gender specialists played a crucial
role in ensuring gender mainstreaming during implementation. Nearly
all—94 percent—of the projects that had a gender specialist on the team were rated
Gender Implemented. Diﬀerent types of gender expertise were deployed from a vari-
ety of sources, such as World Bank gender specialists, consultants from other inter-
national institutions or donors (such as the Food and Agriculture Organization), and
government gender specialists. In the most successful cases, both local and interna-
tional gender specialists worked together. This ﬁnding suggests that allocating project resources
to engage a gender specialist can ensure gender implementation.

 Additional funds   • Assign a percentage of project funds for gender mainstreaming
                    • Receive funds from other donors to fund gender-speciﬁc activities not originally planned for the project
                    • Allot special funding (a “women’s revolving fund” or “women’s development fund”) to support creative ideas
                      for designing and implementing activities targeting women and/or projects and activities run by women
 Common sense:      • Keep training close to the home; provide bicycles

                    • Provide day care during training
                    • Recruit women trainers in the required technical ﬁeld
                    • Introduce labor-saving technologies
 Expertise          • Recruit gender experts to assist the World Bank project team

GENDER IMPLEMENTED: BASELINE
AND TARGETS
The Agriculture Global Practice recognizes that the implementation of gender main-
streaming is important for a project’s success. This review makes it possible to establish a
baseline and to suggest a set of targets for a long-term approach to gender mainstream-
ing in agriculture projects. In particular, the focus on all three gender dimensions during
implementation will raise the bar in terms of the quality of implementation.

According to the Agriculture Action Plan 2013–15, which sets the Quality at Entry param-
eters for agriculture and rural development projects, by 2015 projects will (1) include
gender analysis in project design, with a target of 100 percent, and (2) include gender
mainstreaming in all three dimensions of design (analysis, actions, and M&E), with a
target of 75 percent. The 100 percent target for gender analysis reﬂects the fact that all
projects should be assessed to identify any gender asymmetries related to the chosen inter-
ventions and understand their potential implications. Even if it is deemed unnecessary to
include gender in the design, that decision needs to be based on a sound gender analysis.

Based on the Quality at Entry targets, senior management could consider setting similar
gender mainstreaming targets for Quality at Implementation, as suggested in table 4.1.

CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION
There is much to celebrate in this tracking exercise. A promising number of
agriculture projects across regions were rated Gender Implemented. This data could
not have been generated without the QAI tool; this tool was eﬀective for gathering
information on gender mainstreaming reported in implementation documents and
for clearly identifying gaps and strengths for speciﬁc projects and gender trends in
regional portfolios.

There is a need to move beyond quality at entry to have a more realis-
tic picture of gender mainstreaming in projects. This review indicates that
a rating of Gender Informed at entry is no guarantee that a project will successfully
mainstream gender during implementation, although it is a good basis for success. In
addition, this review shows that it is critical to track gender mainstreaming throughout
the project cycle to identify gaps and opportunities in real time. Finally, the review
shows that if a project neglects gender during the design phase, it can still catch up
during implementation.

Gender mainstreaming can involve several activities and approaches,
including aﬃrmative actions to actively promote women’s inclusion and empowerment
on the ground. The gender actions in the reviewed documents (see table 3.1) resemble
aﬃrmative actions and others that are predominantly directed at mainstreaming gen-
der in projects. Clearly diﬀerent types of actions are needed to actively promote wom-
en’s empowerment on the ground, ﬁtting to speciﬁc contexts. A substantial number of
gender actions do not require additional project funding. Instead of additional funding,
what is needed is a change in management and implementation attitudes, as well as a
change in the skills base recruited for project teams. In other words, the easy wins are
there—if project teams apply a gender lens in project implementation.

The quality of gender mainstreaming varies. Some projects do the bare
minimum by undertaking only a few concrete actions, including the minimum core
sector indicators for gender (such as tracking the percentage of women beneﬁcia-
ries), and potentially adding another gender-disaggregated indicator. Other projects
go much farther in mainstreaming gender. They integrate gender actions within each

CHAPTER SIX
RECOMMENDATIONS
    1. Overall, it is important to expand gender tracking throughout the
       project cycle. Continued and deepened regular analyses of agriculture proj-
       ects during the concept note stage, during the quality at entry steps (Qual-
       ity Enhancement Reviews, Project Appraisal Documents), and during imple-
       mentation, up to the ICR, where best practices can be identiﬁed, is proven
       to strengthen strategic gender implementation and outcomes. Harmonizing
       portfolio review methodologies at entry, implementation, and project closing
       improves our understanding of the consistency of gender mainstreaming in
       agriculture projects.

    2. Use the Gender in Implementation tracking tool to identify gender
       gaps in order to provide proactive support to TTLs. The tool can
       identify projects performing poorly on gender issues during implementation
       and can garner support for TTLs. It is suggested that a review of gender imple-
       mentation in the agriculture portfolio be conducted every second year. The
       Gender Cross-Cutting Solution Area; the Urban, Rural, and Social Develop-
       ment Global Practice; and the Agriculture Global Practice are encouraged to
       regularly review Gender Informed (at design) and Gender Implemented scores
       and to agree on how to proactively support poorly performing projects. The
       methodology presented here can also be applied at the midterm of a project to
       quickly gain an understanding of the situation in a given project and change
       course, if needed, before the project closes.

    3. Ensure gender skills, tools, and funding for each project. For proj-
       ect staﬀ, training in gender skills and concrete actions as well as in strategies
       for overcoming possible obstacles to gender implementation is essential. It is
       important to develop user-friendly tools for TTLs; for example, checklists to
       review progress on gender in implementation at the MTR stage, to monitor
       gender during implementation and to provide sample terms of reference for
       the recruitment of gender specialists. Furthermore, it is suggested that a pool
       of gender expertise could be established to provide resources for such support.
       However, the ultimate goal is for project and supervision budgets to allocate
       resources explicitly to support gender actions.

ment that all agriculture projects include in their results framework the core compulsory
gender indicator on female beneﬁciaries. This indicator has been successfully included
in the ISRs of this project. Moreover, the gender achievement of the project is also cap-
tured through the following proposed project development objective indicators:
     » Community (of which women’s) subprojects that satisfactorily achieve 75 per-
        cent of expected results
     » Community (of which women’s) subprojects fully functional one year after their
        completion

In addition, the proposed Intermediate Results Indicators are also intended to capture
the project’s impact on women:
    » Community members (of which women) having attended at least one training event
    » Beneﬁciary satisfaction (of which women)
    » Unqualiﬁed audits in women’s subprojects

TYPES OF DOCUMENTS REVIEWED
Aide-Mémoire: Aide-Mémoires provide (1) a detailed description of activities occur-
ring under the project, (2) the results achieved so far, (3) issues identiﬁed, and (4) next
steps to address issues. The main purpose of an AM is to record the major ﬁndings,
issues, recommendations, and agreements or next steps reached jointly with the bor-
rower during the implementation support visit. The AM is also used to inform World
Bank management about the status of a given project. For that reason, a review of
AMs makes it possible to track and assess how gender activities and issues are accom-
modated, included, and followed up with government during implementation from
the World Bank side.

Implementation Status and Results Report: ISRs provide a picture of the World
Bank’s internal reporting on gender activities, issues, results, and follow-up actions.

Project Implementation/Operational Manual: PIMs detail how a project will
be implemented, including the speciﬁc processes and activities involved. PIMs make
it possible to assess which processes and activities have been developed to ensure that
gender is addressed during a project’s implementation.

Implementation Completion Report: ICRs provide (1) a complete and sys-
tematic account of the performance and results of each operation, (2) a means of
capturing and disseminating experience gained from an operation’s design and imple-
mentation, and (3) accountability and transparency. They also serve as a vehicle for
realistic self-evaluation. A review of ICRs provides information on how projects have
aﬀected women and other data relating to women.

Results framework: The results framework focuses on the project development
objective (PDO) and intermediate outcomes expected from implementing each com-
ponent of a project, all of which contribute to the achievement of the PDO. The
added emphasis on component outcomes helps to focus the project’s design and man-
agement on results. Results frameworks provide information on how gender is being
integrated into the design of projects to contribute to their main outcomes.



Portfolio Review on Gender Implementation of Agriculture Projects (FY08–13)                   31
APPENDIX C
SAMPLE SELECTION OF PROJECTS
The sample of projects reviewed for this study was selected from the 236 active Agri-
culture and Environmental Services (AES) projects (62 from AFR, 46 from EAP, 30
from ECA, 40 from LAC, 8 from MNA, and 50 from SAR). Fifty-ﬁve projects were
selected for review, based on the following criteria:
     » Projects reviewed at the preparation stage were included. All of the projects
       selected are from FY08 and later, as the three gender dimensions for preparing
       AES projects became mandatory only in FY08.
     » The projects were chosen proportionally from the six regions: 13 for AFR, 9
       for EAP, 8 for ECA, 9 for LAC, 4 for MNA, and 12 for SAR. The choice of
       projects for MNA was constrained by the limited number of projects that were
       both active and rated for the three gender dimensions.
     » All of the selected projects had at least one year of implementation and had
       started disbursing.
