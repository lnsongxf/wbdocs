Executive Summary

A Public Expenditure and Financial accountability (PEFA) repeat assessment was conducted
in the Republic of Serbia (RoS) between November 2014 and May 2015 by an independent
team of experts, led by the World Bank (WB). The assessment was financed jointly by the
Strengthening of Accountability and the Fiduciary Environment (SAFE) Trust Fund of the
Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), the European Union Delegation to
Serbia (EU Delegation) and WB. Previous PEFA assessments were performed in 2007 and
2010.

The period covered by this Assessment (2011-2013) was dominated by the challenges posed
by the aftermath of the global economic recession which affected macro-fiscal performances.
Notwithstanding these challenges PFM improvements can be observed in strengthening
legislative framework, and Budget classification, multi-year fiscal planning, procurement and
external audit. In other areas such as the composition of expenditure out-turn compared with
originally approved budget, expenditures arrears, oversight of fiscal risk, and effectiveness of
tax collection, predictability in the availability of funds, application of public sector accounting
standards application and legislative scrutiny of annual budget law and final accounts, further
work is needed to improve PFM performance. The main findings of the assessment are
summarized in the Figure 1.

Summary Assessment
(i)    Integrated assessment of public financial management (PFM) performance

       1)      Credibility of the budget

Despite country fiscal difficulties, revenues out turns improved during the assessment period
and there were no significant variances between actual and budgeted figures. The Budget
System Law (BSL), 2009 and its amendments of 2010 require the preparation of three-year
projections. Previously, projections had been included in the Memorandum on the Budget and
Economic and Fiscal Policy and since 2012 have been part of the Fiscal Strategy that is
submitted and approved by the legislative. In practice, the medium term projections for the two
following years following the budget year, are not considered and observed. Estimates and
ceiling are mostly provisional, without clear evidence of being considered as the starting point
in preparation of following yearsâ budgets.

Macroeconomic instability affected fiscal projections and undermined the reliability of
revenues and forecasts which resulted in deviations compared with approved budgets in the
period covered by this Assessment. Even so, revenue out-turn as compared to the approved
budget evidences marked improvement in recent years.

Improvements in budget estimates would be beneficial, as in most budget execution periods
one or two supplementary budgets are prepared and approved.

Frequent changes in the organizational structure of government occurred during the assessment
period. These changes happened during the fiscal year and necessitated splitting or aggregating
the budget in-year execution according to the newly approved institutional structure. This has
had an adverse impact such the variance was more than 10 percent in one of the three years
under consideration.

Forecasts of macroeconomic parameters that are the basis for preparing the medium-term
expenditure framework (MTEF) are often inaccurate, producing some overly optimistic GDP
estimates that were then built into expenditures forecasts. The assignment of expenditure
ceilings to budgetary heads is defined by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) with little coordination
and input from beneficiary ministries and departments. As a result, the credibility of the MTEF
as a base for planning and budgeting processes is diminished.

Although there are procedures in place to control and monitor expenditure arrears, significant
arrears arose in the health sector, local self-government, and road maintenance during the
assessment period. The government has implemented new measures that are expected to
contribute to a progressive reduction in this problem.

       2)      Comprehensiveness and transparency

The comprehensiveness of information provided in in-year budget reports could be improved.
The final accounts are presented with relatively complete fiscal and budget information
however no information is provided on the previous yearsâ out-turn and budget execution.


                                                                                             ix
Serbiaâs budget classification is consistent with the international standard of Classification of
the Functions of Government (CoFoG) including administrative, functional and economic
categories.

Budget documentation includes macroeconomic assumptions, fiscal information, deficit
financing, debt stock and implication of the budget implications of new policy initiatives,
although the documentation lacks information on financial assets or the prior yearâs budget
outturn and execution.

The in-year budget reporting system does not include comprehensive information during the
year on indirect budget beneficiaries (although the final execution report includes most of this
information); this renders it difficult to quantify the extent of operations that are not properly
reported.

Fiscal risk monitoring has proved challenging in Serbia with more than 1,300 state-controlled
enterprises, some of which receive Government subsidies that contribute to the fiscal stress.

        3)     Policy-based budgeting

The BSL outlines the budget calendar, which was not fully complied with in the assessment
period. Delays in the budget preparation process create bottlenecks that result in insufficient
time allowed for certain stages of the process, which undermines the credibility,
comprehensiveness, transparency and scrutiny of the budget process.

Investment decision are not well linked with sectoral strategies and their cost implication are
rarely included in budget estimates.

       4)      Predictability and control in budget execution

Revenue collection agencies need to effectively promote voluntary compliance even with the
existence of comprehensive tax laws, guidelines, and procedures. Tax-payers continue to have
a perception of that tax agencies take discretionary or judgemental decisions during audits.
Revenuesâ flow of funds is adequately managed and monitored daily.

A recently revamped tax appeal mechanism aims for improve tax efficiency and efficacy in
the tax collection system. Taxpayers are registered in a single database, which is linked with
other registration systems. Penalties deriving from tax non-compliance are not applied
consistently and therefore have little impact on tax compliance. There is room for improvement
in tax collection of tax arrears.

Transaction controls imposed and exercised by the Treasury within the context of the Financial
Management Information System (FMIS) are sound. They effectively controls commitments
to actual available cash in the framework of the approved/ available annual appropriation and
quotas issued by the Treasury for cash management purposes. Nevertheless, budget
beneficiaries can assume commitments up to their budget appropriations for the year, while
the Treasury is not providing them with data on which commitments will be settled based on
availability of funds. This poses a risk of slippage of the following yearsâ payments which
could result in the creation of further expenditures arrears.


                                                                                                x
Entering into multi-annual commitments/contracts is subject to Governmentâs approval and
allows budget beneficiaries to enter into commitments up to their multi-year expenditure
ceiling as defined in the Fiscal strategy. However, it is not clear whether this limitation has
been respected in practice. The Treasury does not keep records of multi-year commitments,
only of the portion to be paid in the current year. The absence of a system monitoring for multi-
annual commitment creates the risk that budget beneficiaries will accumulate significant
expenditure arrears.

A new Public Procurement Law has been adopted which brings the Serbian public procurement
legislation more closely in line with the European Union (EU) Procurement Directives.
However, there is still room for further improvement; the Law does not require publication of
procurement plans and reports on the Public Procurement Administration (PPA) portal.

Serbia has made also more good progress in introduction of Public Internal Financial Control
(PIFC). This is primarily reflected in a comprehensive legislative framework which is largely
aligned with best European practices. Progress is uneven across different institutions as
evidenced by Supreme Audit Institution (SAI) reports and will require further systematic
attention by those charged with its implementation. The Internal Audit (IA) function has been
significantly strengthened by provision of training and certification by the Central
Harmonization Unit (CHU) of the MoF.

           5)      Accounting, recording and reporting

Accounting information is comprehensively maintained in the General Treasury Ledger,
reflecting the full range of budget classifications. The accounting system provided by the
Treasury enables timely and comprehensive reporting on budgetary transactions for direct
budget beneficiaries covered by the Financial Management Information System (FMIS). From
2014 foreign-financed project loans have been included in the in-year reporting. Coverage of
FMIS has still not been expanded to include indirect budget beneficiaries. However, most
Government bank accounts are managed by the Treasury Administration and are reconciled
daily. Bank accounts in foreign currency that are held in commercial banks (in absence of
foreign-currency treasury account) and are regularly reconciled.

By-laws governing the application of public sector accounting standards are not consistent
among themselves (as for example whether prescribed cash-basis International Public Sector
Accounting Standards (IPSAS) are to be applied directly or indirectly). The standards applied
in practice in national accounting are not explicitly disclosed in published annual financial
reports. This had not affected the Final Accounts that provide comprehensive information on
revenue, expenditure and financial assets/financial liabilities. Information on non-financial
assets is of substantially lower quality, as evidenced in the work of the SAI.

           6)      External scrutiny and audit

The performance of public sector external audit has made progress since 2010 PEFA
assessment. Significantly higher resources in the SAI and extensive technical support provided
by a twinning project1 have helped increase the audit coverage and provided closer alignment

                                                                                                       xi
with the International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). Quality control over
the external audit work still needs to be fully developed.

Although there is no statutory deadline for submission of the audit report on the Final Account
to the legislature, the SAI has managed to audit the final account within 12 months of the
period. Timing of the submission of the audited final account to the National Assembly is in
December and coincides with the deliberation of next yearâs budget proposals in the
legislature. The timing of submission limits the usefulness of the audit reports as a source of
information for legislative scrutiny.

The legislature has scrutinized the budget legislation, including the medium-term fiscal
framework and priorities as well as details of expenditure and revenue. There is a lack of
specific procedures and deadlines for scrutiny of the audit reports by the National Assembly
and its Committee for Finance, Budget and Control over the Use of Public Resources. To
date, no hearings on the findings documented in SAI reports have been held. Although the
legislature has examined the SAI Annual Activity Report, it has not deliberated on the final
accounts for a number of years. Accordingly, the legislature has not issued recommendations
to the executive.

Clear rules continue to be in place for in-year budget amendments without prior legislative
approval and these have been usually respected in practice.

(ii)   Assessment of the impact of PFM characteristics

The three main objectives of any PFM system are to support macro fiscal stability; help with
the mobilization and allocation of public resources; and to support an efficient service delivery
by the public sector.

A brief summary of the impact of the identified weaknesses of Serbiaâs PFM system is
presented below.

Aggregate Fiscal Discipline

Although there are commitments control in place, especially at the central government level,
the overall control over public finances has proven challenging as the fiscal position was
undermined by the materialization of fiscal risks. There is a strong cash flow control on
budgetary funds in place but is not sufficient to monitor the financial position of the entities of
the general government as they received and manage other sources of resources. Fiscal risks
associated with state-owned enterprises (SOEs), sub-national government (SNGs) and indirect
budget beneficiaries (IBBs) are particularly challenging for the Government, which is taking
actions in this regards such as the monitoring on SOEs performed by the Ministry of Economy.

Strategic Allocation of Resources

Although there is a Fiscal Strategy with a medium term perspective in place where the
implication of new policies is discussed, the budget process does not have a strong link with
policy or a strategic focus. The investment program face challenges in its implementation and
the recurrent cost associated with investment projects is not always discussed upfront.


                                                                                                xii
Efficient Service Delivery

With the current implementation of the programmatic budget Serbia is transitioning from a
PFM system focused on controls, rather than on efficiency or effectiveness of service delivery,
towards an output approach. Recently introduced performance auditing has the potential to
facilitate refocusing from compliance to performance and value for money.

(iii)    Prospect for reform planning and implementation

The Government is engaged in an important effort on PAR and PFM reform to modernize and
strengthen its PFM system so as to implement a more modern financial resource management
framework that promotes economic and social development and meets the needs of its citizens.

It is foreseen that forthcoming PFM reforms will be elaborated in a specific sub-sector strategy,
to be prepared pursuant to the Governmentâs broader PAR Strategy for the period 2015-2019.
There is significant support for PFM reforms from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
World Bank, EU, United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and various bilateral partners
including Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO).

(iv) Overview of performance changes (2010 and 2014)

This is the third time the PEFA methodology has been applied in Serbia that was applied before
in 2007 and 2010. When comparing this PEFA assessment with that performed in 2010, it
should be kept in mind cores that not all of the scores are directly comparable for the following
reasons:

For indicators PI-2, PI-3 and PI-19 the methodology for scoring and calibration was revised
by PEFA Secretariat in January 2011. In other cases, a different interpretation of the PEFA
framework based on the latest methodological guidance from the PEFA Field Guide and
consultation on specific cases has resulted in a different score than that in 2010 notwithstanding
the absence of change in actual PFM performance. The following table summarize the changes
in the performance scores compared to the 2010 PEFA assessment where the performance is
shown in columns and the scores comparison in the rows.

In total, performance has improved on seven PIs. In three PIs this led has led to higher scores:

   ï·   PI-5 (classification of the budget) â where updated standard classification framework,
       consistent with GFS/COFOG, and budget codes table have been in use since December
       2011.
   ï·   PI-12 (multi-year perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure policy and budgeting) â
       where improvements are noted with handling of the debt sustainability analysis.
   ï·   PI-26 (external audit) â where the increased capacities of the SAI led to greater
       coverage and establishment of an effective system for follow-up on audit
       recommendations.

The higher score assigned for PI-19 is not directly comparable to the 2010 assessment because
of a change of methodology. However, considerable progress has been made in public
procurement reform. The current public procurement legislation has increased transparency,
further defined the system for public procurement, regulated procurement planning, organized
a register of bidders, and improved the procurement complaints mechanism

In the following three PIs the scores have remained unchanged notwithstanding the
improvements in performance:

   ï·   PI-18 (payroll) â where the increased capacities of the SAI and internal audit units led
       to greater audit coverage of payroll operations,
   ï·   PI-20 (internal controls for non-salary expenditure) â where a comprehensive
       legislative framework for financial management and control is in place and substantive
       training efforts are expected to reap benefits,
   ï·   PI-22 (accounts reconciliation) â where evidence is now available of timely
       reconciliation of foreign currency accounts not managed by the Treasury.

The main deterioration in performance and corresponding scores can be seen on two PIs:

   ï·   PI-2 (composition of expenditure out-turn) â where the variance of expenditure for two
       out of three years was higher than the framework threshold.
   ï·   PI-4 (expenditure payment arrears) â where there are significant data gaps on arrears
       and no evidence to confirm significant reduction in the assessed period.

In six PIs both performance and scores have remained unchanged from the 2010 assessment.

For the remaining 12 PIs, performance has generally remained unchanged but the scores have
deteriorated. As noted above, this is a function of different information available at the time of
the 2014 assessment and different interpretation of available information, resulting primarily
from extended clarification and guidance in the PEFA Fieldguide.

One PI (D-3) remained not rated as the available information was not sufficient to determine a
score.

Annex 7 presents the details on the comparability of scores and changes in performance since
the 2010 PEFA assessment.

SERBIA: Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
Performance Report: Repeat Assessment

1. Introduction
1.1     Background and objectives

The objective of this PEFA repeat assessment2 is to provide the Government of Serbia with an
evaluation of the performance of its public financial management (PFM) arrangements and
practices, including identification of areas that fall short of internationally accepted good
practice, as a potential input for the preparation of a PFM reform action plan.

1.2     Process of assessment and report preparation

This assessment has been performed by a team of World Bank (WB) staff and international
consultants with experience in PEFA assessments.3 The assessment was financed jointly by the
Strengthening of Accountability and the Fiduciary Environment (SAFE) Trust Fund of the
Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), the European Union, and the WB.

Government involvement in the PEFA assessment was coordinated by the Ministry of Finance
(MoF), which assisted with logistics and communications with other Government bodies and
public sector institutions. The MoF followed up on requests for data and documents from other
organizations and ensured that staff were included and adequately briefed for meetings. The
MoF also coordinated comments on the draft report. The Team is particularly indebted to His
Excellency Mr. Dusan Vujovic, Minister of Finance, and Mr Milovan FilimonoviÄ, State
Secretary at the Ministry of Finance, for their support to the project and the extensive time
committed to the preparation of the Report.

1.2.1 Methodology

The PEFA Performance Measurement Framework is an integrated monitoring system that
allows measurement of PFM performance over a specific time period (in the case of this report,
principally from 2011-2013). The Performance Measurement Framework covers 31
performance indicators (PIs), 28 of which are structured into three categories of national
practiceâPFM system out-turns, cross-cutting features of the PFM system, and the budget
cycleâand 3 of which are donor-specific indicators.

The PEFA framework applies a scoring system to the PIs on a scale from A to D (high to low)
using methodologies, guidance, and practical tools prescribed or issued by the PEFA
Secretariat.4 The report provides background information, procedures, and processes related to
the relevant indicators to provide context and to support the scoring. It also includes a review

of economic and fiscal developments, institutional arrangements, and legal and regulatory
frameworks to explain the broader operating context of the PFM system.

The assessment is based on review of published macroeconomic and fiscal data of the central
government, documents relating to the operation of PFM systems, research studies on various
aspects of fiscal and financial management, and interviews with government officials in
relevant ministries, directorates, departments, and other institutions to collect information for
scoring the PIs.

The following comprises the activity timeline for the preparation of this PEFA report.
1. Drafting and review of the PEFA concept note (October 2014).
2. Fieldwork, first mission (November 2014).
3. PEFA introductory seminar on November 12, 2014 for more than 40 participants (mainly
    from MoF, other central government entities, EU Delegation, SECO, and WB).
4. Meetings and working sessions between team members and Government counterparts in
    all entities relevant to the PEFA assessment (November 2014).
5. Aide memoire explaining main activities, findings and next steps sent to the Government
    by WB (December 2014).
6. Informal discussion of preliminary draft assessment for all indicators with MoF (February
    2015).
7. Second field mission for discussions with key stakeholders on detailed elements of report
    and methodological issues (May 2015).
8. Draft report, (validation version) provided to Government and peer reviewers (June 2015).
9. Revised report prepared and submitted for quality assurance to PEFA Secretariat and WB
    management (June 2015).
10. Final report provided to the Government (October 2015).
11. Government publication of the final PEFA report on the MoF website (estimated: 2015).

1.2.2 Structure of the report

The remainder of the report is structured as follows:
   ï· Section 2 provides background information and the economic and fiscal context for the
       assessment.
   ï· Section 3 explains the scores for all 31 indicators.
   ï· Section 4 describes the Governmentâs PFM reform program.
   ï· Annexes 1-8 provide more detailed reference materials.

1.2.3 Quality control process

Report quality was assessed by the PEFA Secretariat and peer reviewers. The Secretariat
reviewed the draft report to establish the consistency of the assessment against the PEFA
methodology and ensure that PEFA CHECK quality assurance requirements were applied.
Further details of these processes are provided in Annex 5.




                                                                                               2
1.3     Scope

This PEFA repeat assessment covers the State budget for the central government.5 The main
PEFA assessment is designed to cover all central government institutions, irrespective of their
location or their territorial-administrative coverage as defined in the methodology. The central
government comprises a central group of ministries and departments (and in some cases de-
concentrated units such as provincial administrations), that make up a single institutional unit.

2. Country Background Information

This section provides general information about Serbia, the core characteristics of the countryâs
PFM system, and ongoing reforms. The Republic of Serbia is a landlocked Balkan country
with a population of 7.2 million. It is a multi-party democracy (all resident citizens over the
age of 18 are eligible to vote) headed by a president who serves a five-year term (and is
constitutionally limited to two terms) and who appoints a prime minister as Head of the
Government from within the 250-member unicameral National Assembly (members of which
serve four-year terms).

2.1 Economic context, development and reforms

Although Serbia is classified as an upper-middle income country, it faces significant challenges
to maintain and improve competitiveness and living standards. Economic growth was strong
during the early and mid-2000s, with economic reforms helping to stimulate new export
dynamism and significant domestic demand. However, the expansion was also fuelled by
domestic consumption, large capital inflows, and a credit boom; the 2008 downturn left Serbia
looking for new sources of growth. Like many countries in the region, the challenge for Serbia
has been to translate tenuous economic recovery into jobs and poverty reduction in a difficult
domestic and regional environment. Both unemployment and poverty rates saw sharp reversals
in the wake of the crisis: unemployment rose from below 15 percent in 2008 to nearly 25
percent in 2012, increasing most among the lowest income earners, and poverty jumped from
about 6 percent in 2008 (after falling by more than half since 2002) to more than 9 percent in
2009. To address these economic and social challenges, Serbia must improve competitiveness
and the efficiency and outcomes of its social spending.

In 2014, the Serbian economy fell into recession for the third time in six years. After a recovery
in 2013, the economy has contracted approximately 2 percent as the devastating floods of May
of 2014 took a heavy toll on industrial production.

Bank webpage6 and IMF staff reports for Article IV consultations.7

2.2 Development and reforms

2.2.1 Development and poverty reduction strategies

Impressive declines in poverty achieved throughout the 2000s reversed abruptly with the 2008
global economic and financial crisis. The poverty headcount fell by more than half from 14
percent in 2002 to 6.6 percent in 2007, according to World Bank Living Standards
Measurement Survey (LSMS) data.8 Considerable and sustained economic growth during this
period as well as the growth of pensions, other social transfers, and international remittances
led to a substantial decline in poverty in Serbia during 2002-2007. Whereas economic growth
prior to the crisis contributed to poverty reduction and shared prosperity, this progress has
declined sharply since 2008.
Serbia opened negotiations for European Union (EU) accession in January 2014. This process
includes identification of goals and objectives for Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance
(IPA) support, including public administration and PFM reform, as a core component in
relation to Chapter 32 (Financial Control) of the acquis communautaire,9 and as described in
the Pre-accession Economic Program for 2014 of the Government of Serbia.

2.2.2 Fiscal policy and fiscal development

Serbiaâs consolidated general government fiscal balance has deteriorated since 2008. Revenues
fell over the period 2008-2011, but have recovered in part as a consequence of increases in the
VAT rate. Expenditures, on the other hand, have steadily grown since the crisis. As result,
there was a deterioration of the general government fiscal deficit from around 2.6 percent of
GDP in 2008 to the peak of about 7.2 percent of GDP in 2012, which subsequently declined to
5.6 percent in 2013. The decline in fiscal deficit in 2013 was primarily due to cuts in capital
expenditures and subsidies and introduction of new rules for the indexation of salaries and
pensions in the public sector, which lowered the wage bill and spending on pensions.

  The World Bank LSMS research project was initiated in 1980 to enable policymakers to move beyond simply
measuring rates of unemployment, poverty, and so forth, to understanding the determinants of these observed

State owned enterprises (SOEs) represent a large proportion of the Serbian economy and
received substantial subsidies from the Government. About 1,300 companies remain under
state control in Serbia, with either majority ownership or effective management in state hands.
These companies employ about 280,000 workers, representing about 16 percent of formal
employment10 in Serbia and receive substantial subsidies from the Government through the
Republic of Serbia budget or local government budgets.

2.3 PFM legal and institutional framework

The high-level legal and institutional framework for public financial management (PFM) in
Serbia is established in the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia approved by referendum in
October 2006. The framework comprises three branches with specific powers over other
branches.11 The legislative branch is represented by the National Assembly with 250 members
who are elected every four years. The executive branch is led by the President of the Republic,
who is elected every five years. The president is supported by a Prime Minister12 who is
proposed by the President to the National Assembly for the same term of the National
Assembly that approved his/her election. The judicial power, independent from the executive,
is exercised by the courts.

2.3.1 Legal framework for public financial management

The highest national legal act with provisions regulating PFM is the Constitution of the
Republic of Serbia. The respective articles of the Constitution deal with taxes (Article 91),
budget (Article 92), public debt (Article 93), balanced development (Article 94), National
Bank of Serbia (Article 95) and the State Audit Institution (Article 96). In general, the
responsibilities of the Republic of Serbia in the area of PFM are covered in Part 4 and include
âcontrol of legality of managing resources of legal entities; financial audit of public finances;
collection of statistical and other data of public interest.â

The primary organic PFM law in Serbia is the Budget System Law. The annual budget is
presented out in the Law on Budget of the RoS. On the budget preparation and execution side,
the Budget System Law13 regulates preparation and review of fiscal strategy, fiscal rules,
planning, preparation, adoption, and execution of the Budget of the RoS; planning, preparation,
adoption, and execution of the budget of autonomous provinces and local self-government
units (local government budget); preparation and adoption of financial plans of the
organizations for mandatory social insurance;14 budget accounting and reporting, financial
management, control and internal audit of public funds beneficiaries, beneficiaries of the
budget of the Republic of Serbia, beneficiaries of the local government budget, and financial
plans of organizations for mandatory social insurance; scope of work and organization of the
Treasury Administration, as an authority within the Ministry of Finance, and local government
treasury, and other issues relevant for the functioning of the budget system. The Budget System
Law (BSL) provides for a calendar for budget formulation, accounting, and reporting.

The legal framework for administration of taxes is covered in the respective laws for each type
of tax (e.g., Value Added Tax Law, Customs Tariff Law, etc.), and accompanying regulations,
decrees, and by-laws.

With respect to local government, the relevant law is the Law on Local Government Finance.15
This Law stipulates local government taxation and charges, shared taxes and charges (with
central government), and how transfers from central government to local government are
determined and regulated.

The primary source of Serbian public procurement law is the Public Procurement Law (PPL)
of 2012.16 The PPL applies to procurement of goods, works, and services purchased by central
and local government authorities, SOEs, and legal persons that use funds provided by the
Government of Serbia or local self-governments. Effective April 2013, the new PPL represents
a step toward conformity with EU standards in the field of public procurement.

Work of the public sector external audit is regulated by the Law on State Audit Institution
(SAI).17

Legislative oversight is covered in the Constitution, the Law on the National Assembly,18 and
the National Assemblyâs Rules of Procedure. Particular aspects of the National Assembly remit
with respect to the work of the SAI are covered in the Law on the State Audit Institution.

The PFM legislative framework since the time of the last PEFA assessment has been marked
by frequent changes and amendments. A number of the primary laws referenced above have
been subject to amendments or have been replaced by new legislation.

2.3.2 Institutional framework

The National Assembly approves the Annual Law on the Budget of the Republic of Serbia and
the financial plans of the organizations for mandatory social insurance and the Law on the
Final Account of the Budget of the RoS. The National Assembly has a specialized body for
budget and finance, the Committee on Finance, State Budget and Control of Public Spending.
The National Assembly is also charged with adoption of the audited public accounts.

The Fiscal Council of the RoS is an independent expert body accountable to the National
Assembly. Its role is to assess the credibility of the fiscal policy from the perspective of
observance of the set fiscal rules and to ensure transparency and accountability in managing of
the fiscal policy (including opinions, analyses, and assessments).

The Ministry of Finance formulates and implements the fiscal policy, prepares the Fiscal
Strategy, manages the annual budget preparation process (which includes determining the
macro framework), holds budget hearings and prepare the annual budget for presentation to
the National Assembly. The Ministry of Finance liaises with ministries, departments, and
agencies (MDAs) and Local Governments with respect to the budget preparation process.

The Ministry of Finance consists of 10 sectors and other number of organizational units outside
of the main sectors. There are seven administrations that operate under the authority of the
Ministry of Finance: Tax Administration, Customs Administration, Treasury Administration,
Public Debt Administration, Tobacco Administration, Anti Money Laundering Administration
and Free Zone Administration.

The Treasury Administration manages cash resources, budget execution, the payroll,
accounting, and reporting through the Consolidated Treasury Account System and FMIS.
Internal financial control is implemented though financial management and control and
decentralized internal audit in the beneficiaries, with harmonization managed and performed
by the Ministry of Finance. In addition, the Ministry of Finance conducts budget inspections.

The main agencies related to tax collection19 are the Serbia Tax Administration, the Institute
for Social Insurance, the Serbia Customs Administration, and the Tobacco Administration.

The annual financial statement of the Republic of Serbia and annual financial statements of the
organizations for mandatory social insurance are subject to external audit, in compliance with
the provisions of the Law on State Audit Institution. In addition to audits of financial
statements and regularity audits, the SAI has recently introduced performance auditing.

Application of the Public Procurement Law is supervised by the Public Procurement
Administration. The Republic Commission for the Protection of Rights in Public Procurement
Procedures is an independent entity responsible for review of complaints about the
procurement procedure.




19
 Serbia has a unified system for collection of taxes and contributions that is administered by the tax agency,
what is described herein are the agencies involved in tax collection, not the tax collection flow of funds itself.
                                                                                                                     9
2.3.3 Special PFM features

Recently the institutional framework in Serbia has been marked by frequent in-year changes
to the organizational structure of government units. In addition to new budget beneficiaries
being established or abolished, there have been frequent mergers and splits, even within
principal ministries. Every year in the period under analysis has ended with a different number
of institutions from the ones agreed during the budget approval process.

Direct and Indirect Budget Beneficiaries

The budget system in the Republic of Serbia recognizes two types of budget beneficiaries:
direct and indirect. Direct Budget Beneficiaries (DBBs) are the bodies and organizations of the
Republic of Serbia. Indirect Budget Beneficiaries (IBBs) are the judicial bodies, budgetary
funds, local communities, public enterprises, other funds and directorates established by local
governments which are financed from public revenues whose purpose is established under
separate laws; institutions established by the Republic of Serbia, or the local government,
where the founder, through a DBBs, exercises legally defined rights in terms of managing and
financing. IBBs budgets are included in the DBBs overall budget at central government level
although they have some independence in the use of other sources of financing (including own
revenues). For example, the schools budget (as IBBs) is included in Ministry of Education
budget by type of expenditure (e.g., salaries). Other levels of government (for example, at
municipal level) have their own IBBs.

Treasury functions

The first characteristic feature of the PFM system in RoS is the role and function performed
by the Treasury.

The Consolidated Treasury Account System (CTAS) is the single account of the consolidated
treasury accounts of the Republic of Serbia and local government treasuries for RSD, used for
execution of payments between beneficiaries of budget funds, beneficiaries of Mandatory
Social Security Insurance Organizations and other beneficiaries of public funds included in the
CTAS, from one side, and entities not included in the CTA System, on the other side,
accounting for interbank payments. The custody over the Consolidated Treasury Account
System rests with the National Bank of Serbia.20

The CTAS serves as the government-operated payments system for the public sector in Serbia.
All budget beneficiaries, irrespective of how they are classified, have accounts/subaccounts in
the CTAS for their budget funds.

The Treasury-operated FMIS encompasses accounting and budget execution functions. On the
accounting side, the Treasury Main Ledger (TML) is maintained using the SAP software. From
the accounting perspective, the TML covers all CTA accounts.

On the budget execution side, the System for Budget Execution (SBE) is a collection of
recording accounts used to register the executed payments and realized revenues for all
payment request transactions from sub-accounts for the execution of the Budget of the

Republic of Serbia that is a part of the CTA. Article 9 of the Rulebook on Budget Execution
System elaborates on the role and purpose of the budget execution system in managing the
CTA (including the Registry of SBE Users). SBE encompasses the budget execution functions
for the accounts of all DBBs but not of IBBs. Earlier plans to sequentially extend the FMIS
coverage to all IBBs have been delayed.

Definition of central government

Coverage of central government, as defined in the Budget System Law, includes the Budget
of the Republic of Serbia and extra-budgetary funds, including the social security funds21.

The Annual Law on the Budget of the Republic of Serbia excludes the data on social security
funds and they submit their separate financial plans for adoption by the legislature and report
outside of the Final Account of the Republic of Serbia. The Budget of the Republic of Serbia
and the financial plans of the social security funds and the annual financial statements adhere
to a harmonized calendar for submission into the parliamentary procedure.

3. Assessment of the PFM Systems, Processes and Institutions
3.1 Budget credibility

PI-1. Aggregate expenditure out-turn compared to original approved budget

  Rationale for this indicator:
  PI-1 assesses the reliability of expenditure plans as a guide to budget out-turns. The closer out-
  turns are to approved budgets, the more reliance can be placed on initial budgets approved by
  parliament. Large and unpredictable variations reduce the confidence of parliaments and the
  public in governmentâs ability to prepare credible and robust budgets.

This indicator under the PEFA methodology use the consolidated budget figures as they closely
reflect total central government expenditure. Under this methodology, donor-funded projects
and debt service payments are excluded from the consolidated amounts in the calculations.

      (i) Difference between actual primary expenditure and the originally budgeted
primary expenditure

An updated Rulebook on Budget Execution System and a Budgetary Framework establishing
a single Budget Classification and Chart of Accounts for the entire government has been in
effect since January 2012 to facilitate application of the previous Rulebook whose original text
dates from 2007 and which was subsequently amended on more than one occasion. The budget
approved by the National Assembly allocates budgetary resources to entities (Budget Heads),
and in some cases, establishes the distribution of budgetary resources among operating units
or programs of the entity.

This indicator is designed to measure the validity of the budget estimates by comparing the
approved budget with the executed budget. Table 7 shows how the budget totals changed in
the years 2011-2013. Detailed calculation information can be found in Annex 2.

In each year of the period under analysis the government's organizational structure underwent
changes. Some ministries were divided into two or more entities, and new entities were created.
These changes affected budget execution and led to budget underspending in 2011, or to a
significant redistribution of funds between entities generating high variations between
budgeted amounts and those executed.

PI-2. Composition of expenditure out-turn compared to original approved budget

  Rationale for this indicator:
  PI-2 assesses the reliability of expenditure composition between main expenditure categories. It
  complements PI-1 as a guide to the reliability of budget estimates for predicting budget out-turns.
  The methodology for this indicator has changed since the last assessment with the addition of a
  second dimension relating to charging of expenditure to the contingency reserve. This new
  dimension provides an indication of how well governments are able to manage within normal
  approved budget allocations without relying on substantial contingency funds.


The methodology was revised by the PEFA Secretariat in January 2011; therefore direct
comparability with the 2010 assessment is not feasible. Table 8 shows the impact of the
methodological changes on the scores of this indicator. Applying the prior and the new
methodology to the values used in the 2010 Assessment, the score of this indicator changes
from A to B+, and the score of the first dimension changes from A to B.

As noted, the organizational structure of the government changed a number of times in recent
years; typically the changes occurred mid-fiscal year, making it necessary to split or aggregate
the in-execution budget according to the new institutional structure. (These organizational
changes impact the budget execution of the affected entities. Measurement of such impact has
not been captured under the scope of this analysis.)

The budget account22 â50031 State Fund for Emergenciesâ makes a direct reference to a
reserve for contingencies, but there are other social funds mentioned in Group 50000 that could
also be linked to emergency situations. The budget execution figures (adjusted budget provided
by the Treasury) show that the allocation and use of Group 50000 funds were insignificant (see
Table 9).

       (i) Extent of the variance in expenditure composition during the last three years,
excluding contingency items

This dimension measures the extent to which reallocations among budget heads during
execution have contributed to the variance in expenditure composition.

As shown in Table 10, the variances on expenditures were higher than 15 percent in two of the
three years period under analysis.

Score D. The variance on expenditures in two of the three years under analysis was higher than
15 percent.

       (ii) The average amount of expenditure charged to the contingency vote over the last
three years

The amount reserved and spent on emergencies and other kinds of contingency expenditures
is not significant (less than 3 percent of the original budget).

* Note: there was a change in PEFA methodology between assessments.

PI-3. Aggregate revenue out-turn compared to original approved budget

  Rationale for this indicator:
  PI-3 examines the reliability of budget revenue estimates. It assesses the variance between the
  original budget revenue estimates approved by parliament and the final revenue out-turns. As with
  the expenditure variances, the larger the variation, the lower the score, reflecting lower confidence
  in the predictive value of approved budget estimates. The PEFA methodology for measurement of
  this indicator changed in 2011, which resulted in recognition of underestimates of annual revenue
  as well as overestimates. Overestimates of revenue received were the sole focus of the pre-2011
  performance assessment criteria.

 (i)     Actual revenue compared to revenue in the originally approved budget
The PEFA methodology for assessing this indicator was revised in January 2011. For this
reason, a direct comparison with the 2010 assessment is not possible.

Government domestic revenues, as referred to in the Budget Law, include tax revenues, non-
tax revenues and grants. All revenues, including the own generated revenues from direct and
indirect budget beneficiaries are deposited in the Treasury, registered in the Treasury system,
and reported in the year-end Budget Report, as well as in its institutional or sectoral reports
when applicable.

Table 11 shows the revenue values, as approved by the Annual Budget Law, and as executed
and reported in the year-end reports of budget execution for the analyzed years.

PI-4. Stock and monitoring of expenditure payment arrears

     Rationale for this indicator:
     PI-4 considers whether there was an accumulation of expenditure arrears and, if so, whether
     efforts were made to control the situation.

     The first dimension of this indicator assessed the significance of expenditure arrears data at the
     end of 2013. The second dimension examined whether information on arrears is collected
     regularly and is assessed, using data from 2012 and 2013.

The Fiscal Council,23 per Article 92 of the Budget System Law (2010 amendment), must
analyze and report to the National Assembly on budgetary issues and fiscal performance. In
2013, it informed the National Assembly about a significant increase in arrears in the Health
Sector.24

The âLaw on Deadlines for Payments in Commercial Transactionsâ which came into effect on
March 31, 2013 in Article 2.7, defines payment arrears25 (referred as âoutstanding paymentsâ
in the English-language version of the Law), as well as new rules limiting the possibility of
generating new âoutstanding paymentsâ by public entities. The Law specifically outlines limits
on payment deadlines for new transactions (Art. 3-4);26 rights of creditors on applying late
payment fees (Art. 5-7); control and monitoring responsibilities (Art. 8-9); penalties to entities
and officers who do not comply with this Law (Art.12); and a progressive schedule for
implementing the Law (Art. 13-16).


23
   The Fiscal Council is an independent state body established by the Budget System Law, accountable to the
National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia, which appoints its members (of whom there are three).
24
   âIn the past few years, there was a significant increase in government arrears, especially in health, local self -
government and for the maintenance of road infrastructure. The total amount of these arrears reached more than
1% of GDP â¦â (Assessment of the Draft 2013 Budget Law, page 6, Fiscal Council, November 13, 2012). With
respect to the Health Sector, the same report states (page 34): âThe estimate is that arrears in the health care
system will amount to around RSD 32.5 billion by end-2012.â
25
   âOutstanding paymentâ is a payment to be made by the public sector or a business entity that has not been paid
to a creditor by the contractual deadline, or by the statutory deadline, where a contract does not stipulate one or
where no written contract has been entered into.
26
   The Law establishes as a general rule that a contract between a public sector body and a business entity may
not stipulate a payment deadline that exceeds 45 days (or 60 days if the business entity is the debtor in such
contractual relationship). There are some exceptions included in the law related to specific institutions, such as
Health Insurance or Health Insurance beneficiaries.
                                                                                                                            17
Data on arrears are collected on a quarterly basis by the Macro-Fiscal Analysis Department
(MFAD) of the Ministry of Finance. This data includes information about all DBBs of the
Republican Budget and of the social funds, and of two public enterprises in the infrastructure
sector (Roads of Serbia and Corridors of Serbia). This data is not verified to establish whether
it represents the total stock of existing arrears. Data on arrears is also collected by the Treasury
through the FMIS system, where it is referred to unpaid bills that are registered in the system
but do not have a corresponding payment order issued.

In 2013 during the months of April and July, the government negotiated payment plans and
conversion for 8.26 billion RSD of Payment arrears. At the end of 2013, as shown in Table 12,
there was a remaining balance of about 85 billion RSD as payable accounts that are constituted
as follows: 5.5 billion RSD were arrears from previous years; 7.5 billion RSD were payable
accounts balances up to 30 days; 4 billion RSD were payable accounts between 30 and 90
days; and 5.5 billion RSD were payable accounts (or payment arrears) of more than 90 days.
The remaining 60 billion RSD were accrued budgetary expenditure incurred during the year,
pending to be paid. The 2013 Budget Execution Report shows that at the end of the year, it
was executed and accrued an amount of 62 billion RSD higher than the recorded budget
appropriations.

(i)        Stock of expenditure payment arrears

This dimension measures the stock of arrears at the end of 2013 and how such stock has
changed, 2011-2013 (as described above).

As a result of the implementation of the Law on Deadlines for Payments in Commercial
Transactions, arrears in 2013 declined27 and are expected to experience additional progressive
reductions in the near future.



27
 At the end of 2013, the FMIS system reported total arrears of about RSD 84,942 million, which compared with
RSD 1,396,229 million spent in that year (or about 6.08% of total expenditures).
                                                                                                                              19
Fiscal statistics do not show that arrears were reduced by more than 25 percent in the last two
years.


Score C. Stock of arrears as reported by the Treasury was higher than 2 percent of the total
expenditures in 2013 and there is not clear evidence of a significant reduction in the period
under analysis.

(ii)         Availability of data to monitor the stock of expenditure payment arrears

This dimension measures whether the available data on the stock of arrears is comprehensive
and accurate.

As also noted above, Treasury and MFAD collect and report information on arrears, but such
information is not comprehensive since many entities do not report arrears even though they
are part of the central government (for example, some IBBs). There is no evidence that a
comprehensive ad-hoc exercise to determine the total amount of arrears was conducted in the
last two years.28 Itâs not possible from the text of the previous PEFA assessment to confirm
that the performance of this type of exercises were considered in rating the dimension as the
management practice seems to be consistent throughout the period considered.

Score D. There is no reliable and comprehensive data on arrears for the last two years.

3.2 Comprehensiveness and transparency

PI-5. Classification of the budget

      Rationale for this indicator:
      PI-5 assesses the classification system used for the formulation, execution and reporting of the
      central government budget. It considers the scope, content and consistency of the classification
      system as a basis for producing consistent reports and information on all aspects of the budget. The
      reference period for this indicator is the last completed FY (2013).



28
  It is not clear whether the failure of indirect beneficiaries of the Republic Budget to report arrears was considered
as a factor for analysis in the 2010 PEFA assessment.
                                                                                                                           20
(i)      The classification system used for formulation, execution and reporting of the
         central government budget

The Rulebook on Budget Execution System and the Budgetary Framework establish a single
Budget Classification and Chart of Accounts for the government.

This classification includes administrative, functional, and economic categories, and
definitions for each category consistent with the Government Financial Statistics manual
(GFS) 2001 and the Classifications of the Functions of Government (CoFoG) main functional
classification.

Score A. The budget formulation and execution is based on administrative, economic, and sub-
functional classification, using GFS/COFOG standards.

PI-6. Comprehensiveness of information included in budget documentation

  Rationale for this indicator:
  PI-6 examines the extent of information provided to the legislature in relation to the annual budget.
  It assesses whether nine important elements are presented in an appropriate format to allow for a
  broad understanding of the assumptions, key indicators, and intentions underpinning the budget
  proposal.

  The indicator considers the last budget presented to the legislature during the assessment period,
  which was in November 2013, relating to the 2014 financial year.

(i)      Share of essential information contained in budget documentation most recently
         issued by the central government

This indicator analyses the extent to which the annual budget and its supporting
documentation, as submitted to the legislature for scrutiny and approval, enables a complete
picture of central government fiscal forecasts, budget proposals and outturn of previous years.
This analysis is based on the documentation submitted for the 2014 budget approval, since
until the end of the PEFA mission in November of 2014, the 2015 budget had not been
submitted to the National Assembly.

The Budget System Law (BSL) describes the documentation that must be submitted to the
National Assembly for revision and approval of the Annual Budget.


                                                                                                                     21
The PEFA methodology requires that in addition to detailed information on revenues and
expenditures, and in order to be considered complete, the annual budget documentation should
contain the information displayed in Table 15.

PI-7. Extent of unreported government operations

  Rationale for this indicator:
  PI-7 assesses the comprehensiveness of financial information in respect to all budgetary and non-
  budgetary activities of the central government. The reference period for this indicator is the last
  completed FY (2013).

This indicator measures the extent to which fiscal reports that are made available to the public
contain full information on revenues and expenditures of the central government and its
autonomous entities, across all categories and financing. The reference period for analysis is
2013.

The PEFA methodology seeks to (i) identify MDAs that operate outside the budget system,
and (ii) quantify the income and expenditure that does not appear in budgetary reports.

(i)      The level of extra-budgetary expenditure (other than donor-funded projects) not
         included in fiscal reports

This dimension assesses the level of unreported extra-budgetary operations at the central
government level, and covers planned/budgeted expenditure, actual expenditure, and annual
financial statements either through consolidation with other central government expenditure or
shown in a separate document presented to the National Assembly.

The budget system has some weaknesses in its institutional coverage and in-year monitoring
and reporting. As operations of indirect budget beneficiaries are not included or monitored in
the budget execution system (although the final budget execution of most of them are included
in the year-end Budget Execution Report), it is not possible to assemble a complete picture of
central government finances. There are references to the existence of unreported operations,
most of them referred to operations originated from own-revenues and expenditures executed
with such funds by indirect budget beneficiaries, but it is not possible to quantify such
operations. This lack of information makes it difficult to quantify the extent and amounts of
operations that are not timely or properly reported.

Score NR. It is not possible to quantify with certainty the amount of unreported operations of
the central government.



                                                                                                                23
(ii)         Income and expenditure information on donor-funded projects are included in
             fiscal reports

This dimension identifies the level of inclusion of donor-funded programsâ revenues and
expenditures in fiscal reports, and covers planned/budgeted expenditure, actual expenditure,
and annual financial statements either through consolidation with other central government
expenditure or as shown in a separate document presented to the Assembly.

Donor-funded programs are included in the Annual Budget Law, and in the year-end Budget
Execution Report. All DBBs report on a quarterly basis their budget execution through the
FMIS system. The report includes the project execution of its IBBs. Not all the received grants
are included in fiscal reports. The SEIO-ISDACON database shows that in 2013 the
international cooperation system disbursed about 131 billion RSD (1,098 million Euros
equivalent) from which 35 billion RSD were grants. The budget system reported just 1,328
million RSD as received grants. In 2013, 27 percent of the cooperation disbursements was
financed by grants.

Score B. Complete income/expenditure information is included in fiscal reports for all loan
financed projects and at least 50 percent (by value) of grant financed projects.

PI-8. Transparency of intergovernmental fiscal relations

      Rationale for this indicator:
      PI-8 assesses transparency and timeliness of inter-governmental fiscal relations and the extent to
      which consolidated fiscal data is reported. The reference period for this indicator is the last
      completed FY (2013).

The starting point for an assessment of inter-governmental fiscal relations is to identify
subnational administrations. In Serbia this includes five regions (Belgrade, Vojvodina,
Sumadija and western Serbia, eastern and southern Serbia, and Kosovo-Metohija), the City of
Belgrade as a separate territorial unit established by the Constitution and law, and 29
administrative areas, 23 cities,29 28 urban municipalities, 150 other municipalities, 6,158
villages and 195 urban settlements.30

                                                                                                                    24
The institutional core element of Local Government (LG) is the municipality, which directly
administers its responsibilities, through institutions funded by its budget but organized as
separate institutions (indirect budget beneficiaries) and through local enterprises. Collectively,
Local Governments account for about 15 percent of total general government spending, and
about 20 percent of total public employment.31

From the perspective of the legal framework, the Law on Local Government Finance (2006)
is the principal determinant of inter-governmental fiscal relations with respect to transfer of
funds. It mandates that âoverview of non-categorical transfers per local government units shall
be prepared by the Ministry of Finance in cooperation with the Commission for
Intergovernmental Finances, and that ânon-categorical transfer shall be allocated to the local
government unit up to 25th day of the month for the previous month in the amount of one-
twelfth of the amount foreseen for the particular fiscal year.â32

On a practical level, one critical factor in inter-governmental fiscal relations is the Budget
System Law, which permits the MoF to suspend transfers to local authorities that do not
comply with requirements for financial management, even when technical limitations of the
system prevent LGs from recording transactions. The result of the disruptive effects of
suspending transfers is to exacerbate the difficulties of LGs managing within their allocations.

During the period of PEFA review, the system for intergovernmental fiscal relations changed
in several ways, including alterations in the formula for distributing revenues from the personal
income tax in favor of LGs in 2011, followed by the reduction of this tax in 2013, and
elimination of a number of local fees and charges in 2013 and 2014. Such changes, particularly
when announced mid-fiscal year, create problems for Local Governmentsânot least on the
revenue front, which has led many LGs to either increase borrowing, accumulate arrears, or
under-deliver assigned public services. With respect to the first two options, it is important to
note that during these years the Law on Public Debt was amended to allow in practice
borrowing by LGs, including through municipal bonds.33

Transfers to municipalities and cities are included in the Budget of the Republic as a total
amount and the distribution to each beneficiary is shown in the Revised Memorandum/ Fiscal
Strategy, which must be issued by October 1. Table 16 shows the actual dates on which the
Revised Memorandum/ Fiscal Strategy was adopted by the Government and promulgated to
municipalities and cities.
Transfers to local governments are recorded in account 463 of the economic classification of
the budget. The Budget Law explicitly indicates the amounts assigned to each group of
beneficiaries (municipalities and cities, Vojvodina territory, and others) in its summary tables,
and the year-end Budget Execution Report uses the same classification to report the actual
expenditures. The central government budget execution as reported in the year-end Budget
Execution Report shows that the deviation of the actual amount transferred to âother levels of
governmentâ for the last three completed years was lower than 10 percent (see Table 17).

(i)        Transparent and rules-based systems in the allocation among sub-national
           governments of transfers from central government

This dimension assesses the criteria applied for distributing central government funds among
subnational governments (SNGs). The critical period of time for this review is 2013.
The Law on Local Government Finance (2006), in Section 2 - Revenues from other Levels of
Government - explicitly defines the types of transfers and their objectives, as well as the timing
and procedures for calculating the amount to each government and for coordinating,
announcing, transferring or suspending the transfer of funds.

As identified and described in the 2010 PEFA assessment, the legal framework that rules the
horizontal distribution of funds among SNGs is comprehensive and clear, whether it refers to
the calculation of the assigned amount to each SNG or the application of sanctions or the
temporary suspension of the transfer to some local governments.

  A Calendar for local government budget has been established in the Budget System Law:
  (1) 15 June - local government finance authority issues the instruction for the preparation of the draft local
  government budget.
  (2) 1 September - direct beneficiaries of the local government budget submit the draft financial plan to the
  local government finance authority for the budget year and the two following fiscal years.
  (3) 15 October - local government finance authority submits Draft Budget Decision to the local government
  executive authority.
  (4) 1 November - local government executive authority submits the Proposed Budget Decision to the local
  government assembly.
  (5) 20 December - local government assembly adopts the local government Budget Decision.
  (6) 25 December - local government finance authority furnishes the Minister with the local government
  Budget Decision.


As shown in Table 17, the actual transferred amount in 2013 was almost 97 percent of the
budgeted amount by its monthly distribution there is a uniformity on disbursements throughout
the year.

Despite the difficulties that the application of the legal procedures may create for some local
governments, it is possible to affirm that âthe horizontal allocation of almost all transfers (at

                                                                                                                   27
least 90%34 by value) from central government is determined by transparent and rules-based
systems,â as defined by the PEFA methodologyâresulting in a score of A.

Score A. Approximately 97 percent of all the budgeted transfers from the central government
to SNGs were calculated and transferred in a timely manner and applying transparent and
systemic rules.

       (ii)      Timeliness of reliable information to sub-national governments on their
                 allocations from central government for the coming year

This dimension assesses the predictability of the allocation of funds to SNGs, measuring how
timely, firm, and reliable the information provided to them is, so they can plan and budget their
spending programs. The critical period for this review is 2013.

As already noted, the detailed allocation of funds for each city and municipality is defined in
the Revised Memorandum/Fiscal Strategy prepared by the central government.

According to the budget calendar defined by the Article 31 of the Budget System Law for local
governments, on October 15 the âlocal government finance authority shall submit Draft Budget
Decision to the local government executive authority.â

According to the budgetary legal framework, local governments have at least two weeks to
adjust their budgets before completing their budget proposals; however, in practice, they are
not able to acquire all the necessary information from the beginning of their budget preparation
process. As showed in Table 16, the Fiscal Strategy showing the amounts that will be
transferred to SNG for the year 2013 was adopted on November 28, which was several weeks
after the local governments must submit their budgets for approval by their executive
authorities.

The timing of the information provided to SNG differs from the one assessed during the
previous PEFA and deteriorated as in 2013 amounts were announced after SNG prepared their
budgets.

Score D. Reliable estimates on transfers are issued but only after SGN budget preparation
processes have been finalized.

(iii)         Extent to which consolidated fiscal data is collected and reported for general
              government according to sectoral categories

The budget classification used by the central government applies to all public entity
beneficiaries of the Budget of the Republic and facilitates the consolidation of fiscal data on
revenues and expenditures. All public entities must report their budget execution on a quarterly
basis to the Ministry of Finance. The monthly Public Financial Bulletin published by the
Ministry of Finance as well as the Year-end Budget Execution Report issued every year in
June, shows consolidated fiscal data of the General Government. Since 2005, all Local
Governments report monthly on their budget execution to the Ministry of Finance.


34
     The 90 % percentage figure is consequence of sanctions on local governments that affect part of the transfer.
                                                                                                                28
Score A. Fiscal information ex-ante and ex-post of the General Government is consolidated
on a monthly basis by the Ministry of Finance and published the following month in the Public
Finance Bulletin.

PI-9. Oversight of aggregate fiscal risk from other public sector entities

  Rationale for this indicator:
  PI-9 assesses the extent to which central governments monitor fiscal risks with national
  implications that arise from the activities of other general government sector entities. Fiscal risks
  can take the form of government guarantees, operational losses caused by quasi-fiscal operations,
  and expenditure payment arrears.

  The reference period for this indicator is the last completed FY (2013).

This indicator assesses whether the central government has a formal oversight role in relation
to other public sector entities; if it has implemented procedures for monitoring and managing
fiscal risks arising from activities of SNGs, autonomous government agencies (AGAs) and
public enterprises (PEs), including state-owned banks; and whether it has responsibility for
financial default of other public sector entities.

As a consequence of the high and increased level of deficit that has been reported in recent
years by the public sector, fiscal risk monitoring has become an issue of heightened relevance
for the Ministry of Finance.
                                                                                                                      29
Serbia still had about 1,300 state-controlled enterprises (state-owned and socially owned
enterprises).35 In 2010, the overall losses of the state-owned, socially owned, and public
enterprisesâwhich receive direct budget subsidies, thus contributing to the fiscal deficitâ
approximated â¬1 billion (approximately 3.5 percent of GDP).36 The overall government
expenditures for assistance to these enterprises (direct subsidies, service buyoff transfers, and
guaranteed loans for cost servicing) were approximately 2.7 percent of GDP in 2010 and
approximately 2.3 percent in 2011.37 That financial assistance that could occur without
provision in terms of amount and timing implies that these are significant fiscal risks.

The substantial fiscal imbalance between the Republican and local government levels is a
consequence of sundry unilateral and unplanned changes in law in recent years. By mid-2011
changes to the law on financing local self-governments raised available funds at the local level
by RSD 40 billion annually and devolved some responsibilities. Thus, for example, in February
2012, the Republican government re-classified approximately 6,000 kms of regional roads into
local roads, with RSD 4 billion of costs for their maintenance entrusted to local governments.
However, by the time of the 2013 draft budget, the Republican government agreed to fully
assume the cost for maintaining these roads. Then, changes in law in the fall 2012 limited or
abolished certain source revenues of local self-governments (the so-called quasi-fiscal
charges); the anticpated consequences is that âthe revenues of local self-governments will
decline by RSD 5-6 billion annually.â38 All those decisions affect fiscal risk and could result
in unexpected financing costs for the Government.


(i)      Extent of central government monitoring of the autonomous government
         agencies and public enterprises.

This dimension assesses the manner in which the central government requires and receives
quarterly financial statements and audited year-end statements from AGAs and PEs, and
monitors performance against financial targets.

In 2014, in response to a recently implemented reform and with a view to generating a database
of AGA and PE information, the Department for Control and Supervision of Public Enterprises
of the Ministry of Economy begun receiving and monitoring the financial plans and financial
reports of 681 Local Public Enterprises and 24 Central Government Public Enterprises, on a
quarterly basis (Audited year-end statements of these entities have not yet been received.)
Since many of these entities have not yet fully provided their fiscal information, and given the
limited resources assigned to the Department, it has not been possible to produce consolidated
and comprehensive reports of the sectorâand hence not possible to effectively monitor the
sector.



35
    This number is anticipated to decline significantly as a consequence of the Privatization Law that took effect
in August 2014, at least as regards socially owned enterprises, which (unlike state-owned capital) face a
mandatory deadline originally set for December 2015.
36
    In addition, these enterprises receive various forms of indirect subsidies, such as government guarantees for
loans, tax holidays, and âlinking of the years of service,â which increases the current and future public
expenditures and reduces public revenues.

Score D. There is no evidence of annual monitoring of AGAs and PEs in 2013. Monitoring
activities from the Ministry of Economy started in 2014.

(ii)     Extent of central government monitoring of fiscal positions in sub-national
         governments

This dimension assesses the manner in which the central government requires and receives annual
financial statements from SNGs and monitors performance against financial targets.

As identified in the 2010 PEFA assessment, local governments are permitted to borrow, but
the Ministry of Finance must review and approve the operation prior to the signature on the
borrowing contract. Additionally, local government revenues and expenditures are managed
through Local Treasuries, which report to the National Treasury. Those funds are recorded in
the Treasury General Ledger.

Consolidated fiscal information of the local government sector is published on a monthly basis
in the Public Financial Bulletin issued by the Ministry of Finance. The Public Debt
Administration of the MoF monitors the fiscal risk associated with SNGs, and produce monthly
and quarterly reports that shows updated information on local governments indebtedness. The
area of Public Debt Analysis and Risk Management of the Public Debt Administration
monitors continoually monitor the risk generated by SNGs.

Score A. The central government monitors monthly the SNG fiscal position. The SNG
consolidated fiscal position is included in the monthly Public Finance Bulletin and in the Public
Debt Reports.

PI-10. Public access to fiscal information

  Rationale for this indicator:
  PI-10 assesses the extent to which information on central governmentsâ budgets and their
  execution is readily accessible to the general public. The reference period for this indicator is the
  last completed FY (2013).

(i)     The number of elements for which public access to information is available
        (based on specifications in the PEFA Performance Measurement Framework)

This indicator analyzes the degree of transparency in the public management of finances with
respect to the accessibility of information on fiscal plans, positions and performance of the
government by the general public or at least by the relevant interest groups. This analysis is
based on the documentation relevant to the last completed fiscal year (2013). The PEFA
methodology specifies the essential elements of information to which public should have
access (see Table 18).

The Government through the Cabinet of Ministers (CoM), not the MoF, is responsible for
submitting the budget proposal (the essential elements of which are specified in the Budget
System Law) to the National Assembly. It is the Government which reviews/amends the MoF
proposals, adopts the final budgetary proposal, and prepares the final document that is
submitted to the Assembly. This document is not readily available (e.g., through the Internet)
to the public. The public has easy access (through the MoF website) only to the final version
of the documents prepared by the Ministry of Finance and to the Approved Budget Law.

PI-11. Orderliness and participation in the annual budget process

     Rationale for this indicator:
     PI-11 assesses the existence and application of regular procedures for formulating annual budgets
     and the involvement of political leadership and the legislature.

     Dimensions (i) and (ii) consider the last budget approved by the legislature (2014). The last three
     FY budgets approved are considered (2012-2014) for dimension (iii).

This indicator assesses the organization, clarity and comprehensiveness of the annual budget
preparation process.

With respect to organization, clarity and comprehensiveness, the budget process in Serbia
suffers from evident shortcomings as reported by the Fiscal Council and as noted in previously
reviewed PIs, including the following:39
        ï· annual budget laws are usually not applied in practice, while medium-term budget
            limits are not followed at all

        ï·    lack of transparency and accounting of expenditures âbelow the lineâ for certain
             public enterprises and state banks (which are thus not visible in the Budget Law)
        ï·    the omission of a large number of quasi-fiscal institutions and agencies from the
             regular budget procedures
        ï·    lack of a monitoring system for arrears and commitments
        ï·    absence of a credible framework for managing the budget negotiations at the

        ï·    failure to separate costs of existing activities from new public policy measures.

The Article 31 of the Budget Calendar of the Budget System Law defines the budget
calendar applicable for the Central and Local Governments as follows40:
        âThe process of the preparation and adoption of the budget and financial plans of organizations for
        mandatory social insurance shall be carried out according to the budget calendar, as follows:
        1) Calendar for the Republic of Serbia level:
          a) 15 March â direct beneficiaries of the budget of the Republic of Serbia shall furnish the
              Ministry with the proposals for determining priority areas of financing for the budget year and
              the two following fiscal years;
          b) 1 April â the Government, at an agreed proposal of the Ministry and special Government body,
              shall determine priority financing areas, including national investment priorities for the budget
              year and the following two fiscal years;
          c) 10 April â Government shall organize a public hearing on priority areas of financing, also
              including national investment priorities for the budget year and the next two fiscal years;
          d) 30 April â the Minister, in cooperation with ministries and institutions in charge of economic
              policy and system, shall prepare the Memorandum, which shall contain economic and fiscal
              policy of the Government with projections for the budget year and the two following fiscal
              yearsâtaking into account the public hearing;
          e) 15 May â Government shall adopt the Memorandum;
          f) 1 June â the Minister shall adopt the instruction for the preparation of draft budget of the
              Republic of Serbia;
          g) 1 June â the Minister shall submit the Memorandum to local government and organizations for
              mandatory social insurance;
          h) 1 September- direct beneficiaries of the budget of the Republic of Serbia and organizations for
              mandatory social insurance shall submit draft medium-term and financial plan to the Ministry;
          i) 1 October â upon the proposal of the Minister, the Government shall adopt the revised
              Memorandum, together with information on financial and other effects of new policies, taking
              into account the macroeconomic framework updated after 30 April;
          j) 15 October â the Minister shall furnish the Government with the Draft Law on the Budget of the
              Republic of Serbia, draft decisions on giving consent to financial plans of organizations for
              mandatory social insurance, accompanied by said financial plans;
          k) 1 November â Government shall adopt the Proposed Law on the Budget of the Republic of
              Serbia and shall submit it, together with the revised Memorandum, the proposed decisions on
              giving consent to financial plans of organizations for mandatory social insurance, and said
              financial plans, to the National Assembly;
          l) 15 December - National Assembly shall adopt the Law on the Budget of the Republic of Serbia
              and decisions on giving consent to financial plans of organizations for mandatory social
              insurance;
        2) Calendar for local government budget:
          a) 15 June âlocal government finance authority shall issue the instruction for the preparation of
              the draft local government budget;




40
  Note that from 2012 the Memorandum was replaced by the Fiscal Strategy, which is a document that has
similar content, but with a strengthened focus on fiscal issues and medium-term policies and projections.
                                                                                                            34
          b) 1 September â direct beneficiaries of the local government budget shall submit the draft
             financial plan to the local government finance authority for the budget year and the two
             following fiscal years;
          c) 15 October - local government finance authority shall submit Draft Budget Decision to the local
             government executive authority;
          d) 1 November - local government executive authority shall submit the Proposed Budget Decision
             to the local government assembly;
          e) 20 December - local government assembly shall adopt the local government Budget Decision;
          f) 25 December - local government finance authority shall furnish the Minister with the local
             government Budget Decision.
Dates indicated in Paragraph 1 hereof shall mean the due dates of the budget calendar. The Minister shall
prescribe the procedure and schedule for the preparation of the medium-term scope of funds to be considered
and adopted by the Government in the process of Memorandum adoption.â

(i)     Existence and adherence to a fixed budget calendar

This dimension assesses how well the budget preparation and approving processes adhere to a
fixed budget calendar, focusing on the time that ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs)
have to complete their detailed estimates. The critical period of time refers to the processes of
2013; the assessment is based on the 2014 budget.

There is a comprehensive budgeting calendar, which is set out in the Budget System Law;
however, in practice some of the processes do not adhere to the requirements stated in the Law.
More importantly, the substantive intent of the Law is rendered ineffective, because
informationâeven if promptly sent and receivedâdoes not actually influence the final content
of the budget. This is a consequence of the failure to adequately separate costs of existing
programs from new policies from existing ones, and the fact that the prescribed limits for
individual budget beneficiaries are not respected, undermining the credibility of plans that are
subsequently presented in the Fiscal Strategy. In addition, although the budget calendar
stipulates that the Government shall submit the Draft Fiscal Strategy to the Fiscal Council by
the end of April, this deadline has not been met in the previous three years.41 Therefore, the
Fiscal Strategies were usually drafted at the end of the year, together with the Draft Budget for
the coming year. Failure to comply with the budget calendar further damages the credibility of
the budget process and contributes to the situation where budget beneficiaries usually spend
more than the amount that was prescribed in the Budget Lawâthus requiring budget revisions
during the year.

Some critical elements for preparing the budget by the public entities are not disseminated on
time, or do not include adequate information for budget preparation. Such is the case of the
Budget Proposal for the year 2014, which was submitted to the legislature on Novermber 1,
2013, before the adoption by the Government of the Fiscal Strategy for the same year. The
Fiscal Strategy was adopted by the Government on November 28, 2013, four weeks after the
Budget Proposal was submitted to the legislature.

Since these weaknesses mainly originate in the Ministry of Finance, their adverse impact
affects the entirety of the budget preparation process, suggesting that the calendar does not
effectively determine dates of delivery, which are largely nominal in impact.

Unlike in the 2010 PEFA assessment, MoF practices with respect to specific timeframes for
providing information to budgetary entities have adversely affected the score of this dimension.

Score C. Substantial delays by the Ministry of Finance in providing key information to entities
for the preparation of their budgets suggests that the budget calendar does not effectively
determine dates of delivery, which are largely nominal in impact, and thus do not qualify for a
B score.

(ii)     Guidance on the preparation of budget submissions

This dimension assesses political involvement in preparing guidelines and instructions for the
preparation of the budget by entities. As with the preceeding dimension, the period of reference
is 2013, for the 2014 budget.

The key element to guide entitiesâ budget preparation is the Fiscal Strategy containing the
economic and fiscal policy of the Government, with projections for the budget year and the
two following fiscal years. Political involvement in this document is clear and mandatory, per
the Budget System Law, since the Fiscal Strategy must be adopted by the Government before
May 15 prior to its distribution to entities. Budgetary ceilings for each entity are defined in this
document.

Score A. A comprehensive and clear Fiscal Strategy is issued to MDAs, which embodies
ceilings approved by the Government.

(iii)    Timely approval of the budget by the legislature

The critical period of time refers to the processes carried out in 2012, 2013 and 2014 (2013,
2014 and 2015 budgets).

Good practice requires that the Annual Budget Law be approved before the beginning of the
budgeted fiscal year (January 1 in Serbia), and this dimension measure the frequency and
extent in which delays ocurred in such processes. The following Table shows that the Serbian
Budget of the Republic has always been approved before the beginning of the new fiscal
year.

PI-12. Multi-year perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure policy and budgeting

     Rationale for this indicator:
     PI-12 examines the existence and operation of more advanced features of public sector budgeting,
     including medium-term fiscal forecasts, functional allocations, debt sustainability analysis,
     sectoral strategies and integration of investment budgets with medium-term estimates.

     Dimension (i) considers the last two completed FYs (2012 and 2013), dimension (ii) considers the
     last three years (2011, 2012 and 2013), dimensions (iii) and (iv) consider the last completed
     budget (2013).

This indicator assesses how expenditure policy decisions have multi-year implications, and are
aligned with the availability of resources in the medium-term perspective. Medium-term
frameworks are predicated upon a credible projection of budget expenditures that finance
existing commitments; and the previous commentary and reportage42 has indicated the factors
that undermine budget credibility in Serbia.

(i)    Preparation of multi-year fiscal forecasts and functional allocations

This dimension assesses (a) the forecast of fiscal aggregates and whether it includes
expenditure estimates for the main budgetary categories (economic and functional or
administrative classification); (b) the number of years projected on a rolling annual basis; and
(c) whether there is a clear link between the multi-year estimates and the subsequent setting of
annual budget ceilings. The critical period of time refers to the last two completed fiscal years
(2012 and 2013 budgets).

With the 2010 implementation of the Budget System Law, a three-year expenditure framework
was introduced to improve the budget process and medium-term forecasting. As noted in the
Budget System Law, the Fiscal Strategy must contain, among other matters, â(i) mid-term
projections of macroeconomic aggregates and indicators; (ii) mid-term projections of fiscal
aggregates and indicators; â¦ (vi) medium-term public investment priorities; (vii) overview of
priority financing areas and proposed new policies; (viii) MTEF of the budget of the Republic
of Serbia with the overall scope of expenditure per budget beneficiary for the budget year and
the two following fiscal years; (ix) assessment and quantification of fiscal risks and potential
liabilities; (x) strategy for the management of the Republic of Serbia public debt, for the period
covered by the Fiscal Strategy.â
The overall scope of expenditure per budget beneficiary for the budget year and the two
following fiscal years was included in the Fiscal Strategy that referred to the budget year 2013
and projections for 2014 and 2015 (the Fiscal Strategy for budget year 2012 was described in
the document âMemorandum on budget, economic and fiscal policyâ issued on January 2012,
after the approval of the Budget by the legislature). The expenditure ceiling limits defined for
the budget are respected when the budget is prepared, but there is not a clear link between the
projections for the next two years and the budgets that will be prepared for such years. The
forecast includes projections on GDP values of the main categories of the economical
classification. As mentioned in the Fiscal Strategy document, several changes were introduced
in the government organization and in the legal framework that are impacting the accuracy of
projections.

Score C. Forecasts of fiscal aggregates (on the basis of the main categories of economic
classification and budget beneficiaries) are prepared for at least two years on a rolling annual
basis, but the link between the projected forecast and the subsequent budgets is not clear.

(ii)   Scope and frequency of debt sustainability analyses

This dimension assesses the frequency and scope of debt sustainability analyses. The period of
reference is the last three completed fiscal years (2011, 2012, and 2013).
The National Bank of Serbia annually produces an external debt sustainability analysis (DSA)
using a self-developed model that allows a simultaneous projection of GDP, balance of
payments, prices and the exchange rate. Additionally, the Public Debt Administration of the
Ministry of Finance annually analyzes the public debt using the criteria set out in the Maastricht
Agreement, which is a systematized guideline aimed at attaining public debt and fiscal system
sustainability. The results of these analysisâ are included in the Debt Management Section of
the Fiscal strategy.

Score A. DSA for external and domestic debt has been undertaken annually since 2010.
                                                                                               38
(iii)     Existence of sectoral strategies with multi-year costing of recurrent and
          investment expenditure

This dimension assesses the sector development strategies, focusing on the amount of primary
expenditure that is based on fully-costed sector strategies during the last year.
The priorities of the Government are set out in the Prime Ministerâs formal exposition to the
National Assembly and are included in the Government Annual Work Plan (GAWP), which is
a non-public document.

Every year, as part of the budget preparation process, on March 15 the âdirect beneficiaries of
the budget of the Republic of Serbia shall furnish the Ministry with the proposals for
determining priority areas of financing for the budget year and the two following fiscal years.â
Although the budgetary entities must provide their priorities to the ministry, there is no
evidence that such priorities are part of a sector-costed strategy.

In recent years, the fiscal strategies summarized in the Memorandum of the Budget or the
Fiscal Strategy have increased their focus on reducing the fiscal deficit and on public debt
management and sustainability, instead of sector development strategies. âThe main goal of
fiscal policy in the future is moving towards and within sustainable levels of deficit and debt,
as defined by the fiscal rules. With fiscal capacity at the present level, the sustainable level of
deficit and, consequently, public debt can only be achieved by reducing government public
expenditures.â (Fiscal Strategy for 2014, with Projections for 2015 and 2016, Ministry of
Finance, 2013.)

A review of the allocation of funds projected for budgetary beneficiaries in the Fiscal Strategies
for 2013 and 2014 suggests that these are primarily based on fiscal criteria that is not reconciled
with, nor has taken into consideration sector development planning costs, thus discouraging
the preparation of costed-strategies by budgetary entities.

Score D. Sector strategies may have been prepared for some sectors, but none of them have
substantiated complete investment-costing and recurrent expenditures.

(iv)      Links between the investment budget and future expenditure estimates

This dimension assesses the strength of the links between investment decisions and sector
strategies and their recurrent cost implications. The applicable period of time is 2013.

Every year, as part of the budget preparation process, on April 1 the Government is directed to
explicate its priority financing areas (bearing in mind limited resources, the most favorable
costs/benefits ratio and the fiscal rule that limits the debt ratio to 45 percent of GDP), including
national investment priorities for the budget year and the following two years, and on April 10
to organize a public hearing on these priority areas for same period.43

Although the Fiscal Strategy Report for the year 2013 makes clear reference to specific
investment projects, there are no references of the budgetary amounts assigned to such projects

or to their future recurrent costs. A review of some Ministry of Education sector strategies that
project development activities until year 2020 shows that such strategies define goals and
actions, but not their implementation costs. As noted in the discussion of the preceding
dimension, for many entities there is no evidence that all sectors have strategies defining capital
and recurrent costs, nor that such costs are included in the multi-annual projections. With few
exceptions (e.g., the infrastructure sector), there is no evidence that any entities are revising
their strategies to match the fiscal goals.

Score C. Many investment decisions have weak links to sector strategies, and their recurrent
cost implications are rarely included in forward budget estimates.

3.3.2 Predictability and control in budget execution

PI-13. Transparency of taxpayer obligations and liabilities

     Rationale for this indicator:
     PI-13 considers the overall taxation framework and examines whether tax laws and regulations
     explain taxpayer obligations clearly; taxpayers have adequate information to meet their
     obligations; and there are sufficient mechanisms to question and appeal where decisions are
     considered to be wrong or unfair.

(i)       Clarity and comprehensiveness of tax liabilities

This dimension measures whether the Serbia tax system is clear and complete from the
taxpayer perspective. In particular, the dimension aims to measure whether the tax system
enables taxpayers to fulfill their tax obligations through voluntary compliance. In this context,
no major discretionary decisions from tax collection agencies should influence taxpayer
obligations.

The Serbia tax system collects both direct and indirect taxes. The main tax collection agencies
are the Serbia Tax Administration (STA), the Institute for Social Insurance (ISI), the Serbia
Customs Administration (SCA), and the Tobacco Administration (TA). Among direct taxes,
the Personal Income Tax (PIT) and Social Security Contributions combined represent on
average 15 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in recent years. The Value Added
Tax (VAT) is the most important indirect tax, and on average represented 11 percent of GDP
for 2011-2013 (see Table 20).44

Among taxes exclusive of social security contributions, VAT clearly stands out as a revenue
source, representing more than half of total tax revenue in each year, 2008-2013 (see Table
21).

  The standard rate of VAT was raised from 18 to 20 percent in September 2012, and the lower rate of VAT from
8 to 10 percent in January 2014. The latter is applied, among other things, to basic foodstuffs, drinking water,
cereals, medicines, textbooks, hotels, and natural gas. As VAT is an indirect tax, for the final consumer it
represents a consumption tax. However, from the sellerâs perspective it is a tax only on the value added to a
product. As a result, the seller will submit to the tax collection agencies only the difference between these two
amounts, retaining the rest to offset the taxes that they paid for inputs.

Although tax agencies have implemented measures to assist taxpayers in clarifying and paying
their tax obligations (e.g., e-filing for tax returns, the âintegrated collection systemâ for
withholding taxes and social insurance contributions, information Booklet on Customs, etc.)
so as to promote voluntary compliance, in practice - according to the private sector perception
- wide discretionary power remains in the hands of tax assessors/auditors because formal
guidelines for legal interpretation are rare, requests for interpretations of tax laws are difficult
to obtain and opinions might be diverse across tax offices, and individualized services from
tax offices is only intermittently available.

To address these challenges (or to take advantage of these opportunities), large companies
usually hire tax consultants who provide specialized advice to minimize disputes with tax
collection agencies (e.g., VAT payments made under tax exemptions require a tax inspectorâs
assessment on the supporting documentation to clear refunds). However, individuals and small
and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) typically cannot afford specialized advice.

In addition, the business community perceives that although the length of audit depends on
several factors - such as the taxpayer size, scope, number to taxes, etc - , audits are lengthy. In
addition, taxpayersâ perceive that beyond the size of the business that tax audits last too long
and are performed at different times by several agencies requesting the same information, thus
increasing the firmâs operating cost. From the taxpayersâ perspective, although they thought
their tax obligations were accomplished, at the time audits are performed those expectations
are not fulfilled because of discretionary decisions of tax inspectors. One aspect that might
influence these perceptions is the lack of systematic risk management that allows the tax
administration to target not only risky taxpayers but also flag either transactions or behaviors.
In that sense, the entitled discretionary decisions might be better regulated and subject to
stronger oversight arrangements.

Score C. Although legislation and procedures for some major taxes are comprehensive and
clear (e.g., VAT and PIT), discretionary powers exist for tax collection entities (especially in
the case of audits executed by STA), leading to disputed resolutions.

(ii)    Taxpayer access to information on tax responsibilities and administrative
        procedures

All legislation applicable to the MoF and its departments (e.g., Treasury Administration), as
well as all rulebooks, orders, instructions, and guidance (for instance, âDecision on the
amounts of average weighted retail price and minimum amount of excise taxes for tobacco




                                                                                                   42
productsâ) are published in the âOfficial Gazette of the Republic of Serbiaâ and posted on the
website of the competent authority.45

The MoF and tax collection administrations in Serbia have actively developed taxpayer
educational campaigns to promote voluntary compliance. STAâs website has been improved
and now disseminates all tax regulations, procedures, schedules, enquiry points, and so forth
to assist taxpayers to fulfil their tax obligations. STA has established one call center located in
Belgrade to address queries and to interact directly with taxpayers to provide forms and explain
their use. STA also conducts communication campaigns to professional associations, business
associations, and Chamber of Commerce, domestic and foreign. Nevertheless, there is not a
one-stop, consolidated taxpayer support unit, as critical services are disseminated across
different STA units; this undermines the objective of promoting voluntary compliance.

SCAâs website has been improved to provide good access to critical information regarding
laws, by-laws, internal regulations, all customs procedures, notifications, and publications
about Customs regulations. In addition, SCA holds regular meetings with the Chamber of
Commerce, shippers, forwarders, exporters, importers, and resident representatives of the
international business community. Notwithstanding these notable advances, the website still
lacks languages options, interactive options, and a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) menu.

Score B. Taxpayers have access to some information on tax liabilities and administrative
procedures, but the information is limited and lacks comprehensiveness and consistency, and
thus does not strongly foster an environment of voluntary compliance.

(iii)    Existence and functioning of a tax appeals mechanism

The tax appeals mechanism is under the Tax Administration which is perceived as not
independent by the involved private sector. Recently, the appeals mechanism has been
streamlined by the role that the Sector for Fiscal System of the MOF plays in clarifying legal
interpretations to resolve disputes between the tax administration and taxpayers. The Sector
for Fiscal System is in charge of resolving taxpayer requests for interpretation of tax
law/regulations.46 Since May 2013, their opinions and interpretations have been binding on the
Tax Administration, including with respect to actions of tax inspectors in their audits; it is thus
important to ensure that these are implemented in practice. Although the Law establishes a 30-
day benchmark for the Department to resolve taxpayer requests, typically this deadline is not
achieved because of limited institutional capacity. Given that the start-date establishing the
binding character of Department decisions was May 2013, too little time has passed and too
little track record exists to realistically assess the Departmentâs efficacy and efficiency as an
independent tax appeal mechanism, including the issue of whether their decisions are properly
implemented throughout the various tax administrations.

Score C. Although the tax appeals mechanism in Serbia has been revamped and is in operation,
it is too early to assess its efficacy, efficiency, and fairness, including in following up on its
decisions.

45
   In addition, based on the provisions of the Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance, the
information and documents (as a product of the activities of a public authority) should be accessible to the public.
46
   Although taxpayers can ask the same questions to the revenue collection agencies, and if satisfied not seek
redress through the Department, the responses received are not considered as authoritative.

  integrity of the system. It considers the arrangements for managing taxpayer registration, the
  effectiveness of penalties, audit and investigations.

(i)      Controls in the taxpayer registration system

STA registers taxpayers under one of two categories: individuals and legal entities. The latter
holds a unique Tax Identification Number (TIN, Serbian PIB) provided by the Agency for
Business Registers at the time the company is formally established. In the registration process,
the company must supply details of its bank accounts for verification, and this information is
forwarded to STA, which executes a control routine to avoid duplications or other anomalies


                                                                                                                            44
before clearing the TIN.47 (Similarly, STA closes TINs when companies go out of business.)
Only at this point is the legal entity activated and permitted to commence operations. In
practice, however, particularly in cases of SMEs and more particularly those that deal with
regional offices of the Business Register, TINs are created and activated without reference to,
or clearance from, STA. The STA has plans to streamline the operating procedures for
registering business and creating TINs to minimize discrepancies and duplications.

For individuals, STA uses the Serbia Personal Identification Number (SPIN, Serbian JMBG).
Subnational tax administrations use this number to collect property taxes, sign-offs, and fees
established by local administrations (since 2007 they are entitled by Law to collect some taxes
and fees as own-resources to finance local government budgets).

Although STA has implemented some facilities to ensure the TIN database is updated
including the use of a Web portal to update information about TINs, control mechanisms are
typically performed manually. As a result, there is some uncertainty whether the TIN
information is completely accurate and properly updated. Table 22 displays the total number
of legal entity taxpayers, disaggregated by size of total turnover and volume of tax revenue
collected (both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total tax revenue collected), for 2011,
2012 and 2013.

Score B. In Serbia taxpayers are registered in a single database system with some linkages to
other government registration systems and financial sector regulations.

 (ii)  Effectiveness of penalties for non-compliance with registration and declaration
obligations

Although tax laws permit the tax administration to seize non-compliant taxpayersâ assets and
freeze their bank accounts, the significance of the âgreyâ economy evidences the limited
effectiveness and efficiency of legislation to (i) deter that portion of informal activities that
does not comply fully with tax regulations, and (ii) promote voluntary compliance.48 There is

   The grey economy is defined as illegal and legal activities established to avoid tax obligations through loopholes
in the law, or to outright evade obligations through knowledge of weak enforcement capacity; in either case, such
opportunities are then exploited as business activities fill the profitable vacuum. There are estimations that the

                                                                                                                               45
a wide perception among private companies operating in the formal economy that a culture of
tolerance for the âgreyâ economy flourishes, implicating the credibility of effective sanctions
against efforts to evade tax obligations, and further affecting voluntary compliance from formal
sectors. In addition, there is no administrative penalty for non-registration of business activity
or for late filing of tax returns. Instead, these matters are dealt with through the court system.
Although the Court of Misdemeanors may impose late filing penalties, STA has limited
capacity to monitor penalties assessed to determine their effectiveness in systemically altering
compliance behavior. Also in practice, it is easier for STA to seek court enforcement of
penalties against late filing of returns only in cases that used the e-filing system, as that
information system can assist STA to more readily identify non-compliant taxpayers.

STA splits tax collection processes into voluntary payments and enforced collection, which is
activated once non-compliant taxpayers have been identified. As an initial warning, STA
notifies non-compliant taxpayers about overdue tax payments. If these taxpayers do not pay
their overdue obligations within five days of notification, STA can initiate enforced collection
procedures to secure payment. In Serbia, the tax administration is permitted to seize such
taxpayersâ assets to cover tax liabilities, including interest charged, without requesting a
judicial order to proceed. In addition, if non-compliant taxpayers have cash deposits in the
financial system, funds will be withdrawn through the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) in favor
of the tax administration. Once the amount due has been collected, it is allocated among
different tax categories (e.g., VAT, social contributions, and others).

Although STA is entitled to withdraw or confiscate any non-compliant taxpayersâ assets,
reality is sometimes more complex (e.g., in the case of companies whose board of directors
has limited liability, or where the companyâs assets are limited, hidden, or encumbered). Such
situations open room for burdensome legal disputes, and STA must weigh the burdens against
resource constraints and efficiency in terms of rate of return on âinvestments.â Moreover, the
new Privatization Law, which took effect August 13, 2014, establishes that the tax liabilities
of former SOEs cannot be collected. Finally, if companies have initiated the process for filing
for bankruptcy, tax liens and seizures cannot be compulsorily executed by the tax
administration.

In the case of the Serbia Customs Administration (SCA), if the obligation fails to be paid within
eight days from notification, the overdue interest is calculated in accordance with the Custom
Law. Forced collection for unpaid custom duties may be initiated by SCA in conjunction with
the National Bank of Serbia Department for Enforced Collection. In such cases, a declaration
or administrative order to initiate the forced collection procedure is forwarded to the
appropriate NBS unit, which will freeze all accounts of the non-compliant taxpayer and
transfer available proceeds from those accounts to the account of SCA. In the case of
declarations without security for payment of custom duties and taxes, the procedure will be
conducted by the custom office that cleared the goods, while the administrative orders are
forwarded to the Revenue Collection Department in the Custom Administration. In such cases,
SCA can seize the goods until debts have been paid.




âgreyâ economy might represent 30 percent of GDP, suggesting a significant tax avoidance effort running in
parallel to formal activities.
                                                                                                       46
Score C. Although Serbia tax collection administrations are entitled to charge penalties and
seize assets, these actions are not consistently applied and have therefore a limited impact on
compliance, especially in the case of STA which is restricted by the current legal framework
which limits proactive actions in this respect.

(iii) Planning and monitoring of tax audit and fraud investigation programs

Within STA, the Audit Sector is in charge of establishing audit plans within the context of a
risk-assessment framework (the criteria of which were developed in 2004-2005) and a resulting
estimation of potential tax evasion. Thus all its annual audit plans are largely pre-defined
(excluding cases that emerge ad hoc). Recently, the unit has focused efforts on the âgreyâ
economy, diverting scarce resources to address tax avoidance activities and the challenges of
a weakly regulated sector.

Risk management and criteria is managed by several units within the STA depending on the
type of sector and tax. For the Audit Sector, risk management is conducted on the basis of
defined risk criteria and data analysis to target taxpayers who are likely to be in the greatest
breach of tax obligations. The most important risk criteria are (i) disproportionatelly small
amounts of payment of public income compared to turnover registered with the Office of
Business Registration or STA; (ii) founders or authorized directors are simultaneously the
owners or authorized directors at identified money-launderers or known phantom entities; (iii)
an open request for VAT returns, and a small tax payment on business revenues; (iv) import
of goods from China and Turkey in great volume within a short period, and disproportionally
small payment of incomes; and (v) importers of crude oil, where analyses of the gap between
import volumes and sales/tax and duties payments suggests hidden commercial transactions.

For VAT enforcement, the STA has developed additional risk criteria based on: (i) the largest
weight - turnover in the last 12 months; Corrective criteria (weighting is done during the
preparation of the annual plan); (ii) the activity (in accordance with OECD guidelines); (iii)
previous control (track record); (iv) tax returns filing deadline; (v) absolute value of VAT; (vi)
relative ratio of the previous turnover and estimated traffic; and (vii) absolute value of the
difference between output VAT and input VAT. As for VAT refunds and credits, the risk
management criteria are under review. Finally, for income taxes of legal entities, the risk
criteria is based on the analysis of financial statements, tax returns, activity of the organizations
and the largest taxpayers for a period of five years. Criteria for selection of taxpayers to control
taxes on corporate income are still in the process of validation.

Another 60 criteria for selection of taxpayers for audit are grouped in the following categories:
(i) general criteria: registrations, type of registration, activity, form of organization (status),
legal entity or entrepreneur/physical entity, risk; (ii) VAT criteria: comparison on all fields in
the taxpayerâs VAT tax return with the actual entity or with a pre-defined homogenous group
(activity, amount of turnover, region); and (iii) additional criteria: producer of excise goods,
information on cash withdrawn (information from the bank), turnover on the fiscal register and
others.

Despite the existence of the audit plans and broad and detailed risk criteria, the STA has been
diverting its enforcement efforts to sectors (i.e. Grey economy) without proper consideration

                                                                                                  47
about the effects on the overall taxpayer compliance as well as on the significance of additional
revenue collection.

The audit function is broadly divided between the central office and branch offices and carried
out by a small number of skilled tax auditors. Audit orders issued by the central office take
into consideration the indicated risk criteria and attention to new business operating in risky
sectors. Although audit plans are comprehensive and risk-based in principle, some audit orders
have been not performed as a consequence of MoF instructions in 2013 and 2014 to focus on
the fiscal cash register program. This initiative is counted by STA as an audit even though it
does not focus on determining tax obligation per se but rather on enforcing the transition of
mechanical cash registers (e.g., in stores) to an automatic electronic communication of
transactions with VAT and other tax implications. (The yields of which in terms of revenue
collections are relatively negligible.) In addition, branch offices are focusing their audits efforts
on micro enterprises and SMEs, which effort also yields relatively little in revenue collection.

SCA risk management is articulated through the following steps: establishing the context,
identification and risk analysis, assessment and ranking of risks, managing the risks and
follow-up and evaluation. The Department for Post-Clearance Audit Control is in charge of
organizing and implementing the annual post-clearance audit plan, which is prepared for the
entire Department, by identifying and harmonizing needs of all regions (Belgrade, Kraljevo,
Novi Sad and NiÅ¡) so as to reflect breadth of territorial coverage, technical equipment, and
available human resources.50

the branch offices.

   This Department focuses not only on collection self-reported but underestimated custom duties, but also
undertakes pre-control efforts aimed at issuing of approval for simplified procedure (i.e., house clearance and
invoiced-based clearance).

international trade flows, and those that aid the collection of customs duties as budgetary
revenues.

The Department for Risk Analysis and Management is in charge of identifying high-risk
sectors and establishing the measures necessary for assessment of potential risks, and
respective actions to contain the risk; to improve the safety of trade flows based on prior risk
analyses; to affect the strengthening of competitive ability of local businesses (by sanctioning
those who do not conduct business in accordance with the regulations and who damage the
legal national trade); to provide protection of citizens by applying the selectivity criteria with
the purpose of directing the controls performed by the customs services; to evaluate the
relevance of the risk analyses through regular re-examination based on results of controls and
investigations; to develop cooperation in the field of risk analysis and direction of controls
with other services and other authorities of the national administration charged with combating
fraud.

Score C. Although both STA and SCA are producing annual audit plans, they are facing
implementation challenges with respect to their risk-assessment criteria and the degree to
which plans are implemented as designed.

PI-15 Effectiveness in collection of tax payments

  Rationale for this indicator:
  PI-15 assesses the extent to which tax policies and administration are effective in collecting the
  revenue as authorized by legislation and regulations. Handling of tax arrears is an important guide
  to the effectiveness of legal and administrative arrangements. The funds that are collected need to
  be transferred to government accounts and reconciled quickly to allow funds to be used promptly
  and to ensure that records across government are fully aligned. Dimension (i) examines the last two
  completed FYs (2012 and 2013). Dimensions (ii) and (iii) focus on circumstances at the time of the
  assessment (2014).

(i)      The collection ratio for gross tax arrears

The collection ratio for gross tax arrears is measured by the percentage of tax arrears at the
beginning of the fiscal year that is collected during that fiscal year.

STA total gross arrears can be defined by the sum of net tax arrears and disputed tax arrears.
The net tax arrears are the tax arrears at the beginning of the fiscal year less the collected tax
arrears in the course of the fiscal year. In addition, a share of gross tax arrears can be disputed
by tax payers preventing the collection of the arrears, especially in the following categories:
companies undergoing privatization and restructuring, companies in bankruptcy and
liquidation procedures, companies deleted from the registry, ghost and money-laundering
companies and companies with insurance span gaps bridged.

Although STA is entitled to withdraw or size any taxpayerâs assets in order to cancel arrears
and lack of voluntary compliance, in reality there are exceptions as the cases of companiesâ
directors with limited liability and SOEs under privatization process. Typically, STA follows
a standard operating procedure to enforce the payment of tax arrears. This procedure is based
on warnings to taxpayers who have recorded tax obligations past due. Warnings are issued
based on a list of taxpayers with recorded debts and contain the instructions for taxpayers to
respond to STA within five days to discuss issues concerning the nature and amount of the tax
debt.

Therefore, to measure this dimension, Table 24 considers STA tax arrears management in 2012
and 2013.

Score D. The debt collection ratio in recent years (2012 and 2013) was below 60 percent and
the total amount of tax arrears is significant.

(ii)    Effectiveness of transfer of tax payments to Treasury

In Serbia all tax payments are made directly to Treasury accounts. Revenues and allocation of
funds from these accounts follow the regulations and procedures of keeping accounts for the
payment of public revenues, as a subsystem of consolidated treasury account of the Republic
of Serbia.51 The chart of accounts of the budget system has the following classification:

Class 0 - Non-financial assets,
Class 1 - Financial assets,
...
Class 7 - Current revenue,
Class 8 - Proceeds from the sale of non-financial assets,
Class 9 - Proceeds from borrowing and sales of financial assets.

Class 7 of the chart of accounts is used to register revenues expressed analytically. Banks
authorized to collect revenues have a unique identification number provided by the National
Bank of Serbia (i.e. from 105 to 375) that collect revenues to the Treasury system. Therefore
it is the Treasury that informs revenue collection agencies of changes in the account balances
(in the the STA are some 700 revenue accounts). The information process has two main
purposes of ensuring complete reconciliation of accounts between the Treasury and revenue
agencies, and monitoring annual revenue collection targets. The MoF annually establishes a
tax collection target for the tax administration; this target is the basis for the targets assigned
to the local tax administration offices. These constitute STAâs performance criteria. Based on
payments and the unique codes created (which are linked to the TIN), STA can determine who
has paid taxes. STA reports that it has a file record that functions as each STA-registered
taxpayerâs current account.

Score A. All tax revenue is paid directly into accounts controlled by the Treasury.

(iii)   Frequency of complete accounts reconciliation between tax assessments,
        collections, arrears records and receipts by Treasury

There are daily reconciliation processes between the tax collection agencies and the Treasury.

In the case of the STA, revenues are held at the National Bank of Serbia under Treasury
management. Treasury allocates and transfers funds from the revenue account to budget
beneficiaries each working day. Treasury notifies the competent authority of the Republic, or
the autonomous province, municipality, city or mandatory social security payments and
schedule of public revenues, and submits reports on gross revenues, refunds and allocated and

    Pursuant to Article 11, paragraph 4 of the Law on Budget System Ordinance on Standard Classification
Framework and Chart of Accounts for the budget system was adopted ("Official Gazette of the RS ", no. 20/2007
... 11/2010), this is aligned with generally accepted classification of âGFS" (Govern ment Finance Statistics)
standards and the Governmentâs Finance Statistics Offices.
                                                                                                           51
unallocated amounts of revenue. Any payment of tax arrears is allocated and recognized in the
same way as regular payments.

Figure 5 depicts the information exchange process on inflow and outflow of proceeds
recorded on accounts of the SCA, and between SCA and the payment operations system
(a similar reconciliation process with the Treasury applies to the other tax collection agencies).

Figure 5. SCAâReconciliation Processes of Tax Collection with the Treasury




The information flow from the payment operations system to SCA is as follows:

   (i) Tax payers make payments in their commercial banks by using the specific reference
         number. The reference number consists of the control number and the identification of
         the specific JCI (unique custom declaration), to which the payment refersâconsisting
         of (a) the code of the custom office where the specific custom procedure was
         conducted; (b) type of custom procedure; (c) the applicable year of the specific custom
         procedure; and (d) the number of the customs declaration, containing overall
         information of consignment, importer, and beneficiary (i.e., all required information
         for collection and all other subsequent procedures).
   (ii) Data on payments made is sent automatically from commercial banks to the NBS and
         from there to the Treasury. The SCA receives information from the Treasury
         electronically; data is updated every five minutes, providing information on all
         transactions on the SCA accounts.
   (iii) Processing information within the SCA information system: received information on
         transactions on SCA accounts are processed and automatically reconciled with the
         appropriate custom debt. For all proceeds paid to SCA accounts and reconciled with
         the custom debt, orders for allocation to budget incoming payment accounts are
         prepared, once or several times daily, as needed.

The information flow from the SCA to the payment operations system is as follows:
(i) orders for payment into the incoming payment budget accounts are created and are
                                                                                               52
electronically forwarded to the Treasury, therefore completing outflow of proceeds from the
SCA account; (ii) incorrect or double payments are returned to the account of the legal entity
from which they were paid, by creation of a return order at the request of the interested party.
These orders also represent outflows from SCA accounts.

Score A. Complete reconciliation of revenue collection, tax assessments, arrears and transfers
to Treasury occurs at least monthly, within one month of the end of the period.

PI-16 Predictability in the availability of funds for commitment of expenditure

  Rationale for this indicator:
  PI-16 assesses the extent to which MDAs receive reliable and timely information on the
  funds available for them to commit expenditure for recurrent and capital purchases. The
  reference period for this indicator is the last completed FY (2013).

This indicator assesses the extent to which ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) that
are part of the national budget, and depend on budgetary allocations and funding from the
National Treasury, receive timely information on budget allocations and availability of cash,
to schedule and pay liabilities. The period of reference is the last completed fiscal year (2013).

The Budget System Law and Rulebook on Budget Execution System clearly state the applicable
parameters, prominently including the following:
      ï· Direct and indirect budget beneficiaries may execute payments up to expenditure
          ceilings set by the Minister, and/or local government finance authority, for a three-
          month or other period (i.e., the âquotaâ). When setting quotas for DBBs, the
          Minister, and/or local government finance authority, takes into consideration the
          funds budgeted for the DBB in question, applicable budget execution plan, and
          liquidity capacities of the budget. The Ministry and/or local government finance
          authority shall inform DBBs of the quotas, at least 15 days prior to the
          commencement of the period covered by the quotas. (BSL, Article 53)


                                                                                                               53
       ï·   The budget beneficiary is required to deliver the plan for budget execution to
           Treasury by the 5th of the month, using the FINPLAN application, for the following
           three months (at which point the earlier delivered budget execution plans for
           following months may be changed). (Rulebook, Article 19)
       ï·   Commitments created by DBBs/IBBs and organizations for mandatory social
           insurance must conform to the appropriation approved for such purpose in the
           budget year. Commitments created in line with the approved appropriations, but
           not executed during the year, are transferred and have the status of created
           commitments and in the following budget year shall be executed based on the
           approved appropriations for that budget year. (BSL, Article 54)
       ï·   Treasury must establish by the 15th of the month the quota for next three months.
           (Rulebook, Article 22)
       ï·   Budget beneficiaries deliver requests for change of allocated quotas through FMIS.
           Requests for quota change up to 10 percent are decided upon within three working
           days of receipt of request; requests for a quota change greater than 10 percent are
           decided upon within five days. Treasuryâs determination of the requests should be
           guided by a projection of budget revenue and income, budget execution of a budget
           beneficiary from the previous period, and by the appraisal of financial planning
           performance. (Rulebook, Article 23)

(i)    Extent to which cash flows are forecast and monitored

As defined by âArticle 51 - Budget Liquidity Planningâ of the Budget System Law, budget
beneficiaries are obliged to deliver to the Treasury their plan of budget execution (revenues
and expenditures) for the year showing its programed monthly execution within 10 days from
the day the Budget Law is passed. On this basis, every month the Ministry of Finance sets the
expenditure limits (quota) for a three-month period for each budget line. As defined by Article
19 of the Rulebook on Budget Execution System, every month before the 5th day of the month,
budget beneficiaries submit to the Treasury their budget execution plan (revenues and
expenditures) for the next three months. In turn, the Treasury has an annual cash flow that is
reviewed every month and monitored on a daily basis.

Score A. A cash flow forecast is prepared for the fiscal year, and is updated monthly on the
basis of actual cash inflows and outflows.

(ii)   Reliability and time horizon of periodic in-year information to MDAs on
       maximum limits for expenditure commitments

Budget beneficiaries submit to the Treasury their budget execution plan (revenues and
expenditures) for the next three months before the 5th day of every month. That information is
used by the Ministry of Finance to update the quarterly expenditure commitments ceilings.
Then, expenditure limits are defined for the budget beneficiaries for the next three months, and
are reviewed monthly.

In practice, the definition and reliability of the ceilings is low because the information provided
by the budgetary beneficiaries is unreliable, since they do not adapt their plans to the ceiling
provided by the MoF. Many beneficiaries exaggerate the amount of funds they need to finance
their (existing) activities, forcing the Treasury to adjust the MDA requests according to the
availability of funds.
                                                                                                 54
Score D. MDAs are not provided with a reliable indication of actual commitments in terms of
resource availability.

(iii)      Frequency and transparency of adjustments to budgetary allocations that are
           decided at a higher level of management than MDAs

Article 61 (In-Year Changes of Appropriations), Article 62 (Temporary Suspension of Budget
Execution), and Article 63 (Supplementary Budget of the Budget System Law) define the
process of adjusting budget allocations.

Changes in budget allocations decided at a higher level of management than MDAs can be
divided in two categories: those that need National Assembly approval and those that do not
and are decided at the MoF level.

According to the Fiscal Council, ââ¦ the biggest deficiencies of the budget process lie in the
inefficient process of the allocation of public funds â¦ to budget beneficiaries.â52 Such
deficiencies are the principal cause of most of the budgetary adjustments requested by entities
to redirect their allocations among their programs. Limits and procedures for these
adjustments, as previously noted, are clearly defined by the Budget System Law and the
Rulebook on Budget Execution System. Since these adjustments are requested by budgetary
entities to modify their own budgets, they are not considered in this analysis, which focuses on
budgetary reallocations decided at a level higher than the management of entities.

The high level of fiscal deficit and public indebtedness in recent years led the Government to
introduce budgetary adjustments to reduce fiscal risks and control the level of expenditures.
Adjustments related to fiscal issues, such as revenue shortages, can be significant, but typically
occur but once or twice a year (normally in the second or third quarter of the year). Such
adjustments require the approval of the National Assembly (in cases of supplementary
budgets), or notification to the National Assembly (in cases of temporary suspension of budget
execution), or coordination with the budgetary beneficiaries (in cases of reallocation of
appropiations).

From the evidence gathered, MDAs that need to have budgetary allocation adjustments that do
not require National Assembly approval normally apply for them only a few times during the
year, the requests are not for significant amounts and the application/ decision is executed in a
transparent manner.

Score A. There were no significant in-year adjustments to budget allocations in 2013. Routine
administrative changes were not significant and were undertaken in a transparent and

PI-17 Recording and management of cash balances, debt and guarantees

  Rationale for this indicator:
  PI-17 assesses the degree to which:
  ï· public debt administration is undertaken expeditiously, based on accrued and updated
      information to contribute to an adequate plan of budget commitments
  ï· cash needs are supported by updated information on the availability of cash in the Treasury
      accounts to minimize further public debt and optimize the use of cash
  ï· the issuing of government guarantees is registered in a transparent and timely manner to
      ensure information on the implicit fiscal risk.
  The assessment of the first and second dimensions is based on the time of the assessment (2014),
  while the third dimension measures performance over the last completed FY (2013).

The legal and operational frameworks on debt management are clear and complete. They
include procedures of control and review by several entities ensuring that debt operations and
transactions are properly approved and registered. The principal legislation is the Budget
System Law and Public Debt Law, the most pertinent aspects/Articles of which are as follows:
        ï· The Republic, with the approval of the National Assembly, may borrow to finance
           budget deficit and liquidity deficit, to refinance the outstanding debt, to finance
           investment projects, and to make payments on guaranties. Government decides on
           issuing long-term government securities, unless it is otherwise regulated by Law.
           The Minister of Finance is solely authorized, on behalf of the Government, to
           decide on taking short-term loans for budget deficit financing, liquidity financing,
           and public debt refinancing, as well as on issuing short-term government securities.
           Long-term loans and/or long-term government securities, in the sense of this Law,
           are loans and/or government securities the redemption of which is extended over
           the following budget years. (Public Debt Law, Article 5 - Authority to Borrow)

                                                                                                                     56
            ï·    A competent local government body makes decisions on local government
                 borrowing, after it has obtained the opinion of the MoF, which opinion should be
                 issued within 15 days receipt of request for opinion (failing which it will be
                 considered that the opinion is positive). (Public Debt Law, Article 33 - Authority
                 for Local Government Borrowings)
            ï·    The Minister of Finance, and/or local government finance authority, shall be
                 authorized to open the consolidated treasury account of the Republic of Serbia,
                 and/or local government treasury account. The consolidated treasury account of the
                 Republic of Serbia and consolidated treasury account of the local government shall
                 constitute consolidated treasury account system, held with the National Bank of
                 Serbia. The Minister, and/or local government finance authority, and/or the person
                 authorized by him, shall open sub-accounts of public funds beneficiaries included
                 in the consolidated treasury account of the Republic of Serbia, and/or consolidated
                 treasury account of the local government. Within the sub-accounts, the following
                 funds must be kept separately: (i) funds allocated by the budget, and/or the financial
                 plan of organizations for mandatory social insurance, and (ii) own-source revenues
                 generated by DBBs/IBBs and/or organizations for mandatory social insurance, as
                 well as own source revenues of other public funds beneficiaries included in the
                 consolidated treasury account system. These sub-accounts shall be kept by the
                 Treasury. Financial resources of the local government budget, of the DBBs/IBBs
                 of that budget, as well as financial resources of other public funds beneficiaries
                 included in the consolidated treasury account of the local government, shall be kept
                 and deposited on the consolidated treasury account of the local government.
                 (Budget System Law, Article 9 - Consolidated Treasury Account)

 (i)        Quality of debt data recording and reporting

This dimension assesses whether the administration of public debt is conducted in a timely
manner and based on accurate and updated data, in order to contribute to adequate
programming of budget commitments (interest payments and amortization).

As defined by the Article 5 of the Public Debt Law, the Minister of Finance is the only
authorized entity to contract borrowings, conclude loan agreements, and/or issue government
securities, on behalf of the Government and in the name of the Republic. For such purpose, in
2009 the Public Debt Administration (PDA) was created within the Ministry of Finance.

PDA is the holder of the public debt policy and its role is to ensure financing of budgetary
expenses and investment projects for the state and public enterprises. PDA keeps a record of
all transactions of the foreign or domestic public debt acquired in the name of the Government
and the Republic. Additionally, the NBS, as the financial agent of the Government, keeps a
parallel record of the external public debt.

Each month, PDA issues a report of the public debt and every quarter PDA also issues a debt
statistics report. Both reports are published on the PDA website53. Debt records are continually
updated as transactions are promptly registered, and every month the PDA records of external
debt are reconciled with the NBS records and creditors, as stated on the procedures for
preparing the monthly reports. PDA keeps all the debt records in a database organized through

53   http://www.javnidug.gov.rs/.
                                                                                                    57
spreadsheets. The debt information is published on a regular basis, enabling creditors to review
and comment on such figures when inconsistencies are found.

Debt records include central and local government debt (guaranteed and non-guaranteed).
Quarterly and monthly debt reports are explicit in describing the debt stock; showing historical
information on direct and contingent liabilities; presenting the debt structure by creditors,
currencies and interest rates; and presenting securities. Debt service is described and shown in
the Financial Bulletin issued each month by the Ministry of Finance, and the Year-end Budget
Execution Report.

Score A. Domestic and foreign debt records include central and local government debt
(guaranteed and non-guaranteed), and are reconciled monthly with creditors records. Data is
considered of high integrity. Comprehensive management and statistical reports (covering debt
service, stock and operations) are produced monthly.

(ii)    Extent of consolidation of the governmentâs cash balance

This dimension assesses whether cash requirements are supported with updated information
on the availability of cash in the Treasury accounts (so as to minimize generation of public
debt), and analyzes the management of this function as it was performed at the time of the
PEFA evaluation.

The Consolidated Treasury Account provides daily calculation of cash balances and
consolidation of all accounts, as well as real-time monitoring of all accounts.

Score A. All cash balances are calculated daily and consolidated though the Treasury Account.

(iii)   Systems for contracting loans and issuing guarantees
This dimension assess whether the granting of contingent guarantees is recorded in a
transparent and timely manner, so that it is possible to determine and report the implicit fiscal
risk. The reference period is 2013.

Accordingt to the Public Debt Law, âThe Minister of Finance is solely authorized, on behalf
of the Government and in the name of the Republic, to contract borrowing, conclude loan
agreements and/or issue government securities.â The Fiscal Strategy 2013-2015 issued by the
Ministry of Finance and confirmed in the Budget Memo 2013 clearly defines indebtness targets
for 2013 to 2015, based on a fiscal debt reduction program.

The procedure for contracting, borrowing, and issuing guaranties start with a negotiation with
the PDA to define the advisability and terms of the borrowing. Once the operation is accepted,
the intention to borrow must be included and confirmed in the Annual Budget Law. After that,
the public entity, with participation of the PDA can initiate negotiations with the borrowing
agency. The approval process requires the approval of the Ministry of Finance and the Cabinet
of Ministers. After that, a Bill of Law must be prepared and submitted to the National Assembly
for its approval, following which the Ministry of Finance can sign the borrowing contract with
the financial agent, and initiate the procedure for including the borrowed funds in the budget.



                                                                                              58
Score A. Central government contracting, loans, and guarantee issuance are made in
accordance with fiscal targets and have a clear and single approving authority.

PI-18 Effectiveness of payroll controls

  Rationale for this indicator:
  PI-18 evaluates the integrity of central government personnel registration and the efficiency of
  administrative processes for human resources and the government payroll. The indicator
  assesses all payrolls of the central government, even if they cover different segments of the public
  service, including all MDAs and AGAs. The assessment of all dimensions is undertaken at the
  time of assessment (2014), except the fourth dimension, which is assessed for the last three
  completed FYs (2011-2013).

This indicator evaluates the integrity of the personnel register integrity and the efficiency of
administrative processes of human resources and the government payroll process in operation
on the central government level at the time of the assessment. In terms of scope, the indicator

                                                                                                             59
does not assess the human resource management policy of the public sector and government
or the effectiveness of oversight and control over the general public sector wage bill.

Each Government institution specifies the work posts, number of civil servants in each post,
and work requirements in their rulebooks on internal organization and systematization of work
posts.54

The salaries of the civil servants are regulated by the Law on Salaries of Civil Servants and
Employees.55 The remuneration consists of the basic salary and salary allowances. The basic
salary is calculated by multiplying the coefficient with the basis for salary calculation and
payment. The basis for salary calculation and payment is uniform and is determined for each
budget year in the budget law.56 The coefficients for civil servants are determined through the
classification of service work posts into one of 13 payment groups (Article 9, Law on Civil
Service). The coefficient for each civil servant is determined by the decision of the Head of
the institution.57

The Governmentâs Service for Human Resource Management is in charge of professional
affairs related to human resource management in the public administration.58 Among other
duties, the Service is required to maintain the Central Personnel Records of Civil Servants and
Employees in Government Authorities.59 Timeliness and regularity of submission of the data
entered into the Central Personnel Records are monitored and supervised by the Serviceâs
Administrative Inspection Unit.60 Although the Law on Civil Service stipulates that the Central
Personnel Records shall contain comprehensive records, including the data required for
calculation of salary,61 it does not play a role in payroll processing and is not assessed under
this indicator.

The principal authority in charge of centralized payroll processing is the Treasury
Administration of the Ministry of Finance, whose statutory obligations are set out in
amendments to the Budget System Law, from 2013. The role of the Treasury Administration
is two-fold: (i) the calculation of income,62 and (ii) management of a database of employed,
elected, appointed and engaged persons that pertains to their income.63 To implement these
provisions, the Treasury Administration is required to manage a Registry of Employed,
Elected, Appointed and Engaged Persons in the Public Sector (Registry).64 Reservations were

   The Registry is intended to capture data on the number of employed, elected, appointed, and engaged persons in
the public sector as well as data pertaining to income (i.e., salary, salary allowance, compensation and other income
of these persons). Personnel data are to be supplied on the basis of the documentation contained in the personnel
files from the official records of the beneficiary of public funds. Centralized payroll calculation on the basis of the
data from the Registry is to be carried out by gradual introduction of entities, in the period from January 1, 2014
to January 1, 2015 (set forth in the Decree on Contents of Information, Manner of Filling of Forms, Manner of
Submission, and Processing of Data Entered into the Registry of Employed, Elected, Appointed and Engaged
Persons in the Public Sector).
                                                                                                                  60
expressed at the time of the assessment with respect to quality (i.e. comprehensiveness and
credibility) of the Registry because of delays in data gathering and issues with accuracy of the
submissions from individual public funds beneficiaries. This is mainly due to the fact that the
Registry is designed as a self-reporting tool where Treasury has no control over the quality or
reliability of data provided. At the time of the assessment, the Registry was still not used by
the Treasury Administration for its payroll operations and is not assessed under this indicator.

The rating for this indicator is accordingly based on the database of personnel records and
application software for processing of earnings (TREZAR) currently operated by the Treasury
Administration. At the time of the assessment, the Treasury Administration relied on its own
database of personnel records (established in 2006) to underpin the centralized payroll system
for civil servants and employees in the bodies of the Republican administration. The system
currently in operation covers the personnel records and centralized payroll for the civil servants
and employees as set out in Table 25.

As Table 25 indicates, the Sector for Payroll Processing of the Treasury Administration
performs both payroll calculation and processing for some budget beneficiary entities, while
for other entities this sector only performs payroll processing. In the latter case, the budget
beneficiary entities submit payroll data electronically to the Treasury Administration and the
information is uploaded into the payroll system.

The following assessment and rating does not take into account the Registry and the Central
Personnel Records described above, as they currently play no role in the system used for
centralized payroll processing for the indicated central government staff.

(i)     Degree of integration and reconciliation between personnel records and payroll
        data

Both direct budget beneficiaries (DBBs) and indirect budget beneficiaries (IBBs) and the
Treasury Administration maintain databases of personnel for employees whose payroll is
centrally processed. The State Audit Institution reported that there are only rare instances of
DBBs that have not yet introduced electronic personnel records. In the Treasury
                                                                                                           61
Administration, the personnel records are available electronically. Information in the personnel
database is changed solely on the basis of documentary proof supplied by DBBs/IBBs.

The payroll data is centralized and computerized in the TREZAR system. Each month, data in
the payroll TREZAR system is cross-checked against data from the separate personnel
database. Changes in the payroll are entered manually. Any changes in the payroll must
correspond to changes in the personnel database.

The Sector for Payroll Processing Unit sends the recapitulation of the calculation to DBBs and
IBBs for review and confirmation before the release of funds. The payments for all institutions
currently in the system are made by the Treasury, directly to the bank account of each
individual.

The quality and completeness of payroll data, personnel records and personnel database, as
evidenced by the reported percentage of retroactive adjustments, is deemed satisfactory. The
SAI notes that payroll processing and calculation carried out by the Treasury is orderly and
harmonized. For the IBBs, on a very limited sample,65 the SAI has not encountered major
problems with respect to completeness of records, safekeeping of the databases, or updating of
the information therein, but it noted that the system could be made more orderly.

Score B. The Sector for Payroll Processing manages its own electronic personnel database and
payroll software, but the two are not directly linked. The payroll is supported by full
documentation for all changes made to personnel records and is checked against the previous
monthâs payroll data.

(ii)       Timeliness of changes to personnel records and payroll

This dimension assesses the efficiency of the administration of personnel and payroll records,
in order to ensure that records are correctly updated and that there is timely payment of all
workers.

All the changes to personnel data and the corresponding payroll changes are updated monthly,
on the basis of personnel documentation66 submitted to the Sector for Payroll Processing by
the Human Resources Department of each DBB/IBB.

On the payroll side, the joint parameters (i.e., salary basis, new legal provisions or Government
decisions) are updated as necessary. Other specific payroll parameters, (such as the highest
basis for calculation of contributions, minimum price of labor, etc.), are entered by the
processing administrator of the Sector for Payroll Processing on a monthly basis.

Any retroactive adjustments are made in the following month.

Score A. Changes to payroll and personnel records are made without delay within the same
month, and retroactive adjustments are reported as rare.

     The first external audits of IIBs were conducted in 2013.

     For example, promotions, benefits derived from the number of years in service, etc.
                                                                                              62
(iii)      Internal control over changes to personnel records and payroll

Only appointed officers from the Sector for Payroll Processing can enter changes to the records
in the personnel database maintained by the Treasury Administration. They access the
personnel records with a unique password and may make the necessary changes solely on the
basis of authentic documentary proof. Access and changes to payroll records are likewise
restricted to authorized staff only.

For monthly changes in the payroll, based on attendance at work (timesheets) for all employees
and accompanying documentation to justify absences (e.g., annual leave, sick leave, paid leave,
etc.), the appointed officer at Sector for Payroll Processing performs the control by cross-
referencing the overall hours with the previously calculated total available working hours and
ensures that the difference in the total hours available and the total hours claimed is justified.

Each salary payment is preceded by filing of the personal income tax (PIT) return to the Tax
Administration. A salary payment order can only be generated with a reference to the number
of notification on successfully filed PIT returns issued by the Tax Administration. To prevent
fictitious employment, the documentary proof required to register any new employee is prior
registration with the mandatory insurance funds and a copy of the Employment Book.

The IT system generates logs, but the Sector for Payroll Processing reported that such logs are
not reviewed in the course of regular operationsâalthough they present an audit trail of
changes to personnel records and payroll. The SAI has not raised issues related to the integrity
of data in the centralized payroll and personnel records at the Treasury Administration. The
low rate of retroactive adjustments noted above suggests that controls to avoid payment errors
are robust.

Score A. Authority to change records in the personnel database and payroll in the Treasury
Administration is restricted to authorized staff whose access the system requires a unique
password and who are entitled to make changes only on the basis of documentary proof.

(iv) Existence of payroll audits to identify control weaknesses and/or ghost workers
Payroll is audited by both external and internal auditors. Audits conducted by the SAI include
sample testing of salary payments, personnel files of employees, and other transactions as part
of its financial and regularity audit. The centralized payroll calculation and processing
operations at the Treasury Administration have been subject to regularity audits conducted out
by the SAI in each of the past three years.

In the past three years, the SAI audited the personnel and payroll records on a limited sample
of entities included in its annual work program. Furthermore, audits of the payroll system are
conducted by internal audit functions in the respective institutions where they have been
established. In 2013, internal auditors made a total of 244 recommendations in the area of
employees, salaries and allowances. In 2012, the number of internal audit recommendations
was 166, and in 2011 the number was 154. Using the number of recommendations as a proxy
for audit coverage suggest a widening coverage of payroll audits.67

Score C. Despite the fact that the centralized payroll is audited each year and there is increased
audit coverage at individual DBBs and IBBs, not all central government entities have been
subject to payroll audit (which would warrant a score of B). Accordingly, payroll audits
conducted in the last three years are considered partial.

PI-19 Transparency, competition and complaint mechanisms in procurement

     Rationale for this indicator:
     PI-19 examines the operations and integrity of public procurement arrangements. The assessment
     covers all procurement for central government and focuses on the time of the assessment for all
     dimensions except dimension (i), which relates to the last completed FY (2013).

The Public Procurement Law (PPL) of 201268 replaced the Public Procurement Law of 2008,69
and represents a step toward conformity with EU standards. The institutional framework
includes a state authority in charge of public procurement operations (the Public Procurement
Administration â PPA) and an independent entity responsible for review of complaints (the
Republic Commission for the Protection of Rights in Public Procurement Procedures â RC).
The PPL mandates supervision by a Civil Supervisor (professionals in the field of procurement,
anti-corruption, and so forth) whenever the estimated cost of the public procurement procedure
exceeds RSD 1 billion (approximately â¬8.5 million). Civil Supervisors are appointed by the
Public Procurement Administration on a case-by-case basis, and receive no remuneration for
their work.

Typically, procurement operations are decentralized: there are about 4,900 registered
contracting authorities, of which about 166 are central government bodies. The PPL applies to
procurement of goods, works, and services purchased by state and local government
authorities, SOEs and legal persons that use funds provided by the Government of Serbia or
local self-governments.

All contracting authorities prepare annual procurement plans by January 31 in the planned
year, which are submitted to the PPA and the State Audit Institution within 10 days from the
day of plan adoption. The procurement plans are not published on the Public Procurement
Portal; instead, each contracting authority is encouraged to publish their plan on its own
website. Contracting authorities may change their procurement plan in the case of a revised
budget or amended financial plans, but the PPL encourages them to do so in a transparent
manner that highlights the specific changes relative to the original plan and that provides
accompanying justifications. Changes in the procurement plans are submitted to the Public
Procurement Administration and the State Audit Institution, prominently including changes to
contract elements such as price and contract duration. Contracting authorities must also report
quarterly to the PPA on conducted public procurement procedures and contracts awarded.
Exemptions from the PPL are clearly defined by Article 7 and include procurement to ensure
basic living conditions in cases of natural disasters.70

In 2013, approximately 83,000 public contracts were awarded, with an approximate total value
of RSD 262,938,735,000 (approximately â¬2,390,352,000).71 The 2012 PPL took effect on
April 1, 2013. Comparing the first half of 2013 to the second half of 2013, about â¬142 million

   Following disastrous flooding in May 2014, the National Assembly adopted the Law on Post Flood
Rehabilitation in Serbia (Official Gazette 75/14) regulating procurement of goods and civil works to address the
consequences of floods and landslides. This Law has a one-year applicability and introduces simplified
procurement procedures not foreseen by the PPL.

(about RSD 16.3 million less were contracted in the latter period; according to the PPA this
reflects the fact that most contracting authorities initiated public procurement procedures in
the first three months of 2013, and thus applied the provisions of the 2008 PPL.72

In October 2014, the Government adopted a Public Procurement Strategy for 2014-2018 and
an Action Plan for 2015 (available, in Serbian, at www.ujn.gov.rs).

procurement system.

     The PEFA methodology for PI-19 was changed in 2011, and thus no valid comparison can be made to 2010.
                                                                                                            66
(ii)     Use of competitive procurement methods

Contracting authorities are not obliged to apply the PPL for procurement of goods, services,
and works when the annual estimated value of the purchase is less than RSD 400,000
(approximately â¬3,300). In such cases, the contracting authority is obliged by law to prevent
any conflict of interest, ensure competition and ensure that the contracting price does not
exceed the comparable market price.

The shopping method for contracting may be used for âlow-valueâ contracts (annual estimated
value below RSD 3,000,000 (â¬25,000). Unlike the PPL of 2008, the 2012 PPL obliges
contracting authorities that use the shopping method to publish notice and bidding documents
on the Public Procurement Portal.

The 2012 PPL prescribes that above these thresholds, a contracting authority wishing to use
less competitive methods of contracting, such as Negotiated procedure without invitation to
bid (Article 36 of the PPL) or Competitive dialogue (Article 37 of the PPL) must obtain prior
PPA approval.74 This provision has reduced the incidence of the Negotiated procedure without
invitation to bid from 24 percent of the total value of public procurement in the first half of
2013, to 11 percent in the second half of 2013, after the 2012 law took effect in April of that
year. Correspondingly, the use of open competitive procedures increased from 54 percent of
the total value of public procurement in the first half of 2013 to 79 percent in the second half
of 2013. Participation of other bidding procedures75 defined by the Law was reduced from 22
percent in the first half of 2013 to 10 percent in the second half of 2013. 76

From January 1, 2014 to July 1, 2014, the PPA processed 2,950 requests for use of Negotiated
procedure without invitation to bid within the appropriate timeframe.77 In the first half of 2014
this procedure accounted for 4 percent of the total value of public procurement.78 Exemptions
are defined in Article 7 of the PPL. The National Assembly passed the Law on Post Flood
Rehabilitation in the Republic of Serbia effective of July 22, 2014 (Official Gazette 75/14) for
use of funds to repair consequences of flood occurred in May 2014. The Law will be in force
until July 22, 2015; however, PPA was not in the position to make a decision on use of less
competitive procedures. However, the Office for Reconstruction and Flood Relief informed
that all contracts signed in accordance with the Law on Post Flood Rehabilitation followed
open public procurement procedure. The PPA and the Office for Reconstruction and Flood
Relief submitted the information/evidence on public procurement procedures conducted to
mitigate the effects of floods conducted mainly by the public water companies. The PPA
confirmed the non-existence of less competitive public procurement procedures by submitting
tables of all negotiated procedures without invitation to bid (less competitive procedure)
conducted in the post flood period and the PEFA Team was able to justify that procurement
for relief of floods followed open public procurement procedure. Therefore, the dimension is
scored A.

74
   The PPA must decide whether to permit the requested procedure and respond to this effect within 10 days in
cases of negotiated procedure without invitation to bid and within 15 days in cases of competitive dialogue.
75
   Other procedures refer to restricted procedures, qualification procedures, competitive dialogue, design contest
etc.

Score A. When contracts are awarded by a method other than open competition, they are
justified in accordance with the legal requirements in all cases.

(iii)   Public access to complete, reliable and timely procurement information

This dimension of PI 19 assesses whether procurement information (government procurement
plans, bidding opportunities, contract awards, and data on resolution of procurement
complaints) is made available to the public through appropriate means. In practice, government
bidding opportunities and contract awards are promptly posted on the Public Procurement
Portal www.portal.ujn.gov.rs; data on resolution of procurement complaints is posted on the
portal of the Republic Commission for Protection of Rights in Public Procurement Procedures
www.kjn.gov.rs/sr/odluke and on the Public Procurement Portal. Publication of procurement
plans is not mandatory. Government procurement plans are not published on the Public
Procurement Portal; rather, each government entity is encouraged to post this information on
its own website.

Score B. At least three of the key procurement information elements (bidding opportunities,
contract awards, and complain resolutions) are complete and reliable for government unit
representing 75 percent of procurement operations (by value) and made available to the public
in a timely manner through appropriate means.

(iv) Existence of an independent administrative procurement complaints system

The Republic Commission for Protection of Rights in Public Procurement Procedures was
established on October 12, 2010, as an independent body responsible to Parliament. The new
PPL that took effect from April 1, 2013 defined the composition, appointment, competencies
and authority of the Republic Commission. The members and president of the Republic
Commission were elected competitively for the respective positions.

The Republic Commission is responsible for administrative protection in public procurement.
A complaint may be lodged against any phase of the public procurement process, as well as
against the decision on a contract award. Among other responsibilities, the Commission
decides on (i) requests for protection of rights and appeals filed against the conclusion of the
contracting authority and the Public Procurement Administration, (ii) monitors and controls
implementation of its decisions, (iii) annuls public procurement contracts,
(iv) imposes fines on contracting authorities and conducts minor offense proceedings in the
first instance. From April 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013, the Republic Commission
exercised its authority to entirely annul the public procurement procedure in 298 cases.79 In the
same period, it did not annul any public procurement contracts.80 For an assessment of the
Commissionâs complaints mechanism see Table 27.

Members of the Republic Commission were appointed on April 1, 2013, and from that date
until the end of the calendar year, the Commission received 1,696 cases and reached a decision
on 1,609 of these cases (of which 1,258 were for the complainant for protection of rights and
124 upon appeals to conclusions of the contracting authorities).81 Of the 1,609 decisions, 343
were not made within the deadline specified by the PPL.82 In this period, the Commission
sometimes applied the 2008 PPL, as the cases were drawn up and filed on the basis of that law.

From January 1, 2014 through June 30, 2014 the Republic Commission received 1,442 cases,
made 1,282 decisions (958 for protection of rights and 80 upon appeals to conclusions of the
contracting authorities);83 of this data set, 177 decisions were not made within the deadline
specified by the PPL.84 In 244 cases related to protection of rights, the Republic Commission
exercised its authority to entirely annul the public procurement procedure.85 In this period, the
Commission did not annul any public procurement contract.86

Comparing the January 1-June 30 periods for 2013 and 2014, there were 37.66 percent more
cases received in the latter, and 41.58 percent more cases resolved.87

Article 158 of the PPL states that the Republic Commission shall decide upon request for
protection of rights whose content is in accordance with Article 151 of the PPL within 20 days
from receipt of the request, and not later than 30 days. The Republic Commission shall decide
upon appeal to conclusions of the contracting authorities within eight days from the day of
receiving the appeal. In the second half of 2013, the average period deciding upon a request
for protection of rights was 23.61 days, and the average period for deciding an appeal to
conclusions of the contracting authorities was 14 days.88 In the first half of 2014, the respective
averages were 19.84 days and 13.19 days.89

PI-20 Effectiveness of internal controls for non-salary expenditure

  Rationale for this indicator:
  PI-20 examines the effectiveness and comprehensiveness of internal controls, and compliance with
  rules for processing and recording non-salary expenditure transactions, at the time of assessment
  (2014). The indicator covers the control of expenditure commitments and payments for goods and
  services, casual labor wages and discretionary staff allowances. The effectiveness of expenditure
  commitment controls is examined as a specific dimension because of its importance to ensuring
  that the governmentâs payment obligations remain within the limits of projected cash availability,
  avoiding expenditure arrears (as examined in PI-4).

This indicator measures the existence and comprehensiveness of, and compliance with, internal
controls of non-salary expenditure at the moment of assessment. The scope of this PEFA
                                                                                                                                        71
Indicator includes commitments of expenditures and payments for goods and services, the
salaries of temporary workers, and the discretionary fringe benefits of personnel.

The Budget System Law establishes the requisite elements for internal control. The Central
Harmonization Unit (CHU)90 of the MoF is in charge of coordinating the introduction of the
Public Internal Financial Control (PIFC), which comprises financial management and control
(FMC) and Internal Audit (IA) in the public sector. In 2013 the current level of development
of PIFC was subject to a screening process by the European Commission as part of the opening
of the negotiations on Chapter 32: Financial Control of the acquis communitaire with the
European Union.91

Internal controls over non-salary expenditure are exercised by both the Treasury
Administration and budget beneficiaries.

On the level of the FMIS managed by the Treasury Administration, there is a robust framework
of automated controls over transactions in both the registration of the expenditure commitment
and payment stages. Coverage of the controls integrated into the FMIS application include
revenues/expenditures, own source revenues/expenditures and received grants/expenditures of
DBBs as well as transfers from the Republican budget. As for transfers from local government
budgets, and own source revenues/expenditures of IBBs, or project loans, these are not
executed through the FMIS system.

To help strengthen the decentralized controls at the level of spending units, a thorough legal
basis for FMC across the public administration is set forth in the Budget System Law. 92 The
provisions apply to all âpublic funds beneficiaries.â The principal responsibility rests with the
Heads of entities that use public funds, who are required to introduce, maintain, and improve
the FMC system in their respective organizations so as to ensure regularity, compliance,
transparency and value for money. Secondary FMC legislation93 sets forth the specific
responsibilities of the Heads and elaborates in detail the five components of the COSO
Framework as suggested by the INTOSAI Guidelines for Internal Control in the Public Sector.

 (i)     Effectiveness of expenditure commitment controls

The Head of each DBB/IBB is responsible for the assumption of commitments, their
verification, and filling of the payment order (i.e., for orderly execution of the budget). It is the
statutory responsibility of the DBBs and IBBs to assume commitments and execute payments
observing the following provision of the BSL: (i) use the budget appropriation up to the amount
determined for a particular purpose in the budget or up to the amount of the appropriation
determined within the program (as revised) for the given year,94 and (ii) stay within the limits

   The CHU is formally called the Sector for Internal Control and Internal Audit.

into the Serbian PFM system.

   Article 51b, Law on Budget System. On one hand, there is a single appropriation (annual), of the total available
funds. On the other hand, there is a quota (monthly), which is a portion of the available appropriation that
represents a specific spending ceiling for the given period.

   Article 54, Budget System Law.

                                                                                                               72
of a monthly quota (i.e., the maximum amount up to which payments can be made) that is
approved by the Treasury Administration on the basis of the Budget Execution Plan submitted
by the DBB/IBB.95 Ex-ante controls over assuming of commitments are accordingly exercised
at the level of DBBs/IBBs.

In practice, it is possible for the spending units to assume commitments within the budget
appropriation but not be able to execute them against the subsequently set monthly quotas. In
such cases, the DBBs may apply to the MoF for a change of the quota. If the Treasury
Administration, guided by the revenue and receipts projections and budget liquidity, decides it
is not possible to change the quota, delays in payment of the already assumed commitments
may occur.96

On the level of the Treasury Administration, controls over the registration and approval of
already assumed commitments and payments are centralized and integrated in the FMIS
application.97 In practice, the automated application controls effectively prevent DBBs from
registering for payment any commitment that exceeds the available appropriation and the
expenditure ceiling set out in the monthly quota. The rules are applied uniformly for all types
of expenditures.

The SAI noted that the controls over the appropriations for DBBs on the Republican level are
satisfactory.

Score A. Expenditure commitment controls on the level of the Treasury Administration
effectively limit commitments to available budget appropriation and to actual cash availability.

(ii)    Comprehensiveness, relevance and understanding of other internal control rules
        and procedures

Broad internal control rules and procedures (e.g., authorization and approval procedures,
segregation of responsibilities, verification, etc.) are set forth in a number of different laws and
by-laws. Systematic strengthening of internal control rules and procedures has been promoted
by means of the integral development of FMC.98 As a comprehensive system of ex-ante and
ex-post controls, FMC aims to provide reasonable assurance that budgetary and other funds
will be used properly and ethically and will embody the principles of economy, efficiency and
effectiveness in the achievement of the organizationâs goals. FMC covers the entire scope of
operations and transactions, in particular those related to revenues and receipts, expenditures
and expenses, procurement procedures and contracting, repayment of improperly paid funds

and liabilities. At the current level of maturity of the FMC system, 99 internal controls are
primarily intended to ensure legality and regularity.

As of end-2013, CHU reported that 43 budget beneficiaries, encompassing 93 percent of
spending, have established internal controls over their business processes.100 CHU has
developed an FMC Manual, providing a road map for introducing and improving the FMC
system, and provides training to an ever-increasing number of financial officers and managers.
At the time of assessment, more than1200 Heads and financial officers had attended training.
There is still an evident need for more training, especially among senior management.101

Public funds beneficiaries report on the progress in establishment and development of FMC to
the CHU through annual self-assessment questionnaires. According to the CHU 2013 Annual
Report, â55 central government organizations (out of received 125 questionnaires) have
organizationally established the FMC system,â while others have made significant progress in
the process of introducing the FMC system. At the time of the assessment, the SAI noted
significant progress in management understanding and support for the introduction of internal
controls as a result of combined efforts of the CHU and the SAI.

Despite the evident progress in the formal introduction of FMC (occasioned by intensive
awareness raising and training activities conducted by CHU) and a robust legal and
methodological framework for internal controls, the SAI 2013 Annual Activity Report, on a
limited sample of central government institutions, states that the internal control systems for a
majority of the 2013 auditees remain deficient in many compliance aspects (including
âoperations in accordance with regulations, internal enactments and contracts, [â¦] and
safeguarding of assetsâ). External auditors presented 248 recommendations aimed directly at
FMC systems in audited entities (22 percent of the total recommendations), whereas internal
auditors presented 1,274 recommendations aimed specifically at internal rules and procedures
(42 percent of the total recommendations).102

Score C. Other internal control rules and procedures set out in laws and by-laws incorporate a
comprehensive set of controls, which are widely understood but not consistently applied, as
evident in the infringements noted. Further significant efforts are needed for full
implementation of the managerial accountability concept and resulting comprehensive risk-
based set of controls.

 (iii)   Degree of compliance with rules for processing and recording transactions

All revenue and expenditure transactions that are channeled through the CTA are processed
and recorded by the Treasury Administration. Although the Treasury Administration does not
compile error or rejection rates for processing and recording of the transactions entered into
the FMIS, it has reported a few formal errors, originating mainly from errors in data entry for
the respective transactions.

   Chapter 32 EU Screening Report from 2013 indicates that the âFMC is still in practice at the basic fiscal control
stageâ (see http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/key_documents/2014/140429-screening-report-chapter-32-
serbia.pdf).

On the level of DBBs and IBBs, the 2013 SAI Annual Activity Report notes that the accounting
system with respect to balances and changes in assets, claims, and liabilities is not regulated
homogeneously, which makes it difficult to maintain uniform and comprehensive records on
financial transactions of budget beneficiaries, in particular with respect to balances and
changes in assets, claims and liabilities. Findings of the MoFâs Budget Inspection Unit, albeit
on a very limited sample with low materiality, indicate that business records are not maintained
in an orderly and up-to date manner. In 2013, internal auditors gave the second highest number
of recommendations (473, or 13 percent of the total) in the area of bookkeeping records and
financial reporting.103

Score C. While the rules are complied with on the level of the Treasury Administration,
findings documented in the work of the SAI and the Budget Inspection Unit point to the need
for improvement in compliance with processing and recording of transactions on the level of
DBBs and IBBs.

PI-21 Effectiveness of Internal audit

      Rationale for this indicator:
      PI-21 assesses how well the internal audit function performs, based on the last available financial
      and operational information (2014). This indicator complements PI-18 and PI-20 because one of
      the functions of internal audit is to monitor and assess the effectiveness of internal controls.

      The internal audit function should meet internationally recognized standards in terms of
      professional independence, sufficient mandate, power to report and use of professional audit
      methods, including risk-assessment techniques.

The functional and organizational independence of Internal Audit (IA) is enshrined as a
principle in the Budget System Law and its remit includes assessment of the FMC system,
which implies auditing of all functions and processes in the operations of the organization. As
an integral part of a broader PFM reform integrating the Public Internal Financial Control
(PIFC), the Budget System Law and the applicable by-laws,104 foresee the establishment of a
decentralized system of internal audit (IA).105 The responsibility for establishing the
prerequisites for IA functioning rests with the Head of each institution.

(i)        Coverage and quality of internal audit function

The Rulebook on Common Criteria and Standards for Organization, and Standards for
Methodological Instructions for Operations and Reporting of Internal Audit stipulates that all
DBBs have the obligation to establish autonomous internal audit units. Other entities may use
one of the other approved modalities for establishment of internal audit. As of end-2013, an
internal audit function has been established in 105 public funds beneficiaries, which account
for 90 percent of public funds.106

CHU reported that not all DBBs on the central government level have established IA units and
that the number of internal auditors is often not matched with the risks, complexity of
operations and the amount of funds for which they are accountable.107 Nevertheless, internal
auditors in 2013 managed to complete more than 88 percent of the audits (615/695) set out in
the individual annual audit plans of their respective organizations.108

All public sector internal auditors are trained and certified under a program designed and
implemented by CHU. The program involves in-class and practical on-the-job training. Public
sector internal auditors are required to follow the internationally recognized International
Professional Practices Framework (IPPF) issued by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA).109

for Operations and Reporting of Internal Audit.
105
    Internal audit function may be established in one of the four following ways: (i) establishment of an
autonomous internal audit unit, (ii) establishment of a joint internal audit unit with several public funds
beneficiaries, (iii) under an agreement for performing IA with other public funds beneficiaries, and (iv)
appointment of internal auditor.

    CHU has not published separate IA standards; rather, it uses the standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors
(IIA), as translated and published by the Serbian IIA chapter.

                                                                                                                76
The methodology and guidance issued by CHU incorporates these standards and reflects good
international practice. As of the time of the assessment, the number of trained and certified
public sector internal auditors was 216.110

The published IA Manual and the CHU training both place the focus of IA activity on system-
based auditing; however, the data collected through the annual reports of individual IA units
does not reveal with certainty the allocation of IA staff time to systemic issues as opposed to
other types of IA work. CHU has highlighted the issue of internal auditors working for a
substantial portion of their time on matters outside of the principal IA duties.

By-laws111 foresee a comprehensive quality assurance program, comprising internal and
external quality assessment. Full-scale external quality assessment has proven expensive to
implement, and peer review is likewise not practicable because of its complexity and technical
demands. Thus, for the moment CHU monitors internal audit work through annual reports by
the IA. CHU conducted a functional review of the internal auditorsâ work in 2012. While all
public sectorinternal auditors have been trained to conduct (internal) quality self-assessments
and Heads of IA units perform ongoing quality supervision over each audit engagement the
functional review results indicate the need for improved quality assurance.

Although the 2013 Annual Activity Report of the SAI documents shortcomings in
establishment of IA units in most of the entities audited in FY12, at the time of this PEFA
assessment (during audits of FY13) SAI counterparts interviewed by the team noted ongoing
efforts to improve the effectiveness of IA through training and awareness raising efforts with
respect to IA standards.

Score C. Internal audit is operational for the majority of central government entities and
substantially meet professional standards as evidenced by monitoring of annual reports by IA
units. System-based audit approach is embedded in the methodology and the training provided
by CHU, but there is no evidence of allocation of at least 50 percent of IA staff to systemic
issues.

 (ii)   Frequency and distribution of reports

Internal auditors report directly to the head of the spending unit. As a rule, the reports are
issued after each completed audit assignment for all government entities. The audit report
contains the summary, audit scope and objectives, findings, conclusions, and recommendations
as well as the comments of the auditee.

Under the decentralized model in place in RoS, the MoF and the SAI are not the designated
recipients of IA reports, as the report is considered an internal enactment of the respective
institution. Automatic distribution of these reports to the MoF and SAI is not formally
mandated in law. Instead individual IA unit makes the reports available to SAI upon request.
The SAI reported that in the course of its work, it requests and obtains internal audit reports,

through annual reports of the IA units submitted to CHU. The information is thoroughly
analyzed and serves as the basis for development of CHUâs consolidated Annual Report on the
Status of PIFC covering both FMC and IA, which the Minister of Finance forwards to the
Government.

Score C. Internal audit reports are issued regularly for most audited government entities and
distributed to the audited entity, but are only submitted to the SAI upon request.

(iii) Extent of management response to internal audit findings
Annual reports from internal audit units indicate that government managers across different
users of public funds take a substantial degree of prompt action to address internal audit
recommendations. Of 3,568 recommendations issued in 2013, 2,212 (almost 62 percent) were
implemented before the year's end, while others were still within the deadline for
implementation as of the first quarter of 2014. The perspective of the SAI is that the
relationship of management toward internal audit recommendations is satisfactory.

Score B. Close to 62 percent of audit recommendations are implemented within 12 months,
indicating prompt and comprehensive action by many (but not all) managers.

PI-22 Timeliness and regularity of accounts reconciliation

      Rationale for this indicator:
      PI-22 assesses the extent to which suspense accounts and advances are regularly reconciled,
      adjusted, or cleared to ensure that financial and government institution statements adequately
      reflect a true fiscal picture. The reference period for the analysis of this indicator is the time of
      assessment (2014).

Serbia has a Consolidated Treasury Account (CTA) in RSD managed by the Treasury
Administration. The custody of the CTA is with the National Bank of Serbia. CTA covers all
accounts of DBBs and IBBs of the Republic of Serbia, with the exception of foreign currency
accounts in commercial banks and NBS (mainly for project loans financed by international
financial institutions). Although foreseen in the legislation, a foreign currency CTA has still
not been established. The only government accounts not managed by the Treasury are the
foreign currency accounts held either with the National Bank of Serbia or commercial banks,
which may be opened only with the approval of the Minister of Finance.

The Treasury Main Ledger (TML) is managed by the Treasury Administration. The statutory
requirement is for the records in the TML to be recorded in accordance with the Chart of
Accounts and on the level of budget classification and encompass transactions and business
changes, including expenditures and revenues, and changes and balance of assets, liabilities,
and capital.112

(i)        Regularity of bank account reconciliations

The Treasury generates daily statements on executed transactions at the end of each day for all
Treasury-managed accounts and makes them available to the beneficiaries. These statements
can be used for reconciliation with the beneficiariesâ auxiliary records.

DBBs that are beneficiaries of accounts held in the commercial banks and NBS113 are required
to report the account flows to the Treasury on monthly basis.114 Treasury enters the
information on execution from the foreign currency account into the TML on the basis of those
reports. The Treasury requires that the closing balance of the report matches the amount on the
bank statement which implies prior reconciliation between the account beneficiary and the
bank. In their audits of DBBs/IBBs that are foreign currency account beneficiaries, the SAI
has not raised any issue as to timeliness of the reconciliation.

Score A. Statements for Treasury-managed bank accounts are generated daily and made
available for reconciliation with spending unitsâ auxiliary records and foreign currency
accounts are reconciled within four weeks to meet the requirements of monthly execution
reporting to the Treasury.

112
    Article 11, BSL.
113
    For themselves and any IBBs that are beneficiaries of the funds.
114
    These reports in turn are generated from Record of Loan Inflows and Outflows prepared by Project
Implementation Units at DBBs/IBBs; these must be accompanied, inter alia, by a bank statement.
                                                                                                          79
(ii) Regularity of reconciliation and clearance of suspense accounts and advances

The Treasury Administration reported that there are no suspense accounts. The sole type of
advance payment that is made is the allowance extended to individual employees for business
travel. These travel allowance advances are extended at the level of the DBB/IBB115 and
recorded in their auxiliary ledgers, and must be justified within 48 hours after the completion
of the travel, with any unused balance repaid. The actual travel expense is subsequently
recorded in the TML.

 Score A. Reconciliation and clearance of advances take place within the same period and no
 balances are brought forward.

PI-23 Availability of information on resources received by delivery units

      Rationale for this indicator:
      PI-23 assesses whether there is consolidated and reliable information available on all resources
      received by service delivery units, such as schools and primary healthcare centers, and whether
      such information is available to monitor allocation and actual use of the resources. The fiscal
      years 2011, 2012, and 2013 are assessed.

      Detailed information on allocation and provision of resources to front-line delivery units and its
      availability are crucial to determine if PFM systems effectively support front-line service delivery.

Service Delivery Units (SDUs) in the education and health sector are indirect budget
beneficiaries. In the education sector, the central government finances salaries for teachers in
primary and secondary education, and investments into infrastructure modernization and
textbooks for elementary school students in junior grades from the budget of the Republic. All
other costs necessary for running of primary and secondary schools are covered from the
budgets of local governments.116

In the health sector, funds from the budget of the Republic are used to finance investments in
premises and maintenance and capital equipment in SDUs (health care centers).117 A special
category of health care costs that are financed from the central government budget are so-called
services of âcommon interest,â such as epidemic control and medical screenings. All budgetary
funds for health care SDUs are managed by the Ministry of Health on behalf of the government.
All other costs (e.g., earnings of health-care workers, medications, expendable materials, etc.)
of the SDUs are covered from the earmarked contributions for health insurance disposed of by
the Republican Fund for Health Insurance.

(i)        Information demonstrating the resources that were received by the most
           common front-line service delivery units

In both the education and health sectors, the data on resources received by SDUs is collected
though regular accounting and in-year reporting.

In the education sector, the Treasury Administration administers the salaries of teachers (as
discussed under PI-18). The funds for this purpose are executed along the lines of annual
appropriations allocated to the Ministry of Education. Their execution is accordingly reported
through the CTA. The costs of investments in infrastructure modernization and textbooks are
charged against the appropriate line items in the Ministry of Education. Monitoring of the
implementation of these resources is conducted by the line sectors. Other capital and
maintenance investments, utilities and costs of goods and services for education SDUs are
planned, executed and accounted in the budgets of local self-government units. Expenditure of
own-source revenues generated by schools (e.g., for renting of premises) is also accounted for.
This information is reported and consolidated at least annually.

In the health sector, SDUs send their requests for funding of investments in premises and
maintenance and capital equipment directly to the Ministry of Health. Designated committees
116
    An exception to this rule are five schools of national interest, cumulatively accouting for 1-2% of the overall
budget, whose costs are directly borne by the Ministry of Education.

    Under the Law on Health Care.
                                                                                                               81
in the Ministry consider these requests in the course of preparation of the Ministryâs annual
procurement plan. The procurement procedure for the selected projects may be implemented
in two ways: (i) centralized procurement by the Ministry of Health, or (ii) decentralized
procurement by the individual SDU, with the MoF in charge of settling the financial side of
the transaction. In either case, the respective transactions are executed and reported through
the TML. For services of common interest, separate reports on project execution are submitted
by the participating SDUs (Public Health Institute, private health-care providers, etc.). Signed
contracts for these services are used by the Ministry of Health to track service delivery. The
information on delivered resources in health-care is accordingly readily available as all
transactions are carried out through the CTA. The Ministry of Health is under the same
accounting and reporting requirements as other DBBs.

No special surveys to collect data on resources to SDUs in education during last three years
have been reported. In the health sector, the Public Health Institute conducts and publishes
extensive analyses on resource availability and utilization, covering also the use of funds from
the budget of the Republic.

Score A. Data on salaries for teachers (primary and secondary schools) and data on capital
investments and special programs in the health sector are collected and disseminated regularly
in the budget execution reports by the Treasury, as they are executed through the Consolidated
Treasury Account. Data on other expenditure by education and health care providers is
available at least annually in the reports of the self-governance units and the Republican Fund
for Health Insurance, respectively.

PI-24 Quality and timeliness of in-year budget reports

      Rationale for this indicator:
      PI-24 assesses the quality and availability of information on progress with budget
      implementation when required by government and MDAs. The reports must be consistent
      with budget coverage and classifications to allow precise monitoring of performance and,
      if necessary, timely use of corrective measures. The reference period for this indicator is the
      last completed fiscal year (2013).

The Law on the Budget System and the Rulebook on Standard Classification Framework and
Chart of Accounts for the Budget System prescribe a unified classification of budget
information, including organizational, economic, functional, and programmatic classification
and classification of expenditures and expenses per source of funding.118

In practice, it is possible to distinguish between three categories of in-year budget execution
reports:
       ï·    ad-hoc reports (daily, weekly, monthly) generated by the Treasury Administration,
            with no officially designated recipient
       ï·    reports by DBBs (including coverage of their associated IBBs) and mandatory social
            insurance organizations, submitted to the Treasury Administration within 20 days from
            the end the quarter
       ï·    MoF reports on budget execution in the course of the budget year, submitted to the
            Government and the National Assembly119 15 days after the end of the second and third
            quarters.120
All the in-year budget execution reports are cash-based.

The assessment describes all the in-year budget execution reports. The rating for the indicator
is assigned for the in-year budget execution reports officially produced by the Government for
decision-making purposes.

(i)         Scope of reports in terms of coverage and compatibility with budget estimates

This dimension analyzes two fundamental aspects of budget information: (i) whether the
classification of the approved budget and the classification used in budget execution reports
are compatible, and (ii) whether the expenditure is covered at both commitment and payment
stages.

In terms of the ad hoc reports generated by the Treasury Administration, FMIS can generate
budget execution reports for any specified parameters and for any required time period. The
data is disaggregated according to the source of financing, functional, economic and sub-
analytical, and program classifications and it presents the budget execution against the
appropriation and the remaining balance, capturing both the registered commitments and
pending payments.

Quarterly reports of DBBs and mandatory social insurance organizations are submitted in a
standard format prescribed in the by-law that requires information on the amount of planned
and executed revenues and receipts, source of financing, amount of approved appropriations,
and executed expenditures and expenses, with the information disaggregated according to the
Chart of Accounts.

For MoF in-year budget reports (see Table 28), the approved budget and the in-year execution
reporting are only consistently reported on the economic classification. The reports include
aggregated information on revenue and expenditure execution, which is presented in the same
format as Article 1 of the approved annual Budget Law. The Budget System Law requires
these reports to contain information about the discrepancies between the adopted budget and
that executed, with an explanation of substantial discrepancies (though this last requirement
was absent from the report for 2013). Since 2014, the spending of the ârevenue from foreign
borrowingâ source of funding, executed from foreign currency accounts held in commercial
banks, are presented in the six-month and nine-month budget execution reports.

Lack of disaggregated data in different types of classification in Government in-year reports
may restrict monitoring and hinder identification of situations that may need corrective
measures. The assessment of objective compliance and of the adequate use of public funds is
also limited because of this weakness, even if the reports are prepared using the budget
structure and figures.

Score B. Expenditure is recorded in the FMIS system at the registration of the assumed
commitments stage and at the payment stage, but the comparison to the original approved
budget is limited to economic classification.

(ii)    Timeliness of report issuance

IBBs are required to submit to their line DBB a quarterly budget execution report within 10
days from the end of the period. DBBs reconcile these reports with the data contained in the
Treasury Main Ledger and their records, consolidate the data, and submit them to the MoF
                                                                                          84
within 20 days from the end of the quarter. The consolidated periodic reports are to be
accompanied with explanation of any substantial discrepancies.121 Similar in-year reporting
requirements are in place for mandatory social insurance organizations, all of which are
required to report to the Treasury Administration within 20 days from the end of the quarter.122
No evidence has been found of the existence of systematic or recurring delays in the
presentation of the in-year reports against the prescribed deadlines.

In 2013, the Government met the statutory deadlines for submitting the six-month and nine-
month budget execution reports to the National Assembly.

Score C. Reports are not produced for the first quarter, but are prepared within 15 days from
the end of the covered period for the second and third quarters.

(iii)   Quality of information

From the perspective of accuracy of data on fiscal revenue and budget execution to date in the
MoF in-year reports, there is no evidence that the data on budget execution registered in the
CTA contain inaccuracies or omissions. The SAI has not made any objections to the quality of
information contained in the in-year budget execution reports.

Score A. CTA records on budget execution, which serve as the basis for preparation of the in-
year budget execution reports, provide information with no material concerns regarding
accuracy.

PI-25 Quality and timeliness of annual financial statements

  Rationale for this indicator:
  PI-25 assesses whether annual financial statements include comprehensive financial and related
  information in a timely way using appropriate accounting standards. The reference period for the
  analysis of dimensions (i) and (ii) is the last completed fiscal year (2013). Dimension (iii) refers to
  the accounting standards used for preparing the annual financial statements for the last three years
  (2011-2013).

                                                                                                                86
The Decree on Budget Accounting specifies the cash basis as the foundation of budget
accounting and requires the preparation of financial statements following the cash-basis
principles of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS).123

The statutory requirement for all of the financial statements is to be presented on a cash basis
of accounting. The Rulebook on the Manner of Preparation, Composition, and Submission of
Financial Statements of Budget Beneficiaries and Beneficiaries of Funds of Mandatory Social
Insurance Institutions distinguishes four types of financial statements: (i) final account,124
(ii) annual financial statement, (iii) periodic financial statement, and (iv) consolidated annual
and consolidated periodic report (Financial statements include the full Balance Sheet, which is
not the recommended approach for the cash-basis of accounting).

Standardized reporting templates are used by the Budget of the Republic of Serbia, mandatory
social insurance institutions and local government budgets.125

The basis for preparation of consolidated financial statements is the Treasury Main Ledger. It
should contain the accounting records for each DBB and IBB and mandatory social insurance
organizations.126 DBBs and IBBs that do not conduct their operations through their own
account, maintain only auxiliary ledgers and records.127 They submit their financial statements
on Template 1 â Balance Sheet and Template 5 â Budget Execution Report of the Rulebook.
The data in the Treasury Main Ledger contains the data from the main ledgers of DBBs and
IBBs, based on periodic reports and final accounts.128

MoF prepares the consolidated financial statements for the public accounts as a draft Law on
Final Account of the Budget of Republic of Serbia. The Government is responsible for
submitting the proposal of the Law to the National Assembly, per the calendar set down in the
Budget System Law.129

(i)      Completeness of financial statements
Annual financial statements of the Budget of the Republic of Serbia are based on the
consolidated financial data from the TML and data from the final accounts of DBBs and of
mandatory social insurance organizations. Final accounts of DBBs and mandatory social
insurance organizations, in turn, represent consolidated financial statements, which include
data from their own bookkeeping records and data from the reports of final accounts of their
respective IBBs.130

Statutory contents of the Public Final Account of the Republic are: (i) annual financial report
on budget execution, with notes and explanations, (ii) annual financial report of mandatory

123
    Article 5, Decree on Budget Accounting.
124
    On five prescribed templates: 1) Balance Sheet; 2) Income Statement; 3) Statement of Capital Expenses and
Receipts; 4) Cash Flow Statement; and 5) Budget Execution Statement.
125
    This requirement is also foreseen for all the DBBs that maintain their own General Ledger (i.e., operate their
own accounts). In practice, there are currently no such DBBs as all are covered by the TML.

social insurance organizations and annual consolidated financial report of the Health Insurance
Fund, and (iii) external audit report. The annual financial statements must be in accordance
with the contents and classification of the budget and the financial results therein must be
determined in accordance with cash-basis IPSAS.131

A number of counterparts identified issues in relation to comprehensiveness and accuracy of
the information on non-financial assets. According to the Budget System Law,132 it is the
responsibility of the Republican Directorate for Assets to report the structure and value of
assets of Republic of Serbia to the Treasury Administration. Because the registry from which
this information is seen as not sufficiently reliable, the Treasury Administration reported that
these provisions have not yet been fully implemented in practice. Instead the Treasury
Administration fills the resulting gap with information received directly from beneficiaries,
which is prepared manually. Reports supplied by the beneficiaries are taken without further
verification and aggregated for the purpose of producing the final account.

Both the Budget Inspection Unit and the SAI noted issues with accuracy of asset valuation and
balance sheet comprehensiveness. In FY13 (as well as in FY12), the SAI issued a disclaimer
of opinion on the Balance Sheet of the Final Account of the Budget of RoS with respect to
non-financial assets.

Score A. The Final Public Account of the Budget of the Republic of Serbia is prepared
annually and contains information on revenue, expenditure and financial assets/ liabilities.

 (ii)      Timeliness in submission of financial statements for audit

The calendar for financial reporting on the level of the Republic is defined in Article 78 of the
Budget System Law and specifies the deadlines displayed in Table 29.

Table 29. Financial Reporting Calendar for the Republican Level
 Date                     Action

                          previous year and submit them to the competent DBBs of the Budget of the Republic.
                          Users of funds of the Republican Health Insurance Fund prepare the annual financial
                          statement for the previous year and submit it to the Republican Health Insurance Fund.
                          Other users of public funds included in the STA that are established by the Republic
                          prepare annual financial statement for the previous year and submit them to the competent
                          body of the Republic of Serbia.
 March 31                 DBBs of the Budget of the Republic prepare the annual report and submit it to the Treasury
                          Administration, and DBBs of the Budget of the Republic who have IBBs of the Budget of
                          the Republic in their competence control, reconcile the data from the annual budget
                          execution reports and prepare a consolidated annual budget execution report, which they
                          submit to the Treasury Administration.
 April 30                 Mandatory social insurance organizations adopt decisions on their final accounts, and
                          adopt reports on execution of the financial plans and submit them to the Treasury
                          Administration. Republican Health Insurance Fund controls, reconciles data from the

 June 20                  Ministry of Finance prepares the draft Law on the Final Account of the Budget of the
                          Republic and, together with decisions on the final accounts of the mandatory social
                          insurance organizations, submits it to the Government.
 July 15                  Government submits to the National Assembly the proposal of the Law on Final Account
                          of the Budget of the Republic and decisions on the final accounts of the mandatory social
                          insurance organizations.
 October 1                Ministry of Finance prepares the Consolidated Report of the Republic of Serbia* and
                          submits it to the Government.
 November 1               Government submits the Consolidated Report of the Republic of Serbia to the National
                          Assembly, for information purposes.
 * Consolidated Statement of the Republic of Serbia is the consolidated statement of the Final Account of the Republic of Serbia, final
 accounts of mandatory social insurance organizations, consolidated statement of the Republican Health Insurance Fund, final accounts of
 the budgets of autonomous provinces, final accounts of the budgets of municipalities and consolidated statements of cities and the City of
 Belgrade. The Consolidated Statement of the Republic of Serbia as such is not subject to being audited.



DBBs/IBBs and mandatory social insurance organizations adhere to the financial reporting
calendar outlined in the primary legislation and submit their financial statements to the
Treasury Administration for consolidation.
The SAI can access the financial statements of the individual budget beneficiaries for audit
from March 31 onwards.

Per the PEFA 2010 Fieldguide Clarification 25-e, this dimension is rated for the Final Account
of the Republic of Serbia, made available for audit at the time when the draft Law on the Final
Account of the Republic of Serbia is completed. In contrast with the financial statements for
the years 2011 and 2012 which were made available for audit within six months after the end
of the period, performance on this dimension deteriorated in 2013. For FY13, the Final
Account of the Republic of Serbia was submitted for audit on July 3, 2014, within seven
months after the end of the audited period.

The Government has adhered to the deadline (July 15) in submitting the proposal of the Law
on Final Account of Republic of Serbia to the National Assembly.

Score B. The Final Account of the Budget of the Republic of Serbia for 2013 was submitted
for external audit within seven months of the end of the fiscal year.

(iii)      Accounting standards used
Under the Decree on Application of International Public Sector Accounting Standards
(IPSAS), the officially prescribed accounting standards for DBBs and IBBs, users of funds of
mandatory social insurance organizations, and budgetary funds of the Republic as of 2010 are
                                                                                                                                        89
the cash-basis IPSAS. The Decree foresees direct application of the original text of the
standards, without additional national accounting regulations.

However, since there are by-laws issued by the Ministry of Finance that prescribe specific
accounting policies and reporting template, the implication is that IPSAS implementation
continues to be indirect (i.e., applied within the limits imposed by the national framework).
The SAI confirmed that the accounting used for the purposes of financial reporting is in line
with the national accounting framework.

Because of a dispute regarding the rights to translation held by the International Federation of
Accountants (IFAC), the Government has not passed the decision to adopt the official
translation of IPSAS as of the time of the assessment.

Financial statements have been presented in a consistent format over the last three years on the
forms prescribed in the Rulebook on the Manner of Preparation, Composition, and Submission
of Financial Statements of Budget Beneficiaries and Beneficiaries of Funds of Mandatory
Social Insurance Organizations. In adhering to this Rulebook, the financial statements do not
disclose the accounting standards used as the prescribed templates to this Rulebook do not
foresee that the accounting standards should be disclosed.

Score D. While the national accounting framework is applied for all financial statements and
the statements have been submitted in a consistent format, the conflicting by-laws effectively
prevent disclosure of the accounting standards used.

3.3.4 External scrutiny and audit

PI-26 Scope, nature and follow-up of external audit

      Rationale for this indicator:
      PI-26 measures the coverage, quality and timeliness of external audit arrangements for the central
      government. It also considers follow-up on audit recommendations. The period of analysis is the
      last audited year (2013).


Legal framework

This indicator principally measures the coverage, quality, and timeliness of external audit of
the use of public funds. The period of analysis is the last audited year at the time of the
assessment (2013).

There is a comprehensive constitutional and legislative framework in place that regulates the
functioning of the SAI in Serbia as the state audit institution. Following its formal
establishment in 2007, the SAI completed its first audit of public accounts in 2009.
The Constitution identifies the SAI as the highest national audit authority, which is
independent and accountable only to the National Assembly.133 The Constitution also assigns
the responsibility for the audit of the execution of all budgets to the SAI.134 The BSL reinforces
this arrangement by prescribing that the final account of the budget of Republic of Serbia and
final accounts of the mandatory social insurance organizations are to be audited by the SAI. 135

SAIâs scope of work, competencies, organization and manner of work are elaborated in the
Law on State Audit Institution and the Institutionâs own Rules of Procedure. The Law on SAI
has a sufficiently broad mandate for the SAI to perform financial statements and compliance
and performance audits of state and EU funds. As of end 2013, the SAI had 201 staff, of whom
167 are auditors, 5 are SAI Council members and 29 are support staff.

(i)        Scope/nature of audit performed (including adherence to auditing standards)

According to the statutory mandate,136 the SAI can audit all public funds of a broad range of
entities across the public sector, including DBBs and IBBs, mandatory social insurance
organizations, public enterprises, units of territorial autonomy and local self-governments, the
National Bank of Serbia and all other beneficiaries of public funds.

The SAI conducts both audits of financial statements and of operations (regularity audit). The
audit remit extends to revenues and expenditures in accordance with the regulations on the
budget system, financial statements, financial transactions, calculations, analyses and other
records and information of the auditees.137 As a part of financial and regularity audits, SAI also

examines the financial management and control systems, internal control systems and internal
audit. The SAI conducted its first performance audit in 2013.

In 2013, SAI conducted financial and regularity audits of 56 entities across the public sector.138
SAI audited the Final Account of the Budget of the Republic of Serbia, 139 and constituent parts
of financial statements of 10 entities. In total, SAI issued 66 audit opinions.140 Based on the
aggregate out-turn figures for DBBs and IBBs, which were audited as a part of the Final
Account, the SAI reported coverage of RSD 2,364 billion (88 percent) of central government
expenditures and expenses.

The SAI has a statutory obligation to conduct audits in accordance with the selected
internationally accepted standards. While the translation of the International Standards of
Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs) framework exists, and is used in audit practice and
referenced in audit reports, the standards have yet not been formally published in the Official
Gazette, as required under the Law.141

Audit manuals in line with ISSAI were not published at the time of the assessment. The
Financial Audit Manual, completed as a part of the EU-funded twinning project and fully
aligned with ISSAI, was piloted in 2013. The Performance Audit Manual was being developed,
along with implementation of the first performance audit.

Score B. A broad range of financial and regularity audits are conducted, covering 88 percent
of central government expenditures and expenses in 2013 (the last FY audited). In 2013, the
first performance audit was initiated. ISSAIs, although not yet published in the Official
Gazette, are applied in practice by auditors.

(ii)     Timeliness of submission of audit reports to the legislature

The law prescribes the following scope of SAI reporting to the National Assembly.142
       ï· Annual Activity Report
       ï· Individual audit reports in the course of the year
       ï· Audit report on Final Account of the Budget of RoS, final accounts of the
           mandatory social insurance organizations and consolidated financial statements of
           the Republic.

In practice, the consolidated financial statements of the Republic are not audited, and
accordingly no audit report is produced and delivered to the National Assembly.

SAIâs Annual Activity Report for the previous year is to be submitted by March 31 of the
current year; this deadline was adhered to in 2013. SAI has the option of reporting to the

    Disaggregated as follows: 4 direct budget beneficiaries, 2 indirect budget beneficiaries, National Bank of
Serbia, public debt of the Republic of Serbia (within Ministry of Finance), 2 agencies, 18 public enterprises, 24
local self-government units, 2 mandatory social insurance organizations and one clinical center. (SAI Annual
Activity Report, 2013).

    The opinion on the Final Account of the Republic of Serbia for 2013 was qualified.

    Disaggregated as follows: 5 unqualified opinions, 59 qualified opinions and 2 disclaimers of opinion.

National Assembly on particularly significant or urgent matters that, in the opinion of the SAI
Council, should not be delayed until the next regular report.

Audit reports for the last yearâs financial statements from individual audit engagements are
submitted to the National Assembly throughout the year (as they are completed). As a result
of the cyclical nature of external audit work, the number of submitted individual audit reports
peaks in the last quarter of the year (in particular, in November), within 12 months after the
end of period covered in the financial statements. The SAI submits the bulk of their audit
reports of individual entities to the National Assembly within nine months of receipt of the
respective financial statement for audit.

The Law on the SAI does not prescribe a deadline by which SAI should submit the audit report
on the Final Account of the Budget of Republic of Serbia. The Law foresees that the SAI
reports to the National Assembly on the audit of the Final Account in the process of the
adoption of the proposal of the Law on Final Account of the Budget of Republic of Serbia.143
In practice, the SAI submits its Audit Report on the Final Account of the Budget of the
Republic in December, within six from its receipt and within 12 months after the end of the
period covered in the financial statements.

Score B. The SAI submits its report within six months from the receipt of the final account for
auditing, which, as is it considered a financial audit implies a score of B, despite the fact that
the Audit Report on the Final Account of the Republic of Serbia is presented to the National
Assembly only in December (within 12 months of end of the accounting period covered).

(iii)     Evidence of follow-up on audit recommendations

The post-audit procedure is laid down in the Law on the SAI144 and SAI Rules of Procedure.
All institutions subject to audit are under the statutory obligation to report to the SAI about the
removal of the identified irregularities or deficiencies within 30-90 days from the completion
of the audit.145 The deadlines have been complied with in practice. A response report is
provided by institutions subject to audit and contains measures to correct the irregularities and
deficiencies addressed in SAI recommendations with a time-bound plan for their
implementation. The procedure stipulates that the auditees monitor the implementation of their
plan and report to the SAI in appropriate intervals with evidence of the implementation of

recommendations. The information on follow-up activities of the auditees is consolidated on
the level of the institution. At the time of the assessment, a comprehensive SAI data base on
the implementation status of the recommendations was being developed.

SAI checks the authenticity of each response report and the accompanying evidence. If it is
determined that the response report with the respective evidence is not authentic, the SAI
Council decides on conducting of follow-up activities over the response report. In 2013, the
first two follow-up audits of response reports occurred and measures foreseen in the law have
been taken.

For all the audits conducted in 2012 (the latest available information),146 the total of
implemented recommendations in 2013 was 71.88 percent (583), recommendations with
ongoing implementation was 26.63 percent (216), and recommendations not implemented
represented 1.47 percent (12).

Score A. Follow-up activities of the auditees entail sending of a formal response within the
statutory deadline and reporting on the status of the plan to implement the recommendations.
SAI conducts follow-up activities for all response reports judged not authentic.

PI-27 Legislative scrutiny of the annual budget law

      Rationale for this indicator:
      PI-27 assesses the nature and extent of legislative scrutiny of budget legislation. It considers the
      extent to which the legislature scrutinizes, debates, approves, and monitors the budget, including
      the existence of clear rules and procedures for scrutiny. The relevant period for assessment is the
      most recent fiscal year (2013).

The legal basis for legislative scrutiny of the annual budget law and in-year amendments by
the National Assembly is contained in the Budget System Law and the Rules of Procedure of
the National Assembly.

The National Assembly is constitutionally responsible for adopting the budget and the Final
Account of the Budget of the Republic of Serbia,147 upon receipt of proposals from the
Government, in accordance with regulations outlined in the Assemblyâs Rules of Procedure as
specified in the Law on National Assembly.148

The National Assembly has a 17-member standing body for budget and finances, the
Committee on Finance, State Budget and Control of Public Expenditure. At the time of the
PEFA assessment, the Committee was supported by a Secretary, four advisers, and one clerkâ
and, as necessary, by the Assistant General Secretary for Legislation. The staffing of the
professional Secretariat poses a challenge for a detailed fiscal analysis, and the Secretariat has
indicated a need for additional staff.149

The duties of the Committee are specified in Article 55 of the Rules of Procedure, and include
deliberation on proposed laws in the domain of the Republican budget, final accounts of the
budget, and financial plans and final accounts of mandatory social insurance organizations.
The Committee is also charged with monitoring and reporting to the Assembly on the
execution of the Republican budget and accompanying financial plans in terms of legality,
effectiveness, and efficiency in public spending.

The legislative review is supported by analyses by the Fiscal Council of Serbia of the Fiscal
Strategy and proposal of the annual Budget Law.

(i)        Scope of the legislatureâs scrutiny
The Budget System Law regulates the procedure and the calendar for presentation of budget-
related documents to the National Assembly. Under this Law,150 as a part of the budget adoption
procedure, the Government is required to submit the following documents to the Assembly:
    ï· Fiscal Strategy, by June 5
    ï· Revised Fiscal Strategy, by October 5
    ï· Proposal of the Law on Budget of Republic of Serbia, by November 1.



147
    Article 99, Constitution.
148
    Article 53, Law on National Assembly.
149
    See SIGMA assessment 2013.
150
    Article 31, BSL.

                                                                                                         95
The Fiscal Strategy should contain the objectives and guidelines of the Governmentâs
economic and fiscal policy for the medium-term covered by the Strategy, including an
overview of priority financing areas and the medium-term expenditure framework of the
budget of Republic of Serbia, covering the next budget year and the subsequent two years. 151
The Revised Fiscal Strategy is an integral part of the materials accompanying the budget
proposal, which itself presents a detailed disaggregation of revenues and expenditures. (The
Secretariat of the Committee on Finance, State Budget and Control of Public Spending noted
that all of the documents listed above are subject to a detailed legislative review.)

The second important stage of legislative review of budget documents consists of the review
of the in-year reports on budget execution, discussed under PI-24. Legislative review likewise
includes the review and scrutiny of any supplementary budget proposal presented during the
course of the year.
The final vital stage of legislative review is discussion and adoption of the proposal of the
Law on Final Account of the Budget of Republic in Serbia, submitted by the Government. In
the period under review by this assessment, the proposal of the Law was submitted to the
National Assembly within the prescribed deadline, but was not scrutinized by the Assembly.

Score A. Legislative review includes medium-term fiscal framework and medium-term
priorities contained in the Fiscal Strategy and details of expenditure and revenue in the annual
budget proposal.

(ii)    Extent to which legislative procedures are well-established and respected

The procedure for legislative review is prescribed in detail in the National Assemblyâs Rules
of Procedure.152 The National Assembly is bound by the Budget System Law to adopt the
Budget of Republic of Serbia by December 15. The proposal of the Law is initially discussed
in the aforementioned Committee, in principle and in detail.153 The Rules of Procedure foresee
the possibility for line committees (e.g., health, education) to submit initiatives for
amendments to the Committee on Finance, State Budget and Control of Public Expenditure.
Only the Committee can file formal amendments it exercised this authority in 2013.
Subsequently, the proposal of the Law is discussed in the National Assembly, both in principle
and in detail where it may be subject to further amendments by the legislature.154 The same
procedures apply for any budget amendment proposed during the year.

In the absence of any specific provisions governing the adoption of the Law on the Final
Account of the Budget of Republic of Serbia, the same procedure should apply for its adoption
as for other primary legislation. However, the Committee reported to the PEFA team that last
time the proposal of the Law on the Final Account of the Budget of Republic of Serbia was
deliberated in the National Assembly was in 2002.155

151
    Article 27d, BSL.
152
    Article 171, Rules of Procedure.
153
    The Committee does not have its own specific rules of procedure.
154
    Article 157, Rules of Procedure.
155
    The explanation for this situation is complex. Government financial statements are formally presented to the
Parliament and should be approved in the form of a Law (Law on Final Account of the Budget of the RoS). The
BSL stipulates that the financial statements should be audited at the time of submission but the Law on SAI is

                                                                                                             96
Score C. The legislatureâs procedures for budget review are firmly established (and include
internal organizational arrangements for legislative oversight). Although the procedures were
respected for the annual budget proposal, such is not the case for adoption of the final account.
The procedures are therefore considered to be partially respected.

(iii)    Adequacy of time for the legislature to provide a response to budget proposals
         and macro-fiscal aggregates, where applicable

The legal requirement is for the National Assembly to have 45 calendar days for deliberation
of the budget proposal (November 1 through December 15). The Rules of Procedure further
establish that discussion on the proposal cannot be initiated sooner than 15 days from the date
of the receipt of the proposal, thus setting a procedural minimum of time before the National
Assembly can exercise its powers.156

In 2013, the Government submitted the budget proposal in accordance with the deadline (see
Table 32). The Secretariat of the Committee reported that the statutory period foreseen in the
Budget System Law was sufficient for the members of the Assembly to familiarize themselves
with the proposal of the annual budget law.157

Regarding the re-balance (formally, Law on Amendments to the Law on Budget of Republic
of Serbia), which is required to follow a comparable legislative timetable as the original
proposal,158 the deadlines in 2013 were much tighter. The proposal for the budget rebalance
was submitted to parliamentary procedure on July 1 and adopted on July 10, effectively
limiting the time for legislative scrutiny to eight days.




silent on the issue. In years 2002-2006 (before the SAI was established in the Constitution) there was no consensus
of which commercial auditor to use. In the subsequent period, the problem was in the time lag between the
submission of the financial statements (normally in June) and the respective audit report (normally in December).
In the end, the Law on the Final Account (i.e. the financial statements) has not been approved by the Parliament
for over a decade.

    Although irrelevant to the PEFA scoring for the 2013 snapshot, it is worth noting that the 2011 performance
fell well short of the mark (see Table 28); on the other hand, itâs important to notice the subsequent
improvements in 2012 and 2013.

The dimension is rated on the basis of the time available for review of the annual budget
proposal. Score C is assigned in reference to the score for dimension (ii) within this indicator.

 Score C The time for review of the initial annual budget proposal was statutory 45 days in
 the last completed period considered for this assessment (2013).

(iv)       Rules for in-year amendments to the budget without ex-ante approval by the
           legislature

There are clear legal and procedural rules in the Budget System Law that govern in-year budget
amendments by the executive without ex-ante approval by the legislature. Reallocations of in-
year appropriations are allowed for no more than 5 percent of the annual appropriation
approved for a particular type of expenditure or expense by the DBB or up to 10 percent within
a program appropriation, with prior approval of the Ministry of Finance.159 The amount of the
change in appropriation is limited by the amount of the available appropriation. As previously
noted, the Treasury Administration reported that the limits on changes to appropriations are
consistently observed.

The described limits and procedure refer only to appropriations from the budget revenues;
appropriations from revenues from other sources may be changed without restrictions, except
that these changes must also be approved by the Ministry of Finance.

In-year changes to appropriations may also occur as a result of court rulings that implicate
government funds. In cases where the total annual appropriation of the budget beneficiary for
these purposes is consumed, the Treasury Administration reallocates funds from another
relevant appropriation in the amount needed to execute the court ruling.160

Score B. Clear rules exist for in-year budget amendments by the executive, and are usually
respected, but leave room for some administrative reallocations.

PI-28 Legislative scrutiny of external audit reports

      Rationale for this indicator:
      PI-28 assesses the extent to which the legislature scrutinizes and acts on audit reports. The focus
      is on central government entities and the extent to which they are required to submit audit reports
      and respond to questions and recommendations.

The Law on SAI foresees deliberation of the SAIâs reports by the National Assembly and these
duties were discharged by the Committee on Finance, State Budget and Control of Public
Spending in accordance with the remit defined in the National Assemblyâs Rules of Procedure.

The interaction of the Committee with the outputs of SAIâs activities is defined in two instances
in the Rules of Procedure. The first is the deliberation and reporting of the Committee to the
National Assembly of the SAIâs Audit Report on the conducted audit of the Final Account.161
The second is the deliberation of the SAIâs Annual Activity Report and reporting to the
Assembly with a proposal of conclusions/recommendations. The Annual Activity Report is
relevant for Parliamentary scrutiny as it highlights the principal findings and recommendations
from the audit of the Final Account. The National Assembly is to deliberate the SAIâs Annual
Activity Report alongside the report produced by the Committee. Upon concluding the
deliberation, the National Assembly is to decide on the proposal of
conclusions/recommendations by a majority vote.162 No specific procedures are foreseen for
examination of the individual audit reports.

(i)        Timeliness of examination of audit reports by the legislature

There are no statutory or procedural deadlines for reviewing of audit reports by the Committee
or the National Assembly.

Although the law defines the same procedures for legislative review of the budget proposal
and the final accounts of the budget, there is no evidence of deliberation of the Audit Report
on the Final Account of the Budget of Republic of Serbia for fiscal years 2011, 2012, and 2013
in the Committee or the National Assembly. No specific average number of months from
receipt of the audit reports to their deliberation in fiscal years 2011, 2012, and 2013 was
reported.

The Committee did consider the 2012 SAI Annual Activity Report in June 2013, and prepared
and submitted a Report with a proposal of Conclusions to the National Assembly. In
accordance with the Law on SAI163 and the Rules of Procedure,164 the National Assembly
adopted the Committee conclusions.

Score D. There is no evidence of deliberation of the Audit Report on the Final Account of the
Budget of Republic of Serbia in fiscal years 2011, 2012, and 2013 in the Committee or the
National Assembly.

 (ii)   Extent of the hearings on main findings undertaken by the legislature
Although the Rules of Procedure165 provide for the holding of public hearings as a means for
Committee members and other parliamentarians to receive information, professional opinion
or comments from stakeholders, these are typically of a general nature and have not been
practiced for matters related to external audit.

The Rules of Procedure166 foresee that an SAI representative may be required to participate in
sessions of the Committee and the session of the National Assembly; this occurred in 2013.
Representatives of the Committee Secretariat expressed satisfaction with the SAI
cooperation.

Score D. SAI representatives actively participated in the activities foreseen by the Rules of
Procedure of the National Assembly, but the legislative body did not conduct further in-depth
hearings.

(iii)   Issue of recommended actions by the legislature and implementation by the
        executive

While the SAI Law foresees a procedure in which the National Assembly considers the
proposed audit recommendations, measures, and deadlines for their execution,167 there is no
further specification of the requirements for auditees on actions to be taken. The
recommendations issued by SAI are already legally binding on auditees.

Following the first deliberation of the SAI Annual Activity Report in the National Assembly
in 2013, the Conclusions of the National Assembly confirmed that the SAI had made a
thorough presentation of its activities in its 2012 Annual Activity Report and the Assembly
requested the SAI to report on implementation by the executive of SAIâs audit
recommendations from 2011. Subsequently, in its in June 2014 deliberation of the 2013 SAI
Annual Activity Report, the National Assembly confirmed that the SAI had made a thorough
presentation of its activities in the 2013 Annual Activity Report. However, the Assembly did
not offer specific recommendations and/or measures to the executive on either these two
occasions.

Score D. The National Assembly has not issued any recommendations to the executive to
implement SAI recommendations in the 12 months prior to the date of the assessment.

D-1       Predictability of direct budget support

    Rationale for this indicator:
    D-1 assesses the predictability of inflows of budget support and its implications for governmentsâ
    ability to plan and implement its budget, including amounts offered by donors. This indicator is
    assessed using the last three financial years (2011, 2012, and 2013).

Coordination of international cooperation processes is the responsibility of the European
Integration Office (SEIO) established by the Serbian Government in March 2004. In June 2010
the Government amended by Decree the scope of work of the SEIO, expanding its coordinating

activities in the area of planning and using European funds, donations, and other forms of
foreign development assistance.

The SEIO information system (ISDACON) provides information on assistance programs and
development partners (donors), including information for the years 2000-2013. Table 33
displays the assistance data by each donor during the years 2011-2013, including all assistance
programs, as well as assistance to the central and local governments, and to autonomous
entities and public enterprises, as well as all financial (loans, grants and assistance in kind) and
assistance modalities (budget support, investment loans and grants). Data can also be obtained
aggregated by sectors.

(i)     Annual deviation of actual budget support from the forecast provided by donor
        agencies

The only budget support identified was the Second Public Expenditure Development Policy
Loan (a World Bank program, approved and disbursed in a single tranche in 2011, US$ 100
million). The Budget Law 2013 announced a Programmatic Budget Support operation (US$
100 million) from the Russian Federation, but there is no evidence in the budgetary reports that
a disbursement from this program was made on 2013. In general, the Serbian Government,
does not request and does not expect that donors prepares and submit disbursement forecasts
for such type of programs. There is no evidence that donors that executed budget support
programs in the years 2011, 2012, and 2013, prepared and submitted a disbursement forecast
before the beginning of the fiscal year. Such programs were formally approved during the year
and the disbursement was made on the following months of such year.

Score D. No comprehensive and timely forecast for the year(s) was provided by donor
agencies. Fifty percent of the expected cooperation (Russian program) was not implemented.

(ii)    Timeliness of disbursements by donors during the year

As defined by the Loan Agreement of the âSecond Public Expenditure Development Policy Loanâ
operation, âThis Operation is a single-tranche loan. The loan proceeds would be made available to the
Borrower upon the effectiveness of the Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Republic of Serbia.â
Thus, disbursement is not subject to a disbursement forecast but to the accomplishment of the Loan
conditions (effectiveness). Although the loan was fully disbursed during the year, it was not
possible to agree and include in the budget the disbursement before the beginning of the fiscal
year, which is a requirement to merit a C or higher score.

                                                                                                104
Score D. The requirements for score C (or higher) were not met, for the sole example of a
potential data set.

D-2 Financial information provided by donors for budgeting and reporting on
project and program aid

  Rationale for this indicator:
  D-2 assesses the predictability of inflows of donor support for programs and projects in respect of
  the provision of accurate and timely estimates of available funds for inclusion in the budget
  proposal and reporting on actual donor flows.

  The assessment is based on quantitative data for the donors providing project and program
  support and focuses on the last completed fiscal year (2013).

This indicator assesses the predictability of donor support for programs and projects in respect
to the provision of accurate and timely estimates of available funds for inclusion in the budget
proposal and reporting on actual donor aid. The assessment focuses on the last completed fiscal
year (2013).

Section 4 of the 2013 Budget Law has information of the âInstrument for Pre-Accession
Assistanceâ (IPA) program provided by the European Union to the Serbian Government. The
IPA program has two components: (i) a five-year (2008-2012) program that supports transition
and institutional strengthening and had assigned a total of â¬158,114,000 for 2013, and (ii)
technical assistance to support cross-border activities, which had assigned for execution in
2013 a total of â¬11,066,000. The Budget Law also explicitly refers to the counterpart amount
committed by the Government as co-financing for the IPA program. Thus, the global amount
of donor assistance reported in the Budget Law for the year 2013 is â¬169,180,000 (equivalent
to RSD 20,233,928,000), and the global amount of the committed counterpart by the Serbian
Government for the year 2013 represents RSD 3,723,423,000, totaling RSD 23,957,351,000.

                                                                                                                  105
Information provided by the Treasury Administration regarding budgetary expenditures for
2013 shows the following totals: Amount in the Budget Law RSD 33,593,620,000; amount as
modified during the year RSD 34,687,684,047; and amount finally executed RSD
25,135,928,799.

As reported by the Integration European Office (SEIO) through the ISDACON system, the
total amount received in 2013 by the Serbian Public Sector was â¬1,097.87 million (see Table
34).

(i)    Completeness and timeliness of budget estimates by donors for project support

Only the IPA program (a small portion of received aid) and a (RSD 519,287,000) program
from the World Bank under the Ministry of Education are included in the Budget Law.
Treasury information shows that the amount of donor cooperation included in the Law was
just about 71 percent of the initial amount recorded in the Treasury database as a beginning
balance. Although the difference in the initial budgetary amount probably includes remaining
balances from the prior year, it is clear that the information mentioned in the Budget Law about
assistance programs does not include the majority of donor programs and it is not accurate.
Delays on project implementation are relevant, showing that project planning is not realistic,
severely impacting budget planning and preparation of budget estimates.

Score D. Not all major donors provide budget estimates for disbursement of project aid, and
estimates for project execution are not accurate.

(ii)   Frequency and coverage of reporting by donors on actual donor flows for
       project support

As noted in the 2010 PEFA assessment, the only information on donor assistance is reported
in the SEIO-ISDACON system, which only provides an overview of the received assistance
on completed years, without a quarterly distribution; therefore there is no evidence that donors
report the status of their programs on a quarterly basis. Additionally, more than 50 percent of
the donor aid is not included in the budget.

Score D: Donors do not provide quarterly reports within two months of end-of-quarter on
disbursements made for at least 50 percent of externally financed project estimates in the
budget.

D-3     Proportion of aid that is managed by use of national procedures

  Rationale for this indicator:
  D-3 assesses the use of national procedures including procurement, payment/accounting, audit,
  disbursement and reporting, using donor funds. The assessment focuses on the last completed fiscal
  year (FY2013).

As noted in the discussion of Indicators D-1 and D-2, the amount of donor assistance that is
managed through the budget system is only a small portion of the totality of such assistance.
However, with the available information it is not possible to identify the proportion of the
assistance that was provided to the central government, exclusive of the assistance provided to
local governments, autonomous entities, and public enterprises.

Programs that are included on the Budget Law are normally executed using all the government
systems, although the Audit Report to the 2013 Financial Statements refers in a few instances
to some oversights and errors in applying government procedures.




                                                                                                            107
(i)     Overall proportion of aid funds to central government that are managed through
        national procedures

The PEFA methodology requires calculating the average of the following four percentages:
    ï· âPercentage of all donor funds to government that use the national procurement
        procedures
    ï· Percentage of all donor funds to government that use the national payment /
        accounting procedures
    ï· Percentage of all donor funds to government that use national audit procedures
    ï· Percentage of all donor funds to government that use the national reporting
        procedures.â
Since it is not possible to identify precisely the amount of assistance received by the central
government, and from Budget Execution Reports it is not possible to identify clearly the source
of funds used on all expenditures, the calculation of the required percentages is not feasible.

 Score NR. The available information on assistance provided to the central government is not
 adequate to score the indicator.

4. Government reform process
4.1     Description of recent and ongoing reforms
The Consolidated Treasury Account (CTA) was introduced in 2010, enabling much improved
management and control of public funds, and this was followed by further refinements to the
system. Inclusion of sources of financing other than budget revenue source in 2012, bringing
a number of extra-budgetary funds into the budget and capturing own source revenue - further
enhanced the coverage and transparency of the budget and budget execution system. There are
plans to integrate indirect budget beneficiaries into the budget execution system (i.e. FMIS)
within the Treasury. Additionally there is a plan to integrate foreign currency funds currently
held in separate accounts in the National Bank of Serbia into a CTA coverage, action that was
delayed on some occasions in the past.

Revisions to Budget System Law from 2013 targeted improvements in commitment control
and prevention of creation and accumulation of expenditure arrears. This primarily relates to
the introduction of the software for commitments control (RINO168) which is linked to the
payments software. Improvements in commitment controls and a new Law on Deadlines for
Payments in Commercial Transactions from March 2013 are aimed at stabilizing and reducing
the level of arrears.

Revisions of the BSL foresee establishment of the centralized staff register and salary
processing system, but the new Register is still not being used for salary calculation and
processing. The legislative procedure to adopt a new Law on Salaries of Civil Servants is
underway. The new Law is intended to introduce uniformity in the area of salaries and replace
the current complex system, which includes over 20 pay basis and 800 coefficients used to
calculate the salaries, with pay grades.

Forecasts of fiscal aggregates on the basis of the main categories of economic classification
were introduced and prepared for two years following the budget year on a rolling annual basis,
but with limited considerations of such forecasts during the following budget preparation cycle.
After piloting program budgeting in five institutions, it has been rolled out in 2015 across all
levels of government, but it is intended in upcoming budget cycles to further enhance features
of quality program budgeting, such as establishing, measuring and reporting performance
indicators.

The government has recognized the need to improve management of public investment as one
of the priorities in the medium-term. In line with that, a capital investment unit has been formed
within the sector for budget preparation at the MoF. Amongst its first tasks will be to coordinate
a working group for preparation of a by-law intended to regulate identification, evaluation,
selection, implementation and monitoring of public investment, as well as development of
accompanying methodology for this process.

There was significant strengthening of capacity of the SAI over the past years in terms of
number of staff, organizational structure and development of an audit methodology. The

168
   RINO stands for âRegistry of Settlement of Pecuniary Commitmentsâ. The purpose of the application is to
improve the availability of information about the assumed commitments, meeting of the statutory deadlines for
payment and to prevent accumulation of potential arrears. While it covers transactions between the public and
the commercial sector, it leaves out the information on transactions between public sector entities.
                                                                                                          109
institution conducted its first performance audit in 2013, and the most recent development
relates to establishing quality control department within the institution.

Legislative framework for implementation of Public Internal Financial Control (PIFC) was
established by provisions of Budget System Law. Central Harmonization Unit is coordinating
implementation. Internal audit and financial management and control have been rolled out in
large number of entities. Nevertheless, since those functions (and in particular financial
management and control) have not been established across all entities, or have not been made
fully functional, there are further ongoing efforts in this direction. Progress in this area will be
vital in the EU accession process considering that PIFC is in the center of chapter 32 on
financial controls, which is expected to be among first chapters to be opened during
negotiation. In line with the above, a new PIFC strategy/policy paper is in draft stage with
further refinements to the document expected in the coming months. A PIFC strategy/policy
paper is expected to make integral part of broader PFM strategy/programme document which
is currently under preparation. PIFC is likewise recognized as a vital part of the overall Public
Administration Reform Strategy.

Considerations with regard to shift from cash basis to accrual basis of accounting in the coming
period were expressed by relevant governmentâs institutions, with the intention being to
carefully assess existing gap and possible trajectory to accrual.

Currently efforts are invested to enhance the governmentâs oversight and monitoring of state-
owned enterprises (public enterprises), with a unit in the Ministry of Economy in charge of
corporate strategy and governance and monitoring of financial and operational performance of
state-owned enterprises, and a unit in the Ministry of Finance which analyzes fiscal risk arising
from operations of state-owned enterprises and provides further support in monitoring of
financial performance, such as monitoring mass salaries and the implementation of legislative
acts.

A new Public Procurement Law was adopted in December 2012 and became effective on April
1, 2013. The law had an objective to bring the Serbia public procurement system close to
international procurement standards, but more importantly a step forward towards the
alignment with the EU Procurement Directives (2004/18). To ensure implementation of the
Law, a number of implementing regulations and model tender documents have been adopted
during 2013, and a few others remain to be prepared.

4.2    Institutional factors supporting reform planning and implementation

Serbia Public Administration Reform (PAR) Strategy provides a support framework to the
Public Financial Management reform. The PAR is one of the Government priorities that
adopted the Republic of Serbia Public Administration Reform Strategy in 2014. The
implementation of the PAR Strategy has been supported by the implementation of the PAR
Action Plan, for the period 2004-2008 and 2009-2019. Also, more specific and targeted Public
Financial Management Program 2015-2017 is being developed, and it is in draft version at the
time of this report. The European Union (EU) assistance to Serbiaâs ongoing reform is based
on the EU integration process and aims to structural reforms and additionally to meet EU
requirements on PFM specific aspects as taxation and customs (Chapter 16 and 29), budgetary
frameworks (Chapter 17), public procurement (Chapter 5) and internal control and external
audit (Chapter 32).
                                                                                               110
Commitment to further advance PFM reform is strong at Government level and institutions as
shown by the reform strategic plans and the number of ongoing reform activities that set up a
foundation of an enabling environment for the PFM reform.

Although a strong commitment exists, sustainability of the reform process is a challenge with
two fold implications. On one side, frequent changes in the Governmentâs composition pose a
threat to sustainability of reforms as the momentum may be lost due to changed priorities. On
the other hand, large part of reform initiatives is linked to international funding or cooperation,
therefore outcomes of such undertakings should be properly managed in order to ensure that
achieved results are sustainable in terms of transferred know-how and continued
implementation benefits.

Annex 7. PEFA Methodological Framework through Time

Through time, the PEFA Secretariat has developed - as part of its mandate - various technical
guidance notes and tools to facilitate the work of assessors or any stakeholder conducting a
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability PEFA-based Public Financial Management
(PFM) assessment and seeking guidance on how to go about it. Most of these guidance notes
are based on reviews and comments on carried-out assessments or have been developed in
response to questions received from teams applying the Framework at country level, and are
updated regularly. The additional guidance and clarification provided through the time helps
to clarify the methodology, sources of information and calibrate better the scoring in PEFA
dimensions. A nonâcomprehensive list of updates is presented below to illustrate how the
Framework has evolved through time:

   -   Issues in Comparison and Aggregation of PEFA Assessment Results over Time
       and Across Countries (May 2009). How to use the data available from PEFA
       assessments to make meaningful comparisons of scores over time within
       countries and cross-country comparisons both at a given point of time and over
       time?
   -   Guidance Note for Repeat Assessments (February 2010). Suggestions for each
       stage of a typical repeat assessment in order to provide a clear picture of specific
       changes in performance since the initial or baseline assessment.
   -   Spreadhseets to assist in the calculation of PI-1 and PI-2 (revised January 2011).
   -   No Scoreâ for an indicator or dimension date (July 2011) methodology for a
       detailed solution for assessors when they encounter a no scoring situation in
       order to ensure clarity and consistency of terminology and justification.
   -   CN & TOR Checklist revised (June 7, 2012) replaces the English and Spanish
       versions from March 2007. A list prepared to assist those who prepare and
       review concept notes and terms of reference for Public Expenditure and
       Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessments.
   -   Good Practices in Applying the PEFA Framework revised (June 7, 2012) replaces
       the version of March 2009. Guidance for assessors and managers for the
       planning, management of and follow-up on assessments.
   -   Clarifications to the Framework (last update January 2012) in English: a set of
       notes based on FAQs and providing additional guidance for those who are
       applying the PFM Performance Indicators and the Performance Report.
   -   Fieldguide (May 2012) in English. The fieldguide combines the contents of
       several earlier guidance.
   -   Quality Review Templates for CN/TORs and Assessment Reports (January
       2013).
   -   Guidelines for the application of the PEFA Framework at the Sub National
       Government level (Updated January 2013). A set of practical and detailed
       guidelines for the application of all specific indicators and individual dimensions
       for applications at the Subnational level.

                                            Serbia
         Serbia Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability- PEFA Report (P152125)

   Background and context
1. Serbia is an upper-middle-income country. Economic growth was strong during the early
   and mid-2000s, with economic reforms helping to stimulate new export dynamism and
   significant domestic demand. However, the expansion was also fueled by domestic
   consumption, large capital inflows, and a credit boom and the 2008 downturn left Serbia
   looking for new sources of growth. Like many countries in the region, the challenge for
   Serbia has been to translate tenuous economic recovery into jobs and poverty reduction in
   difficult domestic and regional environments. Both unemployment and poverty rates saw
   sharp reversals in the wake of the crises; unemployment increased from below 15 percent in
   2008 to nearly 25 percent in 2012, increasing most among the lowest income earners, and
   poverty jumped from about 6 percent in 2008 (after falling by more than half since 2002) to
   more than 9 percent in 2009. To address these economic and social challenges, Serbiaâs
   challenges are to improve competitiveness and the efficiency and outcomes of its social
   spending.

2. Serbia opened a negotiations process with the European Union (EU) in January 2014.
   Part of this process will involve identification of goals and objectives for Instrument for Pre-
   Accession Assistance (IPA) support, including public administration, and PFM reform, as a
   core component in relation to Chapter 32 of the acquis comunitaire, Financial Control and
   as described in the Pre-accession Economic Programme for 2014 of the GoS. Continuing on
   a number of ongoing and completed reform initiatives, the government and the donor
   community are working on identifying ways to further pursue a PFM reform agenda, and are
   seeking up to date information on the current performance and priority areas that need
   external support. Further improvement in the PFM system is a part of Public Administration
   Reform Strategy (January 2014), which is one of the Governmentâs priorities in the period
   to come.

3. The authorities have sought to strengthen the public financial management in recent
   years. Numbers of areas of the PFM system were marked by legislative and institutional
   developments. Law enforcement and functioning of institutions developed at a slower pace,
   but still registering improvements. The State Audit Institution came a long way since its
   foundations and start of audit work in 2008.170 Coverage of public expenditures which are
   audited, number of entities and capacity of the SAI increased substantially. The Budget
   System Law defined in 2009 the establishment of the Public Internal Financial Control
   (PIFC) framework. Ever since, development of internal audit function experienced progress,
   and at a slower rate - financial management and control. There are five pilot ministries for
   introduction of program budgeting, which should be implemented across central and local
   level in 2015. An amendment to the Budget System Law including Budget Accounting is in
   preparation which is expected to bring about improvements with regard to clarity of

      Serbiaâs SAI was established with the SAI law in 2005 but become operational only in September 2007
   and started activities gradually in 2008.

                                                                                                        139
   accounting standards used and reliability and completeness of financial reporting. There were
   changes in the Budget System Law in 2013 with the aim to enhance management of arrears
   and commitment control.
4. A letter with the official request from the Government to conduct a PEFA assessment
   was submitted to the World Bank. Letter dated July 7 2014 and signed by (now former)
   Minister of Finance, has been received by the Bank on July 15 2014. The letter emphasized
   the Governmentâ expectation that PEFA will provide relevant findings to help the
   Government in the process of preparing the PFM reform programme and identify priority
   areas. The letter also requests PEFA assessment teamâs input to corresponding action plans
   in priority areas identified by the PFM reform programme. The Governmentâs commitment
   to the task has been re-confirmed with the new Minister of Finance.

5. Previous PEFA assessments in Serbia were conducted in 2007 and 2010. The PEFA 2010
   registered overall improvement comparing to the assessment from 2007. The 2010
   assessment identified the following areas as key strengths of the PFM system in Serbia:
   public access to key fiscal information; orderliness and participation in the annual budget
   process; accounting, recording and reconciliations; in-year and annual reporting. Main areas
   for improvement as per the assessment were planning and budget formulation including
   costing of sector strategies: recording and management of arrears, procurement competitive
   practices; effectiveness in collection of tax payments and customs fees; legislative scrutiny
   of external audit reports and; donor practices. One of the outcomes of the PEFA 2014 will
   be to measure progress and changes comparing to the previous assessment.

6. The government intends to adopt a new PFM Reform Programme in 2015. The EUâs
   new enlargement strategy now foresees a more comprehensive approach to PFM in all
   enlargement countries and those countries are expected to prepare multi-annual PFM
   programs. A credible and relevant PFM programme is also one of the four pre-conditions for
   using IPA funds in form of sector budget support. Since all PFM sub-systems are strongly
   inter-linked, a credible reform programme will need to address all public financial
   management sub-systems, including revenue administration, budget preparation, budget
   execution with cash management, debt management, public procurement, accounting and
   reporting, public internal financial control (including internal audit), and external audit, as
   well as adequately sequence reform actions both within and between the sub-systems. The
   building block for enlargement countries to work on a programme is to have a comprehensive
   diagnostics of the situation, covering all PFM sub-systems, and the preferred diagnostic
   assessment is PEFA.

   Purpose, scope and coverage

7. The purpose of this project is to provide the Government of Serbia with an updated
   assessment of the performance of the public financial management system. The
   assessment process seeks to provide better understanding of the performance of the public
   financial management system and those areas where further attention is needed to strengthen
   the framework and move to a higher standard in terms of international good practice. The
   assessment is expected to provide relevant information to be used for preparation of PFM
   Reform Programme by the Government. This efforts form part and are aligned to the
   country's objective to get access to the EC as a mean to improve the economic growth and
   share prosperity in the country. At the same time, the task itself will provide input to PFM

                                                                                              140
   Reform Programme and associated actions plans for PFM reform in priority areas identified
   by the PFM Reform Programme.

8. The proposed assessment will discuss progress since the 2010 assessment. As one of the
   priorities, the PEFA will include discussion and presentation of the changes since the
   previous assessment and a discussion of the differences between the indicator scores of the
   two assessments. This assessment will cover the core financial management and planning
   systems for the institutions of central government that are funded from the national budget.
   For example, it will not include public enterprises or local self-governments, except to the
   extent envisaged by related indicators ie. PI-9 and PI-8, respectively.

9. The proposed assessment will cover central government level. Applying the indicators in
   the six performance dimensions of an openly and orderly PFM system will be conducted as
   defined by the PEFA framework. The central government comprises a central group of
   ministries and departments. The Government with the support from the SECO Swiss
   cooperation is simultaneously applying the PEFA methodology at subnational level for six
   municipalities. Coordination between the assessments will be critical to ensure consistency
   and that will be pursued by reciprocal peer reviewing for National and Subnational PEFA
   from both institutions.

   Stakeholders and their roles

10. The Government of the Republic of Serbia will be the primary audience and the final
   owner of the report. The Ministry of Finance will be main Government counterpart for the
   assessment. The Ministry of Finance will coordinate with representatives from all key
   institutions involved in the assessment that will be act as a PEFA working group, acting as
   focal point of contact and cooperation for the assessment team. It will include representatives
   of the Ministry of Finance, Treasury, Tax Administration, State Audit Institution and Public
   Procurement Administration. Members of the working group will provide most of the
   relevant information to the assessment team during data collection and will coordinate
   communication between the team and public officials, thus facilitating provision of the
   remaining information. The assessment team will draft the report and assign ratings that will
   be validated within the working group. The members of the group will review and provide
   comments on each draft of the report. Members of the working group are expected to attend
   initial training/launch workshop and final report/dissemination event. Other audience will
   include the donor community and other relevant institutions in PFM area.

11. The World Bank will lead and manage the assessment team, which will consist of the
   World Bankâs staff, international and local consultants. The assessment team will be
   responsible for data collection, preparation of draft report, revising the report for comments
   by the Government and peer reviewers, and producing the final report. The assessment will
   comply with PEFA CHECK quality assurance guidelines with the aim of having the
   assessment endorsed by the PEFA Secretariat. The PEFA Secretariat will provide comments
   on the design and content of the assessment but will not participate in the project in any other
   way, as is the case with all individual assessments.

12. The project will be funded by the Strengthening Accountability and the Fiduciary
   Environment (SAFE) Trust Fund. SAFE Trust Fund already financed a number of PEFA

                                                                                               141
   assessments, most recent cases in the region are Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
   Financiers of the Trust Fund are the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO)
   and the European Commission (EC). This task will be funded by both pools of the SAFEâs
   financing. There will be a minimum of four reviewer institutions as required by the PEFA
   check methodology: Government of Serbia, the PEFA Secretariat, EU, the Swiss
   Government and the World Bank. The peer reviewers will be as follows: Milovan
   Filimonovic, Assisant Minister of Finance; Gabriela Schafroth and Irene Frei (SECO);
   Vladan Petrovic (EU); The PEFA Secretariat; Franck Bessette, Sr. Financial Management
   Specialist, GGP MENA Region, and Lazar Sestovic, Country Economist for Serbia (World
   Bank). The PEFA Secretariat will have a central role in assuring compliance with the
   methodology and achievement of quality standards. If assessed to meet the required quality
   assurance procedures, the PEFA Secretariat will endorse the final assessment by issuing
   PEFA CHECK.

   Methodology

13. The assessment will be conducted in line with existing PEFA methodology at the time
   of preparation and data collection for the assessment. The assessmentâs methodology will
   not incorporate revisions to PEFA methodology expected to be valid from January 1 2015.
   This should allow comparability of ratings with the 2010 assessment, and more meaningful
   analysis of progress/changes that occurred between two assessments. Training in PEFA
   methodology will be delivered to Clientâs staff. A new adjusted PEFA framework has been
   recently published for consultation and there is the possibility for piloting the new adjusted
   framework in parallel with the PEFA methodology in addition to the current PEFA
   methodology report. This possibility will be discussed with the Government and the PEFA
   Secretariat to explore the application as a test of the adjusted methodology on a pilot basis.
   If the test of the new adjusted framework is agreed it would be prepared as a separate
   document and it will not part of the quality assurance mechanisms including the PEFA
   Check. The pilot document is an agreement between the Government, the World Bank and
   the PEFA Secretariat and will remain confidential unless the Government decides on its
   publication and would be delivered for Government comments after the PEFA Report
   delivery.

14. The PEFA assessment will be conducted in line with PEFA Framework as approved by
   the PEFA Steering Committee. This means that the assessment will review and assign
   rating over 28 main indicators of performance in PFM area, plus three indicators related to
   donor practices. As indicated above, the assessment will apply current methodology as
   published on the PEFA Secretariat website, as adopted in January 2011 after revisions to
   indicators PI-2, PI-3 and PI-19. It will not apply revisions to the methodology, expected to
   be adopted from January 1 2015. The assessment is based on a review of information for the
   last three complete budget consecutive years, and in this case it will cover 2011, 2012 and
   2013 and in some cases the current status of the PFM function under analysis.

15. The assessment team will also use other methodological guidance and practice tools.
   Other technical guidance and tools developed by the PEFA Secretariat which will be used
   for the assessment include: the PEFA Field Guide, Good practice in applying the PEFA
   Framework, Guidance Note for Repeat Assessments as well as other guidance from the
   PEFA Secretariat. The draft and final reports will be prepared in English and Serbian

                                                                                             142
   language with the English version being the authorized version if different interpretations
   occur. Both versions of the report will be published on the Government/MoF website and
   will be linked to the PEFA website to allow general access to the documents. Both versions
   will be printed and distributed in limited number of copies.

   Schedule of Work

16. The PEFA assessment is expected to be completed by December 31 2015, while input to
   PFM Reform Programme and action plans in priority areas will be provided to the
   Government preliminary in January 2015 with a final document by July 2015.
   Finalization of the assessment report will be subject to availability of data upon requests for
   information being submitted by the PEFA team and timely provision of comments on various
   versions of draft report by the key country institutions. Input to the PFM Reform Programme
   and action plans will depend on the pace of Governmentâs preparation of those documents.
   The estimated timetable and a description of the key stages are provided below.

      A.   Concept Note

17. The draft concept note will be submitted to the Serbian Government, PEFA Secretariat
   and peer reviewers for comments before finalization. World Bank procedures will be
   followed in preparation and implementation of the project, requiring authorization of the
   project by the Country Director. Once it is approved and funds are allocated, the final team
   will be engaged, including appointment of consultants, and preparatory research will
   commence.

      B. Training/Launch Workshop

18. Launch workshop which will focus on training of selected Governmentâs staff in PEFA
   methodology and the ways PEFA findings can be used. The workshop will include around
   20 participants from relevant country institutions, and representatives of the donor
   community or other relevant stakeholders in addition to that number. The workshop will
   intend to provide general and technical knowledge to the Clientâs staff with regard to PEFA
   methodology. The workshop will provide an introduction to the PEFA methodology based
   on the PEFA Secretariat training materials. It will explain the purpose of the assessment, the
   roles and responsibilities of the various entities and provide an overview of the methodology
   for each indicator.

      C. Data Collection

19. The assessment team will meet with Government officials and other key institutions in
   order to obtain information needed for the assessment. Prior to data collection mission,
   the assessment team will perform desk review of available documentation and analysis of
   information collected based on the questionnaires to be sent to all relevant institutions.
   During the data collection mission the assessment team will clarify information received and
   obtain additional information and knowledge regarding the functioning of financial
   management arrangements, verify information received where possible and discuss reform
   options. The data collection mission is anticipated to last two to three weeks. At the end of
   the data collection mission, the assessment team will discuss preliminary findings with the
   working group and seek their verbal input/comments on the initial observations on each of
   the indicators.

                                                                                              143
       D. Draft PEFA Assessment

20. The assessment team will draft PEFA assessment report based on the evidence gathered
   during the data collection mission. Continuous communication by the assessment team will
   be maintained with the participating institutions, and in particular members of the working
   group, during the process of drafting, with the goal to avoid any incorrect interpretations or
   inaccurate findings/conclusions.

       E. Consultations and revisions of the draft PEFA Report

21. The draft PEFA report will be shared with the Government for review and comments.
   A period of two to three weeks will be given to all participating country institutions to review
   their respective indicators (and report as a whole) and provide any comments they may have.

22. A second field mission by the assessment team will be organized to discuss the Clientâs
   comments on the draft report and collect any additional information needed to address
   the comments. During this mission the assessment team will meet with counterparts in the
   areas of any concern with regard to ambiguity, accuracy or completeness of the PEFA report
   findings, which were identified during the Clientâs review of the PEFA draft. The assessment
   team will work with the working group during that process.

23. Revised draft report will be prepared based on revisions agreed with Government
   during the second field mission. The assessment team will revise the draft report in line
   with the result of discussion with the Client about any questionable areas/indicators. At this
   point, revised draft will be shared for views and comments with a number of institutions in
   the PFM community prior to the formal peer review.

       F. Decision Review/Peer Review

24. There will be an independent peer review of the revised draft assessment before final
   delivery to the Government and publishing. It will be targeted to have the same peer
   reviewers as for the concept note, in order to achieve consistency and have peer reviewers
   with prior knowledge of task and assessment. This means that peer reviewers will be selected
   from Government of Serbia, the PEFA Secretariat, the World Bank (other than members of
   the assessment team) and other institutions and international organisations including EU and
   the Swiss Government. In the scope and as a result of a formal decision review, the
   assessment will be reviewed and endorsed by the World Bankâs management.

       G. Final Report Workshop/Dissemination Event

25. The final assessment will be presented to the Government and representatives of the
   PFM community through a dissemination event. One day event will be organized with
   participation of officials from all institutions that participated in the assessment, including
   members of the working group, and representatives of donor community and other relevant
   PFM institutions in the country. The final report will be published after dissemination on the
   Governmentâs/MoFs website with the link to PEFA website. Both the original English
   version and Serbian translation of the report will be printed and distributed in limited number
   of copies. Other channels of reaching to broader public in raising awareness about the PEFA
   assessment will also be used, such as written media.


                                                                                               144
      H. PEFA Report follow up and Input to Governmentâs PFM Reform Programme and Action Plans in
         priority areas
   The assessment team will provide input to the Governmentâs PFM Reform Programme
   and action plans for reform in priority PFM areas. It is expected that findings of the
   PEFA assessment will identify strengths of the PFM system, as well as areas for
   improvements, and thus serve as guidance to the Government in preparing PFM Reform
   Programme. Action plans will be prepared for priority reform areas as identified by the PFM
   Reform Programme, and the assessment team is expected to provide input to specific action
   plans to the Government. The preliminary input is expected to be provided in January 2015
   in time for the Government to take the recommendation into account for the development of
   the PFM reform plan that will start be discussed in February 2015. The final input is expected
   to be delivered in July 2015 as part of the ongoing dialogue that the Bank will engage after
   the final report is disseminated. Dissemination will be discussed with the Government and
   will take place after the final delivery.
