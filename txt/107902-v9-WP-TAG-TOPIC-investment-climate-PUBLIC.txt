About the Investment Climate Department of the World Bank Group
The Investment Climate Department of the World Bank Group helps governments implement reforms to improve their business
environments and encourage and retain investment, thus fostering competitive markets, growth, and job creation. Funding is
provided by the World Bank Group (IFC, the World Bank, and MIGA) and over 15 donor partners working through the multidonor
FIAS platform.
    Annex 1:
    Justification and scope of World Bank Group involvement


                 Food safety is key for growth in the food-processing sector because it allows development of
                 the local market as well as provides access to export markets. It thus has direct benefits for the
                 private sector, in addition to its role in ensuring growth more broadly by reducing the burden
                 of food-borne diseases. It is an important area where the International Finance Corporation
                 and the Investment Climate Department of the World Bank Group have a specific role to play
                 to improve the regulatory environment, which often acts as a barrier to development, access
                 to markets, and investment. Demand for food safety regulatory reform can come from many
                 quarters: domestic businesses, would-be exporters, retailers, foreign investors, etc. It is part
                 of a broader set of changes as regulation is only one piece of the food safety puzzle. Many
                 changes are simultaneously needed on the private sector side (how businesses actually work),
                 as well as changes of behavior among consumers.

                 Before getting involved in starting a food safety reform project, the Investment Climate De-
                 partment of the World Bank Group has to clarify:

                    •	 whether the proposed intervention fits with the World Bank Group mandate and strategy
                       for the country and region;
                    •	 that needs and demand for the intervention are sufficiently evidenced, and that there is
                       real added value for intervention by the Investment Climate Department of the World
                       Bank Group; and
                    •	 what the realistic limitations are on the scope of the project.

                 On the first point, this is a crowded space with many international organizations and donors.
                 Therefore, the Investment Climate Department of the World Bank Group needs to play to its
                 strengths. It needs to collaborate rather than compete with the other players and that means
                 there has to be a strong private sector development reason for becoming involved. Although
                 there are many technicalities in the field of food safety regulation, it is also fundamentally
                 about developing markets and supporting the growth of the private sector. That is what proj-
                 ects of the Investment Climate Department of the World Bank Group should focus on. Food
                 safety regulation aims at “healthy markets” in addition to healthy people.

                 It is also essential to know what the project will precisely focus on and aim to achieve. The field
                 is too vast to just start a “food safety regulation” project without a clear objective. In parallel
                 with defining the focus, it is also important to consider how a project will add value to that of
                 others or will in some other way complement the projects of others. It is also absolutely essen-
                 tial to check that there is a real demand for the project from policymakers and key institutions,
                 and that there is a good chance of the project being successful even if there are changes in
                 important personnel in the government.

    In terms of scope, the following main options should be considered, generally in some combi-
    nation as framework and implementation should be seen as complementary:



       •	 Revision of legislative framework – is this a critical pre-condition for further work, and
          does this involve only limited changes to roughly adequate legislation, or fundamental
          rewriting? If there is a need for fundamental rewriting, it is important to think through
          what will be needed in terms of implementation support.

       •	 Institutional reform – because food cuts across so many issues of government there is
          often confusion and overlap across both ministries and agencies. On this point reform can
          be limited reform (clarifying some problematic issues) or fundamental reform (setting up a
          whole new institutional framework). This has implications at the implementation level.

       •	 Process reform (changing how regulators organize and conduct their work) and
          implementation support – this is an essential part that can come as “stand alone” (if
          framework is generally right) or in complement to framework reform. The Investment
          Climate Department of the World Bank Group has expertise and a track record in
          inspections and licensing reforms, and other regulatory reform tools that are relevant to
          food safety reform implementation.

    Once the decision has been made for involvement by the Investment Climate Department of
    the World Bank Group, and the scope of the intervention is determined, a certain degree of
    training for World Bank Group staff would be helpful, particularly in supporting productive
    relations with collaborators who are experts in the food safety, such as the World Health Or-
    ganization and Food and Agriculture Organization.

    Annex 2:
    European legislation on food safety

    Food safety policy in the EU is defined as a key priority in the White Paper on Food Safety.1 The key elements of the
    EU food safety policy are:

        •	 use a risk-based approach;
        •	 use scientifically based international standards;
        •	 cover all steps in the food chain;
        •	 secure the same level of protection and control across the entire EU community;
        •	 inform the public about risks and ways to prevent and combat them; and
        •	 present requirements to trade partners outside the EU..
    Regulation (EC) 178/2002 lays down these principles and outlines a model to be followed when developing a food
    safety law in the EU member states. Those principles are:

        •	 high level of protection of human health, consumers’ interests and, where necessary, animal and plant health
           and the environment;
        •	 implementation of international standards whenever they exist, and use of other standards only when no
           international standards exist and until they are developed;
        •	 “Farm-to-fork” regulations and measures to cover all stages of food production, processing, transportation,
           retail, and catering;
        •	 Risk analysis – a three-tier system to be introduced and implemented by official bodies in policymaking and
           enforcement;
        •	 “Precautionary principle” when there is a risk of harmful effect on human health, animal, or plan health.
           Management of that risk can be performed by ad hoc measures only if scientifically based measures do
           not exist for that risk. Such measures should be replaced with scientifically based ones, as soon as they are
           developed, or remain in force if proved to be scientifically sound and effective;
        •	 food and feed imported into the EU market from third countries shall have the equivalent food safety
           characteristics as food produced in EU member states. If there is a specific agreement between a third country
           and EU member state, than food must comply with provisions stated in that agreement;
        •	 transparency is important when developing food laws and measures, and when estimating their impacts.
           Involvement of all stakeholders (authorities, private sector, associations of producers, scientific community,
           NGOs, chambers of commerce, international trading partners, trade organizations) is recommended;
        •	 primary responsibility of food business operators for safety of food they place on the market;
        •	 food business operators are responsible for fulfilling all regulatory requirements concerning food and feed;
        •	 implementation of the preventive approach to control of hazards is at all levels of food and feed production,
           circulation and use;
        •	 presentation of food and feed that does not mislead consumers; and
        •	 Securing traceability along the food chain at least as “one step down-one step up.”
