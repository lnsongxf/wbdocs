About the GRI index

The World Bank supports the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and is one of the GRI Chapter Group of founding members. This response
has been prepared in accordance to the GRI guidelines: core option and provides an overview of sustainability considerations within the
World Bank’s lending and analytical services as well as its day-to-day operations and management of staff. We aim to be comprehensive
in our reporting and thus include indicators from GRI’s Financial Sector Supplement.

The World Bank reports on a fiscal year basis, which extends from July 1 through June 30. This report covers fiscal 2014 (July 1, 2013 —
June 30, 2014).

Note: The World Bank consists of two agencies: the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International
Development Association (IDA). Except for the eligibility of support and terms of lending to member countries, the agencies are tightly
integrated and work as a single unit. World Bank Group includes World Bank, as well as its sister agencies: the International Finance Cor-
poration (IFC), the Multilateral Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).

Defining the report
The topics deemed relevant for disclosure were identified by assessing annual corporate priorities outlined by the institutions’ Boards
and President, considering stakeholder input, as well as ascertaining sustainability impacts of carrying out the mission and vision.

Methodology for determining what’s material

To determine if a GRI aspect is material for the World Bank to report on, an assessment was carried out based on (1) the potential impact
on the Bank’s business, and (2) the sustainability impacts stemming from its business.

Setting the reporting boundary for the World Bank

The World Bank is a vital source of financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the world. We are not a bank in the
ordinary sense but a unique partnership to reduce poverty and support development. In delivering services to member countries, we
look to promote environmental and social sustainability at the country, region, and global levels, and to pursue a fiscally responsible
development path. Simultaneously working in more than 130 offices globally, we endeavor to be an environmentally responsible partner
and a good corporate citizen. The impacts that make a topic relevant can appear in our lending and analytical work with clients, in our
internal operations, or in both.

Validating the methodology: Stakeholder Panel

The World Bank, one of the first institutions to apply the new GRI G4 (fourth generation) guidelines on sustainability reporting, invited
selected stakeholders in May 2014 to meet in person and review the Bank’s materiality approach and resulting reporting, and advise it in
that undertaking for the 2014 reporting cycle.

Results: What is material?
Operational impact

The World Bank’s most pertinent sustainability impacts from financial and technical services to clients can be summarized in the follow-
ing GRI related aspects:

1.	 Economic Performance – Since creating and distributing economic value is part of the mission of alleviating poverty, shareholders
    and investors care about the sustainable economic performance of this institution.
2.	 Indirect Economic Impacts – These impacts are essential aspect of the Bank’s second goal of ensuring shared prosperity. Numerous
    stakeholders have also asked for better valuation of results, direct and indirect, from World Bank lending and analytical services.
3.	 Biodiversity – Through lending and grant support to client countries, the World Bank Group is one of the largest international fund-
    ing sources for biodiversity worldwide.
4.	 Human Rights / Child Labor / Indigenous Rights – The World Bank significantly promotes human rights through its projects, for
    example, improving poor people’s access to health services, education, food, and water; promoting the participation of Indigenous
    Peoples in decision making; strengthening the accountability and transparency of governments to their citizens; supporting justice
    reform; and fighting corruption. In addition, civil society is actively following the World Bank’s current process of updating its safe-


                                                                      1
      guard policies. Stakeholders have also raised concerns about inadequate protections for child labor by member countries in projects
      implemented through World Bank lending.
5.	   Local Communities – The very nature of the Bank’s mission is to positively impact communities through investments in education,
      health, public administration, infrastructure, and other development needs.
6.	   Anti-corruption – A well-functioning public sector that delivers quality public services consistent with citizen preferences and fosters
      private, market-led growth, while managing its fiscal resources in a prudent manner is critical to the World Bank’s mission to alleviate
      poverty. Anti-corruption was listed as one of the development priorities by opinion leaders in its client countries.
7.	   Grievance Mechanisms (environmental and human rights, for impacts on society) – Grievance redress mechanisms (GRMs) are
      crucial for managing risk in the Bank’s portfolio. By offering a channel for citizens to express concerns, comments, and complaints,
      GRMs create opportunities to resolve disputes before they escalate. GRMs can help the Bank and member countries improve project
      outcomes, prioritize supervision, identify systemic issues, and promote accountability. “Percent of resolved registered grievances” is
      now a key performance indicator for the World Bank (see the World Bank Corporate Scorecard).
8.	   Product Portfolio and Audit Aspects from the Financial Sector Supplement – As a lending institution, World Bank stakeholders look
      to the institution to ensure policies and procedures are in place to assess and screen environmental and social risks in its lending
      portfolio.

Corporate impact

The most material aspects of the Bank’s internal operations include the following:

1.	 Staff are the Bank’s greatest asset—They bring a wide range of perspectives to bear on poverty reduction issues and emerging devel-
    opment challenges and are critical to the effectiveness of the Bank’s core operational and knowledge services. Staff related indicators
    are pulled from the following GRI aspect categories: economic performance, market presence, employment, occupational health and
    safety, training and education, diversity and equal opportunity, labor practices grievance mechanisms, and nondiscrimination.
2.	 We recognize that reducing the Bank’s own corporate environmental impacts is in line with the institutional mission to reduce
    poverty, as environmental degradation affects the world’s poor disproportionately. Increasing the efficiency of how the organization
    runs its business—through facility-level and staff behavior changes—reduces natural resource waste and decreases the costs of
    day-to-day operations. Key aspects related to the Bank’s environmental footprint include the following: materials, energy, emissions,
    effluents and waste, and procurement practices (including supplier environmental assessment, supplier assessment for impacts on
    society, and supplier human rights assessment).

G4-2 Description of             As a development institution, the World Bank works with its members to achieve equitable and sustainable
key impacts, risks, and         economic growth in their national economies and find solutions to pressing regional and global problems in
opportunities                   economic development and in other important areas, such as environmental sustainability.
                                Despite progress during the last decades, humanity still faces urgent and complex challenges. More than 1
                                billion people live in destitution, making extreme poverty a continuing priority. Against a backdrop of rising
                                inequality and social exclusion in many countries, poverty remains an urgent challenge. The simple-sounding
                                mission has proven to be a complex challenge with multiple dimensions requiring coordinated action from
                                the entire international community on many policy fronts. Combining concern for greater equity with the
                                need for growth will help to ensure that the bottom 40 percent of society will share in prosperity.
                                We believe that the depth and breadth of the World Bank’s sectoral knowledge, along with its range of financial
                                and technical assistance instruments, can help countries address these challenges. With this in mind, the World
                                Bank has set two goals: (1) strive toward reducing the extreme poverty rate to no more than 3 percent in 2030 and
                                (2) promote shared prosperity by fostering income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the population in every
                                country. We endeavor to pursue both of these goals in an environmentally, socially, and fiscally sustainable way.
                                A detailed discussion on significant economic, environmental, and social impacts of the World Bank and
                                associated challenges and opportunities as we continue on the path to end poverty and boost shared prosper-
                                ity is available in the World Bank Group Strategy. Unveiled at the 2013 Annual Meetings, the Strategy brings
                                together for the first time the combined strength of the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA and places the collective
                                institution in a position to become the “Solutions Bank with results for the poor as our central benchmark.”
                                In addition, to ensure the availability of adequate resources that are aligned with the twin goals and its
                                strategy, the World Bank Group is undertaking significant financial reforms that will increase its capacity to
                                provide lending services to clients while strengthening its financial resilience.
                                Performance for these goals includes more than one indicator.

                                management team was established to address risks and challenges across the Bank. The group meets biweekly.

G4-9 Scale of organization   As of June 30, 2014, the World Bank employed 12,335 staff and 4,804 consultants who worked in Washington,
                             DC, and in more than 130 country offices worldwide.
                             World Bank lending commitments for development support totaled more than $40.8 billion in fiscal 2014.
                             New lending commitments by IBRD totaled $18.6 billion for 95 operations in fiscal 2014. This volume was
                             higher than the precrisis historical average ($13.5 billion a year in fiscal 2005–08) and the $15.2 billion in
                             fiscal 2013. As of June 30, 2014, net commitments in IBRD’s active portfolio stood at $98.3 billion. IBRD also
                             offers financial products that allow clients to efficiently fund their development programs and manage risks
                             related to currency, interest rates, commodity prices, and natural disasters. In fiscal 2014, the Bank’s Treasury
                             executed U.S. dollar equivalent (USDeq) 4.3 billion in hedging transactions on behalf of member countries,
                             including USDeq 2.7 billion in interest rate hedges, USDeq 1.1 billion in currency hedges, USDeq 52 million
                             in hedges against non-IBRD obligations, and USDeq 547 million for disaster risk management.
                             In fiscal 2014, net revenue for IBRD equaled $2.62 billion and for IDA equaled $3.16 billion. IBRD issues bonds in
                             international capital markets and provides loans, guarantees, and other risk management products, as well as tech-

                             IDA commitments amounted to $22.2 billion for 249 operations in fiscal 2014, including $18.5 billion in
                             credits, $2.8 billion in grants, and $937 million in guarantees. As of June 30, 2014, net commitments in IDA’s
                             active portfolio stood at $84.9 billion. IDA is financed largely by contributions from partner governments.
                             Additional financing comes from transfers from IBRD’s net income, grants from the International Finance
                             Corporation (IFC), and borrowers’ repayments of earlier IDA credits. In fiscal 2014, the 17th replenishment
                             of resources for IDA (IDA17), which will cover fiscal years 2015–17, was concluded with a record financing
                             envelope of USDeq $52.1 billion. IDA17 represents an increase over IDA16 (covering fiscal years 2012–14) of
                             5.7 percent in U.S. dollar terms.

                             In terms of diversity, nationals of developing countries account for 61 percent of all staff and 41 percent of
                             management positions. Women account for 52 percent of staff members and hold 38 percent of management
                             positions. Sub-Saharan African and Caribbean nationals represent 15 percent of all staff and 12 percent of
                             management positions. Thirty-eight percent of staff are located in country offices. There has only been a 2
                             percent increase in the number of employees since fiscal 2013 (12,058) and six percent since 2012. The Bank
                             also employed about 4,033 consultants in fiscal 2014, a six percent increase over FTE consultants employed in
                             2013. A substantial portion of work at the World Bank is not conducted by self-employed workers (short term
                             consultants), or by individuals other than employees or supervised workers.

                               External stakeholders include civil society, foundations, citizens impacted by projects, private sector (includ-

                              consulted on the major policies introduced or updated by World Bank staff in recent years in such areas as
                              access to information, social accountability, and environmental and social safeguards. Consultations have also

                              broad spectrum of CSOs on Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), sector studies, and individual Bank-funded
                              development projects. Often these consultations are multistakeholder and involve CSOs, governments, busi-
                              nesses, and other donor agencies. The Bank also introduced the Citizens Engagement Strategic Framework,

                              Diagnostics (SCDs), and Country Partnership Frameworks (CPFs). The views of civil society are taken into

Management Approach                The World Bank is a vital source of financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the
                                   world. The World Bank’s lending is aimed at different groups of countries: IBRD strives to reduce poverty in
                                   middle-income and creditworthy poorer countries through loans, guarantees, risk management products,
                                   and analytical and advisory services. Its sister organization, IDA, offers below-market-rate financing to the
                                   world’s poorest countries, primarily through credits and grants.
                                   IBRD funds itself through high-quality World Bank bonds offered in the international capital markets. IDA’s
                                   funding is predominantly from contributions by donor countries, including OECD countries and, increas-
                                   ingly, middle-income nations.
                                   The World Bank’s Corporate Scorecard is designed to provide a snapshot of the Bank’s overall performance,
                                   in the context of development results. It facilitates strategic dialogue between management and the Board on
                                   progress made and areas that need attention. Aspects of financial strength are measured under the Score-
                                   card’s Tier III, which reviews the overall success of Bank activities in achieving their development goals and
                                   examines the effectiveness of Bank operations, including the performance of its lending portfolio.

G4-EC2 Financial                   Under the leadership of President Jim Yong Kim, the World Bank has placed              Full
implications and other risks       climate change at the center of its work. The Bank is scaling up mitigation,
and opportunities for the          adaptation, and disaster risk management work; we will look at all aspects of
organization’s activities due to   our business through a climate lens. These efforts build on the 2008 Strategic
climate change                     Framework on Development and Climate Change, increasing demands for
                                   support by clients to enable climate-resilient and low-carbon development,
                                   and a full recognition that the World Bank Group’s twin goals of eradicating
                                   poverty and ensuring shared prosperity by 2030 cannot be met if climate chal-
                                   lenge is not addressed effectively.
                                   The World Bank Group Climate Vice Presidency, established in January 2014,
                                   is working to leverage both public and private sources of climate finance to
                                   support climate-smart policies and investments, and to help countries and
                                   businesses adapt to a changing climate.
                                   The report, "Turn Down the Heat: Why a 4°C Warmer World Must Be Avoid-
                                   ed," was prepared for the World Bank by the Potsdam Institute for Climate
                                   Impact Research in 2012. It says that the world is on a path to a 4°C (7.2°F)
                                   warming by the end of this century and provides a clear picture of the devas-
                                   tating impacts on agriculture, water resources, ecosystems, and human health.
                                   It concludes that while every region will be affected, those least able to adapt—
                                   the poor and most vulnerable—will be hit hardest. A follow-up report in 2013,
                                   which focused on impacts of climate change on Sub-Saharan Africa, South
                                   Asia, and Southeast Asia, shows that if the world warms by 2°C (3.6°F)—
                                   warming that may be reached in 20 to 30 years—there will be widespread food
                                   shortages, unprecedented heat waves, and more intense storms.
                                   The 2014 report, “Climate Smart Development: Adding up the Benefits of Ac-

                                   which the World Bank produced in collaboration with the ClimateWorks
                                   Foundation, showed the opportunities created by climate mitigation action:
                                   climate-smart policies in key sectors aimed at keeping the world under the 2°C
                                   threshold could contribute to increasing global gross domestic product (GDP)

                           The World Bank study, “Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change,” found
                           in 2010 that to adapt to a 2°C warmer world, developing countries will need
                           between $75 to $100 billion per year over the next 40 years to build resilience
                           to these changes, and mitigation costs are expected to be in the range of $140
                           to $175 billion per year by 2030. Analysis from the Climate Policy Initiative
                           found that global climate finance flows plateaued at $359 billion in 2012, with
                           developing countries receiving about $182 billion.
                           The Bank is looking at its business through a climate lens. Systems have
                           been developed to track climate co-benefits linked to financing across the
                           Bank’s portfolio. On July 1, 2013, the Bank began conducting greenhouse
                           gas (GHG) accounting for all energy and forestry investment lending
                           projects that have agreed methodologies and accounting tools. Roll out will
                           begin in the agriculture and transport sectors in fiscal 2015, and in other
                           sectors by fiscal 2016. The Bank’s approach to GHG accounting is aligned
                           with other multilateral development banks, as formalized in the “Inter-
                           national Financial Institution Framework for a Harmonized Approach to
                           Greenhouse Gas Accounting.” As of July 1, 2014, climate and disaster-risk
                           screening tools have been rolled out for IDA17 operations. The tools
                           support early-stage screening for climate and disaster risks. In fiscal 2013,
                           the World Bank continued supporting integration of climate and disaster
                           risk into development plans and investments for a total of 18 countries, of
                           which 17 are IDA countries. The Bank supports its climate change–related
                           efforts on the basis of a combination of annual core budgets, IBRD/IDA
                           investments, and dedicated trust funds financed by a combination of donor
                           countries.
                           The tracking of climate cobenefits within the World Bank’s portfolio (IBRD/
                           IDA) showed for fiscal 2013 a total of $4.1 billion in lending with mitigation
                           cobenefits, and $2.9 billion in adaptation benefits. Overall, World Bank
                           lending has contracted since fiscal 2010, and the share of climate-related
                           commitments is decreasing from its fiscal 2012 record. Funding for adapta-
                           tion cobenefits accounts for 9 percent of fiscal 2013 lending commitments
                           (13 percent in fiscal 2012) and 13 percent for mitigation cobenefits (20
                           percent in fiscal 2012). Funding for mitigation from external resources grew
                           $23 million to $974 million in fiscal 2013, while funding for adaptation from
                           external resources dropped $48 million to $221 million.
                           The World Bank Treasury is the world’s largest issuer of Green Bonds, which

Management Approach           The World Bank is a vital source of financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the
                              world. We are not a bank in the ordinary sense but a unique partnership to reduce poverty and support
                              development. We support a wide array of investments in such areas as education, health, public administra-
                              tion, infrastructure, financial and private sector development, agriculture, and environmental and natural
                              resource management.
                              The Bank has established ambitious, but achievable goals to galvanize international and national efforts. The
                              goals are to be achieved by 2030:
                              •	 End extreme poverty by decreasing the percentage of people living on less than $1.25 a day to no more
                                 than 3 percent
                              •	 Promote shared prosperity by fostering the income growth of the bottom 40 percent for every country
                              The World Bank Group Corporate Scorecard measures the progress on these goals. The Scorecard’s Results tier
                              reports on the key sectoral and multisectoral results achieved by our clients with our support.

                              and in other important areas, such as environmental sustainability. The Bank
                              pursues its principal goals of overcoming poverty and improving standards of
                              living primarily by providing loans, risk management products, and expertise on
                              development-related disciplines and by coordinating responses to regional and
                              global challenges. Our financial resources are significant, but they are finite. Our
                              knowledge is also a valuable commodity. The more this knowledge is shared, and
                              the more new ideas germinate, the greater the potential for delivering solutions
                              to the challenging and intractable development problems, leading to greater im-
                              provement. The Bank’s scale, range, and diversity lie at the core of its specialized
                              role as a key contributor to global development knowledge. The interaction of
                              the Bank’s broad knowledge base with lending operations is unique.

Management Approach          Countries rely on healthy ecosystems and biodiversity to survive, grow enough food, and make a living. But
                             the world is experiencing a dramatic loss of biodiversity, negatively affecting livelihoods, clean water supply,
                             food security, and resilience to environmental disasters. This situation particularly affects the 75 percent of
                             the world’s poor who live in rural areas and often rely on ecosystems to make a living. The World Bank works
                             with countries around the world to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity. With a portfolio of 245 projects
                             worth $1.058 billion in the 10 years from fiscal 2004 to 2013, the World Bank is one of the largest internation-
                             al financiers of biodiversity conservation and sustainable use.
                             The World Bank helps countries to put policies in place so that biodiversity is valued as a key driver of
                             sustainable development. The Bank works with clients to improve their administration to better conserve
                             and sustainably use their biodiversity. We invest in those aspects of biodiversity services—such as watershed
                             management and protected areas—that help countries achieve their development goals. We also help coun-
                             tries find ways to generate revenues from biodiversity—such as tourism income. And we assist countries
                             with fighting wildlife crime. Our biodiversity projects range from establishing and strengthening terrestrial,
                             freshwater, and marine protected areas, to eradicating invasive alien species to improving biodiversity man-
                             agement planning in the production landscape.
                             The World Bank does not support projects that involve the significant conversion or degradation of critical
                             natural habitats. Wherever feasible, Bank-financed projects are sited on already converted lands. The Bank
                             does not support projects involving the significant conversion of natural habitats unless there are no feasible
                             alternatives for the project and its siting, and comprehensive analysis demonstrates that overall benefits from
                             the project substantially outweigh the environmental costs. If the environmental assessment indicates that
                             a project would significantly convert or degrade natural habitats, the project includes mitigation measures,
                             including minimizing habitat loss and establishing and maintaining an ecologically similar protected area.
                             In deciding whether to support a project with potential adverse impacts on a natural habitat, the Bank takes
                             into account the borrower’s ability to implement the appropriate conservation and mitigation measures.
                             A 2010 review of the Bank’s safeguard policies regime by the Independent Evaluation Group found that
                             11 percent of projects triggered Operational Policy 4.04 on Natural Habitats. Among these, the policy was
                             satisfactory in 72 percent of cases.

                             The overall Bank biodiversity portfolio of 245 projects in the 10 years from
                             fiscal 2004 to 2013 included direct biodiversity commitments worth more than
                             $1.06 billion. Of this, 27 percent came from Global Environment Facility (GEF)
                             funds, while 69 percent came from IBRD/IDA. These projects have taken place
                             in 74 countries in all six of the Bank’s regions. Most projects were in the Africa
                             and Latin America and Caribbean regions, which between them accounted for
                             more than two thirds of biodiversity projects. In fiscal 2014, the Bank approved
                             18 new operations in 17 countries and four regional projects with a combined
                             commitment amount for biodiversity of more than $120 million.

                              ASPECT: ENVIRONMENTAL GRIEVANCE MECHANISMS

Management Approach      The World Bank’s mission is sustainable poverty reduction. Poverty, as the Bank recognizes it, encompasses
                         lack of opportunities (including capabilities), lack of voice and representation, and vulnerability to shocks.
                         The Bank significantly promotes human rights through its projects, for example, improving poor people’s
                         access to health services, education, food, and water. Moreover, the Bank promotes the participation of In-
                         digenous Peoples in decision making, helps strengthen the accountability and transparency of governments
                         to their citizens, and supports justice reform and fighting corruption. Although development projects are
                         intended to bring about positive change, their implementation involves risks and people or the environment
                         can be harmed. The Bank has policies to help avoid such outcomes, but some problems may remain unrec-
                         ognized or unaddressed. In such circumstances, one way for concerns to receive attention is for the citizens
                         themselves to speak out.
                         Grievance redress mechanisms (GRMs) are crucial for managing risk in the Bank’s portfolio. GRMs create
                         opportunities to resolve disputes before they escalate by offering a channel for citizens to express concerns,
                         comments, and complaints. Beyond their benefits to citizens, GRMs can help the Bank and client improve
                         project outcomes, prioritize supervision, identify systemic issues, and promote accountability. Environmen-
                         tal and social standards now lead the Bank’s corporate work on grievance redress, with the goal of imple-
                         menting a consistent and systematic approach to grievance redress, handling of complaints, and conflict
                         resolution across all IBRD/IDA operations.
                         The Bank deals with grievance redress on a voluntary, demand-driven basis; the work supports a number of
                         the Bank’s major initiatives, in particular, work on risk, results, and beneficiary feedback.
                         The “Global Review of Grievance Redress Mechanisms” found that half of all Bank projects feature a
                         grievance redress mechanism (GRM) in project design documents. However new research shows imple-
                         mentation challenges. A major focus for the Bank in the future will be to further integrate grievance redress
                         in all projects, increase support for implementation, and enhance collection and monitoring of grievances
                         received and resolved across the project’s portfolio.

                                             ASPECT: HUMAN RIGHTS INVESTMENT

Management Approach            Although the World Bank policies, programs, and projects generally do not expressly incorporate human rights,
                               the Bank significantly promotes human rights in a range of areas: from improving poor people’s access to health
                               services, education, food, and water, to promoting the participation of Indigenous Peoples in decision making
                               to strengthening the accountability and transparency of governments to their citizens, and to supporting justice
                               reform and fighting corruption. Thus, the Bank’s role is facilitative, helping its members realize their human rights
                               obligations.
                               For all projects that are proposed for Bank financing, the Bank screens each one to determine the appropriate
                               extent and type of environmental and social analysis to be undertaken during project preparation and whether
                               the project may involve the use or application of other safeguard policies. Policies that may be triggered include
                               the following: OP/BP 4.01, Environmental Assessment; OP/BP 4.04, Natural Habitats; OP 4.09, Pest Manage-
                               ment; OP/BP 4.10, Indigenous Peoples; OP/BP 4.11, Physical Cultural Resources; OP/BP 4.12, Involuntary
                               Resettlement; OP 4.36, Forests; and OP/BP 4.37, Safety of Dams. In addition, the Bank recognizes that gender
                               issues are important dimensions of its poverty reduction, economic growth, human well-being, and develop-
                               ment effectiveness agenda. OP/BP 4.20 establishes a country-level, strategic approach to mainstreaming gender
                               issues in Bank work. For more information on gender issues, see: http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/gender
                               The Bank classifies the proposed project into one of four categories (A, B, C, and FI) depending on the type,
                               location, sensitivity, and scale of the project and the nature and magnitude of its potential environmental
                               impacts. The borrower is responsible for any assessment required by the safeguard policies, with Bank staff
                               providing general advice. Depending on the type of project and its safeguard policy category, the Bank
                               project design incorporates into project development such issues as public consultation, environmental and
                               social assessment social action plans, Indigenous Peoples’ action plans, and resettlement frameworks and
                               action plans. The compliance forms part of the legal agreements for grants and loans.
                               Regarding monitoring and evaluation, the World Bank launched a two-year process in October 2012 to
                               review and update its current environmental and social safeguard policies. The safeguard policies contribute
                               to sustainability and development effectiveness in Bank projects and programs by helping to avoid or mitigate
                               harm to people and the environment. This review and update will better align the policies with the changing
                               needs and aspirations of borrowers, the external context, and the business of the Bank. The review is current-

                                In addition, the World Bank launched in 2009 a knowledge and learning
                                program for World Bank Staff—the Nordic Trust Fund—on human rights with
                                the objective to help staff better understand how human rights relate to the
                                Bank’s core work and mission. The Nordic Trust Fund, a multiyear and mul-
                                tidonor trust fund, supports knowledge and learning activities. The program
                                offers Bank staff learning events that share knowledge about how human rights
                                relate to the Bank’s analytical and operational work. It also features an internal
                                grant program in which Bank teams receive technical and financial support to
                                explore the role of human rights in their particular project or task. Currently
                                there are 27 grant teams working on aspects related to rights in different parts
                                of the organization. Operation for the program was extended until 2019. In

                                                    ASPECT: INDIGENOUS RIGHTS
Management Approach             Central to the Bank’s mission of reducing poverty and promoting sustainable development is ensuring that
                                the development process fully respects the dignity, human rights, economies, and cultures of Indigenous
                                Peoples. The Bank recognizes that the identities and cultures of Indigenous Peoples are inextricably linked
                                to the lands on which they live and the natural resources on which they depend. These distinct circumstanc-
                                es expose Indigenous Peoples to different types of risks and levels of impacts from development projects,
                                including loss of identity, culture, and customary livelihoods, as well as exposure to disease. Gender and in-
                                tergenerational issues among Indigenous Peoples also are complex. As social groups with identities that are
                                often distinct from dominant groups in their national societies, Indigenous Peoples are frequently among
                                the most marginalized and vulnerable segments of the population. As a result, their economic, social, and
                                legal status often limits their capacity to defend their interests in and rights to lands, territories, and other
                                productive resources, or restricts their ability to participate in and benefit from development. At the same
                                time, the Bank recognizes that Indigenous Peoples play a vital role in sustainable development and that their
                                rights are increasingly being addressed under both domestic and international law.

                                   For all projects that are proposed for Bank financing and that affect Indigenous Peoples, the Bank requires
                                   the borrower to engage in a process of free, prior, and informed consultation. The Bank provides project
                                   financing only where free, prior, and informed consultation results in broad community support to the proj-
                                   ect by the affected Indigenous Peoples.
                                   The World Bank policy on Indigenous Peoples, OP/BP 4.10, Indigenous Peoples, underscores the need for
                                   borrowers and Bank staff to identify Indigenous Peoples, consult with them, ensure that they participate in,
                                   and benefit from Bank-funded operations in a culturally appropriate way. It also emphasizes that adverse
                                   impacts on them are avoided or, where not feasible, minimized or mitigated. The Bank cannot proceed on
                                   projects unless Indigenous Peoples have given their “broad community support.”

                                   All standard World Bank bidding documents contain a prohibition of using child or forced labor in contracts

                                   ASPECT: HUMAN RIGHTS GRIEVANCE MECHANISMS

Management Approach           The World Bank’s mission is sustainable poverty reduction. Poverty encompasses lack of opportunities
                              (including capabilities), lack of voice and representation, and vulnerability to shocks. The Bank signifi-
                              cantly promotes human rights through its projects, for example, improving poor people’s access to health
                              services, education, food, and water. Moreover, the Bank promotes the participation of Indigenous Peoples
                              in decision making, helps strengthen the accountability and transparency of governments to their citizens,
                              and supports justice reform and fighting corruption. Although development projects are intended to bring
                              about positive change, their implementation involves risks, and people or the environment can be harmed.
                              The Bank has policies to help avoid such outcomes, but some problems may remain unrecognized or unad-
                              dressed. In such circumstances, one way for concerns to receive attention is for the citizens themselves to
                              speak out.
                              Grievance redress mechanisms (GRMs) are crucial for managing risk in the Bank’s portfolio. GRMs create
                              opportunities to resolve disputes before they escalate by offering a channel for citizens to express concerns,
                              comments, and complaints. Beyond their benefits to citizens, GRMs can help the Bank and client improve
                              project outcomes, prioritize supervision, identify systemic issues, and promote accountability. Environmen-
                              tal and social standards now lead the Bank’s corporate work on grievance redress, with the goal of imple-

                              resolution across all IBRD/IDA operations.
                              The Bank deals with grievance redress on a voluntary, demand-driven basis; the work supports a number of
                              the Bank’s major initiatives, in particular, work on risk, results, and beneficiary feedback.
                              The “Global Review of Grievance Redress Mechanisms” found that half of all Bank projects feature a griev-

Management Approach            The very nature of the World Bank‘s mission is to positively impact communities through investments in ed-
                               ucation, health, public administration, infrastructure, financial and private-sector development, agriculture,
                               and environmental and natural resource management. Our stakeholders are consulted at different points
                               throughout our projects and policy development.
                               In recent years, the World Bank has increasingly focused on lending to community-driven development
                               (CDD) programs in order to let communities lead their own development. This process lets communities
                               identify their own development priorities, hire contractors, manage project funds, and, on completion of
                               construction, manage and sustain the project. CDD approaches have been used to support a range of local
                               development and service delivery needs identified by communities themselves, including water supply
                               and sewerage rehabilitation, school and health facilities construction, nutrition programs for mothers and
                               infants, rural access roads, and support for livelihoods and microenterprises.
                               A growing body of CDD program impact evaluations generally finds positive evidence of poverty reduction,
                               targeting of the poor, and increased access to services. Evidence is limited or mixed on these programs’

                                  policies. The Bank classifies the proposed project into one of four categories
                                  (A, B, C, and FI) depending on the type, location, sensitivity, and scale of the
                                  project and the nature and magnitude of its potential environmental impacts.

Management Approach               Critical to the World Bank’s mission is a well-functioning public sector that delivers quality public services
                                  consistent with citizen preferences and fosters private, market-led growth, while managing its fiscal resources

                                  ruption measures into project design. The objective is to better manage corruption and fiduciary risks and to
                                  ensure that development funds are used for their intended purposes. The World Bank’s Integrity Vice Presi-
                                  dency (INT) plays an important role in this respect. INT investigates allegations of fraud and corruption in

                                  volving Bank staff (internal investigations). INT also pursues sanctions against firms and individuals that have
                                  engaged in fraudulent, corrupt, collusive, coercive, or obstructive practices. The resulting debarments prevent
                                  these parties from participating in future Bank-financed projects and serve as a deterrent to other potential
                                  wrongdoers. Moreover, by combining investigations with an enhanced focus on compliance, detection of red
                                  flags, and building preventive measures in projects, INT promotes a proactive approach to managing fraud
                                  and corruption risks. It is vital to manage these risks in an efficient and effective manner as they can impact
                                  development resources, particularly in fragile contexts and high-risk sectors.

Management Approach             The World Bank’s mission is sustainable poverty reduction. Poverty, as the Bank recognizes it, encompasses
                                lack of opportunities (including capabilities), lack of voice and representation, and vulnerability to shocks.
                                The Bank significantly promotes human rights through its projects, for example, improving poor people’s
                                access to health services, education, food, and water. Moreover, the Bank promotes the participation of In-
                                digenous Peoples in decision making, helps strengthen the accountability and transparency of governments
                                to their citizens, and supports justice reform and fighting corruption. Although development projects are
                                intended to bring about positive change, their implementation involves risks and people or the environment
                                can be harmed. The Bank has policies to help avoid such outcomes, but some problems may remain unrec-
                                ognized or unaddressed. In such circumstances, one way for concerns to receive attention is for the citizens
                                themselves to speak out.
                                Grievance redress mechanisms (GRMs) are crucial for managing risk in the Bank’s portfolio. GRMs create
                                opportunities to resolve disputes before they escalate by offering a channel for citizens to express concerns,
                                comments, and complaints. Beyond their benefits to citizens, GRMs can help the Bank and client improve
                                project outcomes, prioritize supervision, identify systemic issues, and promote accountability. Environmen-

Management Approach           The World Bank is a vital source of financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the
                              world. The Bank is not a bank in the ordinary sense but a unique partnership to reduce poverty and support
                              development. We support a wide array of investments in such areas as education, health, public administra-
                              tion, infrastructure, financial and private sector development, agriculture, and environmental and natural
                              resource management. Bank stakeholders look to the institution, as a lending facility, to have policies and
                              procedures in place that assess and screen environmental and social risks in its lending portfolio.
                              In 2013, the World Bank adopted a new World Bank Group Strategy focused on aligning all of the institu-
                              tions’ work with the twin goals of eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity in a sustain-
                              able manner. Implementation is monitored by a newly developed World Bank Group Corporate Scorecard
                              [see http://worldbank.org/corporatescorecard] that aggregates the contributions of the World Bank Group
                              institutions. On a day-to-day basis, working closely with country government counterparts and their stake-
                              holders, Bank staff members shape the role, financial products, and technical and advisory services to the
                              unique development needs and capacities of each country client. Thus, interactions with clients, investees,
                              and business partners regarding environmental and social risks and opportunities form the foundation of
                              the Bank’s advisory and loan services. A cornerstone of the Bank’s financial support, technical and advisory
                              services, and applied aim to prevent and mitigate impacts and risks to people and their environment in the
                              development process, are the Bank’s environmental and social safeguard policies. There are 10 safeguard
                              policies: environmental assessment, natural habitats, forests, pest management, physical cultural resourc-
                              es, dam safety, Indigenous Peoples, involuntary resettlement, international waterways, and disputed areas.
                              Without these safeguard policies, the positive effects of the development work can be severely diminished.
                              These policies provide mandatory guidelines for Bank and borrower staffs in the identification, preparation,
                              and implementation of investment programs and projects. To strengthen the effectiveness of the safeguard
                              policies, the Bank has initiated a process to review and update its environmental and social safeguards for
                              investment projects. This review is currently in its second phase. For more information, see: http://consulta-

                              These policies aim to prevent and mitigate impacts and risks to people and
                              their environment in the development process. These policies provide manda-

                              ed by the Bank has substantially increased as a result of attention to these
                              policies. Safeguard policies have often provided a platform for the participa-
                              tion of stakeholders in project design, and have been an important instrument
                              for building ownership among local populations. All safeguard policies are
                              approved by the Board of Directors.

FS2 Procedures for assessing    The Bank undertakes screening of each proposed project to determine the appropri-           Full

and social risks in business    ronmental assessment, to be undertaken during project preparation and whether the
lines                           project may involve the use or application of other safeguard policies. The Bank clas-
                                sifies the proposed project into one of four categories (A, B, C, and FI) depending on
                                the type, location, sensitivity, and scale of the project and the nature and magnitude
                                of its potential environmental impacts. The borrower is responsible for any assess-
                                ment required by the safeguard policies, with general advice provided by Bank staff.
                                In general, a World Bank environmental and social specialist is assigned to each
                                project with the potential to have environmental and social impact or risk in its
                                design and planning stage. A sector manager who is responsible for a collection
                                of projects, most often in sector and regional associations, manages this process.
                                As the project moves through design, the Bank works with the clients to under-
                                stand the technical features of each project and in partnership with borrowers,
                                works to develop approaches for addressing these impacts as risks as required
                                in the suite of World Bank safeguard policies. For category A and B projects,
                                there is also involvement by the Regional Safeguard Advisor and his or her team
                                or unit. Higher risk projects must submit a series of safeguard documents to
                                identify and explain how the borrower will undertake safeguards requirements.
                                Several quality control and review committees meet to agree on processes, such
                                as the Regional Operational Committee (ROC). Finally the Board of Executive
                                Directors must approve all projects, and those approvals also require submission
                                or summaries of any environmental assessment and social safeguard documents.
                                Information is shared amongst all decision makers and with stakeholders.
                                These thresholds are based on environmental and social impact and risk defined
                                in the safeguard policies and the Environmental Health and Safety Guidelines.
                                For more information on procedures for assessing and screening environmental

environmental and social       requirements included in the loan agreement of a specific project is part of regular
requirements included in       project supervision. Supervision missions of projects are carried out twice a year
agreements or transactions     and include staff with appropriate environmental and social expertise. For more
                               complex projects, staff members from the regional safeguard units are included.
                               The Bank’s Operations Risk Management Department (OPSOR), housed within
                               the Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) Vice Presidency, supports
                               the regions and ensures that the Bank’s safeguard policies are applied in a uniform
                               manner across regions. Environmental and social management frameworks include
                               provisions for grievance mechanisms by which stakeholders can bring concerns
                               forward and settle arising disputes. In addition, stakeholders can bring concerns
                               to the independent Inspection Panel, a permanent body reporting to the Board of
                               Executive Directors, to ensure accountability of the World Bank and investigate
                               complaints about harm stemming from policy violations.
                               Most often, Bank environmental and social specialists work with the project Task Team
                               and borrowers to identify noncompliance issues and provide suggestions and proce-
                               dures for bringing projects into compliance. Remedies are also available, if necessary.
                               During project supervision, both environmental and social specialists undertake
                               project site visits and consult with numerous stakeholders. When safeguard
                               issues of concern are encountered, the Bank engages in discussions with the
                               borrower to arrive at mutually agreed courses of action that are time bound and
                               identify responsible parties. These actions are documented in the Aide Memoire
                               and regularly in technical, back to office reports.

                               safeguards during project preparation and supervision. The purpose of ac-
                               creditation is to ensure that the Bank’s environmental safeguard policies are
                               consistently applied during project preparation and supervision, and to confirm
                               broader environmental expertise by the accredited staff. A similar accreditation
                               course has been established for social safeguard staff.
                               In addition, Safeguard Training Modules introduce the basic concepts of safe-
                               guard policies and also contain specific case studies and operational examples
                               to provide richer understanding of how safeguard policies are applied. A unique

                               countries for country staff and CMUs.
                               Newer delivery tools have also included webinars. Special manager’s safeguard
                               trainings have also been completed. Several regions also conduct safeguards

Management Approach             An independent evaluation is an essential building block for effective development programs. It creates an
                                objective basis for assessing results, providing accountability, and helping development practitioners to learn
                                from experience. The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) is charged with evaluating the activities of IBRD
                                and IDA.
                                The IEG evaluates the Bank Group’s work at the project level. These products are the evidence base for larger
                                evaluations. For the World Bank, they include independent, field-based Project Performance Audit Reports
                                (PPARs), which assess project achievements, rate projects for accountability purposes, and clarify lessons
                                from experience.
                                In addition to PPARs, IEG does validations of completion reports, which are evaluations that project teams
                                write at the end of each project’s life-cycle. IEG now discloses Implementation Completion and Results

                                scale social and environmental risks in the World Bank’s projects. The evaluation highlighted the need for
                                the Bank to consolidate its safeguard and sustainability policies and to improve the coverage of its policies’
                                social effects. Since IEG completed its report, the Bank committed to a 24-month consultative process that
                                will lead to the ongoing update of its safeguard policy framework.

Management Approach             The World Bank values the diversity, health, safety, and security of its 12,000+ staff and consultants who
                                work in Washington, DC, and in more than 130 countries worldwide. The institution’s diverse workforce
                                brings a wide range of perspectives to bear on poverty reduction issues and emerging development challeng-
                                es. It is critical to the effectiveness of the Bank’s core operational and knowledge services. Staff diversity is a
                                strategic business asset that directly contributes to achievement of our two goals: reducing extreme poverty
                                and promoting shared prosperity.
                                To that end it is important that the Bank employs the right people in the right place with the right skills at
                                the right time. To deliver on that commitment, the Human Resources Strategy has four areas of focus:
                                •	   Building a culture of performance and accountability
                                •	   Developing inspiring leaders
                                •	   Shaping a diverse and inclusive workforce
                                •	   Creating career opportunities for staff
                                As the Bank retools to increase its delivery and responsiveness to its clients, Human Resources has played a
                                pivotal role in the transition of staff from the earlier structure to the new Global Practices. Looking forward,
                                we will continue making aligning staffing and skills to the World Bank Group Strategy a priority.

Management Approach             As a service-based organization, material use is an important impact of our day-to-day business. It is also
                                closely related to the Bank’s recent efforts to reduce our expense to business revenue ratio. Through investor
                                questionnaires, external stakeholders have identified purchasing as a material aspect. Moreover, purchasing
                                is a material aspect given that purchasing decisions can contribute to the accumulation of persistent toxic
                                emissions as well as materials extracted from the earth’s crust. Different groups purchase major material
                                categories throughout the Bank. For example, the General Services Department Printing and Multimedia
                                group controls the purchase of paper, one of the largest classes of materials used by the Bank. This group

                               The World Bank manages its energy use carefully by tracking use in each owned facility on a monthly
                               basis. General Services Department tracks quarterly progress on energy use, which is reported as a part of
                               the progress toward goals for the head of corporate real estate. Energy use is evaluated both as an absolute
                               figure, as well as on an intensity basis to determine progress.

                             to deepen its efforts to measure, reduce, offset, and report its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated
                             with its global internal operations, including its facilities, key meetings, and corporate air travel. The Bank
                             has measured the GHG emissions from its facilities in Washington, DC, since 2005 and globally since 2007.
                             Emissions data are collected and emissions are calculated in accordance with the World Resources Institute
                             and World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s GHG Protocol, with additional information on
                             proxies, emissions factors, and our complete boundary available in the annually updated Inventory Manage-

Management Approach          The World Bank views reducing effluent and waste production as a material aspect because of the poten-
                             tial negative environmental impacts, which include the release of persistent toxic chemicals through waste
                             degrading in landfills or by being incinerated. Our stakeholders also see reducing our effluent and waste
                             production as important.
                             The Bank has worked to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills through a combination of source re-
                             duction, reuse, and recycling.
                             Minimizing the amount of material brought into our facilities is the first way we manage the amount of
                             waste created. Avoiding unnecessary packaging for purchased items, including encouraging minimum
                             purchase thresholds for office supplies, is one way in which we accomplish this. Another way we do this is
                             by mandating large purchases from vendors, such as our latest computer monitor purchase, be sent in bulk
                             instead of individually packaged. In fiscal 2014, we took a closer look at our waste management system,
                             seeking to identify and correct areas where we were not properly diverting recyclable waste from the landfill.
                             This included mapping out the way that waste moves into and out of our facilities, identifying responsibil-
                             ities and roles, and beginning to set targets. A waste audit was carried out and a new waste management
                             system will be installed in fiscal 2015.

Management Approach            In Human Resources, focus is about getting the right people in the right place at the right time, and respond-
                               ing with the best possible assistance in an environment that is rapidly evolving. Our goal, in support of the
                               Bank’s goals, is to put in place the elements that will make this the best place to work in development. To
                               accomplish that, we will need a clear “social contract” between the institution and its employees—setting
                               expectations that each party must honor.
                               The World Bank is continually in search of the brightest, most talented individuals from around the globe. We
                               are proud to employ a dedicated and committed workforce that reflects our diverse membership, bringing a wide
                               range of perspectives to bear on our poverty reduction work. Our staff members include economists, educators,
                               environmental scientists, financial analysts, and managers, as well as foresters, agronomists, engineers, informa-
                               tion technology specialists, and social scientists, to name a few. Human Resources staff members support the
                               Bank in employing the right people in the right place with the right skills at the right time. As the Bank retools to
                               increase its delivery and responsiveness to its clients, Human Resources has played a pivotal role in the transition
                               of staff from the earlier structure to the new Global Practices. Looking forward, aligning staffing and skills to the
                               World Bank Group Strategy will be a priority.

                               market reference points in other public and private organizations, and salary
                               increases of individual staff are determined by his or her performance and
                               contributions to the Bank’s objectives. Overall performance evaluation that
                               affects individual staff salary increases is conducted annually, and assesses
                               staff ’s competence, commitment, contribution, and team work, with input
                               from peers. All these policies are specified in the internal Staff Manual, which
                               is available for all staff. The Human Resources Committee of the Board meets
                               every year to review compensation and determines the overall Bankwide pay

                                work in Washington, DC, and in more than 130 countries worldwide. Many employees travel throughout
                                the world, thus the World Bank views proper and convenient health care as an important service.
                                The Health Services Department (HSD) serves the staff and management by promoting good health and
                                contributing to a healthy work environment. A Health and Safety Working Group acts as an advisory group
                                to senior management with the aim of providing recommendations to address health and safety issues.
                                A new Occupational Health and Safety Committee reporting to the Senior Management Team will be tasked
                                with developing, implementing, and monitoring an occupational health and safety policy that will apply to

                                             ASPECT: TRAINING AND EDUCATION

Management Approach          The World Bank values the diversity, health, safety, and security of its 12,000+ staff and consultants who
                             work in Washington, DC, and in more than 130 countries worldwide.
                             The aim of the Bank’s investment in staff learning is to ensure that learning is a strategic tool for the organization,
                             so that staff members have the cutting-edge knowledge and skills to carry out the Bank’s mission. Bank Senior
                             Management endorsed the Staff Learning Strategy in April 2010, which outlines three complementary and mu-
                             tually reinforcing pillars: Corporate Core Curriculum (includes on-boarding of new staff, operational learning,
                             and management and leadership development), Professional and Technical Learning, and Unit and Individual
                             Learning (such as languages for business purposes, mentoring, and behavioral skills). Crosscutting principles
                             underpinning the Learning Strategy are ensuring geographically neutral access to learning, more on-the-job
                             learning and less formal classroom learning, common quality assurance processes, and linkage with competen-
                             cies. The Bank offers a broad range of learning resources via online and face-to-face sessions through its internal
                             learning program. Funding support for external training or education is made possible based on annual discus-
                             sions between staff and managers on individual yearly learning plans.

employee category            in headquarters (Washington, DC). These individuals attended the equivalent of
                             47,183 days of training; averaging 3.8 days (30.4 hours) per staff member, with

                             fiscal 2014, the World Bank invested $65.9 million in staff learning, of which
                             48 percent was spent on developing and delivering learning activities, and 52
                             percent was spent to cover direct and indirect expenses for staff members to
                             participate in learning (provided internally or from external providers), includ-

                                         ASPECT: DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

Management Approach           World Bank staff are located in offices in more than 130 countries, working in core finance, administra-
                              tive, legal, economics, and technical specializations in more than 20 sectors. They bring to the Bank and
                              its mission an impressive breadth and depth of professional expertise, academic background, industry,
                              and international experience. Consistently in staff surveys, a large majority of staff agree that they work in
                              a climate in which diverse perspectives are valued, where we treat each other with respect, and where we
                              feel encouraged to find new and better ways of doing things. Staff are drawn to and energized by the Bank
                              Group’s vibrant and dynamic multicultural environment, making diversity and inclusion a key element of
                              our employment value proposition.
                              The World Bank recognizes that meeting the demands and needs of our diverse client base more effectively
                              means we must bring to bear a range of ideas and perspectives to finding the best solution to the devel-
                              opment challenge at hand. Achieving shared prosperity in a sustainable way is, by definition, about equal
                              opportunity, empowerment, and economic and social inclusion.
                              The Articles of Agreement for IBRD and IDA emphasize the need to “pay due regard to the importance of
                              recruiting personnel on as wide a geographical basis as possible” when appointing Bank officers and staff,
                              “subject to the paramount importance of securing the highest standards of efficiency and of technical com-
                              petence.” This directive was reiterated in the 1983 Principles of Staff Employment approved by the Executive
                              Directors to set forth the broad policies according to which the President shall manage staff. In addition, the
                              Principles direct the Bank to “encourage diversity in staffing consistent with the nature and objectives of the
                              organizations.”
                              In addition to reflecting our global nature, the importance of staff diversity in enhancing the effectiveness
                              and credibility of our institutions has been underscored by ongoing reforms to increase the voice and
                              participation of emerging markets and developing countries in the Bank. Indeed, it is incumbent upon us
                              to consider how we organize and manage ourselves internally as we ask the world, for example, to embrace
                              inclusion as a principle that is core to poverty alleviation and development, or to “Think Equal for Women
                              and Girls.” We describe in our mission statement the work environment we strive to maintain: “an excellent
                              institution able to attract, excite, and nurture diverse and committed staff with exceptional skills, who know
                              how to listen and learn,” underpinned by the core values of working together in teams, with openness and
                              trust, empowering others and respecting differences.

Management Approach            The World Bank considers the diversity of its staff a strategic business asset. The World Bank Group’s Code
                               of Conduct defines discrimination as “the unjustifiable differentiation between individuals or groups within
                               staff. Discrimination can be based on characteristics such as race, color, gender, language, physical ability,
                               religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, or sexual orientation.” It stipulates that each
                               individual has a role to play in preventing discrimination in the workplace.
                               The World Bank Group Office of Ethics and Business Conduct (EBC) promotes the development and appli-
