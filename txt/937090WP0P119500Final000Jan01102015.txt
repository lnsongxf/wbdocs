   support to the reform process are necessary for             numbers of human resources is necessary for
   real impact to occur. Key decisions were stalled at         effective implementation. Staff turnover due to
   critical moments in the program’s trajectory, limiting      retirement or other reasons led to “lost” capacity

Project Overview

 The School Education Quality Improvement Technical
 Cooperation Program (SEQI TCP) between the Kuwaiti
 Ministry of Education (MoE), National Center for
 Educational Development (NCED) and World Bank
 (WB) began in 2010 with the goal of improving
 education quality through the development and
 modernization of four key areas: curriculum, school
 leadership, assessment and educational standards.
 Building upon earlier successful WB-MoE cooperation,
 the 2010-2014 TCP was based upon a comprehensive
 conceptual model. World Bank support across the
 four components included training and technical
 assistance for the key program activities.

                                               needed staffing resources, and dedicate the needed staff time to meet the challenge of an expanding program, and a complex reform process.
                                               The new phase of the TCP will require an enhanced program and project management structure , which need to be based on (i) a sound monitoring and evaluation system at
REQUIREMENTS                                   all levels; (ii) results frameworks and operational plans to establish, guide, and track progress; and (iii) greatly enhanced governance structures, including clarity on the

                                               management and coordinate the work of project teams for the reform pillars (which would coordinate the work of their project task teams)

Program Achievements
OVERALL

1. One of the major successes was the adoption of
   an integrated approach to reform, based upon a
   conceptual model jointly developed by MoE, the
   World Bank and NCED. The comprehensive,
   strategic approach indicated MoE’s significant
   commitment to reform. The cohesive package
   included components at the heart of education
   quality:     curriculum    development       and
   enhancement, effective school leadership,
   strengthening NCED and national assessment
   capacity and developing National Education
   Standards. Unlike previous initiatives that were
   piecemeal and disjointed, the TCP promoted
   collaboration     and   communication      across
   departments within the MoE; and between MoE         “In general, we are much

3. The TCP enhanced MoE and NCED’s abilities to
   mobilize and motivate teams at all levels to lead,
   advocate for and embrace change.                The
   implementation of TCP activities often required
   additional effort from MoE and NCED teams, who
   demonstrated a real desire for and ability to serve
   as positive change agents. The organic formation
   of communities of learning and practice as well as
   transfer of knowledge within teams was
   remarkable and noted by both international
   experts and the teams themselves. In describing
   principals participating in the SLP Pilot, “[their]
   commitment and enthusiasm for embracing
   change and doing the best that they can with what
   they have is outstanding across all schools.”

   collaborated for the complete modernization of         recommendations for curriculum sector policies

   learning activities. On the positive aspects of the
   new curriculum, subject leads commended the
   move away from memorization towards the
   development of competences and skills and the
   integration of subjects. Teams also noted that the
   competences and standards-based curriculum has
   the potential to transform Kuwaiti education if
   implemented with fidelity. In addition to grade and
   subject specific curricula, the curriculum revision
   process included the development of key
   curriculum reform documents, including a National
   Curriculum Framework, Implementation and
   Communications Plans and Teaching Plans.

5. The TCP enabled the transformation of school
   management practices in pilot schools. The 48
   schools taking part in the School Leadership
   Program (SLP) Pilot underwent significant
   improvements to the policies, processes and
   practices of school leadership.           New job
   descriptions were created to clearly define roles
   and responsibilities for the principal and assistant
   principals. School leadership was re-conceptualized
   and reorganized with new and improved
   administrative procedures and the beginnings of a
   career ladder system were put in place. School
   leadership teams and teachers were trained on the
   use of data for decision-making, community
   engagement and outreach and planning for success.
   Pilot schools now use participatory and team-based

7. Qualitative issues in the provision of technical
   assistance delayed project progress. Because
   Arabic-speaking specialists were not always
   available for the provision of technical assistance
   or training, the WB team relied on other
   international experts being aided by translation
   and interpretation to overcome the language
   barrier. The translation and back-translation of
   materials affected turn-around time for documents
   and the quality of the end products. Kuwaiti
   project teams noted the importance of not just
   language but also the adaptation of training
   material and workshop content to the Kuwaiti
   educational context. MoE and NCED teams valued
   even more structured guidance and mentorship
   from the WB in the form of more frequent
   interactions with expert teams, operational
   manuals and implementation guidelines.
