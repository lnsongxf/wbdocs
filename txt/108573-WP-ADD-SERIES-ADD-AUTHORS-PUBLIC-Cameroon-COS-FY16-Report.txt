I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Cameroon perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Cameroon
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Cameroon
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From May to June 2016, 607 stakeholders of the WBG in Cameroon were invited to provide
their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President, Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies; Project
Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects; consultants/
contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments; bilateral/
multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/
private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 394 stakeholders participated in
the survey (65% response rate).
Some respondents received and returned the questionnaires via courier or email; others
completed the questionnaire with the presence of an independent research consultant.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Cameroon; their overall attitudes toward
the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities;
working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Cameroon; and the WBG’s communication
and information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey (COS) must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate is 71%, N=403). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, mean
ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are
slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY’13 COS report and the non-
weighted data presented in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix E (page 89).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, employees of ministries/ministerial departments/implementation
       agencies were combined with respondents from PMUs/consultants/contractors working
       on WBG-supported projects; respondents from the financial sector/private banks were
       combined with those from private sector organizations; respondents from NGOs/
       community based organizations, private foundations, faith-based groups, youth groups,
       and trade unions were combined in the “CSO” category; and the small number of
       respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister, the office of a minister, the
       office of a parliamentarian, local governments, independent government institutions were
       included in the “Other” category. There were no respondents from the judiciary branch.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey and the FY’13 Country
        Survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (weighted mean in
        FY’16 = 5.4; weighted mean in FY’13 = 5.7)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Cameroon, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development in Cameroon, and the extent to which the WBG contributes to the country’s
        development results.

IV. General Issues Facing Cameroon
Headed in the Right Direction2
          Year comparison: This year’s respondents were significantly more likely to believe that
           Cameroon is headed in the wrong direction compared to respondents in the FY’13
           Country Survey.
          Stakeholder groups: In this year’s Country Survey, respondents from the private
           sector/financial sector/private banks were more likely to indicate that Cameroon is
           headed in the right direction, while respondents from the media and academia were
           significantly less positive about the prospect of Cameroon.

Overall Ratings for Indicator Questions by Stakeholder Groups
      Stakeholder groups: Respondents from academia/research institutes/think tanks had
       significantly lower mean ratings for the aggregated responses to the twenty six COS
       indicator questions compared to respondents from other stakeholder groups. Responses
       for individual indicator questions by stakeholder groups can be found in Appendix B (see
       page 59).
      Collaboration: Respondents who collaborate with the WBG had significantly higher
       mean ratings for the aggregated responses to the twenty six COS indicator questions
       (mean rating = 6.6) compared to respondents who do not collaborate with the WBG
       (mean rating = 5.7). Responses for individual indicator questions by exposure to the
       WBG can be found in Appendix F (page 95).

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Cameroon, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty six specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Cameroon. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
            The WBG’s effectiveness at rural development; and
            The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Cameroon, suggesting that ratings
       of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The area determined to be key driver from these
       analyses was:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at health;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at urban development; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at rural development.

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year19
All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number of respondents
indicated will be slightly different from the aggregated responses in Appendix A. Similarly, responses from FY 2013
respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2013 COS report.

FY 2013 Number of comparable respondents = 368  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 376

By weighting, the FY 2013 and FY 2016 samples have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank Group interacts with them
in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past aggregated annual global data. The weighted
stakeholder breakdown is presented below:
