                                               What This Report Is

                                                   About
This report comes following a request by the Municipality of Alba Iulia for the World Bank to assist with the following activities:


          Assessment of the projects included in the general and sectoral, local, intercommunity,
          county and regional urban planning and strategic documents in effect or coming into
          effect throughout the years 2014 – 2015, valid until at least 2020;

          Accommodation of the projects with the eligibility criteria set forth in the EU financing
          regulations, the Partnership Agreement, the Operational Programmes, other strategic
          and funding documents, in order to maximize the chances to access funds allocated
          for the local public administrations and/or their eligible partners;

          Analysis of Alba Iulia City’s capacity to ensure the financial and functional sustainability
          of such projects;

          Preparing recommendations concerning the improvement of performances of the
          project management teams;

          Recommendations concerning the improvement of the internal work procedures and
          instruments specific to externally funded projects;

          Recommendations concerning the risks associated to future projects and related
          contingency measures.

The aforementioned request followed a number of recommendations made by the World Bank in a technical assistance program for
the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA), between 2012 and 2014. These proposed ways in which
the MRDPA, as well as beneficiaries of EU funds, could better prepare for the 2014-2020 programming period.

The City of Alba Iulia is also getting ready for the 2014-2020 programming period and local authorities are aware that the city’s
development will continue to be dependent, to a large degree, on the efficient absorption of EU funds. To this end, the City
Development Strategy has been updated for 2014-2020, along with the General Urban Plan, and along with the finalization of the

                                                                   9
                                                                                                                                                                           Framework
Local Development Agenda 2014-2040. The task at hand will be to identify from these strategic documents priority projects that will
be undertaken between 2014 and 2022, using available resources in a judicious and efficient manner.

Consequently, this report will not duplicate the analysis carried out in the already completed strategic documents, but merely look
to see how the proposals made in these documents could be best operationalized for the 2014-2020 programming period. Where                                                    for Assessing Local Projects
necessary, additional analysis is undertaken to justify particular project choices.
                                                                                                                                      An analysis of strategic and programmatic documents has to start from the reality that some strategic documents are normative,
                                                                                                                                      while others are not. For example, the Alba Iulia General Urban Plan (GUP) is a normative document that provides the zoning for
                                                                                                                                      the City of Alba Iulia (i.e., what type of construction is permitted in different areas of the city) along with proposing major projects
                                                                                                                                      in the area. The fact that a project is in the GUP does not mean that the project will actually be implemented in the time-period for
                                                                                                                                      which the GUP is valid. However, once a particular land area is designated a particular function in the GUP (e.g., a new road), no
                                                                                                                                      other project than can be done there. Ideally, a GUP should only propose projects that can realistically be achieved within the GUP’s
                                                                                                                                      validity period. Moreover, whenever changes do occur in terms of planned projects, the GUP should be updated accordingly. For
                                                                                                                                      example, the current GUP includes an expressway that will by-pass Alba Iulia, connecting Turda with Sebeș and the A1 Highway.
                                                                                                                                      However, in the meantime national authorities have decided to develop a highway instead of an expressway, which means the Alba
                                                                                                                                      Iulia GUP has to be updated.

                                                                                                                                      Development strategies are not normative documents and as such place few binding constraints on local authorities to follow them.
                                                                                                                                      Almost every major local authority in Romania has a development strategy, but the way these strategies are put into practice varies
                                                                                                                                      from case to case. In some situations (e.g., when a political administrative change takes place), a locality may choose to focus on
                                                                                                                                      another set of projects than the ones listed in the strategy. An exception is made in the case of development strategies that come
                                                                                                                                      with funding constraints. For example, Integrated Development Plans (IDPs) enable access to EU funds for local authorities, but
                                                                                                                                      once approved, local authorities have to follow the list of projects included in the IDP.

In 2013, the World Bank elaborated a report (“Competitive Cities: Reshaping the Economic Geography of Romania”) that discusses
the Romanian system of cities in great detail, including a set of recommendations that are relevant for the City of Alba Iulia. The local
authorities already have this report, so the information will not be repeated here.

represent a significant source of revenue. Cities with a clear tourist potential should look for ways to meet the needs of tourists.
These needs can be grouped in the following five categories: attractions; information; connectivity; accommodation; quality services.
These will be discussed in more detail below.

Tourists go where there is something to visit. Many local authorities like to fashion their cities as tourist meccas, but when they look

at the numbers they see that they did not manage to generate a lot of revenues from tourism, nor did they manage to attract a lot
of tourists. Even cities that continuously have their hotels full, may in fact be visited by business travelers, not by people who were           criminality, begging, loitering. Tourism development can often deepen those social cleavages - e.g. pushing poor people outside
there to just visit the city. As such, local authorities have to be very clear about what attractions they can offer tourists (e.g., historic     historic neighborhoods. It is therefore critical that tourism development projects be done with a social inclusion lens in mind.
sites, cultural heritage, entertainment, gastronomy, culture) and find the best ways to showcase those attractions.
                                                                                                                                                  Climate Change
Information                                                                                                                                       Issues pertaining to climate change should also permeate tourism development decisions. For example, local authorities may

Connectivity
The easier it is to get to an attraction, the more visitors it is likely to enjoy. Easy access to airports, major road infrastructure, rail and
naval hubs is critical in this respect, although it is not always within the means of just one local authority to provide this connectivity.
                                                                         16                                                                                                                                                            17

                                                                Budget
     The simplest and most efficient tool for the prioritization of the proposals in a development strategy is a clear operational budget.
     Once city leaders have an estimate of the budget they could rely on to implement projects in a given timeline, they will also be in
     a better position to identify the priority projects they would want to fund with that budget. By contrast, having no realistic budget
     planning leads to long wish lists of projects that may be started and completed in some cases, but in the vast majority of cases they
     may be started and left unfinished for a long period of time or they may remain only on paper.

     The World Bank has developed a simple methodology for estimating prudent capital expenditure margins for local authorities. The
     methodology starts from the premise that public authorities should not spend more than 30% of their non-earmarked revenues on
     capital expenditures, year on year. Capital expenditures, such as the development of new infrastructure, bring with them operation
     and maintenance costs, and the larger the sum spent on capital expenditures the larger the operation and maintenance costs are
     likely to be. Thus, even when capital expenditures are done with grant money, they often require fixed costs that will be a burden on
     the local budget once the investment is completed.

     Non-earmarked revenues were calculated using the formula below:

                Non-Earmarked Revenues = (Own Revenues) + (Shared Personal Income Tax) +
                               (Non-Earmarked Grants) + (Other Revenues)

                     2007-2013 Projects
     Alba Iulia has been one of the most dynamic localities in Romania in terms of absorption of EU funds. Overall, it has managed
     to absorb or leverage in cooperation with other local/regional stakeholders over 150 million Euro in EU funds – a remarkable
     achievement. While Alba Iulia is only the 33rd largest city in Romania by population, it was 7th in terms of contracted projects under
     Axis 1 (on Urban Integrated Development Plans) of the Regional Operational Programme 2007-2013, with around 60 million Euro
     committed to urban development projects.

     In what follows, we provide an overview of the major infrastructure projects undertaken by the Municipality in Alba Iulia between
     2007 and 2013. This overview will help identify the key priorities of the Alba Iulia municipality in the previous programming period,
     which in turn will provide an idea about what priorities could be pursued in this programming period. Often, investments in one
     particular sector are carried over several programming periods. The analysis of the 2007-2013 portfolio of projects will be done
     using the Pyramid of Needs framework introduced earlier.

                                                  Educational Infrastructure
                                                  Educational units may be considered both under the “Opportunities” category and the “Basic Infrastructure” category. Normally,
                                                  an educational unit may be considered a creator of opportunities when it acts as a magnet for people. For example, a university
                                                  attracts a student body from a wide area (the best universities in the world have a global student base). A primary school, on the
                                                  other hand, usually services a certain community. However, good schools act as a magnet for parents who want to ensure that their
                                                  children get the best education possible. This is certainly the case in the United States, where parents seek the best school districts
                                                  in the area where they work.

                                                  Social infrastructure, similar to educational infrastructure, may also be considered under the “Basic Infrastructure” category.
                                                  However, when such infrastructure is not widely available (e.g., a center for elderly care), it becomes a draw for people in the region.
                                                  For example, elderly people may move to the city to benefit from the existing infrastructure, or families that have children with
                                                  disabilities may move to an area that offers them the appropriate social infrastructure.

                                                  and more cities offer a basic package of opportunities (e.g., well-paid jobs, access to good education and healthcare). The local
                                                  authorities in Alba Iulia have been able to engender an impressive transformation of the City Fortress. In the same vein, the local
                                                  authorities have developed and rehabilitated sports infrastructure (e.g., an Olympic swimming pool, and a rehabilitated football
                                                  field), have constructed new bike paths, and have rehabilitated several parks in the city.

                   The Alba Iulia
                 2014-2020 Projects
     In preparation for the 2014-2020 programming period, the local authorities in Alba Iulia have prepared a number of normative and
     strategic documents. These documents present the key issues the locality plans to tackle in the coming years. The proposals made
     in normative documents, such as the General Urban Plan, are binding (e.g., they assign land-uses and infrastructure proposals that
     have to be respected). The proposals made in strategic documents, such as the development strategy, serve more of a guiding
     purpose. However, for Axis 4: Sustainable Urban Development of the Regional Operational Programme 2014-2020, local authorities
     have to propose a binding list of projects, for which funding will be pre-allocated.

     In what follows, we discuss some of the key proposals made by local authorities for the coming years.

                                                         The Alba Iulia Development Strategy 2014-2020 took into consideration the larger context of the AIDA Functional Urban Zone. It is
                                                         acknowledged that Alba Iulia does not exist in a vacuum and it has to develop together with the localities around it. As such, the
                                                         Development Vision is defined at the level of the AIDA, taking regional synergies and dynamics into consideration. In addition the
                                                         strategy takes into consideration the development vision defined at the county level and at the regional level, with a focus on local
                                                         development based on knowledge, environmental protection, and social inclusion.

                                                         The vision of the Alba Iulia Municipality is to

                                                         live, work, and invest in by 2020.” Moreover, “the development of the Alba Iulia
                                                         Municipality will be completed in close coordination with the development of the localities in the AIDA region, thus becoming a
                                                         development engine, with a competitive economic environment and human resources adapted to socio-economic realities.”


                                                         Four Strategic Objectives have been defined to help achieve this vision:

                                                               Strategic Objective 1: Alba Iulia, a Smart, accessible, and cohesive city

                                                         These Strategic Objectives in turn are correlated with the Thematic Objectives defined by the EU for the 2014-2020 programming

     Prioritizing Projects
          for 2014-2020
     The large majority of development strategies end up with a long list of projects and no actual prioritization. This means that actual
     project implementation happens in a haphazard way and is often plagued by delays. Since local authorities have no clear priority
     list they tend to act in a reactive (e.g., pressure from the public) rather than a pro-active way. Proper prioritization requires that at
     least three elements are in place: an implementation timeline; an operational budget; and a framework/methodology for prioritizing
     projects. These elements were discussed above, and their application in the case of Alba Iulia will be discussed below.




                                       Implementation timeline
     A clear implementation timeline is critical for the establishment of an investment program. A hard deadline forces public authorities
     to think about what they would hope to realistically achieve within the set time period and also creates an incentive to finish set
     priorities within the respective time-period. For most EU-member countries, particularly the New Member Countries (which are to a
     large extent dependent on EU funds for critical infrastructure investments), it make sense to follow the EU program implementation
     cycles – in this case the 2014-2022. This not only allows a coordinated and harmonized approach of capital investments, but also
     ensures that different sources of funding are used in a complementary fashion to achieve key set goals.




                                              Operational budget
     The methodology for the elaboration of an operational budget was discussed earlier. The table below indicates the proposed 2014-
     2022 operational budget for the Municipality of Alba Iulia, as well as the other localities that are part of the AIDA intercommunal
     development association, as well as the county council. Given the strong commuter dynamics in and around Alba Iulia, it is important
     that priority projects not be considered in an insular, locality-focused fashion. Moreover, investments done by one local authority,
     or the county council, can benefit several localities – in fact, the majority of projects have some form of spillover effects, benefiting
     neighboring localities as well.

                                      projects the local authorities consider to be most needed for the city.

                  Priority projects
                   for 2014-2020
                     Rationale for choosing priority projects
The prioritization of an eclectic package of projects is more art than it is science. A multitude
of factors need to be taken into consideration when deciding what projects are best for a
community. There is no perfect methodology to achieve this desideratum and what is a priority
today may not be a priority tomorrow.

For the prioritization of projects in Alba Iulia a number of filters and methodologies were used.

The simplest and arguably most efficient tool for the prioritization of projects is the clear
definition of a clear implementation timeline and an OPERATIONAL BUDGET. In the case of
Alba Iulia the defined timeline is the EU implementing cycle (2014-2020) and the proposed
operational budget for capital investments is €69 million.

This does not necessarily mean that local authorities in Alba Iulia cannot do capital investments
in excess of €69 million between 2014 and 2022 (although they should not go over by too
much), but it is very helpful in triaging a long list of projects. And indeed from over 350 projects
outlined in the Development Strategy and the General Urban Plan, a final priority list of 13 was
chosen, plus an additional 3 to be implemented by national authorities.

                                                 79
     Getting to this final list of 13 priority projects was not a straight forward affair. For example, in the scoring of different projects
     by local authorities and external experts, Public Transport was identified as the number one priority. This project did not make
     it to the final priority list for two main reasons:


             • the project is not eligible for EU funding, since the public transport system is run by a private company;
             • projects
               the project has a large value (over €26 million) and if implemented would restrict the possibility to implement other
                        of importance.

     The eligibility of a project for EU funding was a prime criterion used in the triage of the list of projects in Alba Iulia. While the
     availability of EU funding should not be the main driver of an investment plan (local authorities should fund projects that are likely
     to have the most significant impact locally, regardless of the funding source), it is hard to argue against it. Whenever possible,
     local authorities should take advantage of available grants (while also ensuring the financial sustainability of completed capital
     investments), because this way the budgetary space is created to complete other needed projects.

     Consequently, several projects that received a high score in the prioritization exercise undertaken by the local authority and
     external experts, did not make it to the final priority list.

     On the other hand, there were projects that received a lower score in the prioritization exercise, but were included in the final
     priority list. For example, the proposed CLLD project in the Lumea Nouă neighborhood was priority number 35 out of a short list
     of 40 projects. However, it was priority 4 out of 11 on the citizen’s priority list. Moreover, projects with a focus on social inclusion
     or climate change are often not considered a priority by local authorities, but may have a large and long-term impact.

     In what follows, a short justification is provided for every project that made it on the priority list.

     The projects ranks 9th (out of 40) in the prioritization
     done by local staff and external experts and was
     ranked 6th (out of 11) in the citizen’s priority list.

     The projects continues the integrated approach
     undertaken in the 2007-2013 programming period,
     with several strategic investments undertaken in
     the City’ historic citadel. As such the city was
     given particular attention in the assessment
     undertaken and was put on the priority list.

     The project is eligible for EU funding under Priority
     Axis no.4 of the ROP 2014-2020, Measure no. 4.1.

     undertaken by local staff and external experts. Local authorities
     have undertaken a separate survey concerning the interest of
     citizens in a thermal rehabilitation project and their willingness to
     co-finance such projects. Over 80% of people indicated that such
     a thermal insulation project is useful, and more than 50% of those
     surveyed are willing to co-finance at least 20% of project costs.

     The project will not only help reduce energy consumption and
     energy bills for citizens, but will also help improve the quality of
     the urban space in the Municipality of alba Iulia, with a focus on
     apartment blocks in the Integrated Territory 2.

                                                      The promotion of the AIDA region to potential investors is of particular importance, given that a region cannot sustain its long term
                                                      growth if it does not also manage to create opportunities for people. The Alba County Council has already created a unit in charge of
                                                      promoting the county to investors. A platform has been developed (the Business Info Point - http://investalba.ro/4business/), which
                                                      gives potential investors easily digestible information about the county and the investment opportunities in the county. However, the
                                                      AIDA could have dedicated staff in charge of pro-actively attracting investors (e.g., going to trade shows, arranging direct meetings
                                                      with private companies, doing presentations at conferences).

                                                      Currently, AIDA is the most attractive area for business in Alba County. The available lands for investments with significant economic
