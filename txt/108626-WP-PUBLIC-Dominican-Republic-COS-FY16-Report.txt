I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in the Dominican Republic perceive the WBG. The survey
explored:
    General Issues Facing the Dominican Republic
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in the Dominican Republic
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From April 2016 to June 2016, 624 stakeholders of the WBG in the Dominican Republic were
invited to provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country
opinion survey. Participants were drawn from the Office of the President/Prime Minister; office
of a minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; Project
Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/ programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; non-profit organizations/community based organizations; the media;
independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups;
academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of
201 stakeholders participated in the survey (32% response rate).

Some respondents received and completed the questionnaire online, while others received and
filled out the questionnaire via mail. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing the
Dominican Republic; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and
results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future
role in the Dominican Republic; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate is 54%, N=275). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of
the FY’16 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, D and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix E (page 92).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister and the
       Office of Minister were combined. Respondents from the financial sector/private banks

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s country survey were significantly more
        familiar with the WBG compared to respondents of the FY’13 country survey (weighted
        mean in FY’16 = 7.6; weighted mean in FY’13 = 6.6)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in the Dominican Republic, and
        significantly, moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant
        role in development in the Dominican Republic and the extent to which the WBG helps
        to achieve development results in the country.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
Attributing Failed/Slow Reform Efforts
      Year comparison: Respondents in the previous FY’13 Country Survey attributed failed
       or slow WBG assisted reforms to “inadequate level of citizen/civil society participation
       (40%),” “political pressures and obstacles (36%),” and “the government working
       inefficiently (33%).”
      Stakeholder groups: Among this year’s respondents, respondents from
       academia/research institute/think tank were significantly more likely to attribute failed or

report are questions that are asked in every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey.
These will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.

The Effectiveness of the World Bank Group and Other Development Banks
(Indicator Question)
      Year comparison: This year’s respondents gave significantly higher ratings for the
       effectiveness of the World Bank Group than respondents in the FY’13 Country Survey
       (weighted mean in FY’16 = 7.3; weighted mean in FY’13 = 6.9).
      Stakeholders gave significantly lower ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness than the
       effectiveness of the Inter-American Development Bank, whereas they gave significantly
       higher ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness than the effectiveness of the Latin American
       Development Bank and European Investment Bank.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in the Dominican
Republic, bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the
twenty nine specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in the Dominican Republic.
       The areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at government effectiveness.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in the Dominican Republic,
       suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions
       of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results. The areas determined to be
       key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at nutrition and food security; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity.

IX. The Future Role of the WBG in the Dominican Republic
Making the World Bank Group of Greater Value
       Year comparison: Respondents in the previous FY’13 Country Survey indicated that the
        World Bank should “reach out more to groups outside of the Government” (49%) and
        “reduce the complexity of obtaining World Bank financing” (46%) to make itself of
        greater value in the Dominican Republic.
       Stakeholder groups: Stakeholders from CSOs and private sector/financial sector/private
        banks were significantly more likely to indicate that the WBG should reach more to
        groups outside of Government compared to stakeholders from other groups.

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year18
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number
of respondents each year will be slightly different from those in FY 2013 appendices.

FY 2013 Number of comparable respondents = 239  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 186

By weighting, FY 2013 and FY 2016 have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable.
The weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank
Group interacts with them in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past
aggregated annual global data. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:
