       Executive Summary

Purpose of Fiduciary Systems Assessment (FSA)

1. The Results-based Scaling Up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program (the “Program”)
   fiduciary systems should provide reasonable assurance that the financing proceeds will be
   used for intended purposes, with due attention to the principles of economy, efficiency,
   effectiveness, transparency, and accountability. The Assessment of Program fiduciary
   systems integrates findings in three areas:
 The procurement systems were assessed to determine the degree to which the planning,
   bidding, evaluation, contract award and contract administration arrangements and
   practices provide a reasonable assurance that the Program will achieve intended results
   through its procurement processes and procedures;
 The financial management systems were assessed to determine the degree to which the
   relevant planning, budgeting, accounting, internal controls, funds flow, financial reporting
   and auditing arrangements provide a reasonable assurance on the appropriate use of
   Program funds and safeguarding of its assets; and
 The Program was also assessed in how its governance systems handle the risks of fraud and
   corruption, including the use of complaint mechanisms, and how such risks are managed
   and mitigated in light of the government’s commitments under the Guidelines on
   Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Program-for-Results Financing (Anti-
   Corruption Guidelines or ACGs).

2. The Fiduciary Systems Assessment (FSA) has been prepared based on interviews and
   analysis at the national level with the National Target Program (NTP) Standing Office under
   the Ministry of Agriculture and Development (MARD), the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and
   the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), and the Vietnam Health Environment
   Management Agency (VIHEMA) under the Ministry of Health (MOH). Interviews and analysis
   were also completed at the provincial level in the Northern Mountains and the Central
   Highlands (NM-CH) provinces of Dien Bien, Dak Lak, Lai Chau, Hoa Binh and Yen Bai
   provinces. The Assessment also benefited from the recent fiduciary assessments prepared
   for the Results-Based Rural Water Supply and Sanitation under the National Target Program
   (approved in November 2012) and the Results-Based National Urban Development Program
   in the Northern Mountains Region (approved in June 2014) which cover similar technical
   and geographical areas, respectively, as compared with the concerned Program.

National Target Program for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation

3. The Government of Vietnam (GoV) gives high priority to development of rural water supply
   and sanitation. The National Rural Clean Water Supply and Sanitation Strategy to 2020
   (developed in 2000 and updated in 2011) has set the overall vision and goals for the sector.
   To implement the strategy, GoV established a National Target Program (NTP) for Rural
   Water Supply and Sanitation which has resulted in considerable progress over the past ten
   years. Since 2001, rural water supply and sanitation has been financed through a dedicated


                                              5
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                         FSA


   National Target Program in three phases; the second RWSS NTP ran from 2006 to 2010 and
   upgraded water services for 5.4 million people and sanitation services for 6.8 million
   people.

4. This Fiduciary Systems Assessment (FSA) relates to the third National Target Program for
   Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (hereafter referred to as NTP3) which runs from 2012 to
   2015. NTP3 is specifically intended to promote investment in poor, remote, ethnic, border
   and island areas as well as areas where water is polluted or scarce. The NTP3 includes the
   following components:

   a) Construction and rehabilitation of water supply schemes, promotion of clean water use,
      improved control of water quality, and support to sustainable systems;
   b) Construction and effective use of latrines at households, schools, health clinics and
      public places;
   c) Information, Education and Communication activities to raise awareness on the
      importance of clean water and latrines and hygiene practices;
   d) Continued development of the legal framework for the implementation of the RWSS
      strategy;
   e) Promotion of international cooperation; and
   f) Capacity building.

5. Nationally, NTP3 aims to reach the following indicators in rural areas by 2015: 85 percent
   coverage of hygienic water, of which 45 percent meets water quality standards as per QCVN
   02-BYT; 65 percent coverage of hygienic latrines and 100 percent of commune clinics and
   schools (excluding satellite schools) that have hygienic water supply and sanitation facilities.
   To date NTP3 has achieved 82 percent coverage of hygienic water (40 percent meeting
   QCVN 02-BYT) and 60 percent coverage of hygienic latrines. However the level of
   achievement across the provinces is highly variable, with almost all low performing
   provinces in the mountainous and poor areas.

6. Following lessons learned from the first two phases, NTP3 has been structured to support
   both water supply and sanitation (domestic and environmental sanitation), improve
   sustainability and assign clear responsibilities to MARD for water supply infrastructure and
   the Ministry of Health (MOH) for sanitation and hygiene. NTP3 had an increased focus on
   the sustainability of water systems as well as Information, Education, and Communication
   (IEC) activities, and incorporated sanitation under the mandate of MOH.

7. A proposal to transfer the components of the current NTP3 to the successor program in
   2016, expected to be the New Rural Area NTP, has been developed within MARD.

8. The approach taken under the Program is to strengthen the Government of Vietnam’s NTP3
   in the 19 provinces of the NM-CH regions with the lowest sanitation coverage to support
   the existing efforts of the government to scale up access to sanitation and improved
   hygiene practices. The RB-SupRSWS Program will include interventions to support demand
   generation through innovative approaches in behavior change communication (BCC) at the
   local level, coupled with national-level interventions to build awareness of the importance
   of sanitation to the national economy and obtain public commitment at the highest level.
   Support will also be provided to strengthen the supply chain to improve the design,
   availability and affordability of sanitation products and services. Participative approaches
   will be used at all levels in order to ensure that interventions are appropriate and effective.
   Construction of new sanitation facilities and rehabilitation of existing and construction of
   new water supply schemes will facilitate improved hygiene practices. Behavior change
   communication programs would work through nutrition programs as well as reinforce
   them. Technology used will be appropriate, cost effective and accessible for poor
   households. The Program will also support the provision of sanitation, hygiene and water
   supply services to schools and health clinics through the construction of facilities and the
   strengthening of the management model for sustainable operation and maintenance of the
   system.

9. The institutional and financing arrangements will be aligned with the structures of
   GoV. Funds will pass from the center to the Provincial People’s Committees (PPC) in the 19
   recipient provinces. Fund allocations will be made on the basis of provincial plans and
   within the framework of NTP3. These funds will be used to finance NTP3, including water
   supply, sanitation and hygiene promotion. It will be the responsibility of the PPC in each of
   the 19 recipient provinces to plan investments and allocate funding to the appropriate
   technical departments at that level in accordance with the inter-ministerial guidelines. For
   national-level activities, funding for the Program will be allocated by the MOF to the related
   ministries. The amount of funds allocated to different ministries under the Program will be
   based on the anticipated funds required to achieve the Disbursement-Linked Indicator (DLI)
   targets as well as the amounts corresponding to the DLI results that are verified as
   completed.

10. The Program will be designed in coordination with existing socio-economic, rural
    development programs and activities managed by other line Ministries. In order to
    effectively implement the Program and target remote regions, effective and multi-sectoral
    approaches to commune-wide sanitation will need to be developed. Linkages with the
    health and education programs and with nutrition will be key given the links between poor
    access to sanitation and stunting and the need to develop a sustained system. Schools, in
    particular, will be a critical focal point for developing an integrated strategy. For integration
    strategies with nutrition, synergies can specifically be found in the outreach programs to
    mothers and care-givers.

11. Learning from global and Vietnam-specific experience, the proposed program would have
    the following three closely inter-related elements corresponding with the projects under
    the RWSS NTP3 which support delivery of behavior change communication, provide basic

                                                 7

   services and infrastructure to support behavior change, support sustainable services, and
   build capacity:

   a. Rural domestic water supply and rural environment
           Provision of hygienic sanitation, hand washing facilities and adequate water supply
            in schools – including consideration of the needs of all children – and support for
            putting in place the system for operation and maintenance of the facilities;
           Increasing water supply coverage for villages – using small-to-medium sized
            community-based systems – focusing on rehabilitation and extensions from
            existing systems. New water supply schemes would be constructed as required
            using appropriate technology. Investments would be demand responsive and
            would balance willingness to pay with prioritizing areas with higher levels of
            poverty; and
           Provision of Technical Assistance (TA) for improved operation and maintenance
            procedures, management and tariff collection, and accounting procedures at the
            village/commune levels. The role of the Provincial Center for Rural Water Supply
            and Sanitation (PCERWASS) in supporting this process, specifically in their technical
            backstopping role for community based systems, will be strengthened.
   b. Rural sanitation and hygiene
           Provision of hygienic sanitation, hand washing facilities and adequate water supply
            in health clinics – along with support for putting in place the system for operation
            and maintenance of the facilities;
           Support for scaling up domestic hygiene and sanitation to achieve Commune Wide
            Sanitation:
              (i) Demand side interventions would be implemented through existing
                  channels, including clinics, schools, government health system staff, and
                  traditional leadership structures. In addition, at the village level, local leaders
                  along with the women’s union and commune and village health workers
                  would be supported with new tools and to adapt existing approaches, such
                  as Community Approaches to Total Sanitation (CATS), which have
                  demonstrated effectiveness. Counseling of mothers and caregivers in clinics
                  would also support scaling up existing successful programs combating
                  malnutrition;
              (ii) Supply side interventions such as support to the private sector to strengthen
                   the capacity of local builders, manufacturers and suppliers of sanitation
                   products and services, in order to supply a menu of affordable and
                   appropriate household sanitation and hand washing hardware options and
                   services. The intervention will build on the work already being done by
                   VIHEMA and other Development Partners; and



                                                8
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                       FSA


              (iii) Additional targeted support to households for latrine construction with
                    affordable technology options and potentially strengthening micro-financing
                    through the Vietnam Bank of Social Policy (VBSP). This intervention would
                    also identify how to improve the delivery of the existing subsidy systems for
                    poor households (e.g., as rebates directly to households or voucher systems
                    to be redeemed at local sanitation suppliers).
   c. Capacity building, communication and supervision, monitoring and evaluation of NTP3
            Focused capacity building of national, provincial and local agencies involved in the
             Program to develop their implementation and management capacity and improve
             inter-sectoral collaboration including: (i) capacity to promote hygienic behavior
             change and provide sustainable sanitation services; (ii) planning, monitoring,
             evaluation and reporting; and (iii) supporting improved environmental, social and
             fiduciary systems;
            Policy support where needed, for example to enhance the role of PCERWASS in
             supporting institutional capacity development at the commune levels, for school
             water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), water pricing framework, and
             development of sanitation markets;
            Improving sustainability of access to sanitation and improved water supply
             through technical assistance for community management and support to
             PCERWASS and the Department of Health (DoH)/Department of Education and
             Training (DoET);
            Verification of Program Results and External Audit of the Program by the
             Independent Verification Agent; and
            Launch of a national and provincial high-level advocacy campaign to raise the
             political profile of sanitation and hygiene.


   Institutional Arrangements

12. The institutional arrangements are described below:
            MARD will coordinate the implementation of the Program, through a national
             steering committee comprising MARD, MoH, the Ministry of Education and
             Training (MoET), the Committee for Ethnic Minority Affairs (CEMA), MPI and MoF.
             Fully empowered teams will be established nationally in MARD and VIHEMA in
             order to monitor and support implementation in all Provinces under the Program;
            At the central level, VIHEMA will be the technical lead for the sanitation and
             hygiene promotion activities. The National Center for Rural Water Supply and
             Sanitation (NCERWASS) will lead activities relating to community water supply. A
             strong coordination mechanism will be needed in order to promote integrated
             water and sanitation projects to support hygiene practices;

            PPCs will lead provincialllevel steering committees for coordination and
             supervision comprising DoH, PCERWASS, DoET, DPI, the Department of Finance
             (DoF), and CEMA. PCERWASS will be the program owner at the provincial level;
            Independent Verification Agent (IVA) role is to provide independent confirmation
             of the results reported by the provinces through MARD. State Audit of Vietnam
             (SAV)was selected to verify Program results using protocols agreed with the Bank.
             This choice is based on SAV’s role as a constitutional body with both the
             independence and the mandate to conduct NTP audits. SAV has good
             management capacity and can subcontract verification works for which it does not
             have the technical expertise in-house. SAV is the IVA under the RWSS PforR and
             has performed satisfactorily; it has subcontracted the physical verification of
             sanitation and water supply connections to a specialist firm. SAV provided
             adequate oversight of the surveys teams and reporting process; and
            The Women’s Union, potentially other mass organizations, village health workers
             and similar groups will be critical for implementation of the hygiene promotion
             components. These groups will be incorporated into the institutional structure of
             implementation to assist in community mobilization. The Women’s Union will also
             be engaged to support grievance redress channels. These routes are also potential
             channels for the effective engagement of Ethnic Minority (EM) groups in
             implementation.
Procurement

13. Procurement under NTPs is governed by national procurement laws and regulations.
    Specifically, the procurement done before April 2006 was governed by, in turn, Decrees
    88/1999/ND-CP dated September 1, 1999; Decree 14/2000/ND-CP dated May 5, 2000; and
    then Decree 66/2003/ND-CP dated June 12, 2003. The procurement implemented after
    April 2006 has been subject to the Procurement Law No. 61/2005/QH11 dated
    November 29, 2005; Law No. 38/2009/QH12 on Amendments to the Procurement Law
    dated June 19, 2009; and subsequent implementing Decrees (including Decree No.
    111/2006/ND-CP, dated September 29, 2006; Decree No. 58/2008/ND-CP dated May 5,
    2008; and Decree No.85/2008/ND-CP dated October 15, 2009). The new Public
    Procurement Law No.43/2013/QH13 (approved by National Assembly on November 26,
    2013, and became effective on July 1, 2014) and Decree No. 63/2014/ND-CP (dated June 26,
    2014 became effective on August 15, 2014) will govern all procurement activities under the
    concerned Program.

14. Legally, procurement complaints are handled in accordance with the procedures stated in
    Decree No. 63/2014/ND-CP. These procedures require complaints to be duly signed and
    stamped by a legitimate representative of the complaining bidder (anonymous complaints
    are not considered); for complaints related to contract award, the complainant has to
    deposit a fee which would not be returned if the complaint is not substantiated. Complaints
    are handled by procuring entities or project owners and appeals are reviewed by a



                                              10
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                        FSA


   competent agency - normally the Provincial People’s Committee. This procedure seems to
   be rather rigid and discouraging of complaints.

15. Procurement under the proposed Program mostly includes civil works of small and medium
    size (upgrading or new construction of water supply system and providing of sanitation
    facilities less than US$10 million) and associated consulting services (capacity building,
    communication campaign, detailed designs, construction supervision, etc.). There are no
    large contracts valued at or above Operational Procurement Review Committee (OPRC)
    thresholds under the Program. As stated above, Program procurement will be carried out in
    accordance with Vietnam’s procurement laws and regulations. Specific pro curement
    methods that would be applicable to the Program include open competitive bidding, direct
    contracting and shopping. It is envisaged that more than 90 percent of the Program’s
    expenditures will be subject to mandatory open competitive bidding due to the
    effectiveness of the new Procurement Law and Decree. The procurement rules and
    procedures applicable to the Program, therefore, are considered to promote transparency,
    economy and efficiency for the Program.

16. The team identified three specific areas during the assessment of the procurement cycle
    that could, directly or indirectly, compromise the efficient achievement of Program
    objectives, namely: (a) prevalent rejection of bids due to bid prices exceeding pre-bid cost
    estimates and minor, non-substantive deviations; (b) award of contracts to dependent
    State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs); and (c) non-application of Bank debarment/suspension
    lists which may result in unacceptable contract awards to Bank debarred/suspended firms
    or individuals. Corresponding Program actions to address these gaps are proposed to be
    agreed with the Government prior to Credit negotiations. To strengthen the Program’s
    procurement implementation capacity, several crucial measures should be adopted
    including additional staffing, intensive training and hiring of qualified procurement/contract
    management support consultants.

17. In addition to the above, there are a number of other weaknesses that are assessed to
    possibly impact the timeliness, cost-effectiveness and competitiveness of Program
    procurement. These include: (a) a segregated and fragmented approach to procurement
    planning; (b) low-cost estimates for consulting services due to the use of Government cost
    norms; (c) subjective application of technical scoring criteria in bid evaluation; and (d)
    delayed construction due to shortage of funds or delayed allocation of budget or delayed
    payments. These weaknesses will be addressed through capacity support to participating
    provinces in procurement activities; the development of a detailed, clear and practical
    Program Operational Manual (POM) by MARD / VIHEMA (MoH); close support, monitoring
    and supervision by MARD / VIHEMA (MoH) and Program provinces; and strict inspection
    and audit by the MPI Inspectorate / provincial inspectorates and State Audit of Vietnam.
    The Bank will provide assistance and support to the Program procurement implementation,
    and will also closely monitor the defined indicators of Program procurement performance.
    The overall procurement risk is assessed as Substantial, and may be reduced to Moderate
    after mitigation.

Financial Management

18. Budget formulation and allocation. The principal law governing budget management is the
    revised State Budget Law approved by the National Assembly in 2002 which came into force
    for the 2004 budget year. This revised Law has strengthened the legal platform for budget
    management. It clarifies the powers and responsibilities of stakeholders participating in the
    budget process and strengthens decentralization by providing greater budgetary powers to
    Provincial People’s Councils and Provincial People’s Committees.

19. In NTP3, PCERWASS, assigned by PPC to be the provincial NTP Standing Office, prepares a
    five-year financial plan for the NTP which forms part of the overall provincial plan. On the
    basis of the five-year plan, PCERWASS coordinates with DoH and DoET to prepare the
    annual budget proposal for NTP implementation in the province, comprising of budget for
    rural water supply, rural sanitation and communication. This annual budget proposal will be
    reviewed by the provincial Department of Finance and the provincial Department for
    Planning and Investment (DPI), and approved by PPC before being submitted to the NTP
    Standing Office as the basis for the NTP budget allocation for the coming year. In parallel,
    DoH also reports to VIHEMA on the proposed budget for rural sanitation and
    communication. This first process of provincial budget proposal generation is demand-
    based.

20. The budget allocation from the central government, however, is based on the availability of
    funds. The NTP Standing Office (NTPSO), after receiving budget proposals from all
    provinces, with call for a joint meeting among line ministries – MARD, MoH and MoET. The
    consolidated NTP3 annual budget proposal submitted by NTPSO to MPI is detailed by
    province and by sub-project (water supply, sanitation and communication), with substantial
    cut down from provincial budget proposals based on limited availability of funds informed
    by MPI in the regular budget formulation process. Normally, the approved annual budget
    allocation is only around 30 to 50 percent of the province’s proposed amount.

21. Once budget reconciliation has been completed at the national level, the MPI informs each
    province of the amount of NTP funding allocated to them. Upon receiving the annual
    budget allocation, the PPC revises the initial plan in accordance with available resources. As
    long as the chosen activities fall within the scope of the annual plan presented to MPI, the
    allocation of the budgeted resources is at PPC discretion, without any further intervention
    from central government.

22. This full decentralization of budget allocation to PPC created a practice in NTP3, especially
    in the low income provinces such as the Northern Mountains and Central Highlands,
    whereby: (a) almost all NTP funds are allocated by PPCs to water supply components while
    sanitation and communication do not usually receive adequate priority and resources; and
    (b) the implementation of investment is mostly assigned to district and commune
    government instead of provincial technical agencies such as PCERWASS and DoH, leading to
    poor performance in both investment and operation of water supply schemes and low
    quality communication activities. For this Program, the earlier differences between

                                               12
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                                        FSA


      provincial budget proposals and centrally-provided funds will be addressed through an
      improved provincial planning process, complemented by a national inter-ministry (MARD,
      MoH and MoET) guidance based on annual Program entitled withdrawals that have a high
      degree of certainty. There will be a Program Action Plan (PAP) to require timely and
      appropriate budget allocation by PPCs, including adequate allocation to sanitation and
      communication as indicated in inter-ministry guidance. Implementation arrangements, with
      main focus on PCERWASS and DoH for provincial activities, will be provided in the Program
      Outline and Feasibility Study.

23. Fund flow. NTP funds flow from the Government Budget to the ultimate beneficiaries
    through the State Treasury system, in parallel to the budget allocation process. Based on
    the revised plan approved by the PPC, implementing units conduct NTP activities. After
    expenditures are incurred and work completed, contractors/suppliers send supporting
    documents and request for payment to implementing units. Implementing units review and
    transfer the requests to the provincial State Treasury to verify and make payments to
    contractors/ suppliers. NTP funds flow from the National State Treasury to provincial State
    Treasury. The MoF recognizes the need to secure Program funds in a special deposit
    account in State Treasury at the provincial level, to manage proper budget allocation,
    execution and reporting by the provinces. Funds transferred from MoF to provinces are
    performance-based, and result from the amount the provinces are entitled to request for
    advances and the amount reimbursed for DLIs achieved and verified. Funds transferred
    from provincial main deposit accounts to sub-accounts of implementing agencies follow the
    same principles.

24. Internal control, financial reporting and audit. In terms of accounting and financial
    reporting, the capacity of provincial State Treasury and each implementing agency
    (PCERWASS and DoH) is expected to be adequate as the Treasury Budget and Management
    Information System (TABMIS)1 is fully implemented. However, there remains a risk of mis-
    recording of transactions or mis-presentation of financial statements overall at the
    provincial level, where a significant amount of transactions in sanitation and hygiene
    promotion are incurred at communities. This risk is mitigated by assigning PCERWASS to
    prepare consolidated provincial program financial statements, and DoH to be responsible
    for all advances and spending of sanitation and hygiene promotion activities in the
    province, including activities conducted by the Women’s Union, district health centers and
    village health workers. In addition, clear and comprehensive guidance will need to be
    provided in the Operational Manual and training will be provided by the coordinating
    agency. Reconciliation of main account and sub-account statements is done with provincial
    State Treasury quarterly. At the central level, NTPSO will consolidate financial statements
    for the whole Program (provinces, MARD and MoH) and get them audited by the State
    Audit of Vietnam. This process has been done annually by NTPSO and SAV for the ongoing
    Bank-financed RWSS PforR under NTP3.

Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                        FSA


25. Internal controls exist in PCERWASS, DoH and DoET, covering critical areas such as
    segregation of duties, work acceptance and payments, asset count, cash reconciliation and
    advance management. However, no manual has been issued as guidance for the investment
    owners/spending units with respect to managing their funds. With significant increases in
    the volume of sanitation and hygiene promotion, by adding this Program fund to NTP3, an
    operation manual is required to guide the agencies in implementing soft activities, including
    cost norms, advance and advance clearance, work acceptance, filing of records and
    reporting of expenditures. Reporting of budget execution by PPCs to NTPSO is done
    annually; however, it is done with limited reconciliation and follow-up by NTPSO. At the
    provinces, while there are many inspection missions covering various areas, there are risks
    of these overlapping, yet leaving some areas uncovered. The risk of inadequate internal
    control of NTP is assessed as Substantial, and the introduction of an Internal Audit function
    is required. MARD Inspectorate is currently performing an Internal Audit function for the
    ongoing RRWS PforR, with capacity strengthened by an independent consulting firm
    recruited by NTPSO using a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) Technical
    Assistance Grant. The Inspectorate is requested to perform internal audit functions for this
    Program as well.

26. The scope and frequency of external auditing, which is performed by the State Audit of
    Vietnam, also need to be increased. SAV Audit Division 5 is the financial auditor of NTP3 and
    the ongoing RRWS PforR. As required by the Bank, SAV performed audits for 8/8 provinces
    of the PforR and submitted audit reports to the Bank on time for the financial year 2013.
    The audit coverage of NTP3 overall, however, is 20 – 25/ 63 provinces annually. Agreement
    on annual audit Terms of Reference (TORs) needs to be reached between NTPSO and SAV to
    ensure full scope audits on 19/19 provinces for this Program. SAV will be included as an
    implementing agency of this Program to receive funds from MoF to support this annual
    audit work.

Governance

27. The 2005 Anti-Corruption Law and the 2011 Laws on Complaints and on Denunciation
    entitle citizens to submit complaints on fraud and corruption (among other concerns) to the
    government People’s Committee at the appropriate level. A complaints handling syste m will
    receive, record, and provide necessary investigative actions where it is deemed legitimate.
    The assessment also identified a parallel complaints “system” in the Government
    Inspectorate (GI) offices under line ministries and departments at the central and provincial
    level. The GI’s main functions are to investigate allegations of fraud and corruption in their
    respective sectors.

28. Under the Program, complaints of all kinds, which could include allegations of fraud or
    corruption, should be submitted in writing to the Provincial or District People's Committee,
    as well as the supervising Departments of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARDs) and
    Departments of Health (DOHs), or through the implementing agencies (PCERWASS and
    PMC). Where crimes are alleged, allegations will be passed to the local police and
    prosecutors for handling. In addition to the written complaints channel, any citizen may also

                                               14
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                       FSA


   attend Meeting Sessions with PC/Department leaders, held at least monthly, to raise issues
   of fraud and corruption. Although government offices are not required to handle
   anonymous complaints, all these agencies maintain the practice of accepting, recording,
   and giving these complaints some consideration when they contain credible evidence of
   fraud and corruption.

29. In addition to this system for handling complaints, citizens can also submit fraud and
    corruption allegations to the Inspectorate Office of National Ministries or Provincial DARDs
    and DOHs under this Program. The inspectors reserve the right to stop construction for
    investigation if they find evidence of fraud and corruption. Similar to the government
    system above, the Inspectorate will pass allegations on to the police and prosecutor once
    crimes are alleged. Both of these parallel complaints handling systems contain a reporting
    mechanism that can capture information on the number, type and handling of fraud and
    corruption allegations. Information on sanctions and debarment is reported through the
    PPC to the provincial Department of Planning and Investment (DPI) and up to the MPI to
    prepare the National Debarment List.

30. While this multiple-entry complaints system provides a number of options for citizens, it can
    also be confusing and result in complaints being passed around agencies or lost in the
    transfer process making it difficult for citizens to follow up on their complaints. No recent
    significant fraud and corruption cases were reported during the assessment. In recent years,
    participating provinces have mostly received and recorded complaints regarding the quality
    of service delivery or the household contribution requirements.

31. The Government will improve reporting systems and establish a database in order to
    strengthen the framework for complaints handling and combat fraud and corruption under
    the Program. The Government has confirmed its commitment to the implementation of the
    Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Program-for-Results
    Financing and will require the application of World Bank suspension and debarment lists
    that will be made readily available to participating entities. These actions will be reviewed
    during Program supervision. In addition, the Government will oblige all Program
    participants to cooperate with Bank investigations through issuing an executive order to
    participating entities on the Bank’s investigative rights and the Anti-Corruption Guidelines.

32. Over recent years, the Bank has received several complaints related to fraud, corruption
    and collusion in water sector projects in Vietnam. The Bank has substantiated three cases of
    fraud and corruption resulting in the debarment of international and local firms and
    individuals. While it has not been possible to substantiate all the complaints, in each
    instance the Bank has worked with the client to review and resolve issues, mitigate risks and
    strengthen systems where necessary. Despite progress in water program governance, it is
    acknowledged that some weaknesses remain in the sector.

Key Performance Indicators

Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                       FSA


33. Key indicators of fiduciary performance have been identified and compiled to form a
    reference framework to be monitored over the life of the program. These specific
    indicators, for both financial management and procurement, will be measured periodically
    and compared to an initial baseline to assess the extent of improvement in the Program's
    fiduciary performance.

Summary

34. In assessing the performance of the fiduciary systems under which the Program operates,
    the Bank identified a number of weaknesses and gaps which, once addressed, either prior
    to effectiveness or during implementation of the Program through the technical assistance
    (Section E) and the Program Action Plan (Section F), respectively, will result in Program
    fiduciary systems that provide reasonable assurance that the Program expenditures will be
    used appropriately to achieve their intended purpose. The fiduciary systems assessment
    identifies risks and proposed mitigation measures. Prior to the mitigation measures being
    taken, Program risk is assessed to be “substantial.” During preparation the Bank assessed all
    available options: dated covenants, capacity building, Disbursement-Linked Indicators
    (DLIs), and Program design revisions to help mitigate these risks. The results of the
    assessment and recommendations are reflected in the technical assistance program and the
    Program’s integrated action plan.

Additional Provinces

35. During negotiations, the Government of Vietnam requested the inclusion of two additional
    provinces in the Program; Ninh Thuan and Binh Thuan. The Bank agreed to the inclusion of
    these two additional provinces. Following this agreement, the Bank carried out a further
    desk-based fiduciary assessment of Ninh Thuan and Binh Thuan. The fiduciary aspects of the
    Program relating to Ninh Thuan and Binh Thuan provinces, were found to be consistent
    with those identified through the findings of the initial assessment of the 19 original
    provinces. The fiduciary recommendations, the risk rating and the inputs to the Program
    Action Plan from this assessment are therefore considered to be appropriate for all of the
    provinces under the Program including Ninh Thuan and Binh Thuan.

    A. Program Description

RWSS NTP3 (the Program)

36. The Government of Vietnam (GoV) gives high priority to development of rural water supply
    and sanitation. The National Rural Clean Water Supply and Sanitation Strategy to 2020
    (developed in 2000 and updated in 2011) sets the overall vision and goals for the sector.
    The key principles of the strategy include community participation, sustainability and cost
    recovery. The sector strategy also emphasizes the focus on poverty, Ethnic Minority groups
    and remote areas. The government recognizes that improving access to sanitation is a
    priority and has committed to eliminating open defecation (OD) in Vietnam by 2025. In the
    short term, the focus is to target poor communities where water and sanitation coverage is
    low and malnutrition is high. Improving hygiene practices has been a long-term goal of the
    government. To implement the strategy, GoV established a National Target Program for
    Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (NTP) which has resulted in considerable progress over
    the past ten years. Since 2001, rural water supply and sanitation has been financed through
    a dedicated National Target Program.

37. This Fiduciary System Assessment relates to NTP3, which runs from 2012 to 2015.2 NTP3 is
    specifically intended to promote investment in poor, remote, ethnic, border and island
    areas as well as areas where water is polluted or scarce. The NTP3 includes:
    a) Construction and rehabilitation of water supply schemes; promotion of clean water use,
        improved control of water quality and support to sustainable systems;
    b) Construction and effective use of latrines at households, schools, health clinics and
        public places;
    c) Information, Education and Communication activities to raise awareness on the
        importance of clean water and latrines and hygiene practices;
    d) Continued development of the legal framework for the implementation of the RWSS
        strategy;
    e) Promotion of international cooperation; and
    f) Capacity building.

38. Nationally, NTP3 aimed to reach the following indicators in rural areas by 2015: 85 percent
    coverage of hygienic water, of which 45 percent meets water quality standards as per QCVN
    02-BYT; 65 percent coverage of hygienic latrines and 100 percent of commune clinics and
    schools (excluding satellite schools) that have hygienic water supply and sanitation facilities.
    To date NTP3 has achieved 82 percent coverage of hygienic water (40 percent meeting
    QCVN 02-BYT) and 60 percent coverage of hygienic latrines. However, the level of

 After NTP3 ends, the Government of Vietnam is planning to consolidate all the NTPs into two integrated Targeted
Programs starting 2016. For the purpose of the FSA, this consolidation will most likely have minimal impacts since
the participating institutions and the overall government fiduciary system will remain the same. Any necessary
assessment should it be required will be done during Program implementation.

     achievement across the provinces is highly variable, with almost all low-performing
     provinces in the mountainous and poor areas.

39. Following lessons learned from the first two phases, NTP3 has been structured to support
    both water supply and sanitation (domestic and environmental sanitation), improve
    sustainability and assign clear responsibilities to MARD for water supply infrastructure and
    MoH for sanitation and hygiene. NTP3 has an increased focus on the sustainability of water
    systems, and IEC activities, and incorporates sanitation under the mandate of MoH.

40. Following the end of the NTP3 program period it is expected that the Government support
    to the activities under NTP3 would be continued for the period 2016-2020 with MARD as
    the lead agency. This support is expected to be implemented either as a stand-alone
    national program, or as a component under an umbrella National Target Program
    incorporating multiple sectors.

Result-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply PforR (the ‘Program’)

41. The approach taken under the Program is to strengthen the Government of Vietnam’s NTP3
    in the 193 provinces of the NM-CH regions with the lowest sanitation coverage to support
    the existing efforts of the government to scale up access to sanitation and improved
    hygiene practices. The RB-SupRSWS Program will include interventions to support demand
    generation through innovative approaches in behavior change communication at the local
    level, coupled with national-level interventions to build awareness of the importance of
    sanitation to the national economy and obtain public commitment at the highest level.
    Support will also be provided to strengthen the supply chain to improve the design,
    availability and affordability of sanitation products and services. Participative approaches
    will be used at all levels in order to ensure that interventions are appropriate and effective.
    Construction of new sanitation and water supply facilities will facilitate improved hygiene
    practices, and will not be implemented as a standalone intervention. Behavior change
    communication programs would both work through nutrition programs and also reinforce
    them. Technology used will be appropriate, cost effective and accessible for poor
    households. The Program will also support the provision of sanitation, hygiene and water
    supply services to schools and health clinics through the construction of facilities and
    strengthening the management model for sustainable operation and maintenance of the
    system.

42. The institutional and financing arrangements will be aligned with the structures of
    GoV. Funds will pass from the center to the PPCs in the 19 recipient provinces. Fund

  During negotiations, the Government of Vietnam requested the inclusion of two additional provinces in the Program; Ninh Thuan and Binh
Thuan. The Bank agreed to the inclusion of these two additional provinces. Following this agreement, the Bank carried out a further desk-based
fiduciary assessment of Ninh Thuan and Binh Thuan. The fiduciary aspects of the Program relating to Ninh Thuan and Binh Thuan provinces,
were found to be consistent with those identified through the findings of the initial assessment of the 19 original provinces. The fiduciary
recommendations, the risk rating and the inputs to the Program Action Plan from this assessment are therefore considered to be appropriate
for all of the provinces under the Program including Ninh Thuan and Binh Thuan.



                                                                     18

   allocations will be made on the basis of provincial plans and within the framework of
   NTP3. These funds will be used to finance NTP3, including water supply, sanitation and
   hygiene promotion. It will be the responsibility of the PPCs in each of the 19 recipient
   provinces to plan investments and allocate funding to the appropriate technical
   departments at that level in accordance with the inter-ministerial guidelines. For national-
   level activities, funding for the Program will be allocated by the MoF to the related
   ministries. The amount of funds allocated to different ministries under the Program will be
   based on the anticipated funds required to achieve the DLI targets as well as the amounts
   corresponding to the DLI results that are verified as completed.

43. The Program will be designed in coordination with existing socio-economic, rural
    development programs and activities managed by other line Ministries. In order to
    effectively implement the Program and target remote regions, effective and multi-sectoral
    approaches to commune-wide sanitation will need to be developed. Linkages with the
    health and education programs and with nutrition will be key given the links between poor
    sanitation and stunting and the need to develop a sustained system. Schools, in particular,
    will be a critical focal point for developing an integrated strategy. For integration strategies
    with nutrition, synergies can specifically be found in the outreach programs to mothers and
    care-givers.

Institutional Arrangements

44. Launching a national program for sanitation requires high level coordination and
    cooperation between Ministries and different levels of Government. Steering committees
    will be required at the National and Provincial level to support this process. The
    arrangements are described below:

      MARD will coordinate the implementation of the Program, through a national steering
       committee comprising MARD, MoH, MoET, CEMA, MPI and MoF.

      At the central level, VIHEMA will be the technical lead for the sanitation and hygiene
       promotion activities. NCERWASS will lead activities relating to community water supply.
       A strong coordination mechanism will be needed in order to promote integrated water
       and sanitation projects to support hygiene practices.

      MARD and MoH will establish preparation teams which will be fully empowered to work
       intensively with the Bank to prepare the Program. Fully empowered and autonomous
       Program Management Units (PMUs) will be established nationally and at VIHEMA in
       order to monitor and support implementation in all Provinces under the Program.

      PPCs will lead provincial-level steering committees for coordination and supervision
       comprising DoH, PCERWASS, DoET, DPI, DoF and CEMA. PCERWASS would be the
       program owner at the Provincial level.

Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                           FSA


      Multi-sectoral links will be established including with CEMA to support with knowledge
       on EMs and with MoET to provide support for activities in schools.


45. The Program will learn from global and Vietnam-specific experience, and the proposed
    program would have the following three closely interrelated elements corresponding with
    the projects under the RWSS NTP3, which support delivery of behavior change
    communication, provide basic services and infrastructure to support behavior change,
    support sustainable services, and build capacity:

   a. Rural domestic water supply and rural environment
           Provision of hygienic sanitation, hand washing facilities and adequate water supply
            in schools – including consideration of the needs of all children – and support for
            putting in place the system for operation and maintenance of the facilities;
           Increasing water supply coverage for villages – using small-to-medium sized
            community-based systems – focusing on rehabilitation and extensions from
            existing systems. New water supply schemes would be constructed as required
            using appropriate technology. Investments would be demand responsive and
            would balance willingness to pay with prioritizing areas with higher levels of
            poverty; and
           Provision of TA for improved operation and maintenance procedures, management
            and tariff collection, and accounting procedures at village/commune levels. The
            role of PCERWASS in supporting this process, specifically in their technical
            backstopping role for community based systems, will be strengthened.
   b. Rural sanitation and hygiene
           Provision of hygienic sanitation, hand washing facilities and adequate water supply
            in health clinics – along with support for putting in place the system for operation
            and maintenance of the facilities;
           Support for scaling up domestic hygiene and sanitation to achieve Commune Wide
            Sanitation:
              (i) Demand side interventions would be implemented through existing
                  channels, including clinics, schools, government health system staff, and
                  traditional leadership structures. In addition, at the village level, local leaders
                  along with the women’s union and commune and village health workers
                  would be supported with new tools and to adapt existing approaches, such
                  as CATS, which have demonstrated effectiveness. Counseling of mothers and
                  caregivers in clinics would also support scaling up existing successful
                  programs combating malnutrition;
              (ii) Supply side interventions such as support to the private sector to strengthen
                   the capacity of local builders, manufacturers and suppliers of sanitation

                                                20
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                       FSA


                  products and services, in order to supply a menu of affordable and
                  appropriate household sanitation and hand washing hardware options and
                  services. The intervention will build on the work already being done by
                  VIHEMA and other Development Partners.
              (iii) Additional targeted support to households for latrine construction with
                    affordable technology options and potentially strengthening micro-financing
                    through Vietnam Bank of Social Policy (VBSP). This intervention would also
                    identify how to improve the delivery of the existing subsidy systems for poor
                    households (e.g., as rebates directly to households or voucher systems to be
                    redeemed at local sanitation suppliers).


   c. Capacity building, communication and supervision, monitoring and evaluation of NTP3
            Focused capacity building of national, provincial and local agencies involved in the
             Program to develop their implementation and management capacity and improve
             inter-sectoral collaboration, including: (i) capacity to promote hygienic behavior
             change and provide sustainable sanitation services; (ii) planning, monitoring,
             evaluation and reporting; and (iii) supporting improved environmental, social and
             fiduciary systems;
            Policy support where needed, for example to enhance the role of PCERWASS in
             supporting institutional capacity development at the commune levels, for school
             WASH, water pricing framework and development of sanitation markets;
            Improving sustainability of access to sanitation and improved water supply
             through technical assistance for community management and support to
             PCERWASS and DoH/DoET;
            Verification of Program Results and External Audit of the Program by the
             Independent Verification Agent; and
            Launch of a national and provincial high-level advocacy campaign to raise the
             political profile of sanitation and hygiene.



Financing and program costs

46. The budget for the NTP3 Program at the national level is VND 27,600 billion (US$1.3 billion).
    The main sources of funding are the central government (49 percent - directly or through
    the provision of concessional credit to users), provincial governments (11 percent), donors
    (30 percent) and users (10 percent).

47. In the 19 provinces supported by the Program, the total scale of the financing is estimated
    to be US$300 million. Within this context, the GoV seeks an IDA Credit at an indicative
    funding level of US$200 million, or 15 percent of the overall NTP3 Program.

   B. Institutional Framework and Fiduciary Arrangements under the Program

Planning and Budgeting

48. The NTP Standing Office has developed an overall proposal for NTP3, for the entire period
    2012 – 2015, that has been approved by the NA and the Prime Minister. The overall budget
    presented by NTP3 includes all sources of funds (central, local, donors, community and
    private sector) needed for program delivery. The total budget for NTP3 is broken down into
    sub-components: investment for water supply, investment for sanitation and environment,
    and recurrent expenditures. More detailed breakdowns, such as budget by province, by
    sub-project, by activities, by spending unit and by year, are not yet reflected in the NTP3
    proposal.

49. Provinces, under the leadership of the PPC, play the key implementing role in the program.
    To carry out this role, the PPC assigns responsibility to one of its subordinate units to
    prepare an implementation plan for the NTP program conducted in the province, as part of
    the provincial overall five-year plan and covering activities in rural water supply, rural
    sanitation and communication. This process of provincial budget proposal is demand based.
    In most provinces, the PCERWASS is given that responsibility in coordination with DOH and
    DoET. The participation of health and education sectors in this planning process is rather
    limited, especially since the two sectors do not usually have a list of capital expenditure
    projects to be prioritized for fund allocation. The implementation plan becomes the basis
    for preparation of the proposed NTP annual budget proposal. This annual budget proposal
    is reviewed by the provincial DoF and provincial DPI prior to submission for PPC approval
    before being submitted to the NTP Standing Office as the basis to request an allocation of
    NTP central budget resources for the coming year. In parallel, DOH also reports to VIHEMA
    on the proposed budget for the rural sanitation and communication. In NTP3, Provinces
    typically submitted annual plans that would need much more resources than they know to
    be available, and received annual budget allocations of 30 – 50 percent of their request.

50. The budget allocation from the central government, however, is based on the availability of
    funds. NTPSO, after receiving budget proposal from all provinces, will call for a joint
    meeting among line ministries – MARD, MoH and MoET. The consolidated NTP3 annual
    budget proposal submitted by NTPSO to MPI is detailed by province and by sub-project
    (water supply, sanitation and communication), with substantial cut down from provincial
    budget proposals based on limited availability of fund as determined by MPI. VIHEMA also
    go through the same procedure with MoH for its annual budget. All the budget proposals
    from NTPSO and ministries are sent to the National Assembly (NA) for approval. Upon
    approval by the NA of the NTP budget, the Prime Minister authorizes MPI to announce the
    budget allocation for capital expenditures to PPCs. MOF is authorized to announce the
    budget for recurrent expenditures.
                                              22
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                               FSA



51. Once budget reconciliation has been completed at the national level, each ministry and
    province is informed of the amount of the funding allocated to them, including the NTP
    allocation. Normally, the approved annual budget allocation is only around 30 to 50 percent
    of the proposed amount. So upon receiving the figures, PPC informs PCERWASS and other
    spending units (DoH, DoET and districts) of the amount of budget allocated and then works
    with them to revise their initial plan and to allocate the available budget to each activity and
    sub project. As long as the chosen activities fall within the scope of the annual plan
    presented to MPI, the allocation of the budgeted resources is at PPC discretion, without any
    further intervention from central government. VIHEMA also does the same among its
    departments.

52. The overall expenditure framework is described in detail in the Technical Assessment. The
    government has in place budget and expenditure management systems and practices that
    support the NTP in reaching its expected results. Key issues to be addressed within the
    Program design and agreements include reducing delays in budget approval, better linking
    annual budgeting and planning process to multi-year plans and overall targets, increasing
    the current limited spending on software, specifically hygiene and sanitation promotion
    activities, and O&M components to increase effectiveness and sustainability of services, and
    financing mechanisms to reach the poor. Improvements are planned and expected through
    various measures taken by the government, which will be enhanced through the PforR
    Program.

53. In terms of budget sufficiency it should be noted that Budget allocations to VIHEMA for
    implementing the sanitation component of the NTP have declined since 2011, with a very
    significant fall in budget and expenditure from 2012 to 2013. Table B.1 below shows funding
    for the NTP has reduced from 8.4 trillion VND in 2011 to 6.6 trillion VND in 2013. While
    central funds and international grants remain relatively constant, the cash and in-kind
    contributions of local residents have declined. On the other hand, allocations by provinces
    has increased to 0.85 trillion VND in 2013. There are significant fluctuations for some
    provinces in the funds received from central level over the period 2010-2014, for water
    supply and sanitation/IEC.

Procurement

54. Upon finalizing the provincial plan within the allocated budget, the PPC also assigns the
    investment responsibility within the province. In NTP1 (2001-2005) implementation was
    highly decentralized. The investment owner role was mostly assigned to district and
    commune levels and consequently procurement was carried out by these levels. The
    completed works (rural water supply schemes) were then operated and managed by the
    districts or communes. However, experience showed that districts or communes lacked the
    necessary technical and program management capacity to efficiently implement and
    manage the investments.

55. Drawing the above lesson learned, in NTP2 (2006-2010), the implementation responsibility
    was generally given to PCERWASS under the overall coordination, management and
    oversight of National Center for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (NCERWASS, housed in
    MARD). PCERWASS functioned as agencies reporting to the provincial DARD for rural water
    supply component. PCERWASS also acted as program owners. They implemented the
    subprojects within the investment plan, including carrying out procurement and managing
    contract implementation. For operation and maintenance of the resultant water supply
    schemes, PCERWASS took responsibility for major facilities, while smaller water systems
    were handed over to beneficiaries (typically communes) to operate. Most PCERWASSs are
    judged to have good technical and management capacity. In carrying out their procurement
    function, they have acquired a good knowledge of procurement requirements through long
    experience in handling Government-funded procurement, such as the Public Procurement
    Law. For rural sanitation and communication, at central level VIHEMA will play the role of
    coordination and management. VIHEMA is judged to have good technical and management
    capacity for the required goods and services, thanks to its involvement in the first PforR
    operation. The construction and consultancy packages typically managed by VIHEMA vary
    from US$3-4M in value although they have managed contracts of up to US$27M for
    equipment and facilities under a previous Asian Development Bank funded project. VIHEMA
    also has experience in procuring national-level media packages for behavior change
    communication including under the Vietnam Hand-washing Initiative. At provincial level,
    however, as mentioned above, procurement activities of health and education sectors by
    DoHs and DoETs are rather small due to limited budget allocation. Nevertheless, DoHs and
    DoETs have benefited from procurement training courses organized at the central and
    provincial level to familiarize themselves with procurement procedures set forth in the
    relevant laws and regulations.

56. Procurement under NTPs is governed by national procurement laws and regulations.
    Specifically, the procurement done before April 2006 was governed by, in turn, Decrees
    88/1999/ND-CP dated September 1, 1999; Decree 14/2000/ND-CP dated May 5, 2000 and
    then Decree 66/2003/ND-CP dated June 12, 2003. The procurement implemented after
    April 2006 has been subject to the Procurement Law No. 61/2005/QH11 dated November

                                             24
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                                      FSA


    29, 2005, Law No. 38/2009/QH12 on Amendments to the Procurement Law dated June 19,
    2009 and subsequent implementing Decrees (including Decree No. 111/2006/ND-CP, dated
    September 29, 2006; Decree No. 58/2008/ND-CP dated May 5, 2008; and Decree
    No.85/2008/ND-CP dated October 15, 2009). The new Public Procurement Law
    No.43/2013/QH13 (approved by National Assembly on November 26, 2013, and became
    effective on July 1, 2014); and Decree No. 63/2014/ND-CP (dated June 26, 2014 became
    effective on August 15, 2014 will govern all procurement activities under on the concerned
    Program.

57. A review of the new Public Procurement Laws and the new Decree found that they: (a)
    require procurement planning to be prepared and approved in a timely manner with proper
    linkage to budget availability; (b) mandate open competitive bidding as the default
    procurement method and provide detailed procedures for open competitive bidding; (c)
    provide a reasonably clear allocation of responsibilities and accountabilities to the procuring
    entities, employers and project owners; and (d) provide sanctions against unacceptable
    practices including fraud and corruption. In addition, the Government will issue the
    Harmonized NCB Bidding Documents for Goods and Civil Works (including forms and
    templates of contract) and bid evaluation templates, which have been drafted and agreed
    with MDBs, expectedly by mid of the year 2015 for use by procurement practitioners. The
    Decree on Selection of Contractors, which was officially issued on June 26, 2014, however
    does still propose to allow an automatic use of direct contracting and single sourcing for
    small contracts below certain monetary thresholds.4

58. The open competitive bidding procedures described in the procurement laws and
    regulations generally adequately accommodate transparency, economy and efficiency of
    the procurement process. An open competitive bidding for civil works typically includes the
    following steps and requirements:

59. Preparation of bidding documents. Bidding documents should be prepared using the
    templates issued by MPI. Bidding documents should clearly state bid evaluation and
    qualification criteria and contain no restrictions. Bidding documents must be approved by a
    competent agency before issuance;

60. Advertising of bidding opportunity. Invitation for bids must be advertised in the Public
    Procurement Newspaper, which is available nation-wide, for three consecutive issues and
    published on the MPI’s public procurement website (muasamcong.mpi.gov.vn). Bidding
    documents can be sold (at maximum VND2 million or US$90 for one set) or released free of



4
 The Decree on Selection of Contractors proposes a threshold of VND 1 billion for goods and works (US$48,000)
and VND 0.5 billion for consulting services (US$ 24,000) may be procured through direct contracting. Compared to
the thresholds in the existing laws and regulations, these thresholds are substantially lower than those under
earlier laws and decrees, meaning more mandatory use of competitive bidding for the Program.

   charge to interested bidders three days after the advertising date. The laws and decrees
   prohibit any practices to restrict bidders from access to bidding documents;

61. Preparation, submission and receipt of bids and bid opening. Bidders shall be given at least
    20 days for preparation of their bids counting from the date of bidding document issuance.
    Upon the deadline for bid submission, the procuring entity shall immediately open all bids
    received in the presence of bidders’ representatives. The procuring entity shall read out
    bidders’ names, bid prices and discount offers and other important information; prepare
    the minutes of bid opening and send a copy to each participating bidder;

62. Evaluation of bids. The laws require that bid evaluation must be completed within 45 days
    after the date of bid opening. Extension of bid validity is permissible but not exceeding 20
    days. Evaluation of bids includes three main steps: (a) preliminary examination, which
    includes the checking on eligibility, bid security, bidder’s experience and qualifications; (b)
    detailed evaluation, which includes evaluation of technical responsiveness and calculation
    of evaluated bid prices through error corrections, adjustments, and discount application;
    and (c) ranking of responsive bids to determine the top ranked bid for contract award
    consideration. The laws permit: (a) the use of a merit point (scoring) system for technical
    evaluation of bids in addition to a pass and fail methodology; and (b) one stage two
    envelops for contract above US$1 million. This technical scoring methodology may be
    subjective and misused;

63. Contract award, negotiations and signing. The laws require that to be selected for contract
    award, the bidder must: (a) have submitted an eligible, qualified, and technically responsive
    bid; (b) have the lowest corrected price or lowest evaluated bid price; and (c) have the
    proposed contract price not exceeding the approved pre-bid cost estimate. The procuring
    entity will negotiate and sign the contract with the selected bidder based on the contract
    form included in the bidding documents and the selected bidder’s bid; and

64. Publication of contract award. After the contract is awarded, the procuring entity shall
    publish the contract award information in the Public Procurement Newspaper. Information
    to be published includes name and descriptions of the contract, name of the successful
    bidder, and contract price.

65. In case of open competitive bidding for consulting services, the procuring entity shall
    advertise in the Public Procurement Newspaper to seek consultants’ interests; establish a
    shortlist of at least three qualified firms, prepare bidding documents using the MPI’s
    templates, issue the bidding documents to shortlisted consultants and give them at least 10
    days for preparation of proposals; receive proposals and immediately open the technical
    proposals; score technical proposals against prescribed evaluation criteria; publicly open
    the financial proposals of those consultants who secure the minimum technical score and
    conduct financial and final evaluation to determine the highest ranked consultant;
    negotiate and sign the contract with the selected firm and publish the contract award in the
    Public Procurement Newspaper.

66. The Procurement Law requires that procurement plans shall be approved by competent
    agencies after the approval of investment decisions or they can be approved at the same
    time as the approval of investment decisions where conditions allow. The Law also requires
    that procurement plans shall be prepared for the entire projects except where conditions
    do not suffice. Procurement plans must be prepared based on the availability of project
    funding sources. The Law further stipulates that procurement packaging shall be done
    based on technical nature and implementation sequence to ensure no restriction of
    prospective bidders’ participation, and to ensure the consistency of contract
    implementation with overall project implementation. It also prohibits any practices to
    willfully divide procurements into small contracts in order to enable the use of direct
    contracting methods. Procurement and contract management documents are required by
    law to be maintained for 10 years (from the date of work completion).

67. The Government has detailed regulations and a complex cost norm system for cost
    estimation. For works under the Program, detailed cost estimates will be prepared based on
    cost norms that are established by respective provincial departments (normally
    departments of construction) based on the Ministry of Construction (MOC)’s norms on
    construction inputs (standardized consumption of material, labor, and construction
    machinery for a unit of a work item) and local prices of such inputs. These cost norms are
    required to be regularly updated (normally on a quarterly basis). Cost norms for works may
    be comparable to the market prices if they are updated in a timely manner. Costs for
    detailed designs and construction supervision are estimated based on a fixed percentage of
    the total construction costs. This fixed percentage is regulated by MOC and varies by types
    and total costs of construction works. For example, the “percentage norm” for technical
    design of civil works with a cost estimates ≤ VND 7 billion is 1.88 percent while the
    percentage norm for construction supervision for those works is 2.628 percent.5

68. For the purpose of procurement planning, several rounds of cost estimation will be
    conducted with different level of accuracy. Preliminary estimates are used for preparation
    of initial procurement plans, budget allocation, etc. Before a particular contract is invited
    for bids, PCERWASS /DoH will prepare the contract’s detailed cost estimate based on
    detailed designs of the works. This detailed cost estimate is considered the contract’s ceiling
    and is used for the purpose of bid evaluation and contract award, and is subject to appraisal
    and approval by relevant government agencies. Under direct contracting arrangements, this
    ceiling is used to negotiate price and bidders are normally asked to voluntarily offer a
    discount of a few percent below the established ceiling. Under open competitive bidding,
    bids offering prices above the approved cost estimate are rejected.

69. While procurement planning is a mandatory requirement at the level of the individual
    investment, there are no comprehensive procurement plans at a provincial or program

5
    Based on MOC’s Decision 957/QD-BXD dated September 9, 2009.


                                                     27
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                      FSA


   level. Instead, under NTP each water supply scheme is considered as a single self-standing
   sub-project with its own procurement plan. Additionally, there is weak or no integration
   between procurement planning and budgeting and financial management for the province.
   This echoes the lack of integration between the multi-year output plans and the annual
   budgeting process described in the previous section. As with budgeting, the program would
   benefit from strengthened procurement planning to, at a minimum, formulate medium-
   term investment plans for water and sanitation within the provinces.

70. For each approved investment, the draft procurement plan is based on the program
    proposal including a design and cost estimate that had been appraised by relevant
    provincial departments such as the Department of Construction (DOC) or DPI and then
    approved by the PPC. However, the procurement plan can only formally be prepared once
    the budget has been allocated for it. Once approved by the PPC, the procuring entities have
    to implement the plan as approved. Procurement plans will be updated if there are
    substantial changes or modifications during implementation.

71. Fund Flow. NTP funds flow from Government Budget to the ultimate beneficiaries through
    the State Treasury system, in parallel to the budget allocation. Based on the revised plan
    approved by the PPC, implementing units conduct NTP activities. After expenditures are
    incurred and work completed, contractors/suppliers send supporting documents and
    request for payment to implementing units. Implementing units review and transfer to
    provincial State Treasury to verify and make payments to contractors/ suppliers. NTP funds
    flow from the National State Treasury to provincial State Treasury. The MoF recognizes the
    need to secure Program fund in a special deposit account in State Treasury at provincial
    level, to manage proper budget allocation, execution and reporting of the provinces. Funds
    transferred from MoF to provinces are performance-based, resulted from the amount the
    provinces are entitled to request for advance and the amount reimbursed for DLIs achieved
    and verified. Funds transferred from provincial main deposit account to sub-accounts of
    implementing agencies follow the same principles.

Control, Reporting, and Auditing

72. With respect to the law on control, reporting and auditing, expenditures of the State budget
    must be controlled before, during and after payment. In order to be paid, expenditures
    must be listed in the approved budget estimates, in line with standards and norms of the
    State, approved by the authorized officer of the spending unit, and must have adequate
    supporting files and documents.

73. Budget spending units are required to open an account at the State Treasury and the
    financial agencies and the State Treasury control compliance with budget execution. The
    State Treasury has the power and responsibility to determine which payments can be
    legitimately made from the State budget. The Treasury system is the main source of control
    over expenditures, with Treasury records being reconciled and the SAV providing assurance
    of the accuracy of Treasury financial data.

                                              28
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                       FSA



74. According to the State Budget Law, budget expenditures should be directly paid by the
    State Treasury to suppliers and beneficiaries. An exception to this principle is made for
    administrative expenditures with a value less than VND 5 million (US$250 equivalent) and
    other special expenditures. For transactions of this size, cash payments remain common in
    Vietnam. For these small expenditures, advances of funds are made to the spending units,
    which then make payments to the suppliers or beneficiaries and subsequently submit
    supporting documentation to the State Treasury. The State Treasury then verifies and
    records the actual expenditures against the relevant advances. This practice is expected to
    be applied for the Program soft activities in sanitation and hygiene promotion component.

75. The Accounting Law, which was approved by the NA in 2003 and became effective as of
    January 1, 2004, governs the financial accounting and reporting for government and its
    entities at all levels. The Law: (a) defines applicable principles and requirements and the
    scope of accounting; (b) prescribes the types of accounts, chart of accounts, financial
    statements, their disclosure and publication, their audit and inspection; and (c) assigns to
    the MOF the responsibility for formulating accounting standards in conformity with
    international financial reporting standards. An important provision of this law is the
    requirement for all spending units to publish their annual financial statements within 30
    days of the date of approval by relevant authorities.

76. The 2005 State Audit Law requires internal auditing to be implemented in every
    organization that uses State budget, funds, and assets, and empowers the SAV “to direct
    and instruct on the internal audit profession and operation, and on the use of internal audit
    results of agencies and institutions”. However, there are no implementation guidelines to
    clearly define the internal auditing functions, roles and responsibilities, and currently no
    active leadership on the implementation of internal auditing within the public sector.
    Internal audit function, therefore, does not exist in NTP3. For the ongoing RRWS PforR,
    MARD Inspectorate is performing this function for the Program as assigned by Minister of
    MARD and required by the Bank.

Governance and Accountability

77. The system of government in Vietnam is well established. Despite the recent
    decentralization of authority, Vietnam’s government structure remains strongly
    hierarchical, though with a number of parallel systems that may duplicate functions. This
    system contains the basic elements of good governance, including a separation of policy
    making, execution and oversight functions, both between and within levels of government,
    and a system of regular reporting to high levels of government. As elsewhere in the world,
    the form of local governance in Vietnam is evolving within ongoing state wide reforms, and
    this process will be assisted by the Program.

78. Legal Framework. Activities to prevent and combat fraud and corruption in Vietnam are
    governed by the 2005 Anti-Corruption (AC) Law, which introduces new approaches to

                                               29
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                        FSA


   anticorruption such as assets declarations for civil servants, job rotation, and a stronger
   focus on transparency. The law includes ambitious and all-embracing provisions on the
   prevention, detection, and handling of corruption, as well as the organization and
   mechanisms for concerned agencies (also including media, international organizations,
   etc.). The guideline for implementing the 2005 AC-Law was issued through Prime Minister’s
   Decision 30/2006/QD-TTg (6 February, 2006) and Resolution No. 4-NQ/TW (21 August,
   2006) of the Party’s Central Committee (Session X). The AC Law has recently been updated
   by the AC Law of 2012, even though the changes are not significant.

79. According to the 2005 Anti-Corruption Law, each province has established its own Anti-
    Corruption Committee, reporting to the PPC and the National Anti-Corruption Committee.
    The provincial Committee is chaired by the PPC chairman and includes members from the
    provincial level inspectorate, police, court, prosecutor and other related agencies. The
    Committee is operated through a standing office, which has a status equivalent to a
    provincial department.

80. The 2005 Anti-Corruption Law is also complemented and strengthened by the 2011 Laws on
    Complaints and Denunciations (Decrees 75/ND-CP and 76/ND-CP) which regulate the
    process and procedures of handling and settlement of complaints. While the process will
    be explored and analyzed in more details below, it is important to note the clarification of
    roles of different government bodies in charge of handling fraud and corruption complaints,
    as specified in Section 2 of this Law.

81. Another related legal document is the 2004 Law on Inspection which governs the extensive
    Government Inspectorate (GI) system of Vietnam. The key roles of the GIs are to: (a) carry
    out socio-economic inspections; (b) examine and inspect the settlement of citizen’s
    complaints and denunciations; and (c) detect corruption cases and recommend how to
    handle them. It is a multi-tiered system in respect to program financial management, with
    inspectorate bodies existing at the central, province and district administrative levels of
    government, together with specialist sector inspectorates at the central level (illustrated in
    the diagram below). Due to the establishment of numerous Inspectorates, their authority to
    process and settle complaints and denunciations are tightly defined vis-à-vis each other. If
    the denunciation does not fall under their jurisdiction, they must refer it to another
    authority.

82. The implementing units under the Program at the provincial-level PCERWASS, DoH, DoET)
    are therefore under direct line of inspection of:

           (a) Oversight ministry (MARD, MoH and MoET, respectively) and their Inspectorate;
           (b) Provincial Inspectorate under the Provincial People’s Committee;
           (c) Other provincial departments: of Planning and Investment (DPI), Finance (DoF),
               and Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) for PCERWASS; and
           (d) the Provincial Anti-corruption Committee.


                                               30
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                                        FSA


83. At the central level, VIHEMA is under direct line of inspection of MoH. However, the
    frequency of inspection visits is not the same across these implementing agencies,
    underlining a concern that some units seem not to receive adequate oversight from central
    and provincial bodies.




84. Complaints Handling Systems. According to the Law on Complaints and Denunciations and
    the Anti-Corruption Law, citizens can provide fraud and corruption complaints to various
    offices, but they can be summarized into two main channels: (a) the executive agencies
    including People’s Committee at the appropriate level; and (b) the GI agencies. In the
    Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program, complaints related to
    sub-project, which could include allegations of fraud or corruption, will most likely be
    submitted to the respective local governments (including the Provincial or District PC, the
    provincial DARD, DoH, and DoET), or directly to the GI of the MARD, MoH and MoET.

(i) Through the executive agencies6

6
 This term of “local executive agencies” refers to a number of institutions involved in the implementation of the
concerned activities, from the actual implementers (PCERWASS, DOH, DOET) to their supervising agencies (DARD,


                                                       31
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                                     FSA



       A complaint is often submitted in written format with full details of the complainant to
        the executive agencies through its Front Office or through the Citizen Receiving Unit
        (Phòng tiếp dân) which will also transfer to the Front Office to log and forward the
        complaint to a standing member of the agency leadership (Chairman or Vice Chairman
        of the PC, and Director/Deputy Director of the provincial departments). In addition to
        the written complaints channel, a complainant may also attend Meeting Sessions
        chaired by the leaders, held at least once or twice a month, to raise the issue. The
        complainants tend to use the same procedure to submit his/her complaint to various
        agencies to get their voice heard, but within this Program, the complaints will most
        likely be forwarded to the district PC for small cases/investments and PPC for the larger
        ones.
       Upon receiving the complaint, the designated leader will review and deem whether such
        complaint is within his authority or should be forwarded to an appropriate agency at the
        equal or higher level. If it is within his authority, he would demand explanation and/or
        clarification from respective unit or staff in charge of overseeing the concerned
        investment. Upon receiving the explanation from the concerned unit or individual, if the
        leadership considers the allegation credible, the agency Inspectorate will be asked to
        take the lead in the inspection. After this process, when crimes are alleged, the case file
        will be turned over to the police. If warranted the corruption charges can be brought by
        local prosecutors in Vietnam’s court system. Once the case is concluded, a formal
        response will be sent to the complainer to inform key results and decisions made. The
        formal response is required to be shared with the complainant within 45 days from date
        of receipt. If not satisfied with the decision, the complainant reserves the right to appeal
        through a similar process to the higher authority.

(ii) Through the Government Inspectorates

       In addition to this system for handling complaints, citizens can also submit fraud and
        corruption allegation to the MARD, MoH and MoET GIs. The inspectors reserve the
        rights to stop construction for investigation if they see any sign of fraud and corruption.
        Similar to the CPC's system, the Inspectorate pass on the case to the police and
        prosecutor once crimes are alleged. Both of these parallel complaints handling systems
        contain a reporting mechanism that can capture information on the number, type and
        handling of fraud and corruption allegations, which they periodically report up to the
        national level.
       As a result, there are multiple entry points for fraud and corruption allegations. Under
        the Program, such complaints would be most appropriately handled by the provincial
        GIs under DARD, DoH, DoET or the PPCs in the implementing provinces (although for
        VIHEMA it would go directly to the MoH GI). According to information provided by local

Provincial People’s Committee). For VIHEMA, the complaints can go to VIHEMA or MOH. All these institutions are
required to receive complaints and address them or forward them to the appropriate agency to address them.


                                                      32
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                                                                    FSA


           counterparts, regardless of where a fraud and corruption allegation comes in to the
           system, the receiving organization is charged with reviewing it and ensuring it gets to
           the office or agency with direct responsibility for the subject of the complaint (e.g.,
           procurement complaint, corruption in service delivery, etc.). In those cases where
           crimes are alleged, allegations can be passed to the local police and prosecutors for
           handling.
          Neither the existing 2005 Procurement Law nor the newly revised 2013 Public
           Procurement Law have a separate procedure for handling allegations of fraud and
           corruption in procurement7, although they include provisions on prohibiting fraudulent
           and collusive practices. Legally, procurement complaints can be handled in accordance
           with the procedures stated in Decree No. 85/2009/NĐ-CP that require complaints to be
           duly signed and stamped by a legitimate representative of the complaining bidder
           (anonymous complaints are not considered); for complaints related to contract award,
           the complainant must deposit a fee which will be cashed if the complaint is not
           substantiated. Complaints are handled by procuring entities or program owners and
           appeals are reviewed by a competent agency – normally the Provincial People’s
           Committee. This procedure appears to be rather rigid and to discourage complaints.

85. Anonymous complaints. According to the Law on Complaints and Denunciations, PCs or GIs
    are not required to handle anonymous complaints. The inability to submit anonymous
    complaints may be a disincentive for citizens to provide information about fraud and
    corruption in the Program. However, all participating PCs/GIs maintain the practice of
    accepting and logging these complaints for their record. The officials noted that if
    anonymous complaints contained credible or serious allegations the inspectors would
    investigate them fully. This lack of a clear and consistent affirmative policy and procedure
    for these complaints is a clear weakness in the Program’s complaints handling system.

86. Complaints consolidation under the Program. Under the Results-based Rural Water Supply
    and Sanitation Program under the National Target Program, the NTPSO of the NTP3 under
    MARD, which serves as the key implementing agency and coordinator for this Program, has
    been aggregating and informing the Bank of the number of fraud and corruption
    allegations, as well as how they are handled (investigated, mitigated and sanctioned). This
    model can be applied to the Program so that the information will be collected from each
    relevant PC and respective PCERWASS/DoH/DoET, VIHEMA, as well as from concerned GIs
    under MARD, MoH, MPI, MoF, and will be done at least annually.

87. Sanction and Debarment Process. The abovementioned Laws on Anti-Corruption, on
    Complaints, and on Denunciation also regulate sanctions in line with the outcomes of the
    investigation carried out in the complaints handling process described above. Contractors
    can also be sanctioned for multiple warnings of poor performance per the Procurement Law

7This is to distinguish fraud and corruption complaints with procurement petitions, for which the handling process is described in Integrity
Aspects in the Procurement Section of this Assessment



                                                                      33
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                         FSA


   (Art. 75(1) (c)). This provision provides significant discretion to the tendering authority to
   determine “poor performance” and if misused could lead to sanctions and debarments for
   reasons beyond violations of procurement rules and procedures or fraud and corruption.
   Counterparts met during field visits were often unable to tell the team whether there had
   been any “poor performance” debarments in previous infrastructure projects.

88. The outcomes of provincial/GI investigations are also reported to the provincial Department
    of Investment and Planning (DPI) for them to prepare the list of debarment, which is
    subsequently submitted to PPC / MPI on an annual basis. Provincial agencies said that they
    check the national debarred list of MPI / PPC when taking procurement decisions. There
    seemed to be a mix between “blacklisting” as a result of committing a fraudulent or corrupt
    act and “blacklisting” for the lack of technical performance. In the provinces we visited, the
    provincial agencies were not able to tell us about any recent examples of investigations
    and/or sanctions of serious fraud and corruption cases.

Experience under Past Bank Projects

89. Over recent years, the Bank has received several complaints related to collusion in water
    sector projects in Vietnam. It has not been possible to substantiate all the complaints but in
    each instance the Bank has worked with the client to review and resolve issues, mitigate
    risks and strengthen systems where necessary. Despite progress in program governance, it
    is acknowledged that some weaknesses remain.

90. Reviews by the Bank's Institutional Integrity Vice-Presidency (INTVP) have specifically found
    instances where firms have tried to take advantage of weak contract procurement and
    contract management capacity. In 2011, an international firm (Kellogg Brown and Root
    (KBR)) was debarred for two years for such practices in the Red River Delta Rural Water and
    Sanitation Project, implemented under MARD. The Bank found that this consultancy
    company had made deliberate misrepresentations in their bid in order to win a technical
    assistance contract and provided gifts to officials in the hope of influencing the process. The
    KBR case also uncovered multiple small payments made to local government officials by the
    consultant in connection with meetings and field surveys. Such payments should have been
    made in a more appropriate and transparent manner, indicating that projects must also pay
    more attention to the provision of necessary expenses and incentives.

91. Several previous allegations and reviews have indicated a lack of competition in the
    construction industry either due to collusion or due to the tendency for some SOEs to
    benefit from an unfair advantage. The size and influence of these SOEs can make it difficult
    for other local firms to win contracts and gain experience, creating a situation where it is
    difficult for the contractor pool to expand. Regulations aimed at preventing province-level
    agencies from hiring their dependent SOEs are not always followed.

   C. Program Fiduciary Performance

Planning and budget allocation

92. The planning and budget development process is very much input-oriented, rather than
    output- or outcome-oriented, resulting in a weak link between multi-year sector plans and
    strategies and the annual budget. Although the overall program has clear output goals,
    those multi-year targets do not translate into annual proposed investment plans that are
    informed by information sharing among finance and treasury offices, provinces, and line
    ministries and spending units. Without clear guidance on likely national government budget
    availability for a given year and, for some provinces, weak analytical capacity, the tendency
    is to submit annual budget requests that are much higher than the national budget can
    afford. The budget estimates typically lack clarity as to purpose, tasks and priorities. Budget
    negotiations themselves focus predominantly on controlling budget numbers rather than on
    allocating resources efficiently and strategically. In the ongoing Bank- financed RRWS PforR,
    the provinces prepare budget proposal based on the amount of funds required to complete
    the expected DLIs, the entitled advance amount and entitled disbursement received for the
    achieved and verified DLIs in the last period. With high level of certainty of that information,
    the weaknesses in current NTP3 budgeting process are mostly addressed.

93. Due to the lack of funds and the usual budget revision process, the final annual budgets for
    NTP in some provinces are approved very late, causing delay to provincial NTP activities.
    Budget for 2014 was allocated by Yen Bai PPC in February 2014 and by Dak Lak PPC in April
    2014. MOH normally approves budget for all programs and projects in April of the year and
    MARD - in February.

94. This full decentralization of budget allocation to PPC created a practice in NTP3, especially
    in the low income provinces as Central Highland and Northern Mountains, that: i) almost all
    NTP funds are allocated by PPCs to water supply component while sanitation and
    communication do not usually receive adequate priority and resources; and ii) the
    implementation of investment is mostly assigned to district and commune government
    instead of provincial technical agencies as PCERWASS and DoH, leading to poor
    performance in both investment and operation of water supply schemes and low quality
    communication activities. For this Program, the earlier differences between provincial
    budget proposals and centrally provided funds will be addressed through an improved
    provincial planning process, complemented by a national inter-ministry (MARD, MoH and
    MoET) guidance based on annual Program entitled withdrawal that have a high degree of
    certainty. There will be a Program Action Plan to require timely and appropriate budget
    allocation by PPCs, including adequate allocation to behavior change communication as
    indicated in inter-ministry guidance. Implementation arrangement with main focus on
    PCERWASS and DoH for provincial activities will be provided in the Program Appraisal
    Document.

95. Costing. Cost estimates for works and consulting services are calculated using the
    government’s cost norms. For works under the program, cost norms are established by
    relevant departments (normally DoC) based on MoC’s norms on construction inputs
    (standardized consumption of material, labor, construction machinery for a unit of a work
    item) and local prices of such inputs. These cost norms are regularly updated by each
    province (normally on a quarterly basis). Cost norms for detailed designs and construction
    supervision are calculated as a fixed percentage of the total construction costs. These
    “percentage norms” are also regulated by MoC, currently being less than 2 percent for
    detailed design and less than 3 percent for construction supervision for works of similar size
    and nature. Although over design of water supply schemes using unnecessarily high
    specifications is an issue in Vietnam, in contrast to this, the cost norms are considered to be
    unreasonably low and in many cases affect the quality of the services provided which in
    turn affects implementation. Experience in Bank-funded water supply projects show that
    the actual costs for detailed design and construction supervision approximately account for
    7-9 percent of total construction costs, while the government’s cost norm system only
    allows 4-5 percent. However, some of the risk that comes with these norms can be
    mitigated by the project owners. For example, detailed design may require test drilling or
    other work that can be a separate cost item from the design norm itself.

96. In terms of works, the government’s cost norms themselves appear to be generally
    reasonable and comparable to the local market. However, the total cost estimate of any
    particular works may easily become unrealistic and incommensurate with market prices as
    once approved it cannot be revised or updated despite the fact that the period of time from
    the preparation of a cost estimate until contract award is normally long. The government’s
    cost estimating methodology mainly considers direct costs (materials, labor, machine costs)
    and pays less attention to indirect costs (e.g., social and environmental protection). This
    may lead to inadequate cost estimates.

97. Final cost estimates are subject to appraisal and approval by relevant government agencies.
    Once they are approved, they would be considered contract ceilings and awards cannot be
    made above these ceilings. Under direct contracting arrangements, this ceiling is used to
    negotiate price and bidders are normally asked to voluntarily offer a discount of a few
    percent below the established ceiling. Under open competitive bidding, bids offering prices
    above the approved cost estimate are rejected. Overall, while this system seems to
    pragmatically control the risk of cost overruns, it poses a risk to the quality and timeliness of
    the program since if contractors and consultants are not allowed to have market-based
    contract prices, they may be unable to fully perform their contractual obligations, resulting
    in substandard quality of works or services delivered or delays in contract implementation.
    This then becomes a significant technical risk in the context of the program because poor
    quality or delays in implementation will inevitably lead to delays in achieving some DLIs.

Procurement Arrangements and Implementation

98. The open competitive bidding procedures described in the procurement law and regulation
    are found to generally adequately accommodate transparency, economy and efficiency of
    procurement process. The new Procurement Law mandates open competitive bidding as
    default method of procurement. Choice of other methods (including direct contracting, and
    competitive shopping) is allowed where open competitive bidding is not feasible. The law
    however permits direct contracting to be automatically used for contracts whose cost
    estimates are below the specified monetary thresholds [currently VND 1 billion (US$48,000)
    for goods, works, non-consulting and VND 0.5 billion (US$24,000) for consulting services
    according to the Decree on Selection of Contractors]. In practice, the permission of
    monetary thresholds-based direct contracting has caused excessive abuse through willful
    packaging into small-valued contracts. Under the Program, most major works contracts
    (about 90 percent) are expected to be procured under open competitive bidding given their
    nature and complexity. For consulting services assignments, as many of them could be of
    small monetary value, provinces should be encouraged to group them into a larger
    assignment to be procured through open competitive bidding.

99. The reviews of sample procurement transactions implemented by Program provinces under
    NTP found that the provinces have procedurally complied with the relevant laws and
    regulations. All procurement transactions were completed in a timely manner (1.5-2
    months). However, in terms of cost effectiveness and economy, only insignificant savings
    were achieved through these transactions (about 0.3-0.5 percent of the pre-bid cost
    estimate on average). This modest result was because of the overuse of direct contracting
    and the lack of effective competition in bidding processes. There were few contracts
    procured through open competitive bidding; each bidding transaction received only three
    to four bids with bid prices being rather close to each other.

100. The reviews, however, revealed a number of procurement issues and practices that
   could adversely affect the timeliness, cost-effectiveness, competitiveness and compliance
   with applicable rules of the Program. These are:
    Procurement plans are usually not prepared for the entire project or subproject but
      individual works. This piecemeal approach affects the timeliness of Program
      implementation and service delivery. In addition, there is a risk of willful splitting of
      works into small contracts for use of direct contracting which adversely impacts cost-
      effectiveness and competitiveness.
    The Procurement Law provides that in order for a bidder to be awarded the contract,
      that bidder must have a bid price not exceeding the approved pre-bid cost estimate.
      Though the Law does not explicitly state that bids offering prices higher than the
      approved estimate shall be rejected, there was a quasi-automatic rejection of such bids
      in practice without further evaluation of their technical and commercial proposals. Since
      it may be difficult to ensure the reasonableness of the cost estimate, this practice could
      lead to rejection of good bids or cause unnecessary rebidding.


                                              37
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                                                 FSA


        The Procurement Law provides that a bid shall be rejected only if it does not respond to
         major technical or commercial requirements of the bidding documents. The Law also
         permits bidders to clarify their bids (to the extent that do not substantially alter their
         bids) and requires that bid evaluation shall take into account such clarifications. These
         requirements are appropriate since there are rarely perfect bids without any deviations.
         However, there was a common practice in many procuring agencies of immediately
         rejecting bids with small insignificant errors or shortcomings (such as having some
         missing qualification documents, submission of non-notarized documents, etc.) without
         giving the bidders an opportunity to clarify the perceived issues. This practice could
         certainly result in the undue rejection of substantially responsive bids and reduce
         effective competition. Also one stage two envelope leads to a subjective rejection of
         bids.
        The Procurement Law provides that to be eligible to bid, a bidder shall be
         organizationally and financially independent of the Employer and not dependent on the
         same managerial agency as the Employer. While this provision is considered appropriate
         in order to prevent conflict of interest between bidders and project owners or procuring
         entities, it was found that there were cases where State-Owned Enterprises reporting to
         the project province’s People’s Committee still received awards of contracts procured by
         the same province. This practice could harm the integrity and fairness of procurement
         processes under the Program.
        The Procurement Law provides that firms and individuals debarred for their violation of
         the Law, including engagement in fraud and corruption shall not be allowed to bid. The
         Bank also maintains a similar list of debarred firms and individuals and its policy is not to
         permit such firms and individuals to participate in Bank-financed procurement.
         However, the Law does not recognize the Bank’s debarment list. This gap could lead to
         unexpected contract awards to Bank debarred firms or individuals under the Program
         which would be a serious violation of the Bank’s Anti-Corruption Guidelines for PforR
         operations.8

101. The above issues can be addressed through: (a) Program activities and agreed actions in
   the Program Action Plan; (b) through intensive capacity development measures to be
   carried out for Program entities, SAV, MPI Inspectorate, and other stakeholders; and
   (c) preparation and enforcement of a clear and hands-on Program Operational Manual.

102. MARD/MoH/ MoET are responsible for organizing such training courses as part of their
   capacity building responsibilities. Provinces should also hire qualified consultants to assist
   them in handling the procurement process. In addition, the Government has established an
   e-Government Procurement system (e-GP, available at muasamcong.mpi.gov.vn). This e-GP
   system allows procuring entities to electronically handle bidding process (e-tendering) in a

8
  Bullet (g), paragraph 6 of World Bank’s Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption on Program-for-Results
Financing dated February 1, 2012 requires the Borrower to “ensure that any person or entity debarred or suspended by the
Bank is not awarded a contract under or otherwise allowed to participate in the Program during the period of such debarment
or suspension.”



                                                            38
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                       FSA


   more transparent and fair manner with lower administrative costs. Program provinces
   should be encouraged to gradually adopt this electronic procurement system for the
   Program.

Contract Management Performance

103. Bidding documents, which follow MPI’s Model Bidding Documents, include a contract
   form. The most commonly used forms of contracts for works are lump sum and
   admeasurement (bill of quantities); meanwhile most consulting services contracts follow
   lump sum form. Prior to signing contracts, procuring entities conduct contract negotiations
   with the selected bidder to finalize contract details. Generally, contracts signed by the
   Program provinces were found to be consistent with the bidding documents. They contain
   key conditions and terms such as performance security, insurance, advance payment and
   progressive payments, completion dates, liquidated damages, safety and environment,
   warranty obligations, etc. These forms of contracts are assessed to be adequate to be used
   for the Program. However, in order to move forward to international practice, at present,
   Public Procurement Agency is cooperating with ADB and WB to draft the harmonized NCB
   bidding documents. These harmonized BDs are expectedly issued by mid of the year 2015
   and will be more appropriate to be used for the proposed Program.

104. One major challenge faced by PCERWASS /DoH/DoET is the extensive delay in
   implementation. It was reported that most contracts could not be completed within the
   contractual period, but had to be extended as long as twice the initial period or even longer.
   Three major reasons were: (a) the serious shortage of funds or unsystematic flow of funds
   from the program leading to frequent delays in payments to contractors, with no provision
   for compensation for delayed payments; (b) delays in construction of distribution systems
   to the household level due to social and administrative conditions (such as household
   willingness to connect, coordination with various local authorities, transport, and dyke
   safety); and (c) low-paid supervising consultants sometimes were not active in overseeing
   the contractor’s performance. A shortage of cash flow is assessed to be one of the biggest
   challenges to good contract management and timely delivery of works and services under
   the Program. To effectively address this challenge, Program provinces would have to ensure
   proper management of the advance disbursement and other partial disbursements as well
   as to find temporary funding sources. Another option that was considered is to partially
   transfer this risk to contractors by asking them to advance funds for construction. This
   option is not recommended as it has limited applicability and may impact the fairness of
   bidding, the contracting process and the quality of work produced.

105. Cost overruns rarely occurred since the program implementing agencies always
   managed to complete works within the agreed budget as it was difficult to obtain additional
   budget. Contract variations or changes were also often not handled promptly as required by
   the conditions of contract due to lack of budget. Contract disputes were resolved according
   to the government’s laws and regulations. In practice, if there were disputes, the program


                                               39
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                        FSA


   implementing agencies and contractors tried to resolve this through negotiations. No
   serious disputes requiring resolution by a court were reported.

Filing and Record Keeping

106. Transactions recording, filing of supporting documents, and preparing of financial
   reports are done by the investment owners or spending units of the NTP. Recording and
   Reporting systems vary among provinces and departments within the same province
   (manual, excel-based or automated software). The State Treasury of every province also
   records the expenditures of the NTP to their system on a cash basis, using TABMIS. A
   separate code is given by TABMIS to each program, project, and subproject, therefore the
   financial reports generated by State Treasury are detailed and comprehensive but exclude
   work completed but not yet paid, being a cash basis system. Filing and record keeping is
   identified as a minor weakness, but does not significantly affect implementation.

Staffing

107. Provincial PCERWASS, DoH, and DoET in charge of program coordination and
   implementation have a variable number of staff. Although the PCERWASS/DoH/DoET
   usually have units for Administration and Planning (includes accounting and M&E
   functions), Technical, and Construction Management, weak capacity has been reported in
   some areas, mainly in M&E, sanitation promotion and behavior change, supervision of
   designs and construction, and fiduciary issues. The capacity of the implementation units to
   prepare technical specifications for bidding documents, to conduct technical revisions, or to
   supervise works is varied at the provincial level. This is due to a combination of factors with
   more or less relevance depending on the province: low technical skills, insufficient staff and
   recurrent budget to adequately perform these tasks.

108. Generally, PCERWASS, DoH, DoET have adequate numbers of qualified procurement
   staff who have attended the necessary training, possess Procurement Certificates issued by
   MPI, and have gained good procurement experience. They were able to self-prepare
   bidding documents and carry out bid evaluation without external assistance.
   PCERWASS/DoH/DoET also have capable technical staff who usually provided assistance in
   bidding process and subsequently assume the responsibility for contract administration,
   construction supervision and even operation and maintenance of water supply facilities.
   The procurement work is generally carried out by the Planning and Technical Units.
   Standard bidding documents and contracts that are issued by MPI are used. Staff in districts
   and communes generally has weaker capacity than those of PCERWASS/DoH/DoET. That
   said, it was observed that in some cases preparation of the design and technical
   specifications was contracted out to consultants.

109. The financial management duties in PCERWASS, DoH and DoETs are performed by the
   Chief Accountants who have adequate experience and qualification to manage government
   budget expenditures. They are however normally overloaded with daily work of the entities

                                               40
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                      FSA


   plus various programs. In the proposed Program, PCERWASs will be responsible for
   consolidating annual provincial Program financial statements, working with State Audit of
   Vietnam, and consolidating Program annual plan and annual budget; therefore, additional
   resources and capacity building are to be provided to PCERWASS’ financial management
   personnel. Similarly, DoHs and DoETs will be responsible for financial management function
   of all sanitation and hygiene promotion activities in the provinces, including transactions
   incurred by woman union and village health workers, and therefore need additional
   resources and capacity.

Controls, Oversight and Accountability

110. Transactions recording, filing of supporting documents, and preparing of financial
   reports are done by the investment owners/spending units of the NTP (PCERWASS, DoH or
   Preventive Health Center, DoET and districts). Each investment owner/spending unit is
   wholly responsible for payments, bookkeeping and financial reports of the activities
   assigned by PPC in the provincial budget allocation. The investment owners approve
   payments to contractors and suppliers, submit documents to provincial/district State
   Treasury for disbursements, prepare financial reports when the construction is completed
   and gets it accepted by provincial DoF. Similarly, spending units of recurrent expenditures
   do the accounting work and prepare financial reports for their own part. The PCERWASS
   does not prepare consolidated financial reports for the provincial NTP expenditures.
   Reconciliation with State Treasury is also done by each delegated investment
   owner/spending unit.

111. Recurrent expenditures are accounted for in accordance with Decision 19 issued by
   Ministry of Finance for government administrative expenses. Capital expenditures are
   accounted for using Decision 214 issued by Ministry of Finance for investment owners.
   Those accounting policies are based on a modified cash basis. Financial statements for
   capital expenditures are not prepared annually, but only at the time when the construction
   is finished and accepted. The work in progress is not recorded. There are no consolidated
   financial statements for the entire NTP. There is no accounting function at the NTP Standing
   office.

112. There is still a gap in the timely of recording transactions, due to the cash-based
   methodology applied in the public accounts. For example, some revenue and expenditure
   amounts of one accounting year may be recorded in a different financial year (largely due to
   cash basis of accounting), leading to incorrect recognition of budget revenue, expenditure
   and deficits, and unreliable year-to-year comparisons of budget expenditures. The yearly
   recording of expenditures is ever more seriously distorted by the concept “budget year”, i.e.
   expenditures are recorded to the year of allocating related budget rather than the year of
   expenditure incurring. This practice does not happen in Northern Mountain provinces. But
   in Central Highland provinces, expenditures incurred in quarter II are still recorded to the
   previous year to maximize the budget execution ratio.


                                              41
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                          FSA


113. Official documents to guide the internal control of the NTP are issued by all levels, from
   Prime Minister, ministers of MARD, MPI and MoF, to head of the investment owners and
   spending units, covering various areas of operation. The ultimate responsibility of ensuring
   the NTP funds are used for the intended purposes rests with investment owners and
   spending units, which are typically PCERWASS, DoH and DoET in this case.

114. The second level of ensuring proper use of funds is expenditure verification done by the
   provincial State Treasury on every single payment from NTP funds. The State Treasury’s
   payment control is mainly documentation-based and the effectiveness of post-review
   procedures is limited by the lack of regular audit and inspections. It is difficult for the State
   Treasury to check if payment documentation is prepared by the spending units merely to
   withdraw money for purposes other than that of the activity for which the documentation is
   based. Pre-review of documentation for payment has been conducted by the State Treasury
   with some level of success, but the same is not true for the post-review procedure. The
   State Treasury can check the documentation sent by the spending unit, but it depends on
   auditing or inspection results by relevant authorities to know if the activity for which
   payment is made is actually implemented. However, the audits and inspections are not
   carried out on a regular basis, particularly in the case of small spending units. Also, a
   number of expenditure items are not based on expenditure norms, and hence the State
   Treasury does not have a basis for payment control. These factors limit the effectiveness of
   the Treasury payment control procedures. This practice will even face delay and confusion if
   the Program does not have a clear manual for the sanitation and hygiene promotion
   activities, which have significant amount of soft expenditures, including the cost norms and
   basis of payments.

115. The 37/2005 State Audit Law, Provisions 3 and 15, Articles 6 and 15 respectively, require
   internal auditing to be implemented in every organization using State budget, funds, and
   assets, and empowers the SAV “to direct and instruct on the internal audit profession and
   operation, and on the use of internal audit results of agencies and institutions”. However,
   there are no internal audit units within the 19 provinces where the NTP will be
   implemented; this creates a significant gap in the control framework of the program.

116. Inspections performed by Provincial Inspectorate, DPI, DoF and DARD are essentially
   input and compliance orientated with limited attention to identification of systemic
   improvements. The inspection missions do not produce statements or reports on the
   overall assessment of internal control systems, and the effectiveness of the inspection work
   seems limited due to lack of staff and resources together with lack of expertise in sound
   auditing practices.

117. The SAV is the Vietnamese Supreme Audit Institution (SAI). The SAV operates from a
   relatively clear statutory base. Although the Vietnamese constitution does not make
   reference to the state public audit, the State Audit Law passed by the NA on June 14, 2005
   which came into effect on January 1, 2006, created the legislative basis for the legal


                                                42
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                      FSA


   position, functions and working modalities of the SAV. The State Audit Law sets out
   principles on which the SAV should operate free of influence of the executive.

118. NTP3 has been audited by SAV annually. The audit focuses on financial, compliance and
   some particular aspects of performance (3E: economy, efficiency and effectiveness). The
   audits complied with the Vietnamese Standards of State Auditing. The audit reports of the
   provinces visited were issued by July in the year subsequent to the fiscal year audited,
   contained an evaluation of the eligibility of the funds used, the compliance with laws and
   regulations and to some extent, the effectiveness and efficiency of the program. Where the
   audit reports did not follow good practices and standards, they can be improved to a level
   acceptable by the Bank through an agreed audit TOR. SAV also is in process of issuing
   auditing standards in accordance with International Organization of Supreme Audit
   Institutions (INTOSAI), with support from the Bank IDF Grant and other donors.

119. Findings of auditors are followed up by provinces and the Standing Office. After
   provinces addressed the recommendations of the auditors, SAV was invited to check the
   status of implementation of recommendations. Workshops including SAV, the Standing
   Office, and the provinces are also regularly organized to disseminate the audit findings. The
   key issue for NTP3 is SAV only conducted audit for 20 – 25/ 63 provinces, and only give audit
   reports on the provinces they visited without any review of financial statements of other
   provinces. There are no consolidated program financial statements. In the ongoing RRWS
   PforR, as required by the Bank and NTPSO, SAV performed audit on 8/8 provinces and
   submitted the audit report on time for the financial year 2013.

Governance and Anti-Corruption

120. Complaints Handling Systems. While this multiple-entry complaints system may provide
   a number of options for citizens, it can also be confusing and result in complaints being
   passed around agencies or lost in the transfer process and can make it difficult for citizens
   to follow up. According to the MOH GI Report on the Handling of Complaints and
   Denunciations in 2013, only 209 out of 2,694 (or less than 8 percent) received complaints
   were within their authority. The rest were forwarded to the right agencies or returned to
   the complainant with instructions on which agency to submit to. Staffing in the province
   level GI offices varied greatly: some of the implementing provinces had sufficient staff to
   create a dedicated complaints handling office while others had as few as two or three
   inspectors at the DARD level that had to cover all GI functions including complaints
   handling. This lack of sufficient numbers of trained staff could become a constraint on the
   Program’s ability to collect, manage and investigate allegations in some provinces,
   especially if the number of cases would increase under the Program.

121. The inability to submit anonymous complaints due to their prohibition in the Law on
   Complaints and Denunciations may be a disincentive for citizens to provide information
   about fraud and corruption in the Program. However, as mentioned above, according to
   information provided by a number of the DARD and PCERWASS GIs, in practice these

                                              43
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                      FSA


   officials do accept and record anonymous complaints when they are received. The officials
   noted that if anonymous complaints contained credible or serious allegations the inspectors
   would investigate them fully. Notwithstanding the practical handling of anonymous
   complaints in some of the implementing provinces, the lack of a clear and consistent
   affirmative policy and procedure for these complaints is a clear weakness in the Program’s
   complaints handling system.

122. It is also important to note that, with regards to the quality of services, sometimes the
   citizens can provide direct feedback to PCERWASS or PMC for immediate action. For
   example, the Director of PCERWASS in Dak Lak Province publicizes his hotline number at
   water schemes under his authority so that citizens can call directly to report any issues,
   most often on the quality of services. While this channel is very helpful to resolve issues
   quickly, the complaints/feedback do not get captured systematically as a learning tool for
   PCERWASS to improve their services.

123. Complaints Consolidation and Reporting. The reporting system for the Government
   Inspectorate allows reporting up from districts and provinces to the State level GI. The GI
   system is hierarchical with lower levels reporting data and information on complaints and
   investigations up to higher levels until the information is aggregated at the State GI.
   According to a retired inspector from the State GI, the reporting system contains both
   routine and “urgent” reports each of which would contain details on the number and type
   of complaint, status of inspector’s investigations and ultimate resolution. The reports also
   provide explanations for those complaints that are not pursued.

124. Based on the team’s field visits there does not appear to be a single, unified reporting
   system for the GI data. Some provincial GIs told the team that information was kept
   manually in a log book, while others noted that results of investigations can be put on the
   provincial websites and are shared with the complainant (and summaries may be shared
   with other authorized “users” or “participants”, which could include the press).

125. The lack of a common, electronic reporting system across the implementing agencies
   may make it difficult for the borrower to meet the ACG obligation to inform the Bank of
   fraud and corruption allegations and report on how they are handled (investigated,
   mitigated and sanctioned). The use of written log books in some implementing provinces
   raises questions about the quality of the data collected. In addition, the team was unable to
   get agreement to share data on allegations from any of the provincial GI officials
   interviewed during the field visits. Notwithstanding the fact that the Anti-Corruption Law
   requires that the findings of corruption investigations be made public, it was clear that
   these officials felt they did not have the authority to commit to sharing this required
   information with the Bank team.

126. The MARD Program Standing Office, with assistance from donors of NTP2 (the DFAT,
   Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DANIDA) and the UK’s Department of International
   Development [DFID]), has built in the following key controls in operation and monitoring of

                                              44
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                        FSA


   the NTP to ensure achievement of the objectives: (a) annual audit by the SAV, with
   extended TOR covering not only financial figures but also the performance of audited
   provinces in achieving the NTP objective (12 indicators); (b) annual joint review of the NTP
   operation by donors in cooperation with MARD; and (c) regular progress meetings and
   training provided by the Standing Office to provinces to improve budgeting and to
   implement recommendations of SAV and the joint operational reviews. In addition, the
   State Treasury system provides a number of key controls in fund flow; and the various
   departments under PPCs (including the provincial Anti-corruption Committee) carry out
   internal inspection and supervision of the provincial NTP program.

127. Experience in the program. No cases of fraud and corruption under the program were
   reported so far. According to the Public Procurement Agency (PPA) at the central level and
   PCERWASS/DOHs no procurement complaints were recorded under the NTP program,
   either. However, experiences under other Bank-financed projects show that numerous
   allegations of fraud and corruption in procurement are made and have been received
   directly by the Bank. Most notable is the case under the Red River Delta Rural Water Supply
   and Sanitation Project in which a complaint to the Bank resulted in the sanctioning of an
   international firm for two years. In addition, during the preparation of this Fiduciary System
   Assessment, the health sector is investigating a corruption case in which a company is
   alleged to have been paid at least US$2.2 million in bribes to health officers at the national
   level for the medical equipment supply contracts. Although this case is not directly related
   to the Program, it underlines the importance to pay attention to the governance issues to
   avoid similar issues.

128. Based on discussion with provincial and national officials and former officials, the lack of
   fraud and corruption complaints in the national systems could be due to: (a) citizen’s lack of
   knowledge about the complaints system; (b) citizen’s lack of knowledge about their rights
   and service standards under the NTP; or (c) citizens are more concerned about issues such
   as set water fees or required contributions. Under the Anti-Corruption Law, decisions based
   on fraud and corruption complaints are to be made public but since there have been no
   corruption complaints under the previous NTP programs this process has not been tested.
   The lack of any past use of the complaints handling system during previous NTP
   implementation has meant that the team is unable to identify other gaps or weaknesses
   that may appear only during implementation of the system.

Sanctions and Debarment

129. Sanctions for non-procurement related fraud and corruption are handled under the
   Anti-Corruption Law and the Law on Complaints and Denunciations. In most cases, a GI
   office conducts the initial investigation and turns over the case file to the police if the
   investigation identifies a possible criminal violation. If warranted the corruption charges can
   be brought by local prosecutors in Vietnam’s court system. One commentator has noted
   that Vietnam, like other developing countries, lacks the necessary capacity and sufficiently


                                               45
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                       FSA


   trained and experienced staff in its anti-corruption bodies, police, prosecutors and courts to
   effectively and efficiently handle all corruption allegations.

130. Lists of debarment within a given province are prepared by the provincial DPI and are
   submitted to the PPC and MPI on an annual basis. Under the Law, bidders prohibited from
   tendering are listed in the tendering newsletter and on the tendering website controlled by
   the MPI. Provincial officials gave the team inconsistent information regarding whether
   tenders consistently refer to the MPI sources and the DPI lists to determine bidder
   eligibility. One Program should be to ensure the sharing and use of this information across
   provinces.

131. The PCERWASSs do not check the national debarred list of PPA when taking
   procurement decisions. There seemed to be a mix between “blacklisting” as a result of
   committing a fraudulent or corrupt act and “blacklisting” for the lack of technical
   performance. Under the Procurement Law, bidders can be sanctioned for multiple warnings
   of poor performance (Art. 75(1) (c)). This provision provides significant discretion to the
   tendering authority to determine “poor performance” and if misused could lead to
   sanctions and debarments for reasons beyond violations of procurement rules and
   procedures or fraud and corruption. PCERWASS and DARD counterparts met during field
   visits were often unable to tell the team whether there had been any “poor performance”
   debarments in previous water sector projects.

   D. Fiduciary Risks and Recommended Measures for Risk Mitigation

132. The fiduciary assessment identified the following key areas which need to be addressed
   to ensure that the program is able to reach its stated goals.

Planning and Budgeting

133. The risk for financial planning and budgeting cycle is assessed as Substantial before
   mitigation measures. With the implementation of the following actions, the residual risk can
   be assessed at Moderate: (a) The provincial annual budget proposals need to be realistic,
   follow the inter-ministry guidance on availability of fund and priority; (b) announcement of
   the budget centrally allocated to each province and line ministries, and the reallocation by
   PPC and line ministries to each investment owner/spending unit, each sub-project and
   activity needs to be completed in December of the previous year; c) Budget reallocation by
   PPC needs to be in line with the inter-ministry guidance with appropriate priority allocated
   to sanitation and hygiene promotion. Timely and appropriate budgeting process will be one
   of the Program Action Plan.

Bidding and Contracting

134. The procurement risk before mitigation is rated as Substantial and would be reduced to
   Moderate after mitigation.
                                              46
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                                                                 FSA



135. There are risks that existing procurement procedures and processes will result in a low
   level of competition in open competitive bidding that will impact on cost-effectiveness and
   competitiveness. Firstly, existing procedures and practices may lead to an unjustified
   rejection of bids due to minor deviations and omissions and as a result of bid prices
   exceeding cost estimates. Secondly, direct contracting procedures may be abused in ways
   that impact on cost-effectiveness and competitiveness. This problem occurs in the past,
   however with effectiveness of the new procurement law and decrees, this issue should be
   under effective control. Thirdly, contract awards to dependent SOEs may generate conflicts
   of interest and compromise the quality of works and services delivered. To mitigate these
   risks it is recommended that procurement actions are included in the Program Action Plan
   that is agreed with Government, and effectively implemented during Program execution.
   Additionally, provinces should be encouraged to use the e-GP system for managing
   procurement. MARD should provide detailed guidance on procurement matters in the
   Program Operational Manual.

136. Reference to the governmental unit costs in deciding contract awards adversely affects
   open market competition and provides room for collusion. The PCERWASS should avoid
   rejecting an otherwise conforming bid simply because it exceeds the cost estimate. They
   should utilize the mechanisms available in Vietnam for the clearance of award. As a
   mitigating measure in the Program, bids above the stated norms are to be considered
   during bid evaluation.

137. Shortage of funds Delays in contract performance and in payments to contractors
   frequently occur due to many reasons, but the most serious reason is shortage and
   untimely provision of funds. This could continue to be one of the biggest challenges under
   the NTP3 and it may adversely impact the quality and timeliness of works and services
   delivered under the program. Mitigation measures for this potential risk are included in the
   Program design and include appropriate advance payments and Program DLIs that are
   scalable -- allowing partial disbursement against partially achieved results.

138. Procurement performance. Procurement performance is audited and inspected by
   various government authorities such as Provincial Inspectorates, the SAV, and Government
   Inspection Authorities (GIA). There is a need to establish and operate a clear set of
   procurement performance indicators9 and systematic monitoring and reporting at all levels.
   In the Program, the Independent Verification Agent (IVA) will, as part of results monitoring,
   review procurement performance against the targets set in the provincial investment plans
   and any other requirements of the Program.



9For example, Timeliness of completion of contracts, Cost-effectiveness, Effectiveness and quality of procurement planning, Competitiveness of
the procurement processes, Timeliness of payments to contractors, Extent of the implementing agency's compliance with applicable rules on
the use of different procurement methods, and Effectiveness of the complaint handling mechanism.



                                                                     47
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                     FSA


139. The Bank will support the government in updating the procurement manual that has
   been used in NTP2 in a manner reflecting the procurement framework that will be agreed
   upon for NTP3. Some provinces have also expressed an interest in establishing an
   information system for monitoring procurement performance and contract management,
   an interest that can be responded to through the technical assistance program.

Expenditures Control and Financial Reporting

140. The risk of mis-recording or mis-presentation of financial statements is assessed as
   Substantial before mitigation measures. With the implementation of the following actions,
   risk can be reduced to Moderate: (a) PCERWASS is to prepare the consolidated financial
   statements for the provincial NTP. The format of the financial statements is to be agreed by
   the Standing Office, State Audit and the Bank. Financial statements are to be generated
   quarterly and include all sources of funds and all NTP expenditures; (b) DoH will be
   responsible for financial management of all sanitation and hygiene promotion activities in
   the province including activities performed by woman union, district health centers and
   village health workers. The function includes providing advances and managing advance
   clearances, maintaining accounting records and supporting documents, getting
   expenditures verified by provincial State Treasury, and prepare financial reports for
   PCERWAS to consolidate; and (c) reconciliation is to be done between PCERWAS, DoH and
   DOET and State Treasury on a quarterly basis for the statement of main account and sub-
   accounts balances and expenditures disbursed. Those actions will be reflected in the
   Program PDO and FS.

Internal Audit and Internal Audit

141. The risk of internal control and internal audit of NTP is assessed at Substantial before
   mitigation measures. With the implementation of the following actions, risk can be assessed
   at Moderate: (a) financial management manual is to be developed by NTPSO, approved by
   Steering Board and applied by all investment owners and spending units of the NTP. The
   manual needs to be comprehensive, covering all areas of financial management, including
   the cost norms and basis for payment of sanitation and hygiene promotion activities; and
   (b) MARD assigns MARD Inspectorate to perform internal audit function for this Program.
   Those actions are to be completed before Program negotiation.

142. NTPSO needs to agree the audit TOR with SAV to ensure that all 19 provinces are
   audited every year -- covering financial, compliance and performance areas -- and that the
   audit results are submitted to the World Bank within the agreed period. The participation of
   SAV to be financial auditor as well as DLIs verification agency for the Program will be
   reflected in the Program PDO and FS.

Governance and Anti-corruption

143. The Lack of follow-up of Complaints. There is a risk that a lack of clarity in the relative
   authority of various inspectorates and government offices may lead of a lack of follow-up of
   complaints. Due to the establishment of numerous Inspectorates, their authority to process
   and settle complaints and denunciations are tightly defined vis-à-vis each other. These
   shortcomings present a difficult situation for the filing of complaints to the right authority.
   The multiple-entry complaints system provides a number of options for citizens, but it can
   also be confusing and result in complaints being passed around agencies or lost in the
   transfer process making it difficult for citizens to follow up their complaints. The use of
   written log books in some implementing provinces raises questions about the quality of the
   data collected. However, the lack of any past use of the complaints handling system for
   fraud and corruption complaints has meant that the team is unable to identify other gaps or
   weaknesses that may appear only during implementation of the system.

144. It is therefore recommended that improved and consolidated reporting on complaints,
   as well as feedback from beneficiary and other stakeholders, be required on a regular basis
   as part of the Program Action Plan. A coordination unit for the Program should be tasked
   with collecting information from each PPC and respective PCERWASS/PMC, as well as from
   concerned GIs under MARD and MoH, and will be done at least annually. The Standing
   Office of the NTP3 can play this role, as they have been doing under the Results-based
   National Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program under the National Target Program.

145. In order to remove a possible obstacle to effective citizen feedback and reporting on
   problems in the Program, the technical assistance program will support the GOV in
   establishing an effective mechanism for communicating to beneficiaries their rights, roles
   and responsibilities as related to the Program. In particular this would cover items such as
   how to provide timely feedback and complaints regarding the Program to agencies in the
   nineteen implementing provinces. The Program will contain its own reporting systems that
   can capture information on the number, type and handling of fraud and corruption
   allegations in the Program.

146. Different options that ensure the availability of “open complaint procedures” and
   functioning handling mechanisms of these complaints have been discussed with the
   government. These include:

      establishing a simple alternative route for citizens to provide feedback on the program,
       including anonymous complaints. For example, an easily accessible Information
       Technology (IT) Platform could be established at the national level through an expansion
       of the IT platform being developed under the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation PforR
       and linked to a credible follow up process;

                                               49
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                        FSA


      formalizing the process for acceptance, review and investigation of anonymous
       complaints at the provincial level; and
      improving citizen and bidder knowledge and access to information about rights and
       processes for making complaints about concerns with the Program.

147. Anonymous complaints. There is also a risk that the formal denial of the submission of
   any anonymous complaints will prevent the discovery of procurement problems and
   compromise that quality of procurement work. It is recommended that all complaints,
   including anonymous ones, be duly considered and address, as well as recorded and
   reported in the Program.

148. Staffing. There is also a risk that inadequate staffing of inspection agencies will constrain
   the ability of the Program to collect, manage and investigate allegations, especially when
   the Program funs will add a significant amount of work to the existing size of investments
   made by PCERWASS and PMCs in participating provinces. While central government GIs
   have numerous staff to carry out required inspections, staffing in the provincial or district
   inspectorate units varied greatly: some had sufficient staff to create a dedicated complaints
   handling unit while others had as few as two-three inspectors even at the provincial level
   that had to cover all functions including complaints handling. It is recommended that the
   adequacy of staffing is reviewed at Program midterm alongside a review of reports on
   complaints handling to assess whether additional capacity support or other interventions
   are required.

149. Application of the Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in
   Program-for-Results Financing. Under the ACG Guidelines, Vietnam is obligated to apply the
   Bank’s debarment lists for Program-supported investments. In addition to the application of
   the Bank’s debarment lists, the Program will also be subject to Vietnam’s national
   debarment procedures. Prohibition from participation in future tenders is governed by the
   Law on Procurement which provides a defined set of “prohibited acts” -- commission of
   which can lead to debarment. For procurement, initial sanctioning decisions will be made by
   the tendering authority. It is recommended that specific agreements be reached with the
   Government to share the Bank’s disbarment lists with the participating provinces, and that
   their compliance is supervised and audited during Program implementation.

150. In addition, the GOV will need to provide the Bank with clear steps that it will take to
   assist Bank-led investigations of fraud and corruption allegations. This agreement will
   include identifying the participants and beneficiaries of the Program (e.g., water users at all
   levels, commune-level water authorities, DARDs, contractors, etc.) and providing steps that
   the client will take to ensure the cooperation of these participants and beneficiaries. It will
   further include a commitment that those authorities with enforcement and investigative
   rights, such as provincial DARD, DOH, DOET and national and provincial GIs as well as the
   police, will assist the Bank in any fraud or corruption investigation. Government will have to
   submit to IDA evidence of a written communication from a competent central government
   authority to the relevant provincial authorities which sets out the obligations of those

                                               50
Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                               FSA


    authorized to cooperate with any investigations under the Program, including any
    investigations that may be necessary by the Bank’s Integrity Vice-Presidency. This
    communication to the provinces will need to be issued by MARD under the authorization of
    the Office of Government.

Monitoring Fiduciary Performance over Program Period

151. While key fiduciary areas requiring specific actions for strengthening in government
   systems have been listed in the Program Action Plan, it will be important to also monitor
   the overall fiduciary performance during the duration of the Program. Table D.1 identifies
   the specific indicators which will be monitored (together with the relevant baseline
   position) to provide the framework to measure improvements in the performance of
   financial management and procurement processes.

152. To facilitate the effective monitoring of Program procurement, the reporting system and
   practices should improve. It is therefore proposed that Program implementation reports by
   Program provinces/MARD/MoH should include the following information on procurement
   performance:
   a) copies of updated procurement plans;
   b) procurement transactions completed in the reporting period which list the following
      information, inter alia:
           i. contract title and code;
          ii. approved cost estimate;
        iii. procurement method followed;
         iv. advertisement date;
          v. participating bidders’ names and their bid prices as read out and recorded;
         vi. names of bidders rejected and reasons for rejection;
        vii. name of successful bidder and bid price offered;
       viii. date of contract award approval;
         ix. contract signing date;
          x. final contract amount;
         xi. contractual completion date; and
        xii. actual completion date.
   c) procurement inspections/audits conducted during the reporting period (copies of
      reports attached);
   d) dates, venues, and numbers of participants who attended procurement training and
      capacity building activities conducted during the reporting period (with lists of
      participants attached); and
   e) emerging procurement and contractual issues that require attention and actions.

153. The Program Operational Manual should provide for development by MARD, MOH and
   MOET of best practice guidelines for procurement by the PCERWASS/DoH/DoET, including
   the following:
   a) preparation of medium-term procurement plans showing all packages to be procured by
       the provinces (whether or not funded by the Program) during at least an annual budget
       cycle. These plans would not necessarily obviate the “approval to proceed” now
       obtained from Provincial level immediately before initiating procurement for each
       package;
   b) use of market prices as a basis for cost estimate (including for consultant fees);
   c) ensuring adequate length of advertising, with tender documents available from the first
       day of advertising. If not directly forbidden by law, bidders should be permitted to
       examine tender documents at the PCERWASS / PCPM office before deciding to
       purchase. Clear procedures for disseminating information / clarifications to bidders
       should be introduced, perhaps including a pre-bidding meeting or site inspection for
       larger sub-projects;

Results-based Scaling up Rural Sanitation and Water Supply Program                     FSA


   d) establishment of clear, objective and appropriate bid evaluation criteria which should be
      included in the Instructions to Bidders; and
   e) introduction of sole-sourcing procedures, particularly for recruitment of consultants,
      designed to ensure that the qualifications of the best available candidates are compared
      and evaluated and that there is an auditable record of the decision making process.

154. Capacity support should be provided to DARDs / DoHs to support them to comply with
   procurement rules and procedures. Further details on this support are included in the
   Technical Assessment.

156. Agreement on Information Sharing and Reporting on Fraud and Corruption Allegations.
   Based on this assessment and the team’s field visits, there does not appear to be a unified
   national system for collecting and reporting on how the authorities handle allegations of
   fraud and corruption. Therefore, in order to ensure that the client will be able to comply
   with its reporting obligations under the ACGs, the client will need to commit to providing
   this information from the nineteen participating provinces, as well as MARD, MoH and
   MoET. The Standing Office of the NTP under MARD, which serves as the key implementing
   agency and coordinator for NMUP, shall be tasked to aggregate and inform the Bank of the
   number of fraud and corruption allegations, as well as how they are handled (investigated,
   mitigated and/or sanctioned) per an agreed simple template. This list will also include the
   handling of anonymous complaints. The information shall be collected from each PPC and
   respective implementing agencies (PCERWASS/DoH/DoET), VIHEMA, as well as from
   concerned GIs under MARD, MoH, MoET and will be done at least annually as per the
   template below.

157. Broaden the Usefulness of the Complaints Handling Systems. The Bank continues to
   engage more broadly with the client in policy discussions on expanding access to the
   existing systems by formally permitting the submission of anonymous complaints. In
   addition, with support from the Program’s technical assistance component, the Program’s
   communication strategy will include extensive outreach efforts to improve citizen and
   bidder knowledge and access to information about their rights under the Program including
   their rights to water service as well as clear information on the process for making
   complaints about service delivery or fraud and corruption in the Program both to
   Vietnamese authorities and the Bank.

158. Clarify Debarments under the Program. In light of the ability of provincial officials to
   debar firms in addition to the formal national debarment list managed by MPI, the Bank
   reached an agreement with the client to provide periodic information on all debarred firms
   in each of the nineteen implementing provinces as well as those listed in the national
   debarment list. This information will be provided on a periodic basis and include the
   following information: (a) name of debarred entity; (b) date and duration of debarment;
   and (c) reason for debarment.

159. Client to Ensure that Program Participants are Obligated to Cooperate with Bank
   Investigations. During appraisal, the client will need to provide the Bank with clear steps
   that it will take to assist Bank-led investigations of fraud and corruption allegations. This
   agreement will include identifying the participants and beneficiaries of the Program (e.g.,
   water users at all levels, commune-level water authorities, DARDs, contractors, etc.) and
   providing steps that the client will take to ensure the cooperation of these participants and
   beneficiaries. It will further include a commitment that those authorities with enforcement
   and investigative rights, such as DARD, DoH, DoET and provincial and national GIs as well as
   the police, will assist the Bank in any fraud or corruption investigation. Government has also
   submitted to IDA evidence of a written communication from a competent central
   government authority to the relevant provincial authorities which sets out the obligations
   of those authorized to cooperate with any investigations under the Program, including any
   investigations that may be necessary by the Bank’s Integrity Vice-Presidency. This
   communication to the provinces will need to be issued by MARD under the authorization of
   the Office of Government.

   E. Proposed Inputs for the Program Action Plan

Procurement

160. In accordance with the results of Fiduciary System Assessment presented above, it is
   recommended that the following Program Action Plan be agreed with the Government prior
   to the Credit negotiations and subsequently be implemented during the Program:
   a) All proposals for detailed designs, construction supervision and bids for civil works,
       whether below or above cost estimates, shall be evaluated; proposals and bids shall not
       be rejected only on the basis of minor, non-substantive deviations.
   b) State-Owned Enterprises dependent on Program ministries/provinces/departments will
       not be allowed to participate.
   c) Firms and individuals on the local, national or Bank debarment/suspension lists will not
       be allowed to participate.

Financial Management

161. There will be a Program Action Plan to require timely and appropriate budget allocation
   by PPCs, including adequate allocation to sanitation and communication as indicated in
   inter-ministry guidance. Implementation arrangement with main focus on PCERWASS and
   DOH for provincial activities will be provided in the Program detailed outline and Feasibility
   Study.

Governance

162. To address the governance risks above, it’s recommended that a database will be set up
   and maintained by NTP SO to aggregate and report on the complaints and feedback
   received by the Program, as well as how they are handled (investigated, mitigated and
   sanctioned). The information will be collected from each relevant PC and respective
   PCERWASS/DoH/DoET, VIHEMA, as well as from concerned GIs under MARD, MoH, MPI,
   MoF, and will be done at least annually. This activity will publicize the existing channels for
   submitting complaints under the program, including the Grievance Redress Mechanism of
   the World Bank.
