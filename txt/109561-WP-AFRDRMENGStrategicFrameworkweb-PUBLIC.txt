     The Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak that began in March 2014 is the most widespread in history and the first to
     reach epidemic proportions. The three most affected countries have been Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, though
     cases have also been reported in Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. Since
     West African countries had previously not recorded any cases, the EVD was able to spread for several months before
     it was recognized. In its initial phases (approximately three months), the case fatality rate was 86 percent among the
     early confirmed cases and 71 percent among clinically suspected cases.a As of December 2015, there has been over
     28,000 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, with over
     11,000 reported fatalities. In addition to the significant loss of life, the epidemic has resulted in significant economic
     and livelihood impacts.b Airline traffic was interrupted, border crossings were closed and restrictions were made on
     movement, schools and local markets experienced prolonged closures and crop harvests have lowered, resulting in
     increased food security risks. The worst impacts of the EVD crisis have been felt by the poor, who reported losing their
     jobs and sources of income, difficulty accessing medical services and traumatic feelings of fear.c On a macro level,
     it is estimated that the most affected countries will lose at least $1.6 billion in forgone economic growth in 2015.d

  Kenya: Being born in a drought year increases the likelihood of child malnutrition by 50 percent.

  Zimbabwe: Children born during drought-affected periods are, on average, 2.3 cm shorter. Delayed start of school-

     Sea-level rise is increasingly a concern for
many countries, particularly those with low-
lying urban centers such as the densely popu-
lated Niger Delta and low-lying areas along the
coasts of West and East Africa and Madagascar.
Scenarios for climate change show that a 2°C or
more rise from global warming in Tanzania could
cause a sea level rise of 5–19 cm by 2030, sub-
merging vast areas of land. It is likely that with-
out adaptation, this would possibly lead to more
than 850,000 people being forced to migrate to
urban areas. Urban areas along large river sys-

                         Four priorities for action:
                         1.	 Understanding disaster risk

                         4.	 Seven global targets:

                            c)	 Reduce direct disaster economic loss in relation to global gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030.
                            d)	 Substantially reduce disaster damage to critical infrastructure and disruption of basic services, among them
                                health and educational facilities, including through developing their resilience by 2030.
                            e)	 Substantially increase the number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020.
                            f)	 Substantially enhance international cooperation to developing countries through adequate and sustainable

continue to support the alignment of sub-region-

     Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) sets an example in regional
collaboration by leading the policy dialogue on
DRM. Through its technical centers, and in col-

vides leadership to several regional initiatives. In
spite of regional, sub-regional and national level
interventions, the prevention and mitigation of,
and preparedness for natural hazards remains
an emerging issue in the policy agenda of many
African governments. DRM and climate change
adaptation are only partially translated into pol-

reduction measures are not yet fully mainstreamed.     Community leaders receive training for the newly implemented

                         from the International Development Association (IDA). The remaining resources will be requested from bilateral and
                         multilateral sources, including climate finance, and the private sector. It focuses on twelve priority areas, where the
                         World Bank, in collaboration with African governments, regional and international partners, expects to help achieve
                         results to strengthen, power and enable resilience.

Box 8: Supporting Climate Resilient Development in Sub-Saharan Africa (continued)

  Strengthening resilient landscapes and the integri-
  ty of ecosystems to provide the full range of services
  for productive sectors and livelihoods. The Bank will
  aim to mobilize $ 755 million to support the African
  Resilient Landscape Initiative (ARLI), which will help
  design and implement country- and region-specific
  integrated landscape-level strategies in the Sahel,
  the Horn of Africa, and East Africa.
  Supporting integrated watershed management by
  mobilizing $ 3 billion by 2020 across the Niger River,
  Lake Chad, Lake Victoria and Zambezi River Basins
  to support institutional strengthening, development
  of information management systems and tools, and
  infrastructure development such as irrigation sys-
  tems, water storage, and erosion control.
  Supporting ocean economy through an estimated $ 220 million. Analytical work will help countries to integrate
  climate change considerations into the ways in which fisheries and the ocean economy are managed, while invest-
  ments will support the management of coastal habitats, development of alternative livelihood opportunities for
  coastal communities and climate smart infrastructure.
  Supporting Climate Smart Cities through policy dialogue, technical work, and investment financing across 30
  cities totaling $ 1 billion by 2020. This will include strengthening planning and capacity building using the City
  Strength Diagnostic, investing in resilient infrastructure and forging partnerships and city networks for knowl-
  edge sharing.
  Building Coastal Resilience through the mobilization of $ 450 million by 2020. Targeting West African coast-
  al areas, technical assistance will be provided to prepare climate-resilient coastal development and investment
  plans, while investments will be made in both hard (piers, artificial reefs, groins, etc.) and green infrastructure
  (mangroves, sand dunes, vegetation, etc.) to manage coastal erosion and flooding.
  Increasing Social Protection for the resilience of poor and vulnerable households by responding to disasters and
  new Adaptive Social Protection (ASP) approaches help build the adaptive capacity of households before climate
  and disaster shocks occur. In the face of increased climate-related shocks, The Bank will increase the scale and
  scope of social protection systems across Africa by mobilizing $ 480 million by 2020.
  Addressing the drivers of migration, through mobilizing $ 616 million by 2020. This will support diagnostic
  work to develop a better understanding of the push and pull factors behind mixed migration, identify its impacts,
  and craft durable solutions to inform investments. The team will first focus on two regions with urgent needs—the
  Lake Chad Basin and the Horn of Africa. This focus is particularly important given the impact of the 2015/2016 El
  Niño effect on Africa; it is also important given the significant population movement witnessed in recent years as
  a result of conflicts across the continent.
  Energizing resilience through solar, hydro and geothermal energy will scale up low carbon energy sources
  across the African continent and mobilize an estimated $ 5.4 billion by 2020.
  Implementing a $ 270 million hydromet framework program to support Sub-Saharan countries in strengthening
  National Meteorological and Hydrological Services and build capacity at the community level for preparedness
  and response activities.
  Helping African countries and regional organizations integrate climate change considerations into the planning,
  design, and operation of investment in relevant sectors, an Africa Climate-Resilient Development Facility is
  being proposed (initial support estimated at $ 50 million by 2020).
