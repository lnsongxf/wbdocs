           Box 2.1  Steps for Rwanda’s LTR procedure
           	1.	 Notification of areas for the LTR program
           		 District, sector, and cell authorities are notified about the LTR commencing within the next three months.

           	2.	 Cell index map and field sheet production
           		 The cell7 boundary dataset is taken from the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) and overlaid onto the
              orthophoto image. The Field Manager (FM) then walks the cell boundary with the Cell Executive Secretary. If neces-
              sary, the boundary is corrected. Next, numbered rectangular polygons are arranged to cover the entire cell area with
              an overlap of 5 percent. Open-source software packages are used for batch printing of hard-copy maps from the
              orthophotos to make it easier for people to identify houses and pertinent features.

           	3.	 Information, and mobilization
           		 On a cell level, general meetings led by the FM are held to ensure that the public are well-informed and aware of their
              rights under the new laws, of the LTR and its implementation, and how they will be involved in the process and what
              was expected from them. These meetings started at the district level involving all leaders at district, sector and cell
              level to ensure that they were familiar with the process and well equipped to mobilize the population for cell meetings.
              Flyers and booklets are distributed. Special sessions are organized for women only.

           	4.	 Training of para-surveyors (PS) and Adjudication Committee
           		 10 PSs are recruited in each cell during cell level meetings from amongst the population in attendance, with tests and
              final selection done in presence of everyone in the meeting for transparency. The selected were trained on how to read
              a map and trace a physical boundary on a field sheet. The composition of the Adjudication Committee was spelt out
              in the law and self-constituting. It consisted of all cell land committee members (5 people) together with an elected
              village council or committee (5 people). In total there number was 10 members who were then trained in legal matters
              around the LTR by the FM.

           	5.	 Demarcation and identification of disputed parcels
           		 The PS traces the parcel boundary on the field sheet, walking around the parcel with the claimant, neighbors, and the
              village leader. No boundary markers are placed. A unique parcel number (UPI) is given and annotated. The claimant
              then gets a Demarcation Receipt and is instructed to take it immediately to the Adjudication Committee to register
              a claim. This is the first occasion to pay the registration fee of RF 1,000 (RF 5,000 in Kigali).
           		 The boundary of the disputed parcel is demarcated and marked on the field sheet and referred to the Adjudication
              Committee, the village leader, or a special mediator for resolution. Disputes that are unresolved are entered into the
              dispute register and the parties are referred to a mediator or a court.

           	6.	 Adjudication
           		 The Adjudication Committee signs off the adjudication records in the claims and dispute register before they are
              handed over for data entry.

           	7.	 Data entry and checking
           		 Data from the claims register, dispute register, field sheets, claim receipt books, and dispute receipt books are en-
              tered sector by sector into the Land Tenure Regularisation Support System (LTRSS) database at the Zonal Office and
              checked for plausibility.

           	8.	 Parcel digitization (parallel to step 7)
           		 Field sheets are scanned and then georeferenced (in QGIS, another open-source software). Heads-up digitization of all
              parcel boundaries follows under their UPI and calculation of the area in m². Finally, a cell map is printed, with villages
              color-coded and parcels denoted by their UPI.

           	9.	 Objections and corrections (O&C)
           		 O&C starts in all cells of a sector at the same time under the responsibility of the FM and lasts two weeks. All claim-
              ants can inspect the cell maps and their data for errors and omissions or dispute claims made by others. If necessary,
              changes can be made of every data point collected. The adjudication committee oversees this process.

           	10.	 Data corrections after O&C (parallel to step 11)
           		 The LTRSS database is corrected with the information obtained during the O&C period.



     7.	   Rwanda has five levels of local administration: four provinces (North, South, East, and West) and the city of Kigali; 30 districts (of which three are within
           Kigali); 416 sectors; 2,146 cells; and 14,876 villages (umudugudu).

   Box 2.1  Continued
   	11.	 Post-O&C parcel correction in the GIS, cadastral extract generation
   		 With all geometric data now corrected and confirmed, an extract is generated for each parcel, showing the parcel and
      its adjacent neighbors, with the UPI.

   	12.	 Lease preparation
   		 A (collated) lease document contains four pieces: original and duplicate lease contract, certificate of emphyteutic
      lease, and parcel cadastral extract. The certificate is sealed, whilst the contract and extract are stamped.

   	13.	 Lease issuance
   		 After another intensive public awareness campaign, the inhabitants of a cell are informed that the lease issuance shall
      begin and will last for four weeks. The claimant who has not yet paid the fee will be required to pay on lease collec-
      tion, unless exempted. Duplicate contracts have to be signed by the claimant, now new registered lease holder, before
      scanning and archiving.

   	14.	 Migrating LTRSS data to the Land Administration Information System (LAIS)
   		 All data are migrated sector by sector from the LTRSS to the LAIS Maintenance Database. While this happens (a few
      days), the LTRSS is blocked for ongoing transactions, after which the LAIS takes over this task.
