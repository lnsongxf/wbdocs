    Metropolitan Governance in Brazil



    Foreword

    In less than fifty years, Brazil evolved from a predominantly rural society and economy to a highly
    urbanized country in which 85 percent of its people now live in urban areas and more than 90 per-
    cent of the country’s GDP is generated in the cities. This rapid urbanization process was characte-
    rized by a lack of planning and an enduring framework of inequality, resulting in high degrees of
    concentrated poverty in the urban areas.

    Much of this urbanization has taken place in metropolitan regions (MRs). MRs have grown more
    rapidly than the rest of the country, both in population and in GDP terms. In 2010, per capita GDP
    was higher in MRs than in the rest of the country and metropolitan economies accounted for 70%
    of GDP. At the same time, half of the Brazilian poor and 90 percent of the people living in subnor-
    mal conditions were found in metropolitan regions.

    MRs present diverse realities. To begin, there are differences between core and peripheral areas in
    each region, with peripheral areas characterized by lower access to basic infrastructure and ser-
    vices, mobility, jobs, affordable land, and housing. There are also important differences between
    MRs, e.g in terms of scale and wealth. Over 19.7 million people lived in the São Paulo MR (one in
    ten Brazilians) while only 2.1 million people lived in the Belém MR. The São Paulo MR produces
    almost 1/5 of Brazil’s GDP and, in 2012, generated 1/4 of Brazil’s tax collection; in contrast, the
    Recife MR makes up 64% of Pernambuco’s GDP but represents only 1.6% of the Brazilian economy.
    Finally, there are large differences in the racial composition of the MRs with residents of the North
    and Northeastern cities of predominantly self-identifying as pardos (mixed origin) while residents
    of the South and Southeastern cities have larger populations that call themselves brancos (white).

    After years of discussion, the recent approval of a new framework for metropolitan governance in
    Brazil – the Statute of the Metropolis – creates the opportunity for debate and evolution regarding
    several key issues. These include: a) placing metropolitan matters at the forefront of the develo-
    pment arena in Brazil; b) reviewing what has been learned about inter-municipal governance and
    service delivery; c) estimating resource mobilization needs for metropolitan development; d) coor-
    dinating metropolitan land use with transport and housing; e) including metropolitan concerns in
    any revision of fiscal federalism; and f) promoting environmental sustainability, social inclusion
    and resilience to disasters and climate change plans at the metropolitan scale.

    The World Bank can be a partner in addressing these issues. In responding to Client demand, the
    Bank has been providing a range of support to Brazilian states and cities and especially their lo-
    w-income populations in the areas of infrastructure, social services, slum upgrading, institutional
    development, river basin management, local economic development, environmental protection,
    water and sanitation, and transportation. In the future, we hope that this support can increasingly
    be delivered at the metropolitan level and through metropolitan structures.

    This work is part of the Bank’s knowledge generation and dissemination agendas. It is aimed at
    enriching and building a discussion space among our nework of Clients and Partners.

     tructure or close to the core city. Lack of ade-
     quate land use planning and absence of pro-ac-
     tive slum prevention characterizes most of the
     MRs, especially in the periphery. Housing units
     have grown in areas with relatively poor infras-
     tructure, and slums have grown in the outskirts
     of metropolitan areas, aggravating mobility
     issues in already congested urban areas. This
     indicates the low elasticity of land supply for
     housing and shelter and shows the dynamics of
     the informal markets to answer a very clear de-
     mand for affordable land and shelter that is not
     adequately being addressed.

     Case Studies: São Paulo, Recife
     and Belo Horizonte

     Three selected case studies - São Paulo, Recife
     and Belo Horizonte - offer an in-depth, qua-
     litative look at metropolitan governance in
     Brazil and reflect the absence of a unique one-
     size-fits-all model of metropolitan governan-
     ce. The experiences show distinct approaches
     to metropolitan governance currently in place
     in these three MRs, which have taken an active
     role in shaping their institutional and policy
     structure. They exemplify the dynamism of
     metropolitan governance, whether led by the
     state or by municipalities, and offer an oppor-
     tunity to extract lessons that could be of use in
     other MRs. São Paulo presents a compelling
     case due to the sheer scale of its challenges,
     the number of metropolitan initiatives that
     have taken place, as well as its experimenta-
     tion with inter-municipal consortia and other
     forms of metropolitan governance. Recife’s
     historic legacy of metropolitan planning sheds
     light on innovative participatory planning ini-
     tiatives. Belo Horizonte is an interesting case
     study for demonstrating how civil society can
     contribute to metropolitan institutions.

  Box 2. Why metropolitan governance?

  The need for collaborative policies at spatial level is anchored in the foundations of economic
  geography. Accepting the inevitability of urbanization for countries to grow – as density is the
  prerequisite for the economic transformation to industrialization - the World Bank’s World
  Development Report 2009 argues that governments may be concerned about the disparities
  in income and welfare as production concentrates in selected places. The solution would
  be “to promote economic integration to reduce those disparities” (World Bank, 2009). Such
  integration requires institutions and regulations to provide basic services and certainty to
  all; infrastructure to ensure spatial connectivity and enable people to move and access la-
  bor markets, education and cultural facilities) and spatially targeted interventions, such as
  slum upgrading and incentives to innovation. Such interventions will enable the convergence
  of living conditions across the space, so that everyone can take advantage of the benefits of
  urbanization.

The best-known case is the Urban Community of Large Marseille. It began in 1992 with three
municipalities – Marseille, Marignane and Saint-Victoret – that created a public corporation
(the Communauté de Communes Marseille Provence Métropole) focused on roads and traffic.
Five years later, 17 other cities had joined, leading to the creation of the Urban Community of
Marseille in 2000. It is a metropolitan organization with responsibility over regional econom-
ic development, transportation, land use and housing, crime prevention, waste disposal and
environmental policies. The member localities have adopted tax-sharing agreements whereby
the Communaute Urbaine collects a common tax on business, thereby eliminating tax compe-

      Box 4. Two-tier model - Madrid
      The metropolitan region of Madrid was created in 1983, taking over the province of Madrid. It includes
      an upper government (Comunidad Autónoma de Madrid , CAM) and 179 municipalities. More than half
      of the population is concentrated in the City of Madrid (3.2 million people).
      The CAM is responsible for global tasks such as spatial planning, housing, and economic development.
      It shares responsibilities with the central government for health, education and environmental
      protection. The largest spending item is health followed by education, and the largest source
      of revenues is the personal income tax followed by the value added tax (shared with the central
      government).
      The City of Madrid takes care of traffic, streets maintenance, public lighting, and solid waste
      management. Housing policy and spatial planning, among others, are shared tasks with CAM. The
      City’s largest spending item is in the areas of environment and mobility. The Property Tax, the Land
      Value Increase Tax and the central government transfers are the main sources of revenues.
      CAM collaborates with the municipalities in several ways: shares information, helps mediate disputes,
      helps with contractual arrangements for the delivery of public services, and establishes cooperation
      funds to promote social services and employment. There are also special purposes agencies that
      deliver services in transport, water and land. Some examples are:
           •	Madrid Regional Transportation Consortium (Consorcio Regional de Transportes de Madrid,
           CRTM). Created in 1986, CRTM coordinates the public transportation systems, including the
           subway, the Municipal Transport Company, the suburban rail and buses, and the light rail.
           It manages the delivery system, sets fares and ensures a sustainable financial framework. It
           operates with great autonomy from the CAM, bringing together public and private transport
           services providers.
           •	Canal de Isabel II Gestion SA, was created in 2008 to manage the water sector. It oversees
           water production, wastewater treatment, and conservation of rivers. The CAM and 111 regional
           municipalities are the company’s shareholders. It is the succession of a former entity – Canal
           Isabel II created in 1851– that is now the official holder of the concessions, provides authorizations
           and defines the service planning.
           •	Arpegio. It is a company owned by the CAM, responsible for land management. Its activity is
           complementary to the private sector, putting on the market land at affordable prices.
           A voluntary horizontal cooperation agreement widely used in Madrid is the Mancomunidade,
           to which municipalities delegate some functions, such as the provision of public services or the
           promotion of economic development. It is a very flexible instrument that allows incorporating
           new objectives with time.
      In addition, the region has been able to develop strong linkages with the social and economic groups,
      including trade unions and business associations, thanks to their participation in regional entities and
      consultation bodies.
      Some authors argue that Madrid’s metropolitan model is one of the most accomplished in Europe. The
      two-tier government system has allowed the CAM and the municipalities to provide efficient delivery
      of public services and promote the development of the metropolitan region. Nevertheless, there are
      conflicting interests between CAM and the City of Madrid in terms of overlapping responsibilities and
      uncoordinated initiatives.

the constraints tied to administrative boundaries and enhancing the capacity for
comparison across regions and countries. Because data on urban areas are generally
disaggregated according to administrative boundaries, urban areas or metropolitan

administrative units (municipalities). Redefining “Urban”: A New Way to Measure                                                                           35

        Other countries depict similar interest of the central government towards cities and metropolitan
        areas. Switzerland has approved a constitutional amendment allowing the federal government to
        intervene in cities and metropolitan issues. New coordination structures have been created including
        a Tripartite Agglomeration Conference, and policies have been designed to help urgent projects to
        improve metropolitan public transport, railway, and projects in city neighborhoods to advance the
        quality of life of the residents. In Australia, India and South Africa similar initiatives show the in-
        terest of the central government to promote inter-municipal co-operation. In the United States and
        Canada, the federal government has no formal role in local government and the only intervention
        in metropolitan issues is through financing assistance to fund infrastructure (Slack and Chattopad-
        hyay, 2013).

     income inequality during 2000-2010 (Figure 7).
     Some improvement was observed in Campinas,
     Manaus, Brasília, Goiânia, Belém and Curitiba
     (Figure 8), but they have not been enough to
     compensate for the exacerbation of income in-
     equality that occurred in the 1990s. While we
     believe that this trend is part of the convergence
     process being seen in most of the Brazilian re-

54. The following three case studies offer a
more in-depth, qualitative look at metropoli-
tan governance. Each one illustrates a distinct
set of attributes contributing to the ongoing
challenges and relative successes of metro-
politan planning and coordination in its re-
spective urban context. São Paulo presents a
compelling case due to the sheer scale of its
challenges and potentials, the number of met-
ropolitan initiatives that have taken place, as
well as its experimentation with inter-munici-
pal consortia and other forms of metropolitan
governance. Recife’s historic legacy of metro-
politan planning sheds light on innovative par-

         WMATA is a tri-jurisdictional government agency that operates transit service in the Washington Metro-
         politan Area. It was created by the United States Congress as an interstate compact between the District
         of Columbia, the State of Maryland, and the Commonwealth of Virginia. WMATA provides rapid transit
         service and is part of a public-private partnership that operates the DC Circulator bus system. WMATA
         has no independent taxation authority and depends on its member jurisdictions for capital investments
         and operating subsidies. Each of the local jurisdiction finance the investments with municipal bonds and
         guarantees/matching funds from the Federal government.

Box 7. Incentives towards affordable housing – an international perspective

International experiences demonstrate that the success of affordable housing programs
at municipal level depend on the availability of affordable serviced land. In periods of ac-
celerated development, demand for office space and residences increase and urban land
prices sky rocket. To offset this outcome, municipalities and states need to take measures
to remove any excessive controls on land use or buildings permit (like height or space
floor ratios) or offer subsidized housing in places with services and connected by public
transportation to the labor market. Examples of the public sector’s capacity to leverage its
resources and promote affordable housing in cities include:

United States: Minimizing requirements on new development. Through the Livable Commu-
nities Act, the State of Minnesota has aimed to reduce development costs imposed through
special fees, minimum floor areas and lot sizes, which can impede the development of new
housing. This approach required a high level of cooperation from municipalities, but has
created significant savings in development costs in participating cities.

France: National-level affordable housing policy. France provides low-income housing at
the national level, through the Solidarity and Urban Renewal Law, which requires that 20
percent of housing in all municipalities with a population greater than 3,500 is dedicated
to public social housing. Those municipalities that do not meet the requirement pay a fee,
which is in turn invested into social housing development.

UK and the Netherlands: Non-profit sector housing provision. In the UK and the Nether-
lands, the non-profit sector has increasingly played a role in the provision of low-income
housing. Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) in the UK are non-profit organizations that
develop housing partially subsidized by the government. In the Netherlands, non-profit
housing associations provide over 99 percent of the low-income housing stock. These asso-
ciations are financially independent from the government, although the government does
play a role in guaranteeing loans for housing improvement by these associations.

Ireland: Designating land for affordable housing development. To address the issue of a
lack of available land for affordable housing development, the Irish Planning and Devel-
opment Act (2000), allows local governments to designate up to 20 percent of residentially
zoned land for different income levels. This policy intends to ensure the availability of land
for different classes of housing, with an emphasis on low-income or social housing.

  Singapore. Singapore’s success to become a world city in less than 60 years was partly due
  to its urban planning system, under the Urban Redevelopment Authority in charge of execut-
  ing the land use plans. Concept plans were created in 1971, 1991 and 2001. These plans have
  been the anchor for the 40-year development strategy and are refreshed every decade using
  a state of the art GIS. The 2001 concept plan, for example, starts with a target population
  and cascades down to employment estimates by sector and high-level land use, including
  green field development, mass rapid transit, and distinct infrastructure projects. Plans are
  displayed to the public using physical models and planners consider the views of the public
  before finalizing the content. Singapore uses more than 300 professionals and $160 million
  with the planning structure.

  London: The Greater London Authority (GLA) and individual borough councils share the re-
  sponsibility for urban planning. The GLA creates the 20-year statutory urban master plan. Lo-
  cal development plans should be in line with these guidelines. London plan starts off with the
  city’s vision and population projections. These projections are translated into broad land use
  plan and key initiatives in transportation, affordable housing, basic services and environment
  sustainability. These plans are backed by a financial plan with explicit priorities for financing.
  GLA also takes care of the design aspects and sustainability; the master plan enlists current
  and target GHG emissions and a list of supporting activities.

  New York: New York Department of City Planning, in collaboration with the metropolitan city
  planning commissions, is responsible for the planning of the city five local governments. NY
  estimates a population of 9 million people and 4.3 million jobs by 2030. Based on that, the
  plan provides guidelines for polices and projects for more than 95 activities across six priority
  areas: land use (including housing and open spaces), water supply, transportation, energy, air
  pollution and climate change. The plans are discussed with the communities. For example,
  details are provided in terms of floor area ratio and setback defined for each borough.

        In the United States the political system and political culture provides no basis for a met-

        aid in sectors like transport requires a metropolitan planning organization. This is the case
        of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Florida designates regional water man-
