                This report discusses infoDev’s From Mind to Market methodology that was
                designed to bridge early-stage innovation support gaps and guide promising
                business ideas on the path to sustainability. The multitiered mobile microwork
                innovation competition, “m2Work,” was the pilot for the methodology within
                infoDev’s Mobile Innovation Program. More information on the program can
                be accessed at www.infoDev.org/workprogram.

                organizations, including the Armenian-Indian Center of Excellence, Microsoft
                Innovation Center Armenia, Nokia, Qualcomm, Safaricom, and Samsung.

6   Guiding Ideas from Mind to Market
The m2Work Idea Challenge was supported by Nokia’s IdeasProject team, led
by Pia Erkinheimo. High-level judges for the challenge were Stephanie von
Friedeburg (VP and CIO, Information and Technology Solutions, World Bank
Group), Esko Aho (EVP Corp. Relations and Responsibility, Nokia), Anand Kulkarni
(CEO, MobileWorks), Vili Lehdonvirta, Candace Johnson (Serial Entrepreneur,
Telecommunications and Startup Investment), and Karen Hanrahan (Chief
Innovation Officer, UKaid). Several mLabs staged outreach workshops, which
were particularly effective in Armenia. Finalists received coaching from the
infoDev m2Work team and Nokia representatives. DataRangers helped with
the quantitative analysis of the challenge and a visualization of submissions.

The m2Work Hackathon would not have been possible without proactive
and efficient global facilitation by Young Innovations Pvt. Ltd. of Nepal. The
four mLabs in Vietnam, Armenia, South Africa, and Kenya were strong local
implementation partners. mLabs and Young Innovations in Nepal partnered
with many local organizations to run the hackathon successfully: Nokia Vietnam
and FPT Software in Vietnam; Samsung, Safaricom, Emobilis, Isis Software, and
iHub in Kenya; Microsoft Innovation Center, Arm-Indian Center of Excellence,
Gyumri Information Technology Center, Armenian Datacom Company, and
Red Bull in Armenia; Nokia, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Qualcomm, Vodacom, CSIR,
The Innovation Hub, University of Pretoria, The e-skills Institute, and the South
African Innovation Network (SAINe) in South Africa; Microsoft Innovation
Center Nepal, Google Developers Group (GDG) Nepal, CSIT Association of
Nepal, Robotics Association of Nepal (RAN), Nepal Open Source Klub (NOSK),
LOCUS, and Worldlink in Nepal.

       mLabs

       mLabs      offer      specialized  mobile
       business incubation—in particular,
       physical workspaces and state-of-the-
       art equipment, back-office support,
       testing facilities, and technology-neutral
       platforms. While they also organize
       ecosystem-building programs, their
       focus is on supplying the capital-
       intensive resources small entrepreneurs
       need to test their products, and to
       develop the relevant technical skills and
       business know-how to turn scalable
       mobile solutions into thriving businesses.
       Currently, there are four regional mLabs
       in operation, in Armenia (pictured),
       Kenya, South Africa, and Vietnam.

                                                    mHubs are able to map communities

    Box 2: Why Mobile Innovation for Development?

    Innovation and entrepreneurship are key drivers of development. Among the most vibrant areas
    with potential for entrepreneurship-led growth are mobile applications (called “apps”). Mobile
    phones have created the largest communication and transaction platform in history: around
    three-quarters of the world’s population use mobile phones. Mobile access has been linked with
    economic growth potential. The industry itself boosts the economy by providing high-value
    jobs. The tremendous growth of app usage is forecast to continue and further increase over the
    coming years, implying enormous potential for app entrepreneurs and software developers.
    Mobile apps also catalyze new activity in other sectors, such as healthcare and government.

    App entrepreneurs do face substantial challenges in fledgling innovation ecosystems of
    developing countries. They might have unique insights into local circumstances and abundant
    creativity, but they often lack professional networks, favorable policy environments, information
    access, business skills, mentors, spaces for exchange, and access to investors. In most cases,
    ecosystems also have to integrate policy makers, mobile network operators, investors, donors,
    and so forth, for mobile app entrepreneurs to thrive.

                 incentives for collaboration have to be interwoven                 and not see innovation competitions as a panacea

                 the process. For instance, some of the cash prize

                 money as an investment in an app company,
                 and therefore, they did not take their idea
                 forward after the competition. Another adverse
                 selection problem can be that innovators that
                 derive great submissions from their industry or
                 academic expertise might not find it attractive to
                 commit to turning their submission into a time-

Box 3: Finalists and Spot Prize Winners of the m2Work Idea Challenge

Throughout the m2Work Idea Challenge, four spot prize winners were selected from the pool of ideas submitted before
specific deadlines. They received cash prizes of $1,000. In late April 2012, the jury then chose six finalists—one from each of
the five mLab regions and one from the rest of the world. Each received a cash prize of $2,000, as well as business coaching
and a platform to pitch their refined ideas for a chance to win the grand prize. The finalists’ refined video pitches are available
at http://www.infodev.org/en/article.840.html.

     Box 4: How an Ambitious Idea Makes It to Market: the MicroForester Case

     Alexander Shakaryan’s start-up MicroForester is one of the projects that have potential to become a poster child of the From
     Mind to Market methodology. In spring 2012, Alexander came to an m2Work outreach workshop hosted by mLab ECA
     with no prior knowledge of microwork. After churning out a handful of promising ideas, he quickly saw that MicroForester
     brought him the best feedback from peers and judges, in particular, through recognition as second best submission for the
     fourth Idea Challenge spot prize. Alexander scored the regional finalist prize and the global runner-up position in the Idea
     Challenge, securing him $6,000. The m2Work Hackathon in September 2012 further helped him build national recognition
     and partnerships, ultimately leading to being one of the awardees in the local government’s STEP competition, leading to
     another $15,000 in prize money for MicroForester. In May 2013, Alexander pitched in the Dragon’s Den of infoDev’s Global
     Forum, scoring fifth place and winning another cash prize.

     By the end of 2012, Alexander had shown his commitment to MicroForester, quitting his regular job to pursue the start-up
     idea. While the team has never relied on a formal incubation slot at the mLab, the mLab leadership helped him with in-kind
     contributions, mentorship, and contact building. Notably, no one out of the four original team members is a “pure” software
     developer. Instead, the team used the cash prizes to cover expenses and outsource the major coding tasks in order to
     focus on business and partnership development. The emerging start-up mainly targets the corporate social responsibility
     departments of firms, international development organizations, and local governments that have an interest in both
     employment creation through microwork, as well as reforestation. As of May 2013, the MicroForester team had perfected a
     second version of the app, secured first partnership agreements and grants, and had started the process of obtaining tree
     planting permissions for Armenia. Alexander is now based in London.
