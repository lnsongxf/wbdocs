EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.       The present study is part of an effort by the World Bank and the State of Paraiba to assess
Agriculture Sector Risks as a contribution to the strategic economic development and poverty reduction
agenda of the State Government. It is composed of two phases: an Agricultural Sector Risk Identification and
Prioritization (Volume I) and a Risk Management Strategy and Action Plan (Volume II). The study was
conducted in close collaboration with the Cooperar agency (which is currently preparing a World Bank financed
project) and the Secretary of Agriculture of Paraiba (SEDAP).

2.       Paraiba’s agricultural sector when compared to the total national agriculture GDP, det ains only
0.7% of total production. In relation to the Northeast, the State contributes with 11% of total agriculture GDP.
Nonetheless, agriculture remains an important source of employment for the largest part of the rural population
and the rural population remains vulnerable, in that the impact of a shock will have greater proportional impacts on
welfare of a poor household that on a wealthier one.

3.        The risks in Paraiba’s agriculture are highly concentrated in a few crops that account for more
than 80% of the total agricultural gross output value of the State and 84% of total estimated annual losses
due to realized production risks: sugar cane, pineapple, banana, coconut, cassava, maize and beans. Thus,
the priority value chains and subsectors chosen for the risk management analysis, based on the productive structure
(reflecting relative importance of both crops and production patterns) are: sugar cane; commercial fruit production;
family agriculture; and livestock.

4.       The risk assessment confirmed that there are no risks with critical impact that at the same time are
highly probable (1 in 3 years) or probable (1 in 5 years) in Paraiba but there are several probable and
highly probable risks that cause moderate or high impact when realized. It was observed that the important
issues identified around these main risks–- require comprehensive measures to complement the already existing
federal policies and programs that in some way contribute to manage agricultural risks ( Garantia Safra, price
guarantees, livestock sanitary services, food safety, etc.) and to improve their implementation in Paraiba.

5.       For the sugar cane value chain, the most important risks are: drought; irregular precipitation;
possibility of contamination with the ferrugem laranja disease; and uncertainty about gasoline price. The
sugar cane industry is the most important agribusiness sector and main economic activity of Paraiba. As a result,
any adverse impact on this supply chain has also important financial consequences to the State. For the fruticulture
value chain, the four main risks are: irregular rainfall; pests and diseases; pesticide use without needed technical
knowledge; and inter-annual price variations. The State of Paraiba always stood out among the largest producing
states of pineapple in Brazil, presently ranked as the second largest producer in the country. For the livestock
sector (cattle, sheep and goat mainly), the three main risks are: drought; exotic diseases that affect the world beef
trade; and zoonotic diseases.

6.       Severe drought, irregular rainfall, and pests and diseases are the main risks affecting family
farmers in Paraiba. When the risks are prioritized taking into account the relative importance of family
agriculture in the total number of farmers (there are 148,047 family agriculture farmers in Paraiba out of a total of
167,272 farmers ), it results that those risks are the main risks in Paraiba. Accordingly, the solutions scenario


                                                                                                                    I
presents strong actions directed towards improving risk mitigation among family farmers, such as adoption of
innovative technology, improved agricultural practices and effective marketing mechanisms, as well as better
agroclimatic information management, together with recommendations regarding other sectors of the agriculture in
Paraiba.

7.        The impacts of the aforementioned risks have greater consequences for human welfare among the
individuals, communities and regions of Paraiba that are more vulnerable. The poorest areas of the state, as
measured by earned income per capita, are not necessarily the areas that will be hardest hit by drought. State
transfers for old age pensions and Bolsa Família serve to diversify the poor’s portfolio and buffer the direct effects
of drought.

8.       Approximately R$ 28 million (equivalent to US$ 16 million), or 2.3% of the agricultural GDP, was
estimated as the value of the average production loss annually in the agricultural sector as a result of
unmanaged production risks. Drought was the main cause of these shocks, sometimes in combination with other
events. The calculation involves all crops but the losses are concentrated in the crops whose gross output value
accounts for over 80% of the total agricultural gross output value: sugar cane, beans, banana, pineapple, maize,
papaya fruit and cassava. ). Sugar cane and fruits, especially pineapple, because of their large share in the total
agricultural production value of Paraiba, are the greatest determinants of the agricultural losses.

9.       Average figures tend to conceal the actual catastrophic impact that some shocks have at the time
they occur. For instance, during the 2010 drought, losses amounted to R$ 65 million (against the R$ 28 million
annual average), or 5.4% of the state’s agricultural GDP, and there were much higher losses in previous years: R$
108 million in 1998, R$ 104 million in 1993 and R$ 82 million in 1996. Not surprisingly, the first two years match
with two very severe droughts throughout the state (1998 and 1992-1993).

10.      Losses in terms of the normal production value in 2010 were extreme for important smallholder
crops like beans and maize, accounting for R$ 16 million and R$ 7 million losses respectively. In the same
year, the losses of sugar cane and banana reached R$ 18 million and R$ 13 million respectively. In total these four
crops accounted for 83% of the total losses in 2010.

11.     The first phase of the assessment identified the following risk management intervention areas to
address priority risks: (i) strengthening State rural extension and technical assistance system including both
production and marketing aspects; (ii) review and reinforce State animal and plant health sanitary system; and (iii)
improve coordination within fruit supply chains, and (iv) develop an integrated agroclimatic information system.
After analyzing a number of programs and projects that are already addressing some of the identified risks along
the above solution areas, came up some gaps and complementary actions.

12.     As a result, the following are the strategic lines identified during the agriculture risk management
assessment – ARM (second phase):

Agroclimatic Risk Information System (ACIS):
   a. Development of a Agroclimatic Database Integrated System in the state of Paraiba including federal
       institutions and AESA
   b. Strengthening of the Drought Management Committee, making actions more proactive and less reactive

    b. Coordination of the animal health and food safety programsfor what?
    c. Establish the actual status of CSF and NCDV in Paraibameaning?
    d. Create the State Agency for Agricultural Healthfor what?

Supply Chain Coordination:
   a. Identify successful farm to market experiences in Paraiba and assess the viability of being replicated
       under a massive technical assistance program
   b. Develop market oriented business development methodologies for training and providing technical
       assistance to associated small scale farmers
   c. Assess different options to support market development for family agriculture products, including
       revision of the legal framework to channel public resources

Agricultural Innovation System (AIS):
   a. Improve the coordination of the Agriculture Innovation System for family agriculture risk management
   b. Improve efficiency of the Agricultural Innovation System for family agriculture risk management -
        Strengthen the research sub-system

        Strengthen the ATER sub-system
   d. Improve efficiency of the Agricultural Innovation System for family agriculture risk management -
        Enlargement of successful programs and projects

13.      The proposed action plan (detailed in the text) reflects the strategic lines and includes some basic
details on who, when and how much is required for the implementation of the actions proposed. The
estimated cost of the ARM Action Plan is a total of US$ 18,881,000 over 5 years, with a strong concentration
of activities within the first two years. Out of this total, US$ 6,081,000 would correspond to studies, training and
pre-investment and US$12,800,000 to program investments. The EMATER’s staff cost is not part of the ARM
Action Plan but it is included as a complementary public policy, as has been mentioned by State policy makers.

INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT
Background
1.      The World Bank and the State of Paraiba conducted an Agriculture Sector Risk Assessment for
agriculture in Paraiba in Brazil. The assessment was composed of two phases. The first phase was an
Agricultural Sector Risk Identification and Prioritization undertaken in June 2014.

2.      Expert interviews, in combination with primary and secondary data and literature, provided the
basis for this Risk Assessment. The work included consultations with state and federal government,
private sector, civil society, and academic stakeholders to inform this analysis and draw a diversity of
perspectives on risk management.

3.      The rapid risk assessment methodology developed by the World Bank involves several phases.
The first phase – the Risk Assessment – provides a diagnosis of the primary risks in the entire
agricultural sector. Risks are classified on the basis of the probability of occurrence and degree of
impact, from which emerge the prioritized risks for the sector and a list of potential management
strategies. Then, those solutions are confronted with the existing programs and projects that somehow
address the agricultural risks, and a set of solutions that fill gaps in current risk management is proposed.

4.      The first phase serves as the basis for planning the second phase of the risk methodology, which
focuses on the development of a Risk Management Strategy and Action Plan. The Action Plan can be
executed in the medium-term to mitigate, transfer, and cope with the risks in the sector. The specific
solutions are developed in depth with stakeholders in response to the first phase’s characterization of
risks.

5.     The second phase of the Agriculture Sector Risk Assessment aimed to develop an Agriculture
Risk Management Strategy by deepening the analysis into the risk management solutions and risk
capacity assessment along the lines of the above priority risk solutions areas.

6.     Figure 1 on the following page provides an overview of the full process of the World Bank’s risk
assessment methodology.

7.      Brazil has developed a portfolio of agricultural risk management solutions (activities and
instruments like Garantia Safra, several EMBRAPA research programs, Price Guarantee programs, etc.)
that involve management of risks such as drought, pest and diseases and prices. These solutions have a
regional or nationwide coverage and their implementation require the participation of many state and
federal institutions. However, there is still room for strengthening the risk management capacity of the
public and private sector, especially through improving policy and program coordination, taking
advantage of synergies and strengthening the support services to the most vulnerable farmers.



                                                                                                           1

8.     The analysis was conducted in close collaboration with the Cooperar agency (which is currently
preparing a World Bank financed project) and the Secretary of Agriculture of Paraiba (SEDAP). This
report presents the findings and conclusions of the second phase of the Agriculture Sector Risk
Assessment.

9.      The study is a contribution to the strategic economic development and poverty reduction agendas
of the State Government. In the immediate term it provides practical elements for the design of the
Sustainable Rural Development project as it helps to incorporate the risk management dimensions into
project investments.

Contents of the Report
10.     This report is comprised of two volumes: (i) Volume 1: Risk Assessment; and (ii) Volume 2:
Risk Management Strategy. Volume 1 continues with Chapter 1, which characterizes the recent
performance of the agriculture sector, including agro-climatic and market conditions. It also identifies
the productive systems used for this analysis. Chapter 2 describes the main risks in the agricultural
sector, capturing market, production, and enabling environment risks along the value chains involved in
the selected productive system typologies. Chapter 3 presents the estimations of the aggregate impacts
of unmanaged agricultural risk on agricultural losses and production volatility. Chapter 4 identifies risk
profiles for different stakeholders, underlying the different types of risk impacts, and then highlights a
vulnerability framework. Finally, Chapter 5 presents a prioritization of risks and proposes a preliminary
set of priority risk management measures. A short list of potential solution actions is offered as the
starting point for a more in-depth solution analysis to be undertaken during the second phase of the risk
assessment.

11.     Volume 2 is composed of four chapters. Chapter one provides a brief discussion on the
agricultural risk profile and risk management options (solutions) in Paraiba and an inventory of current
programs, projects and policies that in different ways address the main agricultural risks. Chapter 2

                                                                                                        2
presents an overview of the key agricultural sector features as are relevant for understanding the ARM
strategy.1 Chapter three presents the ARM strategy with respect to the intervention areas identified
during the first phase, i.e. weather information system, Sanitary and Phytosanitary System (SPS), supply
chain coordination, and Agroclimatic Information Systems, including concrete risk management actions.
Chapter four incorporates detailed information on the proposed actions aggregated in strategic lines. It
includes information about the estimated cost of the actions, the responsible institution and the
timeframe. Moreover, a second table provides a short term calendar by institution.

CHAPTER 1: PARAIBA’S AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM

Agriculture Sector Overview and Performance
1.     Located in the Northeastern region, the State of Paraiba occupies an area of 56,469.47 km² and
has 223 municipalities. Its neighboring states are Rio Grande do Norte, to the North, Ceara to the west,
Pernambuco to the south, and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, with approximately 135 km of coast. The
climate of Paraiba is tropical humid on the coast, with abundant rainfall. Inland the climate becomes
semi-arid and subject to prolonged droughts and low rainfall.

2.      The services sector generates the majority of revenues in Paraiba, accounting for 74% of the
State’s GDP (2011)2, mainly driven by public services and trade. The agriculture and livestock sector,
represents 5.7% of the State’s economy (2009)3 (3.7% corresponds to agriculture and forestry and 2% is
livestock production). It is comprised mainly of plantation of sugarcane, fruits (such as pineapple,
banana, coconut, among others), cassava (manioc), maize and beans, and livestock production
(composed mostly of goats and bovines).

3.      Due to harsher climate conditions found in the semi-arid inland, most agricultural lands are
located in the coastal regions. Figure 2 below shows the distribution of the crop production value among
the different municipalities, with concentration of production value in the regions with better
agroecological conditions, near the coast (municipalities of Mata Paraibana and Agreste Paraibano, in
particular in the micro-regions of Brejo Paraibano, Esperança and Campina Grande, and in some
municipalities of Serra de Teixeira and Sousa regions). The lowest production densities are fond in the
Borborema and Sertão Paraibano regions, where livestock raising predominates (see location of regions
in Figure 5 in next Section).

4.      Paraiba’s agriculture share is very low, 0.7% as compared with total national agriculture GDP
and 11% as compared with the Northeast agriculture GDP, as it is a small state with limited
agroecological conditions for agriculture. In spite of the continuous growth of Paraiba total GDP
throughout the past decade, the agricultural sector has performed poorly. Figure 3 shows the declining
trend of the agricultural and livestock GDP share of total GDP of the State.

Figure 3: Paraiba - Share of agriculture and livestock GDP of total GDP of the State




5.       Until the second half of the last century the Paraiba economy was mainly agriculture based:
agriculture GDP was 56% of total State GDP in 1961 and most of the labor force was employed in
agriculture. Several factors contributed to agriculture losing relative importance in the economy of the
State, including the increasing urban employment associated to rural-urban migration; the modernization
of agriculture and the consequent reduction of demand for workers; the decline in cotton and sisal
production during the 70s and 80s as result of increasing demand for synthetic fibers and the bicudo
(boll weevil) pest attacking cotton crop, which was partially compensated by increasing area under
pineapple production; and, above all, the periodic droughts that caused long term decline in the
production capacity of many farming systems. Cattle production is still one of the major agricultural
activities in the state and stands out as one of the most important enterprises in large farms.

6.     In spite of its current relatively low share in the total State economy, agriculture remains an
important source of employment for the largest part of the rural population. In effect, out of the 3.7
million inhabitants of Paraiba, 0.9 million live in rural areas (IBGE, Census 2010). Of these, it is
estimated that between 74% and 92% are engaged in agriculture and, are mainly family agriculture
farms -according to the Agricultural Census of 2006, there are 167,272 farms (IBGE) of which 92%
have less than 50 hectares.



                                                                                                      6
7.      Drought is a recurrent event in Northeast Brazil. Drought has a strong negative impact on family
livelihoods as it represents a challenge in terms of food security; crops such as maize and beans and may
cause important losses of livestock. Figure 4 shows the performance of overall agricultural GDP of
Paraiba, with clear evidence of the drought effect.

8.     It should be noted that the social impact of drought is especially aggravated by the fact that
peasant families represent more than 90% of the farmers in Paraiba and irrigation is not widespread -
though the participation of small farms in the total irrigated area has increased over recent years (see
Text Box 1).4

Figure 4: Paraiba - Agricultural and livestock GDP Growth rate




9.      The food security implications of drought would have been severe, had it not been for the safety
nets in place such as Garantia Safra and other government programs (discussed in detailed in the
following pages). Furthermore, the very limited diffusion of irrigation in Paraiba, with only 6.8% of
farms in 2006, makes the precipitation irregularities and recurrent droughts particularly decisive in
agricultural production and food production.

Text Box 1. 1: Irrigation in Paraiba

According to the Agricultural Census of 2006, 11,419 farms, or 6.8% of all farms in Paraiba, had
irrigation facilities, with coverage of 58,683 hectares or 1.6% of all farms’ area. Compared with the
1995/96 Agricultural Census, the number of farms with irrigation facilities increased by 25% but the


4
    Farms with less than 50 hectares account for 91.8% of total farms, but occupy about 27.9% of total area.


                                                                                                               7
irrigated area decreased by 7.7%. The explanation for this may be found in the vulnerability of the
watersheds, as discussed below.

Eighty one per cent of the farms with irrigation infrastructure have less than 10 hectares (9,300 farms or
8% of all farms with less than 10 hectares). However, larger farms (those with more than 500 hectares)
with irrigation represent only 0.2% of the total farms with irrigation (24 farms or 2% of all farms with
more than 500 hectares) but have more than 20,000 hectares under irrigation or 35% or the total irrigated
area. Therefore, irrigation is not a widespread practice in Paraiba, particularly among large scale
farmers.

There are twelve irrigation schemes in Paraiba developed by the government, with 12,516 hectares of
irrigated area that are intended to benefit 2,000 families. The Federal Government through the National
Department Infrastructure Against Drought developed three of them and the other schemes belong to the
State Government.

However, there are several restrictions on the use of available water resources due to watershed
vulnerability to drought events (quantitative aspects) and restrictions related to water quality (hard water
and water salinity levels). In terms of water quality, a study conducted by the Government of Paraiba 5
found that there are moderate restrictions to human consumption and strong restrictions for industrial
purpose use. Restrictions are also present in the use of water for crop irrigation, especially in the
watersheds of Jacu, Curimataú, Seridó, Espinharas and the sub-watershed of Taperoá, where the
misuse of irrigation water may cause soil salinization, reduce soil water infiltration capacity, plant
toxicity, and corrosion on irrigation equipment. Furthermore, lessons learned from irrigated programs
that have been implemented in Paraiba suggest that caution should be taken when promoting these types
of investments due to collateral damages, including: soil salinization, impossibility of selling all the
agricultural production due to an increase of the supply, low profit margins due to high energy costs, etc.


Agro-Climatic Conditions
10.     Like in most parts of Northeast Brazil, Paraiba has the following main agroecological zones: the
Mata zone, the Agreste zone and the Sertão zone (see Figure 5). In the Mata zone there are two
important factors for agriculture: high precipitation (over 1,400 mm annually), and relatively fertile
soils. This region has been, since colonization, largely dedicated to sugar cane produtction. The Agreste
zone is located inland in the Borborema Highlands (between the Mata and Sertão zones), with an
average annual precipitation around 700 mm, distributed irregularly but concentrated in the period
March to August (which is the season of least evapotranspiration), with mild night temperatures. The
Sertão zone presents higher temperatures, and rains occur during the hottest months. In the Agreste

zone, as well as in the Sertão zone, the dry season is long, lasting six to seven months and seven to eight
months, respectively, with severe droughts every 10 or 11 years. In the Agreste zone, the landholdings
are smaller (approximately 40 hectares in size), and greatly engaged in dairy production.

11.    In general, it is known that several phenomena have strong influence on the rainfall pattern
within the Northeastern region of Brazil. One is the Southern Oscillation of El Niño (ENSO), a global
phenomenon that may cause severe droughts or excess of rainfall conditions depending on its intensity.
In general, the different phases of ENSO relate to years with below or above normal rainfall conditions.

                                                                                                         9
However, Northeast Brazil has experienced severe drought events that are not necessarily related to the
ENSO, but to the influence of different atmospheric systems that cause rainfall in this region.6 Other
phenomena are: the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the Atlantic Ocean, Easterly Winds, the Sea
Level Pressure (SLP); the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITZC) – one of the most important factors
that determine how generous or deficient rainfall conditions are going to be reported in the northern
areas of Northeast Brazil;7 Cold Fronts, recorded between November and January (cold fronts are
organized bands of cloud created in the areas where there is a confluence of cold and hot air masses);
and the Upper Tropospheric Cyclonic Vortices that are originated in the Atlantic Ocean between
November and March and they move from east to west more often between January and February. In
addition, the effects of sea breeze also influence rainfall conditions: continental areas record rainfall
values as low as 300 mm compared to the coast (around 1,400 mm annually). The sea breeze, which
may affect up to 100 Km inland, is due to the difference in temperature values recorded between sea
surface (low temperature) and mainland (high temperature).

12.     The rainfall spatial variability experienced in Paraiba in combination with strong temporal
rainfall erraticism generates not only dry spells but also severe drought conditions and even flooding.

Agricultural Production and Market Trends

13.     The area planted with food security crops has shown a declining trend over the last two decades,
especially maize, beans and cassava (see Figure 6 on the following page). Maize and beans, being
cultivated for family subsistence in marginal lands, are subject to strong variability in terms of area and
output. On the contrary, sugar cane, the main crop planted in Paraiba, considering production value, had
a positive performance after 2000, driven by the opening of the European market, the reduction of
Indian production and the oil price increase during the 2000s (US$ 19/barrel in 2001 and US$ 132/barrel
in 2008). Pineapple planted area also presented significant increase between 1996 and 2008. In turn,
yields of all crops have tended to increase or remain relatively stable over the time though showing a
great variation between years, due to the effect of recurrent droughts.

14.     Livestock production in Paraiba is very dependent on the particular semi-arid agroclimatic
conditions. The size of bovine stock has remained almost unchanged over the last two decades (1990 to
2011) at 1.3 million heads contrasting with the national trend (bovine stock increased from 147 million
to 212 million at national level over the same period). In turn, heads per hectare increased by 25%
during the last ten years.

15.    Differently to the bovine stock, goat stock increased significantly during early 2000s (see Figure
7 on the following page), as goats are more adaptable to the semi-arid climatic conditions in Paraiba, but
decreased between 2005 and 2010.

 In general, the ITZC traditional moves to the North between August-October, to the South of the Atlantic basin between
February-April; nevertheless, its position as well as its intensity is conditioned upon the SST.

CHAPTER 2: AGRICULTURE SECTOR RISKS

16.     Agriculture is inherently variable as producers may incur in moderate losses every year due to
sub-optimal climatic conditions at different times thorughout the production cycle or to other production
related factors. For the purpose of this report, production risks refer to the more severe and unpredictable
adverse events that occur besides these smaller events. They are measured by per yield reductions with
respect to the linear trend line greater than 33% of the standard deviation (see details in Chapter 4). Also
modest departures from expected prices may cause moderate losses that are not considered risks but
unexpected significant price drops is an important risk affecting all actors along the supply chain. The
price variations are measured and compared using the coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean).

17.     The state of Paraiba has suffered from severe droughts, which are reported by stakeholders as the
most damaging production risk for all crops. Severe droughts should be differentiated from the recurrent
(annual) droughts in the Semi-arid, which are not a risk, but can be regarded as a constraint given their
predictability. In addition, erratic rainfall is frequent but of moderate or low impact. The damaging
impact of pests and diseases is significant when they are not properly mitigated. Historically, they have
been particularly devastating when new pests/diseases arrived and the State technology support services
were not prepared to respond adequately (e.g.. cotton boll weevil). Livestock sanitary risks are very
relevant. Northeastern export crops, in particular sugar cane, have their prices largely determined by
prices in the international and national markets. Northeast producers are price takers.

18.     Risks are highly concentrated in a few crops that account for far more than 80% of the total
production value of the state and 84% of the total estimated annual losses due to realized production
risks in the last 20 years (see detailed calculation in Chapter 4): sugar cane, pineapple, banana, coconut,
cassava, maize and beans. They are particularly important both for family food security and for the
sustainability of commercial farming. Table 1 shows the relative importance of the main crops in
Paraiba in terms of contribution to the State agricultural production value.

19.     Based on this productive structure, that reflects the relative importance of both crops and
production patterns, the following are the productive systems were chosen for the risk management
analysis: sugar cane, commercial fruit production, family agriculture, and livestock -this analytical
structure was discussed and agreed with the project Cooperar. Table 2 presents a summary of the
information on these productive systems and their most important risks (further discussed along this
Chapter).

for the selected supply chains covering the referred major production systems in the state of Paraiba.
The impact of the adverse events on different stakeholders is discussed in Chapter 5.

Sugar Cane Supply Chain


Overview of supply chain                       Figure 8: Sugarcane Producing Regions in Brazil

21.     Brazil is the largest worldwide
producer and exporter of sugar and the
second largest producer of ethanol.
Sugarcane cultivation in Northeastern
Brazil– including Paraiba – dates back to
the 16th century. During the 20th century,
the sugarcane chain became more
dynamic, especially by producing ethanol
besides sugar, and progressively moved
to the Southeastern and Central regions of
Brazil. South-Central Brazil is the heart
of the country’s sugarcane industry, with
90% of the country's cane and sugar
output. Areas marked in red in Figure 8
indicate where sugarcane is harvested

                                                                                                        15
and, sugar, ethanol and bioelectricity plants are located. The relative importance of the production in the
Northeastern region has progressively reduced but still remains very important for the economy of the
Northeastern states, such as Paraiba.

22.     The sugar cane industry (cane plantation and processing in usinas – sugar cane processing
plants) is the most important agribusiness sector and main economic activity of Paraiba. Historically,
sugarcane was mainly for sugar production, but today a large proportion is directed to the production of
ethanol (biofuel). Most plantations are distributed along the coast, but there are a few small farms in the
Agreste, which produce cachaça (alcoholic beverage) and rapadura (large tablets of brown sugar). In
Paraiba there are 8 usinas and 1,935 farmers producing sugar cane, 95% being small and micro-
producers, in 36 municipalities.8 However, large and medium scale producers (less than 5% of the total),
including the usinas nucleus land, with a production scale of over 5,000 tons/year, contribute to about
55% of the total output. ASPLAN (Sugar Cane Farmers Association of Paraiba) calculates that during
the 2012/13 seasons the sugar sector in Paraiba provided employment (direct and indirect) to more than
63,000 people.

23.     The yield of rain fed sugarcane in the region is lower than the Brazilian average, mostly due to
rainfall irregularity. In particular, if compared to the crop grown on Southeastern and Western regions.
The average yield in the state is estimated at 50 tons per hectares, but in irrigated areas productivity can
be higher than 100 tons per hectare, as a result of reducing water supply uncertainty. In addition, when
the hydric stress is managed, there is a better environment for investing in other agricultural practices,
like fertilizing, crop management, pest control, all of which contribute to higher yields and reduced
production risk. Thus, the stakeholders reported rainfall irregularity as the main risk for the sugar cane
sector, affecting both producers and processing plants. Farmer association leaders and some industrial
entrepreneurs stated that the lack of appropriate public policies was a main issue, alongside climate
irregularity, determining the uncertainty on sector sustainability.

Production risks – Climate risks
24.     One of the risks that constantly affects the value chain in a significant manner is drought. For
instance, prolonged dry conditions recorded in 2012 reduced by 25% the State sugarcane production.
According to ASPLAN, the rainfall values recorded in 2012 during rain gauges were up to 36% below
average (1,484 mm). Figure 9 shows the years where drought caused yields to fall. In addition, irregular
precipitation (heavy rainfall followed by extended dry spells) can cause great damage to rain fed sugar
cane, mostly affecting smallholders and some large scale usinas where irrigation facilities are not
present.

25.    Climate change may be responsible for the increasing incidence of periodic droughts in Paraiba,
but no clear evidence exists. See Annex 1 for more details. Climate change signifies shifts in
temperature and rainfall regimes, which affect agricultural productivity by shifting suitable area for

agricultural production, altering agricultural yields, changing water availability, and producing
conditions that increase the likelihood of plant pathogens.

26.    Given that the sugar cane sector is one of the largest contributors to the state’s agricultural GDP,
any adverse impact on this sector leads to great losses within the supply chain (as shown in Chapter 4)
and also important financial consequences to Paraiba due to the amount of taxes collected.9

27.     Although several years have also recorded extreme drought events in the past, the 2012 year was
particularly dry from March (-57%) to May (-38%), August (-77%) to September (-89%), and
November (-90%) to December (-85%). Also, the drought conditions experienced in 1998 were as
severe as the ones experienced in 2012, and can be explained by the extended drought conditions from
June (1997) to May (1998). As a result, the crop yields at state level reduced by up to 17% of the
historical mean.10

28.     The estates owned by the sugar cane processors tend to have a fairly large quantity of irrigated
land available (with water from rivers accumulated in reservoirs). This allows them to obtain very high
yields in normal and drought years and, above all, allows plants to work at high capacity even in drought
years.

Production risks - Pests and diseases
29.     There are three major insect pests attacking sugarcane in Paraiba: the broca do colmo, broca
gigante and cigarrinha. Their presence is very frequent, but impact is relatively low, as farmers suitably
manage the pests. On the farms owned by the sugar cane processors there is an intensive use of
biological control, which includes parasitic wasps and fungi that parasitizes the insect pest. The
biological agents, both wasps and fungi, are produced by the processors on their own laboratories, and
sprayed or released on their own farms. There is only occasional need to supplement the biological
control with pesticide applications.

30.     On the other hand, among the small-scale farmers supplying the usinas, there is a more intensive
use of pesticides, as they do not have scale to implement and maintain a biological laboratory to produce
the wasps and fungi used for pest control. A way to improve their pest control practices would be to
implement laboratories operated by the Sugarcane Farmer Association (Associação dos Plantadores de
Cana da Paraiba), sharing costs and the inputs in order to produce the biological control agents. This
approach would not only be advantageous from the economic standpoint, but would also be more
environmentally friendly.

31.     In regards to diseases, there is a serious potential phytosanitary threat to the sugarcane
production in Paraiba, due to Ferrugem Laranja. This disease was recently detected in sugarcane
plantations in São Paulo and, to date, there is no assessment of its impact. In other countries where it is
present - like in Australia - the impact is rated as high. It is very difficult to anticipate when and if the
disease will be introduced in Paraiba, and once introduced if the fungus will adapt to the environmental
conditions and effectively become a serious threat. Nevertheless, considering its potential damaging
impact for Paraiba, this disease risk should be considered of high impact.

Price volatility risks.
32.     Sugar cane price volatility is not high in general, both in Paraiba and in Brazil, in spite of the
higher volatility of sugar price in the international market. In effect, sugar cane prices are negotiated
between producers and buyers and changes in the relative prices between sugar and ethanol result in
shifts of industrial output between the two sugar cane products, ethanol and sugar. That type of
industrial decision is possible in Paraiba because most processing plants are mixed plants capable of
producing both ethanol and sugar. They also tend to cogenerate electricity. All in all the sugar cane
industry is efficient at both processing and farm level.

33.    The different actors along the supply chain (farmers’ association – ASPLAN – and the
processing plants), agree on a reference procurement ATR (Açúcares Totais Recuperáveis) price. The
determination of the reference price takes into account the international price of sugar (in the New York
and London markets) and ethanol price (mostly domestically determined as follows the domestic price
of gasoline) as well as production costs, and is based on information provided by technical organizations
such as CEPEA and DATAGRO. Figure 10 below shows the domestic and international prices of sugar
and ethanol.

                                                                                                          18
Figure 10: Domestic and International Prices of Sugar and Ethanol




34.     In spite of the volatility of the sugar and ethanol prices (international sugar price varied a
hundred per cent in 2010-11), the variation of the sugar cane reference price is relatively low as can be
seen in Figure 11, showing the price for the last five years during the marketing season months (August-
April).

35.    The coefficient of variation of the sugar cane reference price for any of the months during the
period 2009/10-2013/14 does not exceed 13% and the average for the marketing season is 6% (Table 3
below).

Enabling environment risks.
36.     The Government of Brazil has been trying to control inflation by suppressing gasoline prices
below international levels. This approach has made ethanol less competitive than gasoline for flex-fuel
cars, because the price of ethanol is relatively higher at the pump stations. In 2008, 50% of the fuel sold
in Brazil was ethanol. Now, it is just above 30%, a drop that is particularly painful to the ethanol
industry. Some have called this “the biggest crisis in the history of ethanol”11: about 50 sugar cane
processing plants have gone out of business in three years in Brazil, leaving about 400 nationwide.
Furthermore, PETROBRAS, the national oil company, is reported to be under financial stress. It is not
publically known what will be the following steps in terms of government intervention in the
determination of fuel prices. This uncertain policy environment prevents appropriate farming and
industrial planning and represents a risk to the sugar industry in Paraiba as a whole. In addition, there is
uncertainty about exchange rate and the general price index, which poses an important risk of
unpredictable cost variability.

37.    Moreover, since the Brazilian sugar cane industry is the largest and most diversified in the
      12
world, public policies in Brazil may have a direct and significant impact on the world market. The
mission, however, did not carry out any analysis on the possible impact of the ethanol policy on the
sugar and ethanol world market.

Fruticulture Sector

Overview of Subsector
38.    Fruit production in Paraiba includes grapes, citrus, banana, mangaba, mango, coconut and
pineapple. They are produced in specific regions of Paraiba. The most important fruit grown in Paraiba,

12
  Sugar and ethanol are Brazil’s third-largest agricultural export group (after soybeans and meat). Brazil’s market share in
world’s sugar production and export was 25% and 50% respectively in 2010.


                                                                                                                           20
in terms of production value, is pineapple. Pineapple is massively exported out of Paraiba and traded in
the Recife Market (main) and the wholesale market of João Pessoa.

39.     Brazil stands out as the largest global producer of pineapple, annually growing 86,630 hectares,
with a current production of 1.5 billion fruits. The state of Paraiba always stood out among the largest
producing states, presently ranked as the second producer. Until the second half of the twentieth century,
the cultivation of pineapple in Paraiba was concentrated in the municipality of Sapé and its surrounding
region, located in the transition of the Coastal Plains to the Seridó meso-region. In recent decades, the
planted area shifted closer to the Coastal areas. One of the causes of the movement is the incidence of
fusariose disease, which has caused great damage and disincentive for its growing in the traditional
producing region.

40.     In the assessment by municipality, the first producer of pineapple is Itapororoca with
approximately 3,000 ha, followed by Araçagi with 2,200 ha and Lagoa de Dentro with 550 ha. Santa
Rita, a small municipality in the outskirts of João Pessoa is the fourth most important pineapple
producer region of the State. Leveraged by a more organized production chain, it is quickly growing and
the trend for the short term is that Santa Rita will surpass Ipapororoca as the first producer.

41.     There are factors that limit technological improvement of the pineapple production chain, such as
the lack of information that contributes to management inefficiency and the poor supply chain
coordination, with the exemption of few cooperatives. In present days, the high and rampant use of
pesticides along with the flow of residential waste and pesticide containers, are among the biggest
environmental concerns. The cultivation of pineapple depends on chemical pesticides.

42.     The production of pineapple in the municipality of Itapororoca is predominantly marketed to
middlemen (atravessadores). Part of the production is sold in the Northeast and the rest is exported to
the Southeast. Taking advantage of the situation of indebtedness and lack of specific public policies to
support farmers, atravessadores buy pineapple production from the grower before harvesting, after the
first application of fertilizer. They do not care about the preservation of the environment, the working
conditions and health of the workforce, or the sustainable local development and even less with the
sanity of the product for the final consumer. A report from CONAB foresees in the medium term a
reduction of the planted area in the region, consequence of the lack of incentives for small farmers to
improve production. That could explain why production is shifting from Itapororoca to Santa Rita,
where better supply chain coordination exists partially with help from APL programs.

Production Risks - Climate
43.     Irregular rainfall is a recurrent risk for fruit production. Recently, the drought conditions
experienced between August 2012 and March 2013 caused severe problems in the pineapple sector.
Production losses were between 20%-25%; in addition, the quality of the products was also affected as
the size of most pineapples did not meet the standards required by the market. The drought conditions
reported between 2012 and 2013 also impacted on other crops, such as coconut. In the municipalities of
Sousa and Aparecida, around 60% of the total coconut plantations was lost and the level of production

                                                                                                       21
registered in 2013 only met 10% of its historical values. In contrast, coco plantations located near the
coast did not registered plant losses but the decline in production was around 20% to 25% (FAEPA,
2013).13

Production risks – Pests and diseases
44.     Insect pests like the broca do olho do coqueiro (coconut) and the disease sigatoka amarela
(banana) are highly frequent but result in low impact. Both the broca and the sigatoka are satisfactorily
managed by cultural practices, including pesticide application. Citrus, mango and mangaba are
frequently attacked by the fruit fly mosca negra dos citrus. Trapping or insecticide applications are used
to control the pest. The impact of this pest is considered as moderate, along with the pineapple disease
fusariose that attacks the crop almost every year. Control of the pest can be made by means of cultural
practices (clean seedlings, eradication of contaminated plants), use of resistant varieties or spraying of
recommended fungicides. As long as these pests are adequately and massively monitored they could be
considered as constraints rather than risks. However, no clear evidence on this exists.

45.     Quarantine pests like the disease sigatoka negra (bananas) and cancro bacteriano (grapes), not
yet present in Paraiba, may be extremely damaging if introduced in the fruit regions of Paraiba. Consider
the devastating effect that boll weevil had on cotton production explained in the Text Box 2 below.
Strong actions of the SEDAP (Phytosanitary department of the Paraiba Government), aligned with the
Federal authorities, are considered paramount to avoid the introduction of these and other quarantine
pests in the state.

46.     Finally, a phytosanitary risk considered as probable and with high impact arises from the use of
pesticides without the necessary technical knowledge and skill. The result is that farmers may face
increased production costs, ineffective pest control and human and environmental hazards as well as
fruit contamination with pesticides residues, a risk for consumers.

Text Box 1. 2: The boll weevil and the cotton crisis in northeastern Brazil – A story to remember

Cotton cultivation in Brazil dates back to the colonial era, in the sixteenth century. The Northeast of
Brazil, especially the State of Paraiba had always been a leading producer and processor of cotton
fiber. Both in the Northeast, as well as in the Southern states of São Paulo, Paraná and Mato Grosso
do Sul, where cotton was widely grown until 1990, it was characterized as a smallholder crop, with
intensive use of labor force. This reality dramatically changed in the late 1980s, with the entry of
the boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis), known in Brazil as bicudo do algodoeiro, a global major
pest for this crop.

The first record of the boll weevil presence in Brazil is from nearby Jaguariúna and Campinas (State
of São Paulo), in February 1983, and subsequently its presence was detected in Paraiba (July 1983).
The most solid evidence suggests it was introduced from Southeastern United States, as a

                                                                                                          22
contamination carried by aircraft, and not by natural expansion of the insect, since the initial
infestation was found in cotton fields near Viracopos International Airport, in São Paulo. The initial
boll weevil infestations in the Northeast area of Brazil were found in the State of Paraiba,
municipality of Inga (July 4th, 1983), most likely due to a secondary introduction from the infested
area of São Paulo. By December of the year, over 90% of the cotton cultivated area was infested
with boll weevil in the State of Paraiba.

Given the rapid expansion of the pest in the state of Paraiba, as well as on the entire cotton
producing surrounding states, there was no way to eradicate the insect and allow the continuity of
cotton cultivation. The entry of the pest required a large number of pesticide applications, which
increased the cost of production beyond the financial capacity of family producers. As such, cotton
profitability in the region fell, resulting in the abandonment of cotton cultivation in Paraiba and
other northeastern states. As a result of the boll weevil infestation, there was not only economic loss
but also unemployment on a historically poor region. The cotton industry, already weakened by the
boll weevil infestation, was further affected in the early 1990s, by the intense and abrupt reduction
of import tariffs, which created an unfavorable situation for the Brazilian fiber.

The result was: reduction in the domestic production from one million tons in 1981 to 420,000 tons
in 1993; increase in imports, which reached nearly 500,000 tons in 1993 (through the mid-1980s,
Brazil was not only self-sufficient in cotton but a major exporter; the cotton area was reduced from
4.1 million hectares in 1981, to 1.3 million hectares in 1995; in the Northeastern region, the area
planted dropped from 3.2 million hectares in 1976/77, to 1.2 million hectares in 1986/87; in the first
ten years following the boll weevil introduction, the cotton acreage reduction eliminated 800,000
jobs (over one million workers in 1985 to 385,000 in 1994), leading to a massive rural exodus;
disappearance of cotton cultivation in Northeast Brazil, with the exception of the Cerrado of
Western Bahia, where it is currently grown in large farms, using top technology, intense
mechanization, with low demand for labor force. Currently, no smallholders produce cotton in
Brazil, due to the high costs of boll weevil control. According to an evaluation made by Santos et al
(2001),14 the private losses due to the boll weevil between 1984 and 1990 were estimated to be over
R$ 11 billion.

Price volatility risk.
47.    Pineapple and banana are among the fruits that are most largely produced and traded in Paraiba.
They are both traded at the wholesale market in Joao Pessoa, EMPASA: the mission visited EMPASA
and held discussions with several traders. Due to of this interaction, and the analysis of price data
provided by the management of EMPASA, it was possible to obtain some conclusions on the price

behavior of pineapple and banana. The inter-annual price variations of both pineapple and banana
largely respond to the changes in production and traded volumes. In effect, the price fluctuates are
inversely proportional to the volumes traded in most years. For instance, the 2005 drought in the
pineapple producing areas caused a significant reduction in the availability of product and an important
increase in price (Figure 12 below).

48.    The correlation coefficient between the annual average prices and the volumes traded is -64%,
which is considerable high and, in spite of the few observations available (2004-2012), it is a reasonably
good indication of the causality of the two variables.

49.     Lower price volatility would be possible under more coordinated supply chain arrangements and
stronger cooperative organization that allow for better production and marketing planning, as is the
experience in Santa Rita with pineapple production. Efforts should be made to strengthen farm to market
coordination with a view to achieve better production planning and less output volatility, possibly
making an extensive use of the APL (Arranjos Produtivos Locais) approach, which has been very
positively assessed in Brazil.15 However, this will have to be assessed during the solutions assessment
mission.

Family Agriculture in Semi-arid Zone

Overview of Subsector
50.     Family farming (agricultura familiar) is formally defined in Brazil16 in terms of area,
management, labor, and income. The family must manage the farm, and the family must rely on
agriculture as their principal source of income. According to the 2006 Agricultural Census there are
148,077 family farmers in Paraiba (or 91% of the total farmers) covering 1,596,273 hectares,
corresponding to 42% of the total area17; two-thirds of family farmers have land title. Figure 13 below
shows the land tenure structure in Paraiba.

Figure 13: Agriculture Establishments and Landholdings, Paraiba (2006)

51.     Family farmers in Paraiba grow temporary crops like: cassava, maize, and beans, on small, rain
fed, plots. Especially in dry regions, small farmers raise small animals, commonly goats. Native trees
and vegetation provide firewood, fodder for animals, and fruits like umbu and nuts like cashew, part of
the nutritional security. Family farmers are spread throughout Paraiba but concentrated in the semiarid
macro-region, encompassing the Borborema, Sertão Paraibano, and Agreste Paraibano meso-regions.
Family farmers often use fundos de pasto, or communal pasture regimes, to feed goat and sheep
livestock herds. However, these areas often have insecure tenure regimes and are vulnerable to
usurpation from competing ranchers. In addition, since the herds rely on natural vegetation, food for
animals is vulnerable to drought.


16
   Family Agriculture, agricultura familiar, is defined as a form o production where the interaction of management and work
is predominant; family agricultures drive the productive process, emphasizing diversification and using an main work force,
family labor at times receiving wages (http://www.mds.gov.br/falemds/perguntas-frequentes/bolsa-familia/programas-
complementares/beneficiario/agricultura-familiar).

52.     In general, family farmers are characterized by little land size, poor soils, low precipitation, low
market access due to physical isolation, low access to credit and technical assistance, and low levels of
farmer organization. Some attribute low association participation to a lack of incentives to associate and
a history of patronage arrangements that small farmers depend on to receive emergency relief supplies in
times of drought. Rural credit is concentrated in the wealthier meso-region of Mata Paraibana at 40% of
the value of contracts but 6.65% of the number of contracts. The Semiarid meso-regions evidence
smaller-value contracts.

53.     Family farmers consume their own production and sell it through cash transfers from social
assistance programs provide a significant proportion of family income and allow food to be purchased
outside the household. Livestock provides a particularly important sources of animal protein in meat and
milk, and artisan crafts from animal hides provide supplementary income.

54.     High rates of female-headed households stand out in Paraiba at about 30% in rural areas. A long
history of principally male out-migration to cities leaves family farmering in the hands of women, with
many elder folk and children. The percent of dependents (population under age 15 and over age 65) in
total population exceeds 50% in many regions of Paraiba. Though dependents represent more mouths to
feed that are not economically active, they also help bring in significant income transfers from federal
government programs, mainly the Rural Retirement Pension from INSS, comprising up 17% of the
average rural family income, and Bolsa Família.

Production risks - Climate
55.     Family agriculture is largely based on livestock, though maize, beans and cassava are grown for
self-consumption. By far the most important risk to the production of these crops is severe drought. In
addition to severe droughts, irregular precipitation (heavy rain followed by extended dry spells) is
another climate risk for smallholders, as irrigation facilities are not usual. In the 2011-2012 crop season,
Paraiba represented the fifth largest Federal State in terms of number of small farmers (86,367 farmers
out of a total number of 771,343) enrolled in the Garantia Safra program (See Text Box 3 for further
details about this compensation mechanism). Given that this compensation mechanism only covers
municipalities within the Semi-arid region and that it triggers payout only when the enrolled
Municipality registers severe crop losses due to extreme rainfall events (mainly drought), historical
payouts disbursed by this program could be used as a proxy of drought events that negatively impacted
the small farming sector. Table 4 shows that on average 6 out of 10 years the Garantia Safra program
disburses compensation payouts above 90% of all enrolled municipalities. The analysis of the historical
records of this program shows that the 2011-2012, 2006-2007 and 2009-2010 crop seasons were the
worst ever recorded.

56.     The severe losses recorded by Garantia Safra in 2012 are consistent with the very low
precipitation values reported by AESA. In March 2012, only three cities in Paraiba reported rainfall
indexes above their historical average values for the same period. The rainfall forecasts made at the time
indicated a decrease of up to 40% of the average. As a result, the Government of Paraiba supported
different federal programs in order to alleviate farmer losses. Some of these programs include:
Programa Emergencial de Manutenção do Rebanho Paraibano, Garantia Safra; and Programa Palma
Resistente.18

Text Box 1. 3: Brazil Garantia Safra

The Garantia Safra program was created in 2002 (Law No. 10420, and then it was modified in 2012 by
the Law 12766) with the objective to provide compensations payouts to vulnerable farmers and rural
families who are systematically affected by severe drought events and excess water events, within the
semi-arid region of Brazil. Given that this federal program reduces the effects of extreme rainfall
conditions (mainly drought) it has reduced the need from State Governments and enrolled farmers to
request Federal emergency actions. The total annual cost is distributed among the stakeholders (federal,
state and municipal governments and the farmers), with the Federal Government as main contributor.

The potential beneficiaries of this program are rural families located in the semi-arid region and with:
monthly gross family income of up to 1.5 times minimum wage; plant between 0.6 and 5 hectares of
beans, maize, rice, cassava, cotton or any other agricultural activity that effectively coexist with the
semi-arid conditions; request their adherence to the program and pay a small contribution to the
Garantia Safra Fund (FGS) for its enrollment.

Operation: The program triggers a compensation payout when crop losses exceed by 50% the average

yield at Municipal level. In this sense, all producers enrolled in the same Municipality will be treated
equally despite registering a different level of losses at individual farming production units. Garantia
Safra compensation payouts are primarily defined by a “hard trigger” scheme, which is an index
parameter that is calculated by the INMET. This index is derived from the calculation of individual crop
water balance models and whose results are extrapolated to Municipal level. Given that rainfall
conditions may vary in space and in time, there may be cases in which there are differences between
what is recorded by the index and what is recorded at the Municipality level. If this happens, a “soft
trigger” scheme is adopted; this means that the state extension service would make field inspections in
order to determine the damages incurred.

Compensation amount: R$ 760 distributed in 5 monthly payouts. One of the main advantages about this
compensation system reported by the beneficiaries is that they receive the payouts directly and they can
use them according to their needs. In addition, the timing of Garantia Safra payouts matches with the
annual schedule of payment of other social benefits that are managed by the Federal Government.

Garantia Safra has shown to be a very popular compensation payout mechanism among small producers
located in the semi-arid region. Over a ten year-period (2002-2011), the number of enrolled
municipalities and enrolled farmers overall have increased 300% and 900%, respectively. On average,
57% of the total municipalities nationwide have received payouts. The less catastrophic year, measured
by the number of municipalities that received payouts, was the 2010-2011 crop season. Interestingly, the
previous and the precedent crop seasons were highly catastrophic where payments were triggered in 9
out of 10 enrolled municipalities.

Production risks - Pests and diseases
57.     Family agriculture crops in the semi-arid (cassava, beans, maize) are susceptible to attacks of
caterpillars or diseases. However, farmers prefer not to use purchased inputs and invest in crops (with
the exception of some infesting weed control). In this manner, they keep the financial cost of mitigating

                                                                                                              28
phytosanitary risks low. In the eventuality of a pest (insect, disease or nematode) attack, smallholders do
nothing and just wait to harvest the remaining production, if any. Their rationale is “why invest on
fertilizers, improved seeds or pest control if the risk of loosing the harvest due to a lack of rainfall is so
high”. The impact is on family food security. Adequate technical assistance would be required to
improve risk management all together and change farmer attitude towards drought risk management and
phytosanitary risk management.

58.    Currently, smallholders usually cultivate a type of cactus called palma forrageira as feed for
goats and sheep and even bovines. A pest called cochonilha do carmim is a serious threat for achieving
higher biomass production, which is fundamental to feed the animals during hydric stress. The State
Government Research Institution (EMEPA) developed a variety that is resistant to the cochonilha and
the public technical assistance (EMATER-PB) is freely distributing this genetic material to family
farmers, to substitute their traditional susceptible varieties, leading to an almost complete control of the
pest.

Price volatility risk
59.     Price guarantees are used to incentivize production and to provide support to poorer farmers.
They are mostly targeted by region, seeking to support poor small farmers (agricultura familiar) and
commercial farmers. See Text Box 4 with details on the current price support and procurement
programs. The result has been more stable prices of basic foodstuffs (like beans, maize, cassava flour,
etc.) that are in turn the main crops grown by the family agriculture farmers. Paraiba, however, is a food
deficit state and frequently maize (basic foodstuff and key feed) is imported using the PEP mechanism
(see Text Box 4 below). These interventions through CONAB, the national food supply agency, have led
to the maintenance of stable prices for consumers even during periods of domestic production scarcity in
the state. The CONAB State Manager mentioned that most often CONAB is unable to meet their
procurement targets because of supply unavailability.

Text Box 1. 4: Brazil - Procurement and price support policies

The Brazilian government operates a series of food procurement and minimum crop price policies
and programs. They are the PGPM (Politica de Garantia de Preços Minimos), which is concerned
with commercial agriculture, and the PAA (Programa de Aquisição de Alimentos) that is
specifically target family farming. The Ministry of Agriculture (MAPA) is responsible for the
former policy, and the latter program is the responsibility of the Ministry of Agrarian Development
(MDA).19 The Federal Government, States and Municipalities implement PAA. The National
Supply Company also executes it – CONAB (Companhia Nacional de Abastecimento), also
participates in the implementation of PGPM. CONAB is a public enterprise that reports to MAPA;
it is responsible for managing several agriculture policies and programs related to the supply and
demand of food products.

19
     MDA is also responsible for the National Program to Strengthen Family Farming (PRONAF).


                                                                                                           29
The PGPM is an instrument that works as a basis for several types of purchasing or financing
operations, always with the objective of supporting producer income. It is used to smooth producer
price variations over time and facilitate trade of agricultural products from the surplus regions to
deficit ones at competitive prices for the producers, particularly in periods of price drop when the
transport cost may represent a serious obstacle for commodity flow across the country. The PGPM
uses different instruments. One is the PEP (Prêmio para o Escoamento de Produto) program,
which involves an “equalization” payment to buyers (wholesalers, processing companies, etc.)
who agree to pay the producer a specified minimum price. The equalization premium (subsidy) is
determined in an auction, with a maximum fixed selling value set by government. This is the most
common instrument. A similar program is PEPRO (Prêmio Equalizador do Produto), which
provides an equalization payment directly to the farmer and works like a deficiency payment by
paying the seller (whether a farmer or a cooperative) the difference between the reference price
and the price received at auction. A third program is PROP (Prêmio de Risco para Aquisição de
Produto Agrícola Oriundo de Contrato Privado de Opção de Venda), which provides a premium
to commercial buyers under a sell option contract, i.e. where delivery takes place in the future (for
instance, coffee). This instrument works as a hedging mechanism for the farmer. The Government
may also operate the Product Outflow Value instrument (Valor de Escoamento de Produto - VEP),
through which the Government grants a subsidy to buyers that intend to buy government stocks to
supply a specific food deficit region that has been prioritized. This instrument would operate when
the market price is higher than the minimum price. Under the PGPM, the government also
purchases from family farmers and their cooperatives (AGF - Aquisições do Governo Federal) at
prices that are above market levels when they are below the minimum prices. The impact of this
program throughout the economy is not supposed to be relevant. Since 2010 family farming has
been entitled to 20% of the resources of the guaranteed minimum price program (PGPM).

The government defines the quality, quantity, value and delivery of the products and establishes
the regions to be supplied on a case by case basis. The Bolsa Brasileira de Mercadorias (Sao
Paulo) and other commodity exchanges operate the government stocks auctions and the CONAB’S
commercial stock auctions. Among the main products included in the PGPM are: cotton, beans,
rice, maize, cassava flour, milk, sorghum, coffee, etc.

PAA was created by Law in 2003. It serves two basic purposes: promote access to food to those in
need and support family farming. The PAA purchases a wide variety of food produced by family
farmers including fruits, vegetables, animal products, etc. The Program is implemented through
different modalities that do not involve a bidding process: Purchase with Simultaneous Donation,
Direct Purchase (CDAF), and Stock Formation by family farming. The Purchase with
Simultaneous Donation involves direct purchase of food from family farmers and simultaneous
free distribution to people in food and nutrition insecurity as well as to those served by social
assistance networks, public facilities for food and nutrition security, and public and philanthropic
education institutions. The CDAF (Compra Direta da Agricultura Familiar) whereby the


                                                                                                        30
government purchases produce from family farmers (enrolled in PRONAF) at subsidized or
market prices (reference prices) to supply populations facing food insecurity. The PAA also
contributes to the formation of stocks of foodstuffs produced by family farmers and of stocks
managed by family farmers´ organizations; farmers’ groups stock part of their production in
exchange for a promissory note that provides farmers access to financial resources.

The budget of PAA consists of funds from the Ministry of Social Development and Fight Against
Hunger (MDS) and the Ministry of Agrarian Development (MDA). Since its conception, the
annual volume of funds invested increased from US$64 million in 2003 to US$434 million in 2012
– an increase of 580%.


Livestock Production Chains
Overview of Subsector and Supply Chain Profile
60.     Cattle production is one of the major agricultural activities in the state and stands out as one of
the most important income generating activities in large farms. Cattle production is mostly extensive and
on semi-arid soils with poor vegetation and low rainfall. According to the Committee for Agricultural
Planning of the State of Paraiba, there are three types of cattle production regions in the State, in regards
to the ecological traits: the Agreste/Litoral region, the Cariri/Curimatau region and the Sertão region.

61.     Dairy production in Paraiba is located in the Agreste /Litoral region, and is considered jointly
with Sergipe, one of the fastest growing milk producing states in the Northeaster Region (Figure 14
below). Milk production is based on extensive grazing with limited animal feed supplementation. In this
system, the ration consists almost entirely of grazed pasture grass. Herds are typically in the 30 –70 cow
size range and consist mostly of crossbred animals. Cows in these herds are usually hand-milked in
parlors.

62.     The sheep and goat production chain has experienced a very significant increase, especially since
the second half of the 1990s (Table 5). This growth occurred due to two main aspects: the first was the
policy of the state government to strengthen these herds by providing resources and technical assistance,
as well as the introduction of new races; secondly, the adoption of the Food Acquisition Program (PAA)
as to ensure market and price for products from livestock strategy (milk, cheese, etc.).

63.    Goat milk production has a very important economic role in the semiarid part of Paraiba State.
Although the productivity of the goat milk industry in this region is low compared with developed
regions worldwide or even with intensive systems in southern Brazil, it is currently the main goat
production region in Brazil and is responsible for approximately 20% of the total Brazilian goat milk
production. Producers are organized in associations and currently 8 small-scale dairy plants exist for the
pasteurization of goat milk.

64.    The swine production chain of Paraiba is relatively small (with small population) and shows a
decreasing tendency over the last three decades. The estimated population in 2011 is 151,702 heads.
However there is a potential to growth in order to supply the state demands, favored by the availability
and the price sustainability of grains.

65.     The poultry production chain had an estimated population in 2010 of 7,7 million broilers and 2,2
laying hens and has had an important increase of 56% since 2000. This increase had been favored by the
price sustainability policy for corn, which facilitates the preparation of low cost feeds. Poultry
production has been a very productive activity for small producers in the rural areas. They are organized
in cooperatives. The small producers are being supported to construct small slaughterhouses to
guarantee that poultry products have official inspection services (meet official commercial criteria) and
can be sold in supermarkets and in interstate markets.

66.    The apiculture production chain is important for the rural population in Paraiba. The areas of
production of honey are the Sertao and Brejo regions. The production is of around 500 tons of honey.
Production is mainly absorbed within the State, through the federal food programs. The remaining
production absorbed by the country and some is occasionally exported to other states. There are around

                                                                                                                   32
40 extraction plants to process the honey. Some of these plants are inspected by the Federal and State
inspection services, which make the honey suitable for the food programs and interstate exportation
market. The main risk faced by apiculture is the drought that kills bees and forces the beehives to
migrate to other areas.

Production risks - Climate
67.     Most stakeholders interviewed by the mission have identified unreliable rainfall in terms of
intensity and distribution as one of the most likely and damaging production risk. Drought also is
acknowledged as a severe risk and one with great potential to cause severe impact to livestock. The most
recent severe droughts affecting livestock production occurred in 1992-1993, 1998, 2001-2002, 2010,
2012-2013. During the drought periods, cattle, goat and sheep, and apiculture have had significant losses
in terms of animals, weight lost and reduction of milk and honey production, among others. It is reported
that during the last drought 80% of the honey harvest was lost and 70% of the beehives migrated. The
State annual production of honey is estimated in 500 tons. The bee producers have good technical
cooperation from EMATER, SEBRAE and COOPERAR among others.

Production risks - Sanitary risks

68.    Animal diseases are significant production risks. Their damaging potential varies among animal
species and is very much correlated to the actual risk management actions in place. On a global level,
there has been a noticeable increase over recent decades in the incidence of exotic animal diseases.
Among the exotic diseases that affect world beef trade, two are most relevant: BSE (Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy or "Mad Cow Disease") and FMD (Foot and Mouth Disease). Paraiba is free of these
major exotic animal diseases, which gives a significant advantage to the Brazilian producers and
exporters. The situation about the principal exotic diseases risks can be summarized as follows.

69.     FMD: In May 2014, Paraiba (and the other Northeastern States: Alagoas, Ceara, Maranhao,
North Region of Pará, Bahia, Pernambuco, Piauí and Río Grande do Norte) was certified by the World
Animal Health Organization (OIE) as an area is free of FMD, with vaccination. In the past, the
presentation of the disease in Paraiba was sporadic and classified as of medium risk. There has not been
a case in more than ten years. Currently this risk has diminished because the bordering states are also
free with vaccination and there is a strict national program to control movement of animals and animal
products in the country, which provides additional protection to prevent the entrance of this disease.20 In
any event, the impact of a disease outbreak could be catastrophic in terms of animal losses, eradication
costs and export earning losses, and thus controls must continue.


20
  There exists a Federal Program for the Eradication of FMD coordinated by the Ministry of Agriculture (MAPA), which
was started in 1998 and is covering 78% of the area and 99% of the cattle and buffaloes stock. There is also an area free of
FMD without vaccination, which covers the State of Santa Catharina. The only states, which are considered infected, are
Amazonas (BR-3), Amapá and Roraima (BR-4), in the North Region of the country. The last outbreak of FMD in Brazil
occurred in Mato Grosso do Sul and Parana in 2006. (Informe de Situación de los Programas de Erradicación de la Fiebre
Aftosa - año 2013 – Documento de trabajo para la COSALFA 41, abril 2014).


                                                                                                                         33
70.     BSE: According to OIE, Brazil´s risk status for BSE is "Negligible", the safest of all. To reach
this status the country presented a risk analysis situation which probes that there are not cases or
possible animals imported from countries where the disease is present or imported feed for cattle
containing cattle meat flour and that has a surveillance and prevention program in place. The major risk
is from the importation of cattle from infected countries and the appearance of atypical cases as it
occurred in Mato Grosso in 2014.

71.     Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI): Paraiba is currently free of HPAI, Asiatic Types, as
the whole country is. However the risk still persists due to the possibility of contamination by wildlife,
as has occurred in other parts of the world.21 In order to prevent entrance of the disease, Brazil has a plan
of action that calls for training of professionals and producers to detect the disease.

72.     Prevalent animal diseases of economic and public health importance: Bovine, Goat and Sheep
Brucellosis is considered by FAO, WHO and the OIE as one of the most important and widespread
zoonosis in the world, causing great economic losses. It can be transmitted to humans causing undulant
fever and joint arthritis syndromes and is a labor related disease because of the contamination of workers
in slaughterhouses. Bovine brucellosis due to Brucella Abortus is endemic and the most prevalent
Brucella infection in Brazil. the National Program for Control and Eradication of Brucellosis and
Tuberculosis Animal (PNCEBT) coordinated by MAPA has been in place since 2001. Each state has to
follow the orientations of the MAPA Federal Program.22 A number of studies and surveys were carried
out in the State of Paraiba to assess the prevalence of bovine brucellosis. The conclusions varied widely:
SEDAP carried out a study in 2013 that indicated the prevalence of bovine brucellosis may range
between 2% to 4% in Paraiba; while an evaluation of the Federal Program carried out in 2010 indicated
there was a decrease in the number of cases of brucellosis in the Northeastern Region from 4.138 to
2.082 (50.3%) between 2001 and 2010. The general conclusion is that bovine brucellosis is still present
in the State of Paraiba and it is both a risk to the animal population and humans (public health).
Regarding the presence of Brucella Mellitensis in goats and sheep, there is no evidence of its presence in
Brazil. Brucella Mellitensis represents an important public health risk because it is transmitted to
humans by goat milk consumption and can cause severe symptoms.

73.    Bovine Tuberculosis is an infectious disease of worldwide distribution caused by pathogenic
Mycobacteria that affect humans and several mammal species. It is also considered by WHO and OIE also
consider it as an important cause of losses to livestock producers and a serious public health risk.
Several studies were carried out confirming that tuberculosis in cattle and goat exists and is a risk to
animal production and public health. Salomon, M. and collaborators carried out a study on bovine
tuberculosis in 2010, which found that: of the herds investigated, 62 (0.57%) had at least one positive

21
   The current international HPAI or “bird -flu” outbreak began in poultry in Southeast Asia and has since spread to Asia,
Europe, the Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. Although many countries have eradicated the virus from their domesticated
poultry, worldwide eradication is not expected in the short term.

animal, and of the animals examined, 136 (0.25%) were positive. Prevalence of tuberculosis in goats it
was found to be 10.7% of positive in 10.7% of herds.

74.     Classical swine fever (CSF):). According to the surveillance system the last outbreak of CSF in
Paraiba occurred in 2006. However, there are risks of introduction because the disease is present in other
Northeastern States. A federal program for the eradication of CSF, coordinated by the MAPA, which has
led to the eradication of the disease in 49% of the territory, 54% of the properties and 81% of the swine
population of the country. As a result, a CSF disease free area has been established which included the
states of the South, Southeastern and South Regions, and the states of Tocantins, Bahia, Sergipe and
Rondonia. The Northeastern States are considered infected and are the next goal of the CSF eradication
program. A survey will be necessary to obtain precise information on the absence of this disease. In
addition, the state animal Health Authorities need to update the prevention and contention programs.

75.      Newcastle Disease Virus (NCDV):). This is a very important poultry disease, which may lead to
serious losses to the producers from killed birds and delays in flock restocking. The State is free of this
disease according to non-official information. However, there are no epidemiological studies to verify
this situation.

76.      Food Safety: There has been an increase in the frequency of outbreaks of foodborne diseases,
making food safety a major concern worldwide. Foodborne diseases pose an important risk because they
endanger public health and can interfere with the domestic and external markets. There is no published
evidence of serious foodborne outbreaks in the state of Paraiba. However, it was found that small
producers do not have enough official assistance to control and inspect their production. This situation
can lead to risks of contaminated products and presentation of foodborne outbreaks. On the other hand,
the lack of official control and inspection system for small producers limit their marketing possibilities.
It also prevents the selling of the production for the federal food acquisition programs (PNAE and PAA)
that requires the products to be officially controlled and inspected. In regards to slaughterhouses, there is
a good federal and state control and inspection service for the large slaughter houses. There is also a
municipal network of slaughter houses, but their status regarding official control and inspections
services is not very clear. From the information gathered there is not a mechanism of coordination
between the Federal, State and Municipal control and inspection services.23

77.     In summary, food safety is a sanitary risk, because there is an incomplete food safety system to
efficiently cover all the steps of the food chain. There is a limited control and inspection service for
small producers and there is no coordination mechanism among the agencies responsible for the control
and inspection of animal food products.

78.     Finally, it is noteworthy that animal health and food safety risks have a significant impact on all
livestock food chains stockholders, including producers, processors, distributors, consumers, exporters
23
   The State Government has taking initial steps to create an Intersectoral Chamber of Food Security and Nutrition
(CAISAN/PB) with the aim to establish the State System of Food Security (SISAN), which will also take care of food safety
aspects.


                                                                                                                      35
and the government. There have not been recent animal health risk events in Paraiba, however there is a
potential risk of occurrence as has occurred in other states of Brazil and countries. In these cases, the
impact on government was very high: costs of the actions of eradication, compensation to the producers,
etc. On the other hand, exporters suffered high losses from the closing of external markets for long
periods of time until the free status was regained.




                                                                                                      36
CHAPTER 3: ADVERSE IMPACTS OF AGRICULTURAL RISKS

Indicative Value of Losses
79.     Agricultural production is subject to relatively normal inter-annual variations and occasional
shocks caused by climate, sanitary and other causes. Shocks have a direct impact on farmers and other
stakeholders in the supply chains, as well as on important fiscal repercussions, reduce the availability of
foreign exchange, reduce household and national food security, and in general have an overall
macroeconomic destabilizing effect. In effect, the inter-annual agricultural output variations are clearly
connected to the overall economy performance (as can be seen in Figure 15 below), although the
intensity of the variations in the agricultural GDP are greater than in the overall economy but the
direction has been the same in recent years.24

Figure 15: Growth Rate Gross Value Added, volume index (2004-2009)




80.    The immediate step for analysis is to distinguish shocks from smaller inter-annual variations in
output. Available data on actual losses is not always accurate or consistent enough to facilitate
comparison and ranking of the costs of adverse events. Analysis was thus based on estimates of the
“indicative” value of losses for the 1990-2010period.

81.     The indicative value of agricultural output lost in a particular year is calculated as the deviation
of the actual yield from the yield trend value. A loss threshold of 0.33 standard deviation from trend is
then set to distinguish between losses due to shocks and those that reflect the normal or relatively easily
absorbable downturns.

24
     Data from IBGE was available only for the years shown.


                                                                                                         37
82.     The yield difference in the years where actual yields were below the loss threshold is then
multiplied by the actual area that year, valued at 2010 producer prices and converted into US$ at the
2010 exchange rate. Indicative loss values are also compared to agricultural GDP in the relevant year in
order to provide a relative measure of the loss.25

83.      The quantification of losses presented in this chapter capture production risks, such as drought
and pest and disease outbreaks. Approximately R$ 28 million (equivalent to US$ 16 million), or 2.3% of
the agricultural GDP, was estimated as the value of the average production loss annually in the
agricultural sector as a result of unmanaged production risks. This percentage is higher than the one
calculated for Bahia (1.9%). Drought was the main cause of these shocks, sometimes in combination
with other events. The calculation involves all crops but the losses are concentrated in the following
crops: sugar cane, beans, banana, pineapple, maize, papaya fruit (mamão) and cassava, affecting all
supply chain actors. As indicated in chapter 3, these crops are responsible for over 80% of state
agricultural GDP and are representative of Paraiba’s agricultural sector risk profile (see Table 6 for
detail information by crop).

84.    Average figures are useful to understand the aggregate costs of production risk. However, they
tend to conceal the actual catastrophic impact that some shocks have at the time that they occur. For
instance, during the 2010 drought, losses amounted to R$ 65 million (against the R$ 28 million annual
average), or 5.4% of the state’s agricultural GDP, and there were much higher losses in previous years:
R$ 108 million in 1998, R$ 104 million in 1993 and R$ 82 million in 1996. Not surprisingly, the first
two years match with two very severe droughts throughout the state (1998 and 1992-1993, respectively).

85.     Furthermore, the losses in terms of the normal production value in 2010 were extreme for
important smallholder crops like beans and maize, accounting for R$ 16 million and R$ 7 million losses
respectively. In the same year, the losses of sugar cane and banana reached R$ 18 million and R$ 13
million respectively. In total these four crops accounted for 83% of total losses in 2010.

86.        The following are some examples of realized risk impact in the livestock sector:

            20% of the cattle and 50% of the goat population were lost during the 2012-2013 drought;
            During the last drought (2012-2013) there was a 90% decrease of honey production and 50%
             of bees died and 70% of the beehives migrated;
            The outbreak of an exotic disease (e.g. FMD or BSE) would have a catastrophic impact
             (elimination of animals, quarantine and disinfection, loss of external markets, etc.) as occurred
             during the 2005 FMD outbreak in Mato Grosso do Sul and Parana.26

25
   Analysis of this nature requires a consistent set of data on both production and prices, for an extended time period. The
source of data chosen was IBGE, where complete statistical information was found for the period 1990-2010.

   Study by Costa, et al. on the impact of the 2005 foot and mouth disease outbreaks in Mato Grosso do Sul y Parana. The
outbreak had great impact on exports and prices of beef, poultry and pork, which only recovered after the lifting of the import
bans by Russia, the main importing country, 28 months later. It was necessary to eliminate 33,741 FMD-susceptible animals
(32,549 cattle, 566 pigs, 626 sheep and goats). One to two months after the import ban by Russia and other countries,

Production Volatility by Regions: The Case of Cassava
87.    Cassava constitutes a major source of carbohydrates in the diet of the population of Paraiba,
including several processed products, such as flour (farinha). Starch (sweet cassava starch or gum),
modified starches, baked goods, pasta, snacks, manioc, tapioca, among others are other products derived
from cassava. Cassava plantations are very popular among small farmers because of its rusticity, low
demand for production technology, ability to adapt to different ecosystems and the ability to produce
even under severe adverse conditions, though at low yields. The maximum planted area was reported in
1990 with more than 52,000 hectares. This area remained relatively stable until 1995 when it started to
decrease in all meso-regions within Paraiba. However, the distribution of the planted area across the
meso-regions has remained more or less constant over the years.

88.     The relative production volatility among different meso-regions is measured using the coefficient
of variation27 of yields. All meso-regions show high inter-annual variations: the coefficient of variation
of yields (tons/ha) range between 14% in the Agreste Paraibano and 45% in the Sertão Paraibano,
which is the drier region in Paraiba. Due to the different level of area planted, these variations have
different impacts on total production (Table 7).

89.    The year of 1998, when a severe drought occurred, shows the most drastic reduction of cassava’s
productivity in all regions. According to the Confederação da Agricultura e Pecuária do Brasil, during
this year the severe drought affected all Northeastern states of Brazil. Similar negative yield
performance is evident in all meso-regions during the 1992-1993 and 2010 droughts. Figure 17 (on
following page) shows cassava yield variability in all the four meso-regions of Paraiba.

Impact of Risks at Individual Stakeholder Level
90.     How the losses attributed to risks are distributed among stakeholders along the supply chain is to
a great extent a function of supply chain governance and stakeholder capability and opportunities for
risk management. This section provides a discussion on the impact of the main agricultural risks
identified in the section above on the different actors of the main agricultural supply chains in Paraiba
(Table 8).

Vulnerability is the concept that explains the heterogeneity in impact.28

92.     Though poverty has been declining in the Northeast, as in the rest of Brazil, over the last decade,
poverty in rural areas where livelihoods concentrate on agriculture, remains high. In Paraiba, you are
twice as likely to be poor if you live in rural areas, than in urban areas. In 2012, 25% of the rural
population was poor, compared to 12% in urban Paraiba, and 8.1% of the population was extremely
poor. However, in the 170 municipalities of the Paraiba Semi-Arid region, which covers most of the area
of the state and most of family agriculture families, the average rate of extreme poverty is 20% (Figure
18).

93.     Poverty exacerbates vulnerability because a shock will have greater proportional effects on the
welfare of a poor household than on that of a wealthier one. In effect, repeated shocks confine poor rural
households into a poverty trap, exhausting savings and dissolving investments that would otherwise help
propel the household ahead. Vulnerable households in Paraiba respond to shocks by reducing household
consumption, selling household and productive assets, and seeking income sources off the farm with
diverse strategies, including migration to urban areas. Expenditures on drought mitigation and
emergency measures also divert resources from longer-term investments in human capital and
productivity.

94.    To capture why vulnerability varies between individuals and between households, vulnerability
can be seen as the function of three factors: (i) sensitivity, (ii) adaptive capacity, and (iii) exposure.29
28
  Vulnerability is “the likelihood that at a given time in the future, an indiv idual will have a level of welfare below some
norm or benchmark.” Common welfare indicators include poverty measurements, household expenditures, savings levels,
and food security and nutrition measures (such as food consumption score and household dietary diversity). Though
vulnerability depends on the severity of external shocks like climate, the likelihood of a drop in welfare depends on both
people’s context and capacity to act and react. Socio -economic assets and institutions play an important role in people’s
vulnerability.


                                                                                                                          43
               i.     Sensitivity is the degree of impact of the initial shock. Sensitivity can be thought of as
                      the elasticity of household welfare (e.g. consumption levels) in response to a shock.
              ii.     Adaptive capacity is the ability of the household to access ex-post coping strategies that
                      helps the household return to pre-shock welfare levels.30
             iii.     Exposure is the probability of the given shock materializing and affecting the
                      household’s assets.

95.     Annex 2 expands on these relevant indicators and suggests measurements for analyzing
vulnerability to drought, the most significant agricultural risk for small farmers in Paraiba. A notional
application of this framework to Paraiba indicates that the poorest areas of the state (measured by earned
income per capita), are not necessarily the areas that will suffer the most from drought. State transfers
for old age pensions and Bolsa Família serve to diversify the poor’s portfolio and buffer the direct
effects of drought.

96.     Policy can reduce all three aspects of vulnerability: sensitivity through encouraging
diversification away from drought-exposed livelihoods to better adapted sources of income/production;
adaptive capacity through education, land regularization, market access and social protection; natural
resource management. This methodology should be applied at the municipality level using available
IBGE data, and state or policymakers should identify which welfare indicators they wish to prioritize in
the analysis. For example, a state that is more concerned with vulnerability that causes hunger or
malnutrition will involve a very different policy response than a concern for rural exodus/out-migration.
Participatory territorial planning methods should be involved to validate and gain ownership over a
technical vulnerability analysis.

   Adaptive capacity is a subset of resilience. United States Agency for International Development (USAID) defines
resilience as the ability of people, households, communities, countries, and systems to adapt to and recover from shocks and stresses
in a manner that reduces chronic vulnerability and facilitates inclusive growth.

CHAPTER 5: AGRICULTURE RISK PRIORITIZATION AND MANAGEMENT

97.    To better utilize scarce resources, it is important to understand which risks are causing the largest
shocks to the sector in terms of losses and observe at what frequency they occur. This chapter
summarizes the priority risks faced by the agricultural sector in Paraiba and the possible risk
management solutions, as identified, validated, and prioritized with sector stakeholders.

Risk Prioritization
98.     Below are the tables containing the agricultural risk prioritization defined on the basis of the
probability of the event and their expected impact, for domestic and export crops (Tables 9 through 12).
The identified risks located in the grey area represent the most significant ones due to their potential to
cause the greatest losses and the higher frequency of their occurrence.

99.     Corollary: No highly probable or probable risks with critical impact were identified but there
exist several probable and highly probable risks with high impact and moderate impact. The important
issues identified for the main risks – limited drought mitigation, uncontrolled pests and diseases,
deficiencies in livestock sanitary services, ethanol policy uncertainty and poor fruit market coordination
– require comprehensive measures to complement the already existing risk management mechanisms in
Brazil (Garantia Safra, Price Guarantees, Livestock sanitary services, food safety, etc.) and improve
their implementation in Paraiba.

100. Figure 19 below shows the relative importance of the different risks that have moderate to
critical impact and refer to the crops that historically have accounted for the larger losses due to
agricultural risks (as explained in Chapter 4). Sugar cane and fruits, especially grapefruit (large share in
the total agricultural production value of Paraiba), are the greatest determinants of the agricultural
losses.

Figure 18: Risk Incidence




101. However, the conclusion is rather different if the risks are prioritized taken into account the
relative importance of family agriculture in the total number of farmers (Figure 20). In effect, there are
148,047 family agriculture farmers in Paraiba (2006), out of a total of 167,272 farmers. Under that
perspective, results that severe rainfall (estimated to occur 1 in 10 years), irregular rainfall (1 in 5) and
pests and diseases (with lower expected impact than the other risks, as explained in Chapter 3) are the
main risks in Paraiba. This scenario is one of much higher impact but of lower probability. The solutions
scenario should involve strong actions directed towards introducing innovative technology and
improving agricultural practices.

Proposed Long List of Solutions
102. The potential solutions presented below (Table 13) were identified during field interviews as
well as already suggested in various government and non-governmental documents. Usually, risk
management strategies are a combination of risk mitigation, risk transfer, and risk coping instruments.
Risk mitigation refers to actions taken to eliminate or reduce events from occurring, or reduce the
severity of losses; risk transfer are mechanisms to transfer the risk to a willing third party, at a cost (e.g.,
insurance); and, risk coping (e.g. government assistance to farmers, debt re-structuring, etc.). How
instruments are applied for a given risk will likely depend on the current risk management and the
probability of the risk and the severity of its impacts.

              Watershed) where water availability for irrigation
              can be improved. Unfortunately, most of irrigation
              plans developed in Paraiba do not include the
              estimation of water demand for the subsistence
              agricultural farming. Therefore, it becomes relevant
              to carry out studies with the aim of assessing the
              restrictions that may prevent meeting the crop water
              irrigation demands; quantifying the effective area of
              agricultural farming that can be supplied with water
              for irrigation, and estimating the financial costs of
              new/improved infrastructure.

Enabling       The sugar and ethanol policies are determined at
Environment    federal level for the entire country. Given the key
               importance of sugar cane production in Paraiba, they
               are of vital importance for Paraiba as well as for
               other sugar cane producing states. The uncertain
               policy environment (discussed in Chapter 3)
               prevents appropriate farming and industrial planning
               and represents a risk for the sugar industry in
               Paraiba as a whole. In addition, there is uncertainty
               about exchange rate and the general price index,
               what poses the important risk of unpredictable cost
               variability. The sugar and ethanol policies should be
               more stable and predictable and above all they
               should not add additional uncertainty to the already
               volatile sugar and oil/ethanol international markets.




103. There are many simple and validated technologies in stock or stand-by, poorly or not adopted by
the farmers, chiefly small familiar peasants, for whom the almost sole transfer channel is the public
technical assistance service. Examples of this situation were found when the mission visited
EMBRAPA´s research centers, EMEPA and universities. The mission had the opportunity to visit a few
smallholders that were directly supervised by EMBRAPA Semi Árido scientists. The technologies being
transferred were simple solutions for enhancing production systems on the semiarid and coping with
recurrent droughts. In spite of the severe drought affecting the region in recent years, poor soils,
inexistent irrigation, etc., theses farmers showed consistent production progress with low financial
investment. Other examples were observed by the mission when visited EMBRAPA Mandioca e
Fruticultura, regarding either varieties of citrus and cassava resistant to key pests, or new technologies
for producing clean citrus seedlings, meaning they are certified to be free of pests, and other
technologies for pest control. However, these technology adoption initiatives are few and isolated.
EMATER’s capacity to provide rural extension services is low and requires improvement. Other non-
public extension modalities should also be explored. In addition, gender elements should be taken into
account considering the large percentage of female-headed families in rural Paraiba (this aspect will be
assessed during the solutions mission).

104. A completely contrasting situation was found on entrepreneurial agribusiness, like in the grain
production area of Western Bahia (Cerrados), or the fruit production clusters of the irrigated districts
located close to the Sobradinho dam (Médio São Francisco), or in southern and southwestern Bahia.
The growers of these regions are receptive to innovative and adequate technologies and conscious of the
need of access them by receiving proper technical assistance. In this case, farmers either have their own
team of professionals or contract private technical assistance. The differences in the business
sustainability between market oriented production and family agriculture is largely found in the rate of
technology adoption, thus highlighting the importance of the public technical assistance for the
sustainability of the family agriculture sector.

                                                                                                       54
Key Risk Management Measures
105. Many programs and projects are already addressing some of the identified risks along the lines of
the solution proposed in the Table 13. Table 14 below, contains a number of these projects and programs
as were identified by the mission (see Annex 3), indicating their connection with the risk assessment
results and the potential gaps to be covered with additional specific risk management actions.

narrowing down onto specific solution areas that tackle the key risk issues. The final result will be a
package of interventions that could effectively lower volatility and increase resilience in agriculture and
since the emphasis is placed on the more vulnerable segments of the supply chains the agricultural risk
management program will have a direct positive impact on poverty reduction.

107. In brief, the following are the key risk management areas, deepened in Volume 2: Risk
Management Strategy:

   1. Strengthen State’s rural extension and technical assistance system for agriculture, livestock
      and marketing, is key for family agriculture farmers and other small and medium scale
      farmers in order to access risk management technology and adopt relative practices.
      Currently, the State extension services are weak:

          a. Smallholders have difficulties accessing private suppliers of technical assistance;

          b. There are not enough Paraiba State Company for Technical Assistance and Rural
             Extension (Empresa de Asistência Técnica e Extensão Rural da Paraíba – EMATER)
             extension offices to cover all the municipalities;

          c. Most of these offices do not have enough technical and support personnel to carry out
             medium or large scale programs;

          d. Extentionists do not have access to updated knowledge and continuous capacitation;

          e. The supporting resources (vehicles, per diem, fuel) are below the requirements for
             minimum operation levels;

          f. The technological transfer programs have to be revised in order to assure transfer of
             proved technologies;

          g. EMATER programs and operations should be coordinated at fine tune level with other
             research and extension institutions working in Paraiba.

      EMATER should allocate more resources to increase the coverage of the extension services,
      improve program coordination, upgrade training programs, develop risk management tailor made
      programs, etc. Simultaneously, efforts should be made to put in place private sector based
      technical assistance services driven by farmers.

   2. Carry out studies with the aim of assessing the restrictions that may prevent meeting the
      crop water irrigation demands; quantifying the effective area of agricultural farming that
      can be supplied with water for irrigation, and estimating the financial costs of
      new/improved infrastructure.

   3. Strengthen SEDAP’s phytosanitary services in order to guarantee proper control and
      prevention of plant diseases. This would include:

          a. Programs to avoid the entry of major pests which are not presently attacking crops grown
             in Paraiba, strengthening sanitary controls, active surveillance and be prepared to
             eradicate exotic pests detections at first detections;


                                                                                                   57
       b. More sound actions to control pesticide trade and use;

       c. In addition, institutions in the three levels of sanitary intervention (Federal, State and
          Municipal) should act in strict coordination.

4. Enhance animal sanitary risk management to assure adequate protection from exotic and
   other diseases. This would require the following actions:

       a. FMD prevention program has to be revised and updated

       b. Control and eradication programs for prevalent diseases of economic and public health
          importance need to be revised, updated and speed its execution.

       c. Municipal control and inspection programs need to be coordinated and harmonized with
          Federal and State Programs following SISBI orientations.

       d. Need to establish State food safety policy and mechanism of coordination along the food
          chain.

5. Improve coordination within the supply chains and assure fine tuning planning. Price
   volatility in important cash crops such as fruits is very much driven by significant inter-annual
   changes in the domestic supply, resulting in an output-price looping behavior. This behavior is
   invigorated by poor farm to market coordination and scarce marketing-production planning. In
   Brazil the APL (Arranjos Produtivos Locais) approach, a sort of cluster approach, has become
   popular since 2004. It is regarded as articulations among supply chain actors for mobilizing
   resources (credit, technology), facilitate marketing and in general promote greater economic
   dynamism and less volatility. Value chain or productive partnership approaches could be
   incorporated into the agricultural risk management strategy in subsectors such as pineapple and
   could be part of the regular technical assistance services in Paraiba.

6. Develop an integrated weather information system in Paraiba to improve the analysis of
   weather data and to improve the accuracy of short and medium-term weather forecasting.
   Some key activities to explore during the solutions assessment, would include:

       a. Integration of weather station networks both at Federal and State level;

       b. Review current institutional arrangement coordination, and strengthen the institutional
          structure and regulatory framework to achieve better coordination between national and
          state weather authorities;

       c. Improvement of current mechanism of data and information dissemination;

       d. Establishment of a state working group to coordinate and manage the application of
          weather data in commercial activities, research, and to warm the civil society about the
          occurrence and magnitude of weather events.

                                                                                                 58
7. Train Paraiba rural extension officers and professionals associated with Garantia Safra on
   the collection of crop loss data in order to minimize sampling errors and to reduce the risk
   of moral hazard. Garantia Safra operation is currently based on the estimation of crop losses
   due to drought events. The losses are derived from a hard trigger or weather index. Given that
   not all regions have a dense weather station network, hard triggers are extrapolated. Therefore,
   the possibility that the resulted output does not accurately reflect the actual yields exists. In these
   cases, Garantia Safra compensation payouts are triggered after the conduct of field loss
   assessments (soft trigger). Loss assessments are made by the state rural extension service or
   alternatively by professionals with background in agronomy that work in public institutions.
   There is, therefore, a need to train rural extension officers because there are several crops that are
   covered under this risk transfer mechanism, and that these crops show different phenological
   structure and level of resilience to drought.

8. Strengthen the Paraiba Drought Management Committee, in order to shift its main focus
   from reactive activities to emergency preparedness. The solutions assessment could concentrate
   on the following aspects:

       a. Develop the Committee’s drought risk management plan;

       b. Develop a communication plan and a communication system;

       c. Improve institutional capacity (knowledge, training) and legal framework;




                                                                                                       59
VOLUME 2: RISK MANAGEMENT
STRATEGY




                            60
CHAPTER 1: SUMMARY OF THE AGRICULTURE RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY

1.      The first phase of the assessment based on the productive structure (reflecting relative
importance of both crops and production patterns) identified: sugar cane; commercial fruit production;
family agriculture crops; and livestock as the value chains and sectors targeted under the Agriculture
Risk Management Strategy. Sugar cane and fruits, especially grapefruit, because of their large share in
the total gross output value of Paraiba (73%), are the greatest determinants of the average annual
production risk related losses (58%).32

2.       Limited drought mitigation, uncontrolled pests and diseases, deficiencies in livestock sanitary
services and poor market coordination for fruit products are the key issues addressed for reducing losses
in Paraiba’s agriculture sector. The risk assessment confirmed that there are no risks with critical impact
that at the same time are highly probable (1 in 3 years) or probable (1 in 5 years) in Paraiba but there are
several probable and highly probable risks that cause moderate or high impact when realized. It was
observed that the important issues identified around these main risks–- require comprehensive measures
to complement the already existing federal policies and programs that in some way contribute to manage
agricultural risks (Garantia Safra, price guarantees, livestock sanitary services, food safety, etc.) and to
improve their implementation in Paraiba.

3.      Severe drought, irregular rainfall, and pests and diseases are the main risks affecting family
farmers in Paraiba. When risks are prioritized taking into account the relative importance of family
agriculture in the total number of farmers (there are 148,047 family agriculture farmers in Paraiba out of
a total of 167,272 farmers33), the main risks in Paraiba are severe drought (estimated to occur 1 in 10
years), irregular rainfall (1 in 5) and pests and diseases (with lower expected impact than the other
risks). Accordingly, the solutions scenario presents strong actions directed towards improving risk
mitigation among family farmers, such as adoption of innovative technology, improved agricultural
practices and effective marketing mechanisms, as well as better agroclimatic information management,
together with recommendations regarding other sectors of the agriculture in Paraiba.

4.    The Text Box 1 presents a summary of all the general agricultural risk management (ARM) areas
recommended at the Risk Assessment.

Text Box 2. 1: Key ARM areas
The following are the Key ARM Areas proposed during the first phase for deepening the
analysis during the second phase of the assessment:
    Agriculture Extension and Technical Assistance: Strengthen State’s rural extension and
       technical assistance system for agriculture, livestock and marketing. This is key for
       family agriculture farmers and other small and medium scale farmers in order to access

                                                                                                         61
       risk management technology.
      Supply Chain Coordination: Improve coordination within fruit supply chains. Value
       chain or productive partnership approaches could be incorporated into the agricultural
       risk management strategy in subsectors such as pineapple and could be part of the regular
       technical assistance services in Paraiba.
      Plant Health: Strengthen the State Secretariat for Agriculture, Livestock and Aquiculture
       Development (Secretaria de Estado de Desenvolvimento da Agropecuaria e Pesca –
       SEDAP) phytosanitary services in order to guarantee proper control and prevention of
       plant diseases. This would include: programs to avoid the entry of major pests; more
       sound actions to control pesticide trade and use; and improved coordination among
       institutions in the three levels of sanitary intervention (Federal, State and Municipal).
      Animal Health: Enhance animal sanitary risk management to assure adequate protection
       from exotic and other diseases.
      Agroclimatic Information Systems (ACIS): Develop an integrated agroclimatic risk
       information system in Paraiba to improve the analysis of weather data and to improve the
       accuracy of short and medium-term weather forecasting.
      Irrigation can also be an important solution to the management of agriculture risks, but
       careful feasibility assessments need to be done. The first phase of the Risk Assessment
       also included a proposal to carry out studies with the aim of assessing the restrictions that
       may prevent meeting the crop water irrigation demands, quantifying the effective area of
       agricultural farming that can be supplied with water for irrigation, and estimating the
       financial costs of new/improved infrastructure. However, it was found appropriate to
       postpone the study of these complex issues and propose that the Sustainable Rural
       Development Project (follow up to COOPERARII) incorporates them into its activities.


5.     The following are the strategic lines identified during the ARM assessment. The detailed actions
under each strategic line are contained in Chapter 4: ARM Action Plan.

   b. Strengthening of the Drought Management Committee, making actions more proactive and less
      reactive;
   c. Training to the extension workers associated to inspection procedures in the Garantia Safra
      project, in order to reduce moral hazard and technical issues.

      Establish the actual status of Classical Swine Fever (CSF) and Newcastle Disease Virus
         (NCDV) in Paraiba;
      Create the State Agency for Agricultural Health.

Supply Chain Coordination

   a. Identify successful farm to market experiences in Paraiba and assess the viability of being
      replicated under a massive technical assistance programwe already did, doubt there are
      possibilities to replicate through a “massive technical assistance program”
   b. Develop market oriented business development methodologies for training and providing
      technical assistance to associated small scale farmers
   c. Assess different options to support market development for family agriculture products,
      including revision of the legal framework to channel public resources

      management - Strengthen the research sub-system;
   c. Improve efficiency of the Agricultural Innovation System for family agriculture risk
      management - Strengthen the Technical Assistance and Rural Extension (Assistência Técnica e
      Extensão Rural – ATER) sub-system;

CHAPTER 2: PARAIBA’S AGRICULTURE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

Brief Information on the Agricultural Sector

Agroecology
6.       Like in most parts of Northeast Brazil, the State of Paraiba has the following main
agroecological zones: the Mata zone, the Agreste zone and the Sertão zone. In the Mata zone there are
two factors important to agriculture, namely high precipitation (over 1,400 mm annually), and relatively
fertile soils. This region has been, since colonization, largely dedicated to sugar cane. The Agreste zone
is located towards the interior, in the Borborema Highlands, with an average annual precipitation around
700 mm, distributed irregularly but concentrated in the period March to August (which is the season of
least evapotranspiration), with mild night temperatures. The Sertão zone has higher temperatures, and
the rains occur during the hottest months. In the Agreste zone, as well as in the Sertão zone, the dry
season is long, lasting six to seven months and seven to eight months, respectively, with severe droughts
every 10 or 11 years. In the Agreste zone, the landholdings are smaller, approximately 40 hectares in
size, and greatly involved in dairy production. In the Sertão…

7.     Most agricultural lands in Paraiba are located in the coastal regions, due to harsher climate
conditions found in the semi-arid inland. The lowest production densities are found in the Borborema
and Sertão Paraibano regions, where livestock raising predominates.

Main features of agriculture in Paraiba34

8.      Paraiba is a small state with limited agroecological conditions for agriculture. Its agriculture
share is very low: 0.7% as compared with total national agriculture gross domestic product (GDP) and
11% as compared with the Northeast agriculture GDP. As compared with the total GDP of the State, the
agricultural GDP is 4.5% in 2011.35 The main economic activity of Paraiba is the plantation of sugar
cane, which is processed in usinas located in the largest farms; for centuries, sugar cane was used for
production of white sugar, but today a large proportion is directed to the production of alcohol fuel.
Most plantations are located along the coast. There are 8 usinas and 1,935 farmers producing sugar cane,
95% being small and micro-producers in Paraiba.36 However, large and medium scale producers
(accounting for less than 5% of the total number of producers in the State), including the usinas nucleus
land, contribute to about 55% of the total output.

9.    Fruit production is also important in Paraiba. It includes grapes, citrus, banana, mangaba, mango,
coconut and pineapple. The most important fruit grown in Paraiba, in terms of production value, is

34
   Sugar cane, pineapple, banana and cassava account for 35%, 27%, 10% and 6% of the State agricultural Gross Output
Value in 2010, respectively. That is, the four crops aggregated account for 78% of the total State’s agricultural Gross Outpu t
Value.

pineapple, which is massively exported out of Paraiba to the rest of Brazil. Main producing areas of
pineapple are the Mata and Brejo zones. Production is mostly in the hands of small scale farmers with
heterogeneous levels of technology development and market coordination.

10.     In the Agreste and humid areas of Borborema, there is beans and cassava cultivation, usually just
for subsistence (beans and cassava flour, along with maize, can be stocked up for long periods, and
constitute the basic food items of most families) or trading in local fairs. Maize is most common in the
Sertão, along with plants adapted to dry climates. Regarding livestock, the raising of caprines is more
common than of bovines in the Sertao. Family farmers are spread throughout Paraiba but concentrated
in the semi-arid macro-region, encompassing the Borborema, Sertão Paraibano, and Agreste Paraibano
meso-regions.

Family agriculture
11.     There are 148,047 family farmers37 in Paraiba, representing 91% of the total number of farmers
in the State, covering a total of 1,596,273 hectares, representing 42% of total areas. Of these, two-thirds
have land title. High rates of female-headed households stand out in Paraíba at around 30% in rural
areas. Family agriculture is largely based on livestock, though maize, beans and cassava are grown for
self-consumption on small, rain fed plots. Especially in dry regions, small farmers raise small animals,
commonly goats. Native trees and vegetation provide firewood, fodder for animals, and fruits (like umbu
and nuts like cashew) are part of nutritional security. Since the herds rely on natural vegetation, food for
animals is vulnerable to drought.

12.     In general, small land size, poor soils, low precipitation, low market access, low access to credit
and technical assistance, and low levels of farmer organization characterize family farmers. Some
attribute low participation in associations to a lack of incentives to associate and a history of patronage
arrangements that small farmers depend on to receive emergency relief supplies in times of drought.
Cash transfers from social assistance programs provide a significant proportion of family income and
allow food to be purchased outside the household.

Agricultural Risk Profile and Risk Management Options (solutions)

Agricultural risks and constraints
13.    Drought is a recurrent event in the Northeast of Brazil and has strong negative impact on
household livelihoods as it represents a challenge to food security crops such as maize and beans and
may cause important losses of livestock. It should be noted that the social impact of drought is especially
aggravated by the fact that family farmers represent more than 90% of the farmers in Paraiba and water
availability (including irrigation) is poor.

37
   Family farming (agricultura familiar) is formally defined in Brazil in terms of area, management, labor, and income. The
farm must be managed by the family, and the family must rely on agriculture as their principal source of income. Definition of
agricultura familiar from Law No. 11326.




                                                                                                                           65
14.     One of the first records of drought in Northeast Brazil happened in the XVIII century, between
the years of 1777 and 1779. It is estimated that more than 500,000 people died and mortality rate of
animals reached 80% (Campos e Studart, 1997). In the subsequent century, the Great Drought took
place from 1877 to 1879, followed by other droughts in 1897, 1898, 1915, 1931 through 1932, 1951
through 1953, 1992 through 1995 and 2012 through 2013. The 2012/13 drought is considered the worst
drought in the last fifty years (Miranda, 2013). One hundred and seventy municipalities decreed
calamity situation during the 2012 drought (almost 80% of the total number of municipalities), and 2.6
million people were affected.

15.     Severe droughts should be differentiated from the dry season in the Semi-arid, which is not a
risk, but rather a constraint38 to agriculture development given its predictability. In addition, erratic
rainfall (high precipitation followed by a long period of drought) is frequent but of moderate or low
impact.

16.      The damaging impact of pests and diseases is significant when they are not properly mitigated.
They have been particularly devastating when new pests/diseases arrived and the State’s support
services were not prepared to respond adequately (e.g. cotton boll weevil). Family farming crops in the
Semi-arid (cassava, beans, maize) are susceptible to attacks by caterpillars or diseases. However,
farmers prefer not to use purchased inputs nor make investments on their crops with the exception of
some infesting weed control. Their rationale is “why invest on fertilizers, improved seeds or pest control
if the risk to lose the harvest because of lack of rainfall is so high”.

17.    Currently, family farmers usually cultivate a type of cactus called palma forrageira as feed for
goats and sheep and even bovines, fundamental to feed the animals during hydric stresses. A pest called
cochonilha-do-carmim (Dactylopius opuntiae) is a serious threat for achieving higher biomass
production and a risk to family agriculture subsistence.

18.     A phytosanitary risk with high social, environmental, agronomic and economic impact arises
from the use of pesticides without the necessary technical knowledge and skill, which are applied at high
rates not in accordance with technical recommendations. The result is that farmers may face increased
production costs, ineffective pest control and human and environmental hazards as well as fruit
contamination with pesticides residues, representing a risk for the consumer health.

19.    Finally, the inter-annual price variations of fruits, mostly pineapple and banana, are also a
serious risk for family farmers. The volatility largely responds to changes in production and traded
volumes, which is in turn connected to the lack of supply chain coordination, farmer organization and
38
   Constraints are certain conditions that result in sub-optimal performance. For instance, low production yields are a
constraint to development and the cause is lack of access to inputs, poor technology, etc. A constraint ignores the volatility in
an outcome. There are also trends. Trends are longer term patterns, e.g. declining production yields are the result of structural
changes in agriculture, changes in climatic patterns, etc. Risk, in turn, is defined as the possibility that an event will occur that
will potentially have a negative impact on the farm and/or the supply chain. Understanding the linkages between these 3
concepts is key for planning and action. The presence of risk often constitutes a constraint, or aggravates an existing one.
Therefore, risks and constraints are intrinsically interrelated.


                                                                                                                                  66
poor production and marketing planning. For family farmers with an important portion of self-
subsistence agriculture and limited but essential commercial farming, the low value and unpredictability
of their markets is not only a risk but also a restriction for development.

ARM options (solutions)
20.     As explained above, Paraiba has a small commercial agricultural sector and a widespread small
scale semi-arid rural population that includes extensive subsistence family farmer groups. The risk
profile is different with respect to the different types of producers, though drought and unmanaged pests
and diseases are a common risk across the State.

21.    Drought is the main risk for family farmers in the semi-arid. Small scale commercial farmers are
exposed to great market vulnerability, like the fruit producers, sugar cane outgrowers, usinas and sugar
cane estates suffer from changing policy environment. Larger farmers and usinas usually have
resources, available tools, and know how to manage other risks.

22.    Commercial farmers tend to utilize drought tolerant varieties and variable crop cycles, control
pests and diseases and are connected to relatively high value markets. However, only a minority of
family farmers adopts mitigation practices like pest control or resistant varieties. Appropriate agriculture
risk mitigation technologies are not easily available to family farmers due to: (i) deficiencies in the
provision of technical assistance services and (ii) poor supply chain coordination. These factors also
prevent family farmers from accessing higher market prices and financial resources for on-farm
investments.

23.     Such a productive and economic dichotomy makes the ARM strategy necessarily complex and
involving a variety of actions of different nature. Given the impacts of realized risks in the past (see
Volume 1: Risk Assessment), it can be inferred that there is room for cost-effective risk reduction by
investing in programs to mitigate, transfer and cope with agriculture risks. The State of Paraiba could
reduce sector losses substantially.

24.     As it was identified in the first phase (Volume 1: Risk Assessment), improved ARM should
involve a comprehensive approach that tackles problems affecting all supply chains, including, at State
level, the availability of better agroclimatic information systems, solid and trusted sanitary and
phytosanitary systems and upgraded technological and market support services. At the Federal level it
would be expected to have more stable and neutral sugar and alcohol policies, but this discussion goes
beyond the scope of this assessment.

25.    Family farming is the most vulnerable segment in the sector and currently there are not many
ARM options (solutions) available for them outside the regular Federal Government support programs.
Thus, many of the proposals below regard institutional capacity building at State level and are to a great
extent directed to improving the agronomical and marketing risk management capabilities of family
farmers. These measures will also have a positive impact on family farmer food security, and
consequently poverty reduction.


                                                                                                         67
Current Institutional ARM Programs and Policies
26.     There are a number of State and Federal programs and policies that in one way or another impact
the management of agricultural risks. In the past, as back as the XIX century, several measures were
taken. For instance: construction of weirs; dams and aqueducts; river transposing; and construction of
wells (Miranda, 2013). But they have not been sufficient to mitigate the impact of severe drought. More
recently, the Cooperar Project has financed investments in water reservoirs/tanks, Complete Water
Supply Systems (Sistemas de Abastecimento de Água Completo - ADC), and Single Water Supply
Systems (Sistemas de Abastecimento de Água Singelos - ADS), which basically consist in drilling wells
to store water in public reservoirs that will supply residences (for the ADC) or public distribution
systems (ADS systems). In total, 8,180 families benefited from the program (Projeto Cooperar, 2014).

27.    More specifically, in regards to weather related agriculture risks, Annex 4 provides a detailed
description of the current programs and policies. The following are the most relevant initiatives:

      The Agricultural Climate Risk Zoning (ZARC) of Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply
       (Ministerio da Agricultura, Pecuaria e Abstecimento - MAPA), which aims to minimize the risk
       related to weather phenomena, and allows identification of the best planting dates in selected
       municipalities considering different types of soil and crop cycles.
      The Agriculture and Livestock Activity Guarantee Program (Programa de Garantia da
       Atividade Agropecuária - PROAGRO), which is a public insurance operated by financial
       institutions. It aims to compensate the rural producer for the occurrence of adverse weather
       phenomena, plagues and diseases afflicting crops and livestock.
      The Agriculture and Livestock Activity Guarantee Program for Family Farmers (Programa de
       Garantia da Atividade Agropecuária da Agricultura Familiar - PROAGRO MAIS) aiming to
       compensate the Family Farmers for the occurrence of adverse natural phenomena, plagues and
       diseases. The difference between PROAGRO and the PROAGRO MAIS is the target public: the
       PROAGRO MAIS focuses solely on family farmers and the traditional PROAGRO aims
       remaining farmers.
      The Rural Insurance Premium Subsidy Program (Programa de Subvenção ao Prêmio do Seguro
       Rural - PSR), through which insurance companies accredited by MAPA are allowed to operate a
       subsidy. In general, the program consists of establishing percentages of subventions for each
       modality of insurance and crops.
      The Garantia Safra Program (GS), operated by the Ministry of Agrarian Development
       (Ministério do Desenvolvimento Agrário – MDA) since 2002. It aims to guarantee minimum
       conditions of survival of the rural family farmers that are affected systematically by drought or
       excess rainfall. The family farmers may receive a benefit on the occurrence of drought or excess
       rainfall, which causes at least 50% of loss on productions of beans, corn, rice, cassava or cotton
       crops.
      The program Drought Grant (Bolsa Estiagem - BE), managed by the Ministry of National
       Integration (Ministério da Integração Nacional – MI), MDA and the Ministry of Social


                                                                                                      68
          Development and Fight Against Hunger (Ministério do Desenvolvimento Social e Combate à
          Fome – MDS). This program aims to support families of agricultural workers which have
          monthly income equivalent to at most two minimum wages and are located in municipalities that
          are considered to have suffered a disaster or emergency situation recognized by Federal
          Government.
         The Brazilian Company for Agriculture and Livestock Research (Empresa Brasileira de
          Pesquisa Agropecuária – EMBRAPA) developed an Agrometeorological Monitoring System
          (Sistema de Monitoramento Agrometeorológico - AGRITEMPO), which allows access to
          meteorological and agrometeorological information for all the Brazilian territory on an
          aggregated level. Since 2002, the available products are drought maps, water available in soil,
          rainfall, agricultural drought areas, necessity of reposition by rainfall and accumulated rainfall.
         The National Institute for Space Research (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais -
          INPE/CPTEC) supplies weather monitoring information regarding drought, frost, soil moisture
          and weather forecast for all Brazilian territory with applicability to agriculture and livestock.
         The World Bank, MI, ANA and state institutions are conducting a technical assistance program
          named Preparation for Drought and Resilience to Weather Changes in response to the long
          lasting droughts in 2012 and 2013. The goal is to define specific instruments for drought
          management in a proactive manner, and is based on the concept of risk for the entire
          Northeastern region.

28.     There are several permanent and transitory programs undertaken by the Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Program of SEDAP, which are quite the same for all Brazilian states. Among the
permanent programs are: the traffic control and the surveillance of animals, plants and its products;
pesticide market and use control; and slaughterhouses inspection.

29.     As for the transitory programs, follows a list for animal and plant health programs. Animal
health programs:

         PNEFA - National Program for Control, Prevention and Eradication of Foot and Mouth Disease;
         PNCEBT - National Program for Control and Eradication of Brucellosis and Tuberculosis;
         PNSA - National Program for Avian Health;
         PNCRH -National Program for Rabies Control and other Encephalopathies;
         PNSE - National Health Equidae Program;
         PNESA - National Sanitary Education Program;
         PNSSO -National Program of Goats and Sheep Health;
         PNSS - National Program of Swine Health;
         PNSAA - National Program of Health of Aquatic Animals;
         PNSAp -National Program of Health Bee.

30.       The plant protection programs include:



                                                                                                          69
      Surveillance and maintenance of free area for A2 quarantine pests of citrus (HLB, pinta preta
       and cancro cítrico), bananas (sigatoka negra and moko), grape (cancro da videira) and
       sugarcane (ferrugem laranja). The main tasks conducted in this program is the control of the
       transit of plants and parts of plants, which can host the causal agents of the mentioned diseases.
       A wider approach could be adopted by involving all the stakeholders, training personnel and
       establish a protocol for active surveillance, aiming at early detection of any eventual introduction
       of the pests.
      Monitoring and sanitary control of A2 quarantine pests of palma forrageira (cochonilha do
       carmim) and citrus (mosca negra). As for the first pest there is an active program in place for
       substituting the presently used palma varieties by resistant ones. The program is technically
       solid, and should be scaled up in order to completely substitute the genetic material grown in
       Paraiba. Regarding the mosca negra, the major action is the transit control of host plants, in
       order to avoid its dissemination. Appropriate control of the pest by growers is the recommended
       technique in this situation.

31. Concerning food procurement and price volatility, there are a series of Federal food procurement and
    minimum crop price policies and programs. They are the Policy for Mininum Price Guarantee
    (Politica de Garantia de Preços Minimos - PGPM), which is concerned with commercial
    agriculture, and the National Program for Acquisition of Food from Family Farmers (Programa de
    Aquisição de Alimentos - PAA) that specifically targets family farming. The Ministry of Agriculture
    (MAPA) is responsible for the former policy, and the latter program is the responsibility of the
    Ministry of Agrarian Development (MDA). The Federal Government, States and Municipalities
    implement PAA. The National Supply Company (Companhia Nacional de Abastecimento -
    CONAB) also participates in the implementation of PGPM.

32. Finally, there are a number of State programs and projects of research and technical assistance (with
    the exemption of the National Institute for the Semi-Arid - Instituto Nacional do Semi-Árido, INSA)
    that provide support to small scale farmers and to family agriculture farmers in particular. However,
    they are insufficient, both in quantity and quality, to assure optimum risk mitigation practices and
    technology. They are (see Annex 5 with information on the objectives, activities and other key :

      INSA projects. INSA is a Federal institution belonging to the Ministry of Science, Technology,
       and Innovation.
      Paraiba Sustainable Rural Development Project (Cooperar). World Bank financed project under
       preparation. It aims at reducing household vulnerability and improving smallholder access to
       markets in Paraiba’s rural areas.
      Cariri and Seridó Sustainable Development Project (PROCASE). SEDAP-IFAD. It is a local
       capacity building project that aims at improving smallholder production and market
       competitiveness and promoting farming practices resilience/adaptive to drought.




                                                                                                        70
   The Paraiba State Company for Agriculture and Livestock Research (Empresa Estadual de
    Pesquisa Agropecuária da Pariaba - EMEPA-PB) projects. EMEPA has nine experimental
    agricultural research stations throughout the State.
   EMEPA small demonstrative projects:
        o Beekeeping as a tool for improving the quality of life for small rural farmers in the semi-
            arid of Paraiba;
        o Multiplication and distribution of animal and plant germplasm, seeking to increase family
            agriculture dairy production of the Piancó Valley;
        o Production and distribution of free-range hens for diversifying farmer families´ sources
            of income and labor;
        o Program for strengthening family farmers´ goat and sheep breeding;
        o Multinutrient blocks: alternative nutritional strategy for herds during drought periods;
        o Use of solar energy in the sustainable production of irrigated fruits and vegetables;
        o Production and distribution of sorghum seeds to family farmers in the semi-arid;
        o Production and distribution of seedlings for domestic fruit tree plantations in family
            farmer settlements;
        o Production and distribution of citrus seedlings to family farmers;
        o Programa Palma Resistente.
   EMATER projects. EMATER provides extension services, registration of family farmers,
    support for access to family farming public policies and services, support for commercialization,
    food and nutritional security, assessment of losses to calibrate Garantia Safra.
   Sertão Emprendedor (Rural Learning National Service / Servico Nacional de Aprendizagem
    Rural - SENAR, Brazilian Micro and Small Business Support Service / Serviço Brasileiro de
    Apoio às Micro e Pequenas Empresas - SEBRAE). Support for projects of water conservation
    and, production and conservation of animal forage.

CHAPTER 3: PROPOSED ARM STRATEGY

33.     This Chapter presents the ARM strategy proposal based on the existing risk management
framework and the identified gaps. It takes into account the main risks identified during the first phase
(Voume 1: Risk Assessment) and comprises actions regarding the agroclimatic information system, the
sanitary and phytosanitary system, the fruit supply chain coordination and the agricultural innovation
system. The detailed justification for the inclusion of these four ARM areas is contained in Volume 1:
Risk Assessment.

Agroclimatic Risk Information System (ACIS)
Need for Improved ACIS
34.     In order to develop good and integrated drought management policies it is necessary to have a
proper database of agrometeorological information, that is, information related to agricultural related
topics (i.e. phenology, vulnerability, technical production packages, etc) and data gathered on time and
efficiently stored from automatic and/or conventional weather stations that are properly spread out
throughout the State.

35.     The current weather information system has a relatively low density of agrometeorological
stations39 and deficiencies regarding data collection and debugging. Most of the stations in operation are
conventional pluviometric stations where data collection is non-automatic, which can result in
measurement failures. Another important point is the low maintenance of existing stations, which may
result in malfunction and even the interruption in data collection because of some kind equipment
damage.

36.     In addition to the technical deficiencies, there is the issue of articulation between state and
federal institutions, and between them and the public sector and universities. Furthermore, at operational
level there is no communication between the federal stations and AESA’s stations. For instance, AESA
shares data with the National Water Agency (Agência Nacional de Águas – ANA) but this data is not
validated before the sharing, which incurs in poor quality information in ANA’s database. Moreover,
AESA has reduced personnel and office space over the years. There is an urgent need to strengthen
AESA’s institutional capacity as the responsible institution for meteorological monitoring in the state.

37.    The first step is to create an integrated systematic weather database for use by policymakers in
the construction of risk management tools. This system should optimize all resources available at both

39
   Compared to other states in Brazil, the density of the stations in Paraiba is relatively low. Taking into account only the
automatic stations, AESA owns only 10 stations, that is, approximately 1 station in 5,600 km 2. When all the types of stations
are considered (hydrometeorological, automatic, meteorological automatic, conventional meteorological, automatic
pluviometer, conventional pluviometer and others) there are 292 stations, with up to 21 years of data available, which
increases the density to 1 station in 194 km2, on average (Banco Mundial, 2014). Out of this total, the majority of the stations
are conventional pluviometers, working on manual basis (manual information collection).


                                                                                                                             72
federal and state government levels. There are several institutions who could jointly implement this
system. These institutions include, among others:

         Water and Sewer Company of Paraiba (CAGEPA);
         National Monitoring Center and Natural Disaster Alerts (CEMADEN);
         Executive Agency of Water Management of Paraiba (AESA);
         National Institute of Meteorology (INMET);
         National Water Agency (ANA);
         National Institute for Space Research (INPE/CPTEC);
         Brazilian Company for Agriculture and Livestock Research (EMBRAPA);
         Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE);
         Semiarid National Institute (INSA);
         The Secretariat for Agriculture, Livestock and Aquiculture Development of Paraiba (SEDAP);
         Municipalities and the extension workers of the State Company for Technical Assistance and
          Rural Extension (EMATER-PB);
         Company of Agricultural Research of Paraiba.

38.     The density of the stations should be increased. In order to overcome this problem, AESA is
submitting a project proposal to the World Bank which includes the purchase of around 20 automatic
agro-meteorological stations. The acquisition of these instruments will ensure speed and quality of data
collection. In addition, AESA needs to be strengthened with trained personnel in order to guarantee the
operation of a database management system that processes and storaes high quality data and
information.

39.      Furthermore, a committee for the coordination of drought mitigation should be consolidated. The
main objective of the committee would be to improve synergy and integration of efforts, inter and intra-
institutional, in order to increase the efficiency of drought mitigation public policies and shift its main
focus from reactive activities to emergency preparedness. The committee should consolidate and
disseminate information concerning the implementation of the risk management policies and encourage
the elaboration of technical reports to support the public decision makers. The drought committee could
be part of the State Secretariat for Planning and Management (Secretaria de Estado de Planejamento e
Gestão - SEPLAG).

40.     The development of the agro-climatic risk information system is fundamental for proper
operations of programs such as Garantia Safra and PROAGRO MAIS. Both programs rely on weather
information to operate. Further to the database improvements, Garantia Safra in Paraiba requires
strengthening of extensionist drought assessment skills. The methodologies adopted to evaluate the
drought losses are not standardized. Moral hazard issues may arise because of the aforementioned
limitations.




                                                                                                        73
Main elements of the ACIS
41.    The strategy would comprise the following elements:

42.      Development of Agroclimatic Risk Information System in the State of Paraiba. The Executive
Agency of Water Management of Paraiba (AESA) manages the actual set of weather stations but there
are some difficulties to overcome, including expanding the monitoring coverage. Technical and
institutional issues should be taken into account in order to improve the existing infrastructure and
operation. The short term suggestion would be to develop an agro-climatic information system that
should integrate other databases such as the INMET, CPTEC and ANA databases, with the purpose of
improving data quality by standardizing the computational, agrometeorological and statistical
procedures.

43.     Another important issue is to strengthen the operational capacity of AESA by increasing the
number of specialists in its staff. The hiring of personnel by AESA would be important to guarantee the
correct execution of the aforementioned procedures and reduce errors in data collection and generation
of useful information to a minimum level.

44.    The system would comprise the following products and information: agro-climatic bulletins,
maps and tables of precipitation, accumulated precipitation, drought, water availability in the soil,
weather forecast. The direct benefits to farmers and agents in the state agribusiness would concentrate in
the updated information regarding the weather and its impact on agriculture. The decision making
process would be more efficient and based on a reliable agro-climatic system.

45.     The plan of action in the next chapter contains the specific actions for implementing this
strategy.

46.    Strengthening the Drought Management Committee. One of the main beneficiaries of the
development of an ACIS would be the state drought committee. ACIS would support the members of
the committee to create risk management tools and elaborate efficient public policies into more
proactive and less reactive actions. The drought committee could be composed by the State Secretaries
and the top leaders of government institutions in areas linked to the drought risk management policies.

47.     Training of EMATER-PB extensionists on drought impact assessment. EMATER-PB’s
extensionists are responsible for the enrollment of family farmers in the Garantia Safra program and,
also act as a claim adjuster to verify the losses in the affected municipalities when drought occurs. About
87% of the inspection reports are carried out by the EMATER´s extension workers.

48.    The Paraiba State Company for Technical Assistance and Rural Extension, EMATER-PB, has
faced financial and operational difficulties (see AIS discussion below) and its field personnel is not
completely able to properly assess the drought impact for Garantia Safra when required.

49.   This step demands improved training (claim adjustment). Taking this fact into account the
recommendation is to develop a short term technical courses for the extension workers. The courses

                                                                                                        74
would be focused on operational, agronomic, climatic and geotechnological aspects of the Garantia
Safra program. Extensionist training can be supported by State universities and experts from research
and education institutions40.

Sanitary and Phytosanitary Systems
50.    Poorly managed pests and diseases are important risks for all agriculture supply chains
considered during the assessment. However, the nature and extent of their impact varies significantly
from one supply chain to another. Annex 6 provides detailed background information. Animal sanitary
quarantine risks are relatively minor in Paraiba but there are still a few issues that require improvement.

Phytosanitary Issues
51.     There are two agricultural sanitary bodies in Paraiba, SEDAP and MAPA. Operational actions
directly conducted by MAPA are limited, as its attributions are normally focused on interstate and
international markets. The program run by SEDAP faces several structural limitations to comply with
the diversity of challenges on both plant and animal health. Among these, the following are noteworthy:
budgetary, personnel, transport, laboratory and infrastructure constraints. As regards personnel, the
problem is not only the reduced number but also the poor training of the professionals. In turn,
coordination with the federal body (MAPA) is present and fluid. As regards state official partners like
EMEPA and EMATER there is a need for more integration and coordination as is the case with the
private sector, in order to reach more efficient results out of the single actors’ programs.

52.     Studies and negotiations have been set up to create an autonomous State Agency with the
mission of protecting the agriculture and livestock of Paraiba from sanitary risks, as well as safeguarding
the environment and public health. This Agency should have normative and operational functions and
would run not only structural activities (quarantine, surveillance, sanitary education, traffic control,
pesticide inspection), but also the transitory programs like targeted pest eradication. It is strongly
recommended that the studies and negotiations be speeded up in order to solve present institutional and
organizational problems, like autonomy, budget and personnel.

53.     The State Board for Agriculture Defense (Conselho Estadual de Defesa Agropecuária - CEDA)
is an advisory body to SEDAP on agricultural health issues, and it is composed by representatives of
government institutions and of the private sector. According to reports from the State Secretary and
officials of the Agricultural Health Program of SEDAP, the CEDA is not acting according to the
conceptualization that supported its creation, and should be reoriented to effectively discuss and give
advice on priorities, programs and operational actions. The creation of the State Agency would be an


40
  The following universities have capacity to participate in the training program: the Federal University of Paraiba (UFPB),
the State University of Paraiba (UEPB) and the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG), counting on the support of
the State Secretariat for Agriculture, Livestock and Aquiculture Development (SEDAP), municipalities and EMATER-PB,
besides the universities from other states such as the University of São Paulo (USP/ESALQ), and Federal University of
Viçosa (UFV), the Federal University of Lavras (UFLA), and EMBRAP A.


                                                                                                                         75
excellent opportunity for an overall discussion on the role of each stakeholder, including the
composition, attributions and operationalization of the CEDA.

54.      It is also strongly recommended to develop deeper integration of SEDAP (and the future
Agency) with the private sector, both to implement cooperative programs and to support producer
initiatives. In the case of substitution of chemical control, there are several opportunities, like supporting
present capacity expansion of the of Sugar Cane Growers Association of Paraiba (Associação de
Plantadores Cana da Paraíba – ASPLAN) to produce biological control agents for the sugarcane
plantations. Another opportunity is the expansion of the substitution of palma forrageira varieties
presently grown for resistant ones, where cooperatives, associations and other producer or civil
organizations can contribute in order to reach more ambitious targets in reduced time.

55.     Active phytosanitary surveillance can also be designed to include the private sector, in particular
farmers, especially regarding exotic pests. This action should be concatenated with sanitary education
programs, to enhance consciousness of the risk of new pests, and with training to better monitor and
early identify new pests. This would increase the probability of success in focused sanitation and pest
eradication.

Animal Sanitary Issues
56.    Animal health in the state of Paraiba can be ranked as relatively good. Meanwhile, some
shortcomings and improvements can be mentioned, regarding animal feeding, quarantine and other
diseases as well as institutional issues. The details are contained in the Volume 1: Risk Assessment and
the proposals are made in the following section.

Sanitary and Phytosanitary Risk Management Strategy
57.     The focus of the phytosanitary and sanitary risk management strategy is to avoid or delay the
occurrence of the risk event and manage the impact in the event of occurance. In particular avoiding or
at least delaying the appearance of exotic pests and animal diseases. The major actions are sanitary
education, surveillance, transit control and eradication. Detailed actions recommended for each one of
the supply chain categories follow:

Sugarcane
a) Expand the production of biological control agents to supply the autonomous cane growers’ potential
demand.

58.    Scope: To control the broca do caule and cigarrinhas da cana with biological control agents,
reducing the damage to the crop, production costs and negative environmental impacts.

59.    Beneficiaries: Autonomous sugarcane growers.

60.    Institutional framework: ASPLAN presently operates a commercial scale laboratory for
producing biological control agents, but its capacity is restricted and roughly meets 30-40% of the


                                                                                                           76
potential demand from the growers. The expertise is available in the laboratory but physical expansion is
needed.

61.   Connection with national policies: There is strong incentive and support from MAPA to
implement Integrated Pest Management Programs, which includes the use of biological control agents.

62.    Potential benefit: For each 1% infestation of the broca da cana, there is a reduction of 0.77% of
the weight of raw cane, 0.25% in sugar yield (35 kg / ha) and 0.20% in alcohol yield (30 L / ha),
according to Gallo et al., 2002. For biological control, wasps (Cotesia Flavipes) are released in the cane
fields at an average of 6,000 adults / ha / year (Biocontrol, no date). In addition to positive
environmental impact, biological pest control has economic advantages. The price per hectare of
applying insecticides averages R$ 42.00, while the biological control with Cotesia Flavipes, this cost is
approximately R$16.00 (Usina Jalles Machado, no date).

63.    The losses attributed to the leafhoppers are due to the extraction of sap in the leaves and roots of
sugarcane by adults and nymphs, respectively, and the injection of toxins by adults during the suction
process. The attack of this pest can result in losses in crop yield ranging from 15% to 80%, reduction of
the quality of the raw material with reductions of up to 30% sugar content. In addition, there may be
contamination problems in the manufacturing process due to sugarcane deterioration in the field
(Claudimir Penatti, Socicana, 2006). Biological control of leafhoppers with the fungus Metarhizium
Anisopliae is made using ca. 500 grams of pure conidia or the equivalent of 2-10kg of commercial
product per hectare. The cost of biological control can reach up to R$ 40.00 per hectare (Terezinha
Monteiro dos Santos Cividanes, personal information41), which is normally equivalent to 10% of
chemical control cost (Batista Filho, 2002).

64.     Actions planned for the short and medium term are as follows. In order to determine the
feasibility of expanding the present ASPLAN facilities for the production of biological control agents, it
is proposed to: determine the present demand of biological control agents and forecast the demand for
the next 10 years; identify the investments and recurrent resources needed for the expansion of present
laboratory facilities, in order to supply potential demand; establish the unitary costs (per hectare) of
biological control according to the projections of the expanded facilities, compared to present
technology (chemical control); organize a workshop and complementary actions, with interested
stakeholders, to discuss the expansion of the biological control agents; decide the next steps, including
providing the necessary funds, final expansion projects and chronogram.

b) Establish the risk and the impacts of the possible introduction of ferrugem laranja in the state of
Paraíba.

65.     Scope: Inform the Government, sanitary institutions, associations, private sector, growers and
other stakeholders of the negative impacts of the possible introduction of ferrugem laranja.

66.    Beneficiaries: Government, growers, sugarcane processors, sugar exporters, alcohol distributors.

67.      Institutional framework: SEDAP has the institutional and organizational conditions to perform
this action.

68.    Connection with national policies: There is a permanent quarantine service at federal level to
avoid or minimize the risks of the introduction of exotic pests, along with surveillance and quarantine
pest control services.

69.     Potential benefit: Based on the study of Zuza & Borsato (2011), losses in TAH (tons of total
reducible sugars per hectare) on sugarcane fields attacked by the ferrugem laranja were estimated at
18.82% (-2.19 TAH) for the second cut, 41.02% (-4.85 TAH) for third cut and 33.06% (-3.62 TAH) to
the fourth section, an overall average of 30.97%. Economic losses at field level were calculated to be
R$94.69 per hectare. There are no fungicides which might avoid its damages and losses registered in
Brazil (control of this disease).

70.    Actions planned for the short and medium term: Carry out a study to establish impacts
(agronomic, sanitary, economic, social, environmental and trade-related) in the case of ferrugem laranja
introduction in the state of Paraíba.

c) Set up a task force and a voluntary monitoring network to minimize the risk of introduction of the
ferrugem laranja.

71.     Scope: To protect the State against the introduction of the ferrugem laranja and be prepared for
its eventual introduction.

72.    Beneficiaries: Government, growers, sugarcane processors, sugar exporters, alcohol distributors

73.      Institutional framework: SEDAP has the institutional and organizational conditions to perform
this action.

74.    Connection with national policies: There is a permanent quarantine service at federal level to
avoid or minimize the risks of the introduction of exotic pests, along with surveillance and quarantine
pest control services.

75.     Potential benefits: There are two major benefits. First of all, if the stakeholders are fully
organized, focusing on minimizing the risk of introduction, all risky anthropic actions will be avoided or
adequately performed. Secondly, just in case of an eventual introduction, there is a large probability of
early detection, a key factor for the success of eradication measures.

76.     Actions planned for the short and medium term: identify all stakeholders, especially technical
assistance professionals, growers and its associations, cane processors, transporters among others;
prepare a surveillance plan and a long list of risky actions that might facilitate pest introduction, and the
correct procedures for each one of these actions; organize a workshop with the major stakeholders and


                                                                                                          78
smaller meetings in sugarcane production regions, to implement the plans; set up an information
services.

Fruticulture
a) Establish the risks and be aware of the impact of the possible introduction of the diseases sigatoka
negra and moko (bananas), cancro da videira and HLB (Citrus).

77.     Scope: Inform the Government, sanitary institutions, associations, private sector, growers and
other stakeholders of the negative impacts of the introduction of these diseases in Paraíba.

78.    Beneficiaries: Government, growers, processors and consumers.

79.      Institutional framework: SEDAP has the institutional and organizational conditions to perform
this action.

80.     Connection with national policies: There is a permanent quarantine service at federal level to
avoid or minimize the risk of exotic pests introduction, along with surveillance and quarantine pest
control services.

81.     Potential benefits and losses: Minimizing the risk of pest entry will avoid the losses caused by
the diseases, as follow: Sigatoka negra is a disease with a potential to completely destroy banana
plantations. Fungicide control of the pest is quite expensive and places negative hazards or impacts upon
the environment and public health; Moko is a disease caused by a bacteria attacking the whole plants.
Losses can reach up to 100% of the fruits; Cancro da videira is a bacterial disease which reduces both
the production and commercial quality of grapes; HLB is recongnized as the most destructive disease
affecting citrus. There is no curative control for the affected plants (which must be eradicated).

82.     Actions planned for the short and medium term: carry out a study to determine the risk of an
eventual introduction of the diseases sigatoka negra and moko (bananas), cancro da videira and HLB
(Citrus) and the impacts (agronomic, sanitary, economic, social, environmental and trade-related) of this
occurrence.

Family Agriculture in the Semiarid
a) Strengthen and improve the program aiming to substitute the older palma forrageira varieties for the
varieties resistant to the cochonilha do carmim, in order to increase the availability of food and water
for the goats or bovine herds during the drought season.

83.   Scope: Avoid the yield reduction of palma forrageira due to the attack of the cochonilha do
carmim throughout the semiarid zone.

84.    Beneficiaries: Government, rural households in the Semiarid.

85.    Institutional framework: Presently, there is a program to substitute the varieties of palma
forrageira, susceptible to the cochonilha do carmim, by resistant ones, developed by EMEPA. The

                                                                                                      79
institutions involved in this program (SEDAP, EMEPA and EMATER) have the conditions to elaborate
a study to enhance the program and implement it on a more ambitious basis.

86.     Connection with national policies: There are several federal policies targeting the improvement
of the production systems on the semi-arid zone (see under Current Institutional ARM Programs and
Policies above).

87.    Potential benefits and losses: During the drought season, herds are adversely affected by the
shortage of fodder and water, reducing their weight, meat quality, sometimes leading to death or
imposing unplanned selling of the animals to avoid even larger losses. Availability of staple fodder like
palma forrageira, which also is an important source of water for the animals, will substantially reduce
the animal losses, enhancing the households’ income.

88.     Actions planned for the short and medium term: determine the need of raquetes (palma
forrageira basic propagation material) needed to completely substitute the presently grown varieties,
susceptible to the cochonilha do carmim, by resistant ones; establish a chronogram and the resources to
be allocated for the production and distribution of raquetes.

Livestock Production Chains
a) Reinforce the program for control and eradication of brucellosis and tuberculosis.

89.    Scope: Reduce economic losses, and, health and social impacts of these diseases throughout the
State.

90.      Beneficiaries: Growers, consumers and the entire society.

91.     Institutional framework: There is a program for eradication of livestock diseases in Paraiba run
by the State Government, in close coordination with the Federal Government and the private sector.

92.    Connection with national policies: There is a national program aiming to the eradication of both
brucellosis and tuberculosis, and state programs that are conducted under this framework.

93.     Potential benefits and losses: According to Lilia Paulin42, brucellosis43 can cause a decrease in
meat production by 10%-15% and expand the interval between pregnancies between 12 to 20 months. It
also causes 30% increase in animal replacement rate, 15% drop in the birth of calves and decrease of
10%-24% in milk production. In addition, brucellosis can expose the product to sanitary barriers, which
reduces the competitiveness in international trade. Similar consequences occur with tuberculosis, being
the losses related to animal weight loss, delay in first lactation, reduced number of lactation, shorter

   The International Organization for Animal Health (OIE) classifies brucellosis as List B disease, meaning diseases that have
socio-economic and / or public health importance and significant consequences in international trade in animals and animal
products.


                                                                                                                           80
duration of lactation, economic losses by the sacrifice of positive reacting animals, barriers to national
and international trade and the possibility of contamination and transmission to humans.

94.     Actions planned for the short and medium term: evaluate the present implementation of the
eradication programs, specially identifying its gaps and deficiencies; implement appropriate actions for
enhancing the current programs, including operational actions, advertisement, sanitary education,
training and capacitation of stakeholders, and continuous follow up and evaluation.

b) Strengthen the coordination of the animal health services and programs, including food safety
programs, in order to rationalize the veterinary and public health protection services.

95.   Scope: Reduce the cases of non-conformity of processed animal products for human
consumption in the State of Paraiba.

96.    Beneficiaries: Growers, processors, Government, consumers.

97.    Institutional framework: There are several federal and state institutions involved in the inspection
of animal slaughter and animal product processing, with some degree of overlapping and lack of
coordination. There is need to involve the different actors (SEDAP, State Agency for Sanitary
Surveillance - AGEVISA, CAISAN, veterinary services of the municipalities) under the leadership of
the National Secretary for Agriculture and Livestock Health (Secretaria Nacional de Defesa
Agropecuária - SDA/MAPA) represented by the local MAPA office.

98.    Connection with national policies: There are national programs for inspection of slaughter
houses and food processors, as indicated in the paragraph above.

99.     Potential benefit: Reduced cases of non-conformity of animal products, reduced risk to the public
health, reduced economic losses and market barriers. There are no available estimations of financial
benefits that would derive from better animal health services coordination.

100. Actions planned for the short and medium term: Organize round tables involving animal
slaughter and food processing inspection; develop, agree and approve a common program; develop
coordination mechanisms; organize annual workshops for following up the implementation of the
common program and coordination mechanisms.

c) Establish the actual status of Classical Swine Fever (CSF) and Newcastle Disease Virus (NCDV) in
Paraiba and the measures to reach or maintain the pest free area status. as the last outbreak in the state
was recorded in 2006.

101. Scope: Reduce the potential economic and trade related losses, and, the negative impact on
public health.

102.   Beneficiaries: Farmers, processors, consumers, Government.



                                                                                                        81
103. Institutional framework: SEDAP is responsible for the official veterinary services in Paraiba,
including surveillance, eradication of animal diseases and to reach and maintain the disease free area of
the State.

104. Connection with national policies: There are national programs to eradicate, reach and maintain
CSF and NCDV free areas in Brazil, to which the state programs are subordinated.

105. Potential benefits and losses: Reduced cases of non-conformity of animal products, reduced risk
to public health, reduced economic losses and market barriers.

106. Actions planned for the short and medium term: conduct epidemiological surveys regarding CSF
and NCDV on the swine and poultry herds, respectively; take the appropriate actions according to the
results of the surveys, in case of virus presence; submit official bid for certification of area free of CSF,
NCDV or both.

d) Besides the exposed above, it is necessary to integrate EMEPA, universities and EMATER-PB to
develop alternatives and promote the use of fodder species suitable for the semiarid areas, for extensive
consumption and for silage. In addition, it is recommended to toughen the traffic control barriers and
the surveillance systems to support the free area condition of Paraiba for Foot and Mouth Disease
(FMD) and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI).

Supply Chain Coordination

Market Risks and Opportunities
107. Pineapple and banana are among the fruits that are most largely produced and traded in Paraiba.
Both are produced mostly for export outside the State. The inter-annual price variation is high and
largely responds to the changes in production and traded volumes (see Volume 1: Risk Assessment).
This price volatility, which is higher than the average volatility, results in production inefficiencies and
limits the commercial development opportunities for individual farmers, mostly family farmers.

108. There is a close relation between production and trade volatility, the poor supply chain
coordination and the limited access to adequate market information of most small scale fruit producing
farmers. Moreover, the incipient farmer organization in Paraiba is a contributing factor to the poor
supply chain coordination among the fruit producers in Paraiba.

109. Closer farm to market coordination and stronger farmer organization are the most evident ways
to cope with this situation. There are positive market coordination experiences that can be replicated
with the appropriate support. Among them it is worth to mention the pineapple producing and marketing
cooperative at Santa Rita, illustrated in the Text Box 2.

Text Box 2. 2: Santa Rita Pinneapple Production Cooperative

This cooperative was born in 1999 due to the need of a group of small scale pineapple producers
(43 now) to access a market that guarantees stable demand for their produce, proper price

                                                                                                          82
discovery and contract enforcement. Up to the Cooperative creation, most of the prospective
farmers sold their produce to local middlemen or to buyers in the consumer markets outside
Paraiba. They used to face high price volatility and serious problems to enforce the contracts. By
doing business with the Bolsa de Hortifrutigranjeiros, Cereais e Produtos Agropecuários do
Estado de Pernambuco (BHCP) the now associated farmers had the opportunity to access an
organized and transparent market. The prices are negotiated in a transparent manner and reflect
the national and international markets. The BHCP also provides insurance on the products
shipped, normally to Sao Paulo and other states in the central part of Brazil, and provides a legal
framework to guarantee payment. The prices obtained are not always the highest in the region
but there is a high degree of certainty about the business environment and, therefore, farmers
have managed to make investments and plan for the medium and long term. The cooperative also
receives permanent technical assistance from EMATER-PB, and that is possible because they are
organized as a group. The members of the cooperative feel they are better off now and in a
position to plan and undertake on farm investments.


110. The Local Productive Systems (Arranjo Produtivo Local - APL) approach has been encouraged
in Brazil and, in particular, in Paraiba. It is another background type of business development experience
to look at. APLs are a sort of cluster approach. APLs are regarded as articulations among supply chain
actors for mobilizing resources (credit, technology), facilitate marketing and in general promote greater
economic dynamism and less volatility.

111. For instance, the case of the citrus APL in Paraiba, the organizational structure is comprised of
governmental and non-governmental organizations, private companies, farmers associations and a
cooperative (Coopertange) which is the center of the APL. In the inner circle are the several farmers
associations in the different municipalities that are part of Coopertange, in the second circle are the
support infrastructure (EMATER, EMAPA, Universities, CONAB, banks, etc.), in the third circle are
the companies providing inputs, transportation services, packing, machinery maintenance, etc. However,
in spite of this well-structured organization there are no specific provisions for the market and marketing
issues. In that regard, there is an opportunity for assessing the APLs in Paraiba and identifying possible
areas of cooperation for improving the marketing components. In effect. APLs tend not to include a
marketing component.

112. In addition, there are business opportunities arising from procurement and policy stabilization
policies and programs managed by CONAB in Paraiba, specially PAA and National School Feeding
Program (Programa Nacional de Alimentação Escolar – PNAE), that could be incentivized through
appropriate technical assistance services and credit facilities.

113. Small farmers are particularly vulnerable to weak food markets and price volatility. The PAA
aims to support family farmer production and their access to market through simplified public
procurement procedures, and to distribute food in quantity, quality and regularity necessary to food-
insecure groups. Fundamentally, the PAA directly addresses one of the central challenges in family
farmer production: commercialization. Through State intervention it increases demand for smallholder


                                                                                                        83
food production. The PAA is a potentially important factor in expanding production for families
participating in the program as well as for strengthening the collective organizations.

114. PNAE, Brazil’s school feeding program, is the other major source of structured demand for
family farmers. Purchase from family farmers also aims at promoting local development and
complements the income of family farmers. PNAE’s procurement objectives, however, include both
price and the quality of food and the seasonality of production at local level. Therefore, it offers a stable
demand if the quantity, quality and continuity requirements are met.

115. Family agriculture farmers have the opportunity to organize themselves in associations to
participate in the CONAB’s procurement projects (PAA and PNAE). They provide primary products
and add value to their primary products by introducing some processing and incorporating adjustments
in the production process that improve the quality of the products. By doing so organized family
agriculture farmers can access to CONAB procurement and financial facilities. As was expressed by
CONAB’ managers in Paraiba, there is unmet demand and enough budget resources to increase the
buying programs. The opportunities include fruit processing, chicken abattoirs, milk and dairy, etc., in
addition to obtaining quality certifications mostly for animal products.

116. After a while beneficiary farmers can also access commercial market segments that are currently
outside their reach. In fact, CONAB’s projects offer a fixed price and a procurement long timeframe that
usually exceeds one year, in addition to financial resources, allowing for the groups to consolidate their
organization and technical skills before attempting to access the open market. This production and
marketing upgrade, however, requires strong technical assistance services. The discussion on the
Agricultural Innovation System below is relevant.

117. Cooperar made instruments available for market development through its cooperation program.
Cooperar participation in market development will be extensively expanded under the next phase (under
preparation) and the following actions can complement the initiatives already being planned.

Market Strategy
118. The ARM strategy proposed comprises actions aimed at reducing excessive fruit price and sales
volatility faced by family farmers, and, supporting them to take advantage of market opportunities
provided by the federal and state policies and programs. Both actions require technical assistant services,
availability of credit resources and market development support, involving EMATER-PB, Project
Cooperar II and other development projects, the APL initiative, etc.

119. COOPERAR will support a competitive mechanism for supporting small-scale producers,
including: identification of market opportunities, development of business plans in conjunction with
public and private purchasers, co-financing of investments and technical assistance to producer
organizations and capacity building of producer organizations.

120.   The following are other recommended actions:


                                                                                                          84
   a) Make an inventory of farm to market experiences in Paraiba like the one involving pineapple
      producer in Santa Rita described above (Text Box 2.2).
   b) Identify value adding activities for family farmer groups that can be developed as projects for
      CONAB’s managed PAA or PNAE, carried out in cooperation between CONAB and SEDAP.
   c) Investigate successful APL experiences in the State of Paraiba seeking to identify initiatives that
      require additional support to strengthen market coordination.
   d) In cooperation with EMATER-PB, and within the framework of the Agriculture Innovation
      System explained in next section, develop a methodology to support family farmer organizations
      to develop business plans regarding activities such as fruit processing, packaging, chicken
      abattoirs, etc.
   e) Assess different market development support options for family farming products, including
      establishing market space facilities in places like Campina Grande or Patos, as is being planned
      by the Paraiba State Company for Supply and Agriculture Services (Empresa Paraibana de
      Abastecimento e Serviços Agrícolas – EMPASA), channel public resources through Project
      Cooperar to transfer resources to farmer organizations for establishing and managing marketing
      infrastructure, etc.
   f) Analyze the legal implications of the above proposal, in particular with respect to the possibility
      of transferring public funds to farmer organizations, and proposal elaboration regarding
      Cooperar.

Agricultural Innovation System (AIS)
Current Research and Extension Institutional Framework
121. There are several institutions (see list below) that generate technological innovations for the
semi-arid region, both at state and regional level. From the analysis of the major programs and projects
of these institutions and interviews with different stakeholders, the issue of a lack of inter-agency
coordination arises. Many times, there is a repetition of research topics without the certainty that the
tests carried out on the same topic in other research centers are taken into account.

122. The current coordination between the research and the extension agencies also seems to be
insufficient; to enable producers to have better risk management, it is necessary to strengthen the
coordination among the institutions in charge of technology generation, and between these and the ones
in charge of technologic transfer to family farmers.

123. In regard to technical assistance, the several projects and programs that provide technical
assistance to family farmers are unsystematic and limited in terms of geographic coverage and
recipients. Currently family farmers who receive technical assistance are a minority, and their number is
not expected to increase significantly in coming years. It was also verified that the coordination among
technical assistance providers is limited, the same as occurs between the research and the extension
agents.



                                                                                                      85
124. The technical assistance services should be improved, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The
quality of technical assistance refers both to the content of technological packages issued and to the
methods and methodologies used to provide technical assistance. It also alludes to the coordination that
must exist, not only among the group of institutions that provide technical assistance, but also with the
other institutions that are a part of the agriculture innovation system in Paraiba (basically the previously
mentioned research institutions).

125. The capacity of EMATER-PB to provide agricultural extension services is low and requires
improvements. Bascially, the only transfer channel family farmers have is the public technical assistance
service. EMATER-Paraiba currently assists 30% of Paraiba’s family farmers (approximately 40-45,000
producers, out of a total of more than 148,000 family farmers), and is not ready to expand its coverage
with its current technical staff.

126. On the other hand, there are other technical assistance providers in the State, mainly non-
governmental organizations (NGOs). By way of example, the National Institute for Colonization and
Agrarian Reform (Instituto Nacional de Colonização e Reforma Agrária – INCRA) hires private entities
for the provision of technical assistance and extension services to the families living in their settlements
(there are more than 300 settlements in Paraiba, with 14,500 families in total). SEDAP has also hired
NGOs to develop some programs. COOPERAR is conducting a survey on potential technical assistance
providers in the State, as well as to explore other non-public extension modalities.

127. According to several stakeholders, technical assistance provided by these NGOs is not good
(some say the same of EMATER) and disagreements exist between EMATER-PB and NGOs. In any
case, it is clear that the vast majority of family farmers will still depend on the efficiency of the technical
assistance and agricultural extension public system.

128. Faced with the current limitations that hinder technical assistance universalization for the vast
number of family farmers in Paraiba’s Semi-arid, it is necessary to carry out a detailed analysis for
understanding the technological requirements by the different types of farmers. It is necessary to define
the most appropriate technological solutions for each group of farmers, to identify the percentage of
them who can get involved in profitable agricultural activities, etc. It would be very inefficient to
propose uniform solutions for such a heterogeneous rural population.

On the Need for a Working Agriculture Innovation System
129. According to the World Bank (2012), "an innovation system is defined as a network of
organizations, enterprises and individuals focused on bringing new products, new processes and new
forms of organization into social and economic use, together with the institutions and policies that affect
their behavior and performance. It embraces science suppliers as well as the totality of actors and
interactions involved in innovation. It extends beyond the creation of knowledge to encompass the
factors affecting demand for and use of knowledge in new and useful ways."




                                                                                                            86
130. An Agriculture Innovation System (AIS) does not exist as such in Paraiba, since the
organizations that provide services are not structured as a network and they are not minimally
coordinated. The system has to be created, but it is useful to refer to it as a consolidation of categories of
analysis. The components of the System would be the institutions responsible for knowledge generation,
i.e. research centers; the institutions responsible for transferring that knowledge to end-users, i.e.
technical assistance and extension agencies; and those in charge of training producers.

131. In Paraiba, and with focus on family farming, the institutions involved in the agriculture
innovation system would need to be: (i) on the research side, the EMEPA-PB, INSA, EMBRAPA-
Semiárido, and to a lesser extent EMBRAPA-Algodão, EMBRAPA-Mandioca e Fruticultura and the
Federal University of Paraíba in the Center of Agricultural Sciences (Centro de Ciências Agrárias -
CCA/UFPB); and (ii) on the side of technical assistance, extension, and training of family farmers, the
EMATER Paraíba, some NGOs, universities, private providers and externally funded projects, as
Cooperar (World Bank) and Procase (IFAD). And regarding institutions not related to semiarid,
ASPLAN (Associação de Plantadores de Cana da Paraíba) deserves to be mentioned; it carries out
technical assistance activities for micro and small sugarcane planters who pertain to family farming.

Main Elements of the Agriculture Innovation System Related ARM Strategy

Improve coordination of the Agriculture Innovation System for family farming ARM
132. As mentioned above, there is need for a strategy focused on the improvement of the agriculture
innovation system efficiency and coordination. It is absolutely necessary to establish and/or strengthen
inter-agency coordination mechanisms, based on a state policy, clear priorities and the allocation of
resources. This requires short and medium-term measures.

133. Currently, there is the State Board of Sustainable Rural Development (Conselho Estadual de
Desenvolvimento Rural Sustentável - CEDRS), chaired by the Secretary of the SEDAP (Secretaria
Estadual de Desenvolvimento Agropecuário e da Pesca), and composed of representatives of the main
public entities who support rural development and family agriculture, like the MDA, EMATER,
INTERPA, SEDAP, Federal Economic Bank (Caixa Econômica Federal – CEF), Banco do Brazil,
Banco do Nordeste, Projeto Cooperar, CONAB, INCRA and other Secretaries of State, as well as the
institutions that represent farmers the most, such as the Agricultural Workers Federation (Federação dos
Trabalhadores na Agricultura - FETAG), Agriculture and Livestock Federation of Paraiba (Federação
da Agricultura e Pecuária da Paraíba – FAEPA), Paraíba Rural Producers Union, Landless Rural
Workers Movement (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra – MST), Articulation of Paraiba
Semiarid (Articulação do Semi-árido Paraibano - ASA/PB, and NGOs from other segments of civil
society. Given its current integration it is a deliberative and consultative body, with poor executive
functions, but with the appropriate adjustments it could constitute the right agriculture innovation system
coordination framework.

134. In order to better focus the actions of CEDRS in the agriculture innovation system, it would be
necessary to create a sub-council or a similar organ that can bring together the institutions that are part

                                                                                                           87
of the agriculture innovation system in a coordinated way. At present, an internal committee was created
to propose amendments to the CEDRS regulations in order to become more executive. This could be a
good opportunity to make detailed proposals on the agriculture innovation system sub-council
integration, definition of roles and interrelations, establishment of procedural rules and to appoint an
Executive Secretary. With this general framework in place, it would be possible to formally create the
Paraiba Agricultural Innovation System.

135. In addition, it will be necessary to implement measures for the internal coordination of the two
sub-systems: one in charge of research, and the other one in charge of technical assistance and
agricultural extension. The research sub-system will consist of state and regional institutions. Among the
state institutions, the most relevant is EMEPA-PB, which has been strengthened in recent years after
undergoing a weakening period. It currently works on adaptive research and technology related solutions
for family agriculture and agribusiness (several of those solutions aim at the coexistence with semi-arid)
by way of nine Experimental Stations. EMEPA-PB seems to have constant relation and coordination of
activities with the research centers of EMBRAPA, but that is not the case with INSA, which is a federal
research institution focused on the Brazilian semi-arid.

136. INSA44 could have an important role in the coordination and organization of the technology
generation activities in the Semi-arid. However, the approach taken by INSA seems to have been mostly
oriented towards research, putting aside the role of organizer or coordinator. In the technician
interviews, both from EMEPA-PB and EMBRAPA-Semiarid, it was agreed that INSA mostly works
alone, not interacting with those institutions.

137. Taking into account that no technology generation institution participates in the CEDRS, the
proposed short-term action is that INSA must fulfil its mission as the body in charge of organizing semi-
arid related research and that it should allocate most of its human and material resources to that
assignment. Once the CEDRS is restructured or once the agriculture innovation system coordinating
sub-council is created, with all institutions involved in agricultural research under its orbit, then INSA
could remain as the organizer of the research sub-system.

138. Regarding the technical assistance and agricultural extension sub-system, all its institutions are
part of the CEDRS, so it should be easier to promote coordination. However, as was mentioned before,
according to government officers, the relationship between EMATER-PB and NGOs that provide
technical assistance is not a good one, there are mistrusts and disagreements between both parties. So
until the proposed agriculture innovation system coordinating sub-council is created it might not be
possible to make any progress in the organization and coordination of these institutions.




44
   INSA mission is to: "Make inter-agency solutions viable for the fulfillment of actions related to the research, training,
dissemination, and policy formulation to reach sustainable coexistence with the Brazilian semi-arid from the socio economic
and environmental potentialities of the region."


                                                                                                                         88
Increase Efficiency of the Agriculture Innovation System for Family Farming ARM
139. Apparently, the activities of both EMEPA-PB and EMBRAPA have many simple and validated
technologies in stock or standby, using a set of technologies that reduce vulnerability to drought
(tecnologias de convivência com o semiárido), but that have not been adopted by the farmers. This
means that available technology would not be a constraint for family farmers to improve the production
risk management, mainly in the case of semi-arid. In any case, it would be important to carry out a
survey to gather precise information regarding available technologies for coexistence with the semi-arid,
currently being done in the context of the preparation of Cooperar. The proposal in the short-term is to
make an exhaustive inventory of the available techniques and practices that allow an increase of the
resilience of agricultural systems and to determine the extent of their implementation at field level.

140. To improve efficiency of the research sub-system, it is essential that the different research
institutions do not duplicate research activities and in turn cooperate to potentiate the achievements. This
seems to be the case with the palma forrageira: both EMEPA-PB and INSA conducted researches to
develop varieties resistant to the Cochinilla-do-Carmim (Dactylopius opuntiae) – an hemiptera insect
that damages plants – and to develop micropropagation techniques of the species to produce large scale
seedlings. It seems that EMEPA-PB was the pioneer in these works in the State (using varieties that
were previously tested in Pernambuco), and it is not clear why INSA also dabbled in the same area.
These inefficacies could be solved once a good coordination environment is in place.

141. In regards to technical assistance and extension sub-system a reference is needed to EMATER-
PB (see Text Box 3 with information on EMATER-PB), as the State institution responsible for extension
services. But there has been a significant institutional deterioration in Paraiba, something that is widely
acknowledged. The strengthening of EMATER-PB is key for family farmers and other small and
medium scale farmers to be able to access risk management technology and adopt related practices,
since smallholders are almost unable to access commercial technical assistance suppliers. The new
technical assistance model should not consider EMATER as the sole technical assistance provider.
Family farmers could also receive subsidies to purchase these services in the market.

Text Box 2. 3: EMATER in Paraíba

EMATER was founded in 1975, under the Secretaria da Agricultura e Abastecimento, with the
objective of collaborating with the competent bodies in the formulation and implementation of
technical assistance and agricultural extension policies in the State, and to plan, coordinate and
execute technical assistance and agricultural extension programs. In the 90s it suffered from the
crisis endured by the entire system in Brazil, when the Brazilian Company for Technical
Assistance and Rural Extension (Empresa Brasileira de Assistência Técnica e Extensão Rural -
EMBRATER), the company that led the system, was closed down at federal level. The recent
creation of the National Agency for Technical Assistance and Rural Extension (Agência
Nacional de Assistência Técnica e Extensão Rural - ANATER ) in May 2014, indicates that the
Federal Government wants to promote technical assistance and agricultural extension throughout
the country. Article 19 of Law 12.897 (18.12.2013) authorizes ANATER to sign "specific
partnerships with state bodies in charge of technical assistance and agricultural extension for the

                                                                                                         89
execution of services", thus enabling the transfer of resources to state institutions.


142. One of the issues is technical assistance coverage. Currently EMATER-PB assists 30% of the
State’s family farmers with approximately 500 field technicians. But EMATER-PB also performs other
functions that absorb part of its staff time, for example, registration of farmers for the issuance of the
DAP (Capability Statement for PRONAF45), which is required by farmers to have access to subsidized
agricultural credit. Furthermore, field agents do not work under a results-orientation system, their
performance is not measured, and they are not accountable to farmers.

143. Another issue is the limited availability of field technical staff. The company has 15 regional
coordination offices and 213 operating units to deal with the 223 State municipalities (177 belong to the
semi-arid region), but 40 of those units do not have agricultural extensionists in charge at the moment.
The solution proposed by EMATER’s technicians and authorities is to increase the number of technical
staff. In addition, there is the issue of poor specific technical trainings for extensionists, as apparently
was available in the past. Training, update of technical skills and human development are considered
key elements. Extension agents do not have access to updated knowledge and ongoing training.

144. Moreover, 38% of the technicians in the company are retired but still working, and R$ 40 million
are required in order to terminate their contracts. 70% of the staff is over the age of 50. The Secretary of
SEDAP mentioned that in 2015 they will make a call for applications to hire 500 technicians. The last
time they made a call was in 2006.

145. Related to the weaknesses of EMATER-PB is the issue of overlapping functions with EMEPA-
PB. For instance, EMEPA-PB executes small demonstrative projects (mentioned above and in Annex)
financed by the State Fund for Poverty Combat and Eradication (Fundo de Combate e Erradicação da
Pobreza – FUNCEP) (11,200 beneficiary farmers and total financing of R$ 2.6 million). This most
likely happens because EMATER-PB is not capable of providing the technical assistance services.

146. In conclusion, in order to expand the coverage of the extension services, improve program
coordination and effectiveness, upgrade training programs, develop tailor-made ARM programs,
EMATER-PB needs to increase its budget and improve its effectiveness and results orientation, as
current resources and modalities limit the coverage and quality of service.

Improve and Better Target Technical Assistance and Training Programs
147. It is proposed that new technical assistance and training models for technicians and farmers be
tested, promoting trainers training, cascade training, farmer to farmer technology transfer methodology,
farmer contracting, etc. Another proposal is to widen the use of information and communication
technologies (ICT) as a way to reduce costs and reach farmers massively. In this sense the use of cell

phone messaging to transmit technical information should become widespread; and start training
producers through distance education methodologies.

148. An interesting example of appropriate program methodology is the Programa Agente de
Desenvolvimento Rural (ADR), developed by SEBRAE-PB in support of goat farming. The ADRs are
people belonging to the communities that have been technically trained. Each one of the agentes works
with around 20 producers. The program is considered successful46, since it has improved goat
production significantly in the Cariri region, where it originated and currently assists about 1500 family
farmers.

149. At the same time, efforts should be made to put in place private sector based technical assistance
services driven by farmers. There are many NGOs that perform technical assistance and agricultural
extension activities at private level, mainly in INCRA settlements. There are 305 settlements in Paraiba,
with 14.5 thousand families living there. In addition, externally funded rural development projects,
which have been implemented in the State, Procase (IFAD) and Cooperar (World Bank), have hired
technical assistance providers to develop some activities.

150. It is essential that in the future, EMATER programs and operations are well coordinated with
other research and extension institutions working in Paraiba. There is a need to complete a registry of all
technical assistance providers in the State, currently underway in Cooperar, including either private
entities or individuals who may provide technical assistance to family agriculture. This will help identify
available resources and plan a proper coordination between public and private technical assistance
supply for family farmers.

151. Finally, there is the issue of targeted assistance. The 1991 Agricultural Law determined that the
Union must maintain technical assistance and rural extension services publicly provided and free for
small farmers (Primo Junior, J. et al., 2013). But, are all the 148,000 family farmers, especially those in
the semi-arid, may not be economically viable agricultural units that would obtain appropriate benefits
from technology services.

152. One might think that the recurring droughts would motivate migration to urban areas and, thus,
the number of family farmers to decrease over the years. However, the data from the agricultural census
does not confirm such hypothesis. Between 1980 and 2006 the number of all farms remained the same,
while the area registered in the census did not increase. Considering farms of up to 50 hectares in size47
as proxy for family farmers, these increased 11.1% between the last two censuses (1995-2006), while its
total area increased by 11.9%.

46
  The team was not able to assess the program directly but there are positive evaluations like “ O fortalecimento da cadeia da
caprinocultura como instrumento de desenvolvimento e geração de renda: um estudo de caso no município de Monteiro/PB,
by Gilney Christierny Barros dos Anjos, Universidade Federal de Campina Grande.
47
  146,291 in the 2006 census, meanwhile family farms were 148,047. Only in the 2006 census the number of family farmers
(according to the definition of agricultura familiar from Law No. 11326) was estimated.


                                                                                                                           91
153. The size of almost 60% of the farms with less than 50 hectares is of less than 5 hectares, with an
average area of less than two hectares. It is highly unlikely for a family in the semi-arid to reach the
subsistence threshold if it relies only on the production of a farm of less than 5 hectares, or even worse
of 2 hectares. In the case of livestock production, the average stocking rate for the Caatinga 48 area is
around 12.5 ha/Animal Unit (AU)/year, although the verified average stocking rate is around 4.4
ha/AU/year (A. Maia Neto, 2013). It can be argued that smallholder sheep and goat breeding is carried
out with the support of the so-called Fundo de Pastos, areas for collective use where flocks of several
farmers are extensively raised.

154. Even so, it is most likely that these families currently rely more on other sources of income (such
as social assistance and drought and flood compensation programs).49 Therefore, such rural households
may not be very interested in adopting technological innovations requiring additional on-farm
investments, higher recurrent costs, and increased use of labor in the farm, which probably is being used
to generate income from off-farm sources.

155. The most reasonable approach to such a diversity of rural households is to adapt agricultural
extension means and methods to user specific asset situations and market perspective. Therefore, the
proposal is to perform a baseline study to determine the extent of household heterogeneity in the semi-
arid of Paraiba and to have a first approximation to a farmer typology. It will then be possible to have a
better estimate of the number of farmers that have to be targeted with appropriate ARM technological
solutions and approaches. EMATER-PB restructuring should follow these results.

156. Some programs, however, are crucial in the semi-arid, such as the upgrading of Programa Palma
Resistente, and should in any case continue to be a priority. According to EMEPA-PB’s technicians, the
Programa Palma Resistente has a demand of 60 million rackets and is expected to produce 13 million in
its second phase next year.




48
  Caatinga is the prevailing biome in the semi-arid.

  Retirements, Bolsa Familia, etc. State transfers from pensions and social assistance programs provide a substantial part of
families' incomes and allow food to be purchased outside the household. State transfers for old age pensions and Bolsa
Família serves to diversify the poor's portfolio and buffer the direct effects of drought.

CHAPTER 4: ARM ACTION PLAN

157. The present ARM action plan reflects the strategic lines described in the previous section and
includes some basic details on who, when and how much is required for the implementation of the
actions proposed. This is an initial proposal based on possible inputs and which needs to be discussed in
detail with the Government of Paraiba.

158. The cost of the entire ARM action plan has been estimated at a total of US$ 18,371,000 over 5
years, with a strong concentration of activities within the first two years. Out of this total, US$
5,571,000 would correspond to studies, training and pre-investment and US$12,800,000 to program
investments. The EMATER’s staff cost is not part of the ARM Action Plan but it is included as a
complementary public policy, as has been mentioned by State policy makers. The summary break down
by category of intervention is as follows:

ANNEX 1: PROJECTED CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON AGRICULTURE IN
NORTHEAST BRAZIL

1.      It is considered probable that climate change will cause global increases in temperature by 2 to
5.4 degrees Celsius in a pessimistic scenario (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - IPCC A2)
and by 1.4 to 3.8 degrees Celsius in the more optimistic scenario (IPCC B2).52 In Northeast Brazil, this
means that rainfall will likely be reduced by 15-20% under the pessimistic scenario. In the Semi-Arid
region that covers most of Northeast Brazil, rainfall is already less than 800 millimeters per year and
rainfall variability is among the highest in the world.53 See Figure A1-1 below.

Figure A1 - 1: Northeast Brazil Climate Predictions, 1971-2000 and 2041-207054




Source: World Bank, 2013



52 The IPCC A2 scenario represents high carbon emissions; the B2 scenario implies low carbon emissions under the hypothesis that all
countries sign the Kyoto Protocol.
53 World Bank, 2013. Climate Change Impacts on Water Resources Management: Adaptation Challenges and Opportunities in Northeast

Brazil.
54
    Figure shows mean annual precipitation, mean annual evapotranspiration, and drought index (precipitation divided by
evapotranspiration) for the periods of 1971-2000 and 2041-2070 (projected) using the MIMR climatic model under the B1 emission
scenario. The more red coloration corresponds to increased drought, due to reduced rainfall and/or increased evapotranspiration.



                                                                                                                               112
2.      Possible impacts of climate change in Northeast Brazil include (i) increased frequency of dry
spells and evaporation rates leading to lower soil moisture levels and reductions in water reservoirs, (ii)
losses in natural ecosystems such as the caatinga, (iii) tendency towards aridization and desertification
in the Semi-Arid Region, (iv) water scarcity, (v) climate induced migration to large cities, and (vi)
impacts on human health.55

3.     Figure A1-2 highlights seven indicators that convey vulnerability to climate change in Brazil as a
whole. In the Northeast, the vulnerability scenario is more drastic: employment in agriculture, soil
degradation, and the risk of extreme weather events indicators are all higher than the country average.

Source: World Bank, 2013

4.     In the Northeast, climate change will have significant impacts on the livelihoods of the poorest,
those that rely on rain-fed agriculture. Climate change is seen as a migration “push” factor, and
migration is projected to increase from the rural Northeast as the value of agricultural production
declines due to climate risks.57

5.     Climate change signifies shifts in temperature and rainfall regimes, which affect agricultural
productivity by shifting suitable area for agricultural production, altering agricultural yields, changing
water availability, and producing conditions that increase the likelihood of plant pathogens.

6.     Reductions in area are projected for all but one of the major commodity crops in Brazil.
Projected climate change impacts on all currently produced food grains will amount to US$4 billion by
2050. Soybeans are likely to be most affected by climate change, with the soybean sector alone
accounting for almost 50% of these economic losses.58 Margulis and Dubeux (2010) modeled the
economic effects of climate change on Brazil’s GDP and found that in the worst case, Brazil could lose
about 2.5% every year due to the impacts of increasing temperature (Tables A1-1 and A1-2).

7.      Projections from Assad et al (2012) highlight the severe risks of climate change’s negative
impacts on three principal agricultural activities in Northeast Brazil (livestock pasture, maize, and
beans). However, even under a pessimistic scenario (IPCC Scenario A2), the area suitable for sugarcane
in Brazil could double by 2020. For Paraiba, this would offset some of the production lost from other
crops. See Figures A1-3, A1-4, and A1-5, below.

8.      Fernandes et al (2011) found that adaptation interventions (short/long cycle varieties, deeper
rooted and drought-tolerant varieties, moderate irrigation at critical growth phases, shift in planting
dates) can mitigate yield declines in all impacted crops. In combination with incentives and
infrastructure for efficient water use, agriculture can evolve to become resilient to climate change, but a
business as usual scenario ignoring climate change in the long run will lead to severe losses. Early
adaptation planning and investments will save costs and can prevent significant damages.

ANNEX 2: VULNERABILITY IN PARAIBA

1.      Climate variability has long been considered a constraint to economic development and poverty
alleviation in Northeast Brazil. Long-term impacts of repeated exposure to shocks bring household food
insecurity, which is much higher in the rural Northeast than urban, and whose rural levels are amongst
the highest in Brazil. Repeated shocks confine rural households into a poverty trap, exhausting savings
and dissolving investments that would otherwise help propel the household ahead. Expenditures on
drought mitigation and emergency measures also divert municipal resources from longer-term
investments in human capital and productivity.

2.      The impacts of the aforementioned risks have greater consequences for human welfare among
the individuals, communities, and regions of Paraiba that are more vulnerable. As we have already seen,
a single risk such as drought has different effects on different systems of productions and producers.
Vulnerability is the concept that explains this heterogeneity in impact. This annex explores drivers of
heterogeneity in vulnerability in Paraiba.

3.      Vulnerability is “the likelihood that at a given time in the future, an individual will have a le vel
of welfare below some norm or benchmark.”59 Common welfare indicators include poverty
measurements, household expenditures, savings levels, and food security and nutrition measures (such
as food consumption score and household dietary diversity). Though vulnerability depends on the
severity of external shocks like climate, the likelihood of a drop in welfare depends on both people’s
context and capacity to act and react. Socio-economic assets and institutions play an important role in
people’s vulnerability.

4.      Vulnerability is not the same thing as exposure to a shock, since many households can
experience, say, a drought with different welfare outcomes. Vulnerability research emphasizes that both
the settings and the asset levels of a household influence the livelihood strategies households choose.60
Since vulnerability results from the combination of factors exogenous and endogenous to the individual,
the same exogenous shock, like drought, affects individuals differently. In addition, if an individual or
household is vulnerable to one exogenous shock, it does not follow that the household is vulnerable to
all shocks. For example, a subsistence-oriented rural farming household may be vulnerable to drought
and other possible climatic shocks like irregular and delayed rainfall, but may not be vulnerable to price
shocks if the household is not commercializing its production.

5.     Vulnerable households in Paraiba respond to shocks by reducing household consumption, selling
household and productive assets, and seeking income sources off the farm with diverse strategies
including migration and even prostitution. Households depend on their own production for income as

well as their food, so different factors that facilitate access to alternate sources of food and income are
important coping strategies after a shock.

6.       Thankfully, in the recent droughts in Paraiba, there have been no reported deaths. Fifty years ago
droughts triggered famine and mass migration. Because of a mixture of social safety nets and
institutional responses, drought kills animals and crops, but not humans.

A. Vulnerability and Welfare Indicators
7.     Vulnerability is of greater concern when the household’s starting welfare levels are low, because
a shock will push a household into even more precarious living conditions. Though technically
vulnerability measures marginal changes in welfare of a household, for our purposes the concept is most
useful when applied to groups that are already at the margin of decent welfare.

Figure A2 - 1: Distribution of Rural Population in Paraiba (2010)




8.     Poverty exacerbates vulnerability because a shock will have greater proportional effects on the
welfare of a poor household than on a wealthier household. For this reason, it is worthwhile to look at
socio-economic indicators in Paraiba to characterize baseline poverty and asset levels.

9.      Though poverty has been declining in the Northeast as in the rest of Brazil in the last decade,
poverty in rural areas, where livelihoods concentrate on agriculture, remain high (Figure A2-2). While in
Brazil in 2010 25.5% of the rural population was considered extremely poor, this rate was 35.4% for the
Northeast’s rural population. The Northeast essentially tied for last place with the North region (35.7%),
and drastically behind all other regions of the country (10.2%, 6.8%, and 11.7% in the Southeast, South,
and Center-West, respectively). In Paraiba, you are twice as likely to be poor if you live in rural areas,
than urban areas. In 2012, 25% of the rural population was poor (per capita monthly income of R$140 or
less), compared to 12.6% in urban Paraiba.

10.    In 2012, in Paraiba, 8.1% of the population was extremely poor (less than R$70 per capita
monthly income).62 However, in the 170 municipalities of the Paraiba Semi-Arid Region, which covers
most of the area of the state, the average rate of extreme poverty, less than R$70 per capita per month, is
20%. See Figure A2-3 below.

   Brazil does not have an official poverty line. In recent years, the R$70 and R$140 per capita per month, which are administrative poverty lines defined for
the Bolsa Familia program and the Brasil Sem Miseria Plan, have been increasingly used in place of official poverty lines. The international US$1.25 line is
also used on occasion, notably in relation to the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). As a result of methodological differences in the computation of
lines and income aggregates, there are sometimes small differences between government and World Bank estimates. However, trends are broadly consistent
across methodologies.

12.      The human development index, which accounts for education (literacy and school enrollment
rates), longevity (life expectancy at birth) in addition to income (GDP per capita), has improved like
other indicators since 2000, but Paraiba remains in the low human development category (Human
Development Index – HDI, below 0.499). The municipalities of João Pessoa and Campina Grande
consistently stand out on development indicators (Figure A2-5).

14.    Though 24% of the population in Paraiba is officially classified as rural (2004), the number of
food insecure households in rural areas contributes 28% of the total number of food insecure in
Paraiba,64 making food insecurity disproportionately rural.

15.   Families on average spend 20% of income on food and acquire 7.5% of their food from their
own production or non-monetary acquisition (2008).

16.   Food insecurity also disproportionately affects people of color that identify as negro or pardo.
The majority (68.47%) of all the moderate/grave food insecure households in Paraiba are non-white.65

17.     When measuring vulnerability, it is important to focus on populations that are most at risk of
falling beneath the poverty line, into food insecurity, or other measurement of human development and
social welfare. To be systematic the set of measurements of interest should be determined in advance
and prioritized in order to work to avoid the worst outcomes. For example, in the Sahel donors agreed
upon a limited set of indicators of resilience-related livelihood outcomes and impacts: Reduction in
Humanitarian Assistance Needs, Depth of Poverty, Moderate to Severe Hunger, and Global Acute
Malnutrition.66

B. Vulnerability is Heterogeneous
18.    To capture why vulnerability varies between individual to individual, household to household,
vulnerability can be seen as the function of three factors: (i) sensitivity, (ii) adaptive capacity, and (iii)
exposure.67

      i.   Sensitivity is the degree of impact of the initial shock. Sensitivity can be thought of as the
           elasticity of household welfare (e.g. consumption levels) in response to a shock.
     ii.   Adaptive capacity is the ability of the household to access ex-post coping strategies that helps
           the household return to pre-shock welfare levels.68
 iii.      Exposure is the probability of the given shock materializing and affecting the household’s
           assets.

19.    Several indices have been constructed in Northeast Brazil to measure the socio-economic aspects
of vulnerability of smallholder farmers. 69 Two examples are included here, with the first (Table A2-3)
focused on the risk of drought and the second (Table A2-4) on conditions of social vulnerability to

   Adaptive capacity is a subset of resilience. USAID defines resilience as the ability of people, households, communities, countries, and systems to adapt to
and recover from shocks and stresses in a manner that reduces chronic vulnerability and facilitates inclusive growth.
69
   Sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and exposure can each be measured through a number of indicators, and several vulnerability indices have been formulated
to capture the heterogeneity of impacts of agricultural risk for farmers in developing countries. See Lindoso et al. 2012. Supplementary Material for
“Integrated Assessment of Smallholder Farming’s Vulnerability to drought in the Brazilian Semi -Arid: a case study in Ceará” for a more comprehensive
review of the vulnerability index literature and comparison of various indices. Though there is growing consensus that vulnerability is defined by sensitivity,
adaptive capacity, and exposure, consensus does not yet exist for what composite of variables should be measured to determine each of these factors.

20.     This annex expands upon these relevant indicators (socio-economic vulnerability index as
presented in Box A2-1) and suggests measurements for analyzing vulnerability to drought, the most
significant agricultural risk for small farmers in Paraiba. A number of indicators for sensitivity, adaptive
capacity, and exposure can be considered to characterize the vulnerability of farmers.

C. Sensitivity:

21.      Sensitivity is the extent of change in a household’s welfare (elasticity) induced by a shock.

22.     A number of factors influence the sensitivity of a household to an agricultural shock like
drought. Prolonged drought affects household incomes most directly by constraining agricultural and
livestock yields. However, income diversification and productive diversification, along with ex-ante
mitigation measures, can minimize household sensitivity. Measurements of sensitivity of a household
should take into account:

       Household revenue diversification, including access to income transfers (Retirement and
        disability stipends, Bolsa Família);
       Agricultural/productive diversification;
       Access to water resources for productive activities and human consumption;
       Number of dependents.

23.     A household with diversified income sources, including non-farm income, and diversified
agricultural production will be less sensitive to drought because their principal income sources will not
all be affected in the same way. Access to water resources is important to minimize sensitivity because
household consumption and production is less dependent on rainfall. Finally, a household with a larger
number of dependents is likely to have a more elastic initial response to drought because finite
household resources must be divided between more people that cannot contribute substantially to
household revenues. However, this is somewhat offset by the fact that these dependents qualify the
household to receive social transfers (Bolsa Família for children and retirement for adults), so the
baseline of these households’ revenues may even be higher than without dependents.

24.     Fortifying these kinds of characteristics/assets help to mitigate the impact of a shock, reduce
sensitivity, and reduce vulnerability.

      a) Income Diversification

25.     A farming household that has little or no income diversification is more sensitive to an
agricultural risk than a household that has a stream of income from non-farm economic activities. In
Paraiba, like much of rural Northeast Brazil, agricultural activities are generally the dominant form of
occupation (Figure A2-6). In many municipalities of Paraiba, employment in agricultural activities is
over 50%. The service industry is the second most important sector of work and often includes public
employment (Figure A2-7). 87% of agricultural units in Paraiba classify as family farming (less than
four fiscal modules with predominantly family labor).




                                                                                                         125

26.    However, data on sources of income shows that in reality, families’ incomes rely to a large
extent on income transfers and public employment. This situation has been referred to as the novo
mundo rural atrasado – the “new backward rural world.”72

27.    In Paraiba, about 29% of the average monthly family income relies on state transfers (R$493.24),
compared to 22.5% average dependency on transfers for the Northeast and 18.5% for Brazil as a
whole.73 A little more than half of family income comes from work (54.9%) and 12.5% from non-
monetary income (such as own-production).74 Retirement stipends from the National Institute for Social

   Though state-level data disaggregated by rural/urban is not available, for reference at the national level, 20.5% average monthly family income comes
from transfers, 53.6% from work, and 18.7% from non-monetary income.



                                                                                                                                                   126
Security (INSS) provides 17% of total monthly family income, on average, in Paraiba, but for families
with between R$830 and R$1,245 monthly income, the INSS retirement pension reaches 31.4% of total
income, an average of R$321 per month. The INSS pension is equivalent to one minimum salary
(R$510) for one person; people in rural areas are eligible for retirement stipends at age 60 for men and
55 for women, as long as their income is less than ¼ minimum salary. 75 There are 32,975 beneficiaries
of BPC Old Age and 62,658 beneficiaries of BPC Disabled Persons in Paraiba.

28.   Bolsa Familia and other federal level transfers are significant, but make up just 2% of total
monthly family income in Paraiba (Table A2-6).

29.     Considering that there are 111,442 family agriculture units in Paraiba, less than a third are
registered in the Single Cadaster organized by the Ministry of Social Development. The Single Cadaster
(Cadastro Único) is used to identify and register families living in poverty and extreme poverty.
Registration in the Cadaster is necessary for access to 19 federal transfer programs, including Bolsa
Familia and Bolsa Estiagem, but not Garantia Safra or federal retirement stipends.

30.    In May 2014, there were 508,956 families receiving Bolsa Familia with a total value over R$81
million. Families received on average R$159.22 per month. 87 percent of beneficiary families have
children between the ages of 6 and 15 years of age, reaching a coverage level of 94% of eligible families
with children in this age range. See Table A2-7 below.

     b) Agricultural Diversification

31.     As illustrated in Figure A2-9 below, the areas with the lowest value added of agriculture are in
the Borborema and Sertão Paraibano meso-regions, despite the fact that these are regions where
agricultural activity is the primary form of employment.

Figure A2 - 8: Value of Agricultural Production from temporary and permanent crops (2009)




32.    In the Semi-Arid of Paraiba, farmers concentrate on temporary crops like manioc, maize, and
beans (Figure A2-10).

  Families that have registered as "agricultores familiares" in the Cadastro Único. These are families whose livelihoods are linked to agricultural activities
that rely predominantly on family labor and who produce for self-consumption and sell surplus production.



                                                                                                                                                        128

33.     Permanent crops like banana, coconut, papaya, mango, and other fruit trees are focused along the
coast and Brejo micro-regions (Figure A2-11).

34.     An analysis of Agricultural Census micro-data is required in order to quantify the degree of
productive diversification on smallholder farms. Households typically rely on a couple of temporary
crops like beans, maize, and manioc, and complement this production with small-scale animal
production (mostly goats, sheep, and chickens) as well as forest products like native fruit and nut trees
(e.g. umbu and cashew). Temporary crops are more vulnerable to drought and irregular rainfall, which
can eliminate an entire harvest or make it impossible to plant. Native plants of the Caatinga and
Cerrado are more resistant to dry spells and support food security in these times. However, these trees
however are sometimes used for firewood in times of drought when there is little fuel available, thereby
eliminating a source of food and income in the longer term.


                                                                                                     129
35.     Though the traditional production system focuses on manioc, corn, and beans for subsistence and
sale of surplus, livestock is an important component in the rural economy, particularly goats. Goats are
known to be well adapted to the dry climate and provide meat and milk for producers. Agricultural
production accounted for 68% and livestock 32% of total value of agricultural activities in Paraiba
(2006). Livestock is proportionally more important in Paraiba compared to the rest of the Northeast,
where livestock contributes 22% of total agricultural value.

36.    Between 2010 and 2012, livestock production declined about 20% across municipalities of the
Semi-Arid, drastically hit by drought. Livestock suffer not only in the absence of water, but also in the
absence of forage material. Typically goats and sheep forage through pasture for food, but in times of
drought this vegetation dies and smallholders do not have the resources to purchase food for the animals.
Most farmers in dry areas rely on collective pasture (called fundos de pasto for goat/sheep livestock,
more common in drier areas, and fecho de pasto for cattle) for animal forage. These communal
pasturelands often rely on collective action to avoid environmental degradation.

37.     Households can also diversify agricultural production and incorporate adaptive or drought-
resistant crops. A new breed of drought- and pest-resistant cactus (palma) recently developed by
agricultural research agencies is being disseminated. Storage facilities for animal forage help provide
feed for animals during drought months when vegetation is limited.

38.    Other adaptive and good agricultural practices can bring significant reductions in sensitivity to
drought. Soil conservation and the integration of organic matter are important to retain soil moisture.

   c) Water Access

39.     Despite severe droughts, Paraiba is not devoid of water resources and actually has a number of
rivers and lakes. The federal government through the program Water for All (Água para Todos) in
partnership with state and municipal government build water storage infrastructure like cisterns, wells,
and small dams – principally for home consumption, but also on a smaller scale for crop irrigation and
animal drinking water.

40.    Still, water and sanitation are significant hurdles for rural families especially during drought
(Figure A2-12).




                                                                                                     130
Figure A2 - 11: Percent of People in Households with Inadequate Access to Water and Sanitation79




        d) Dependency

41.    Finally, the last important aspect of sensitivity is the number of dependents per household.
Paraiba, like much of the rural Northeast, has experienced rural out-migration over the last decades
whereby the economically active population leaves rural areas. The dependency ratio (ratio of
population less than 15 and more than 65 to the population between 15-65 years of age) is very high
throughout Paraiba, especially in some of the poorer meso-regions like the Borborema and Northern
Agreste. This means that it is common that over 58% of the population in these regions is either under
age 15 or over age 65 (Figures A2-13 and A2-14, respectively).

Figure A2 - 13: Number of People over 65




D. Adaptive Capacity:

42.    Households’ access to ex-post coping strategies is closely linked to poverty, social
marginalization, and access to public policies. Ex-post coping strategies are diverse. Migration and off-
farm work has long been a coping strategy in the Northeast to compensate for loss of
production/livestock due to drought; communities and social networks often emerge to help one another
in times of need; and state and federal governments have a variety of emergency measures to help
families maintain welfare levels during drought like cash, animal feed, and seed transfers.80

43.        Measurements of adaptive capacity in Paraiba should include the following components:

       Literacy/education level;
       Social inclusion;
       Land title for security of tenure, including pasture land, and to access PRONAF credit;
       Social capital (“horizontal” and “vertical” ties, including membership in producer organizations
        and patronage arrangements);
       Access to technical assistance and research/technology transfer;
       Access to markets;
       Access to emergency coping services (distribution of food, seed, and fertilizer).

44.    The exposed above are forms of capital that facilitate recovery after a shock. Interventions to
increase adaptive capacity can consider investing in these categories. The concept of intersectionality

80
  Small farmers in the Northeast do not have access to true risk transfer mechanisms, which could also be considered as a strategy for adaptive capacity.
Garantia Safra is not a “true” insurance but rather a fund. Premiums are not calculated by an actuary to reflect risk; every participating farmer pays the same
premium and receives the same payout if the index is triggered.



                                                                                                                                                           132
applies in this context, meaning that overlapping disadvantages (e.g. someone with more than one
historically marginalized identity like gender and ethnicity) typically present greater social exclusion;
i.e., someone with various disadvantages tend to be more socially excluded, than someone with just one
disadvantage.

45.    Conversely, many of these categories reinforce one another. Social capital can support access to
markets and technical assistance; extension agents are more likely to work with organized groups of
producers, and group organization can facilitate access to markets.

        a) Land Tenure

46.    Secure land tenure is an important asset that enables access to coping strategies. Title is required
to access PRONAF credit, among other forms of credit, in addition to conveying security of ownership.
Property ownership is also important to retain possession of land in times of hardship; people renting
land may lose access to land when they cannot produce the resources to pay for rental, either cash or
through sharing a portion of agricultural production with the owner (sharecropping). In the Semi-Arid,
69.6% of family farming plots have legal title. For the roughly 76,000 households engaged in livestock
and ranching in Paraiba, about 75% own the land on which the animals are raised.

47.     Secure tenure is particularly important for pasture for animals (Table A2-8). The three meso-
regions with the most livestock producers are the Agreste Paraibano (38% of all producers), Sertão
Paraibano (35%), and Borborema (21%). In each of these, ownership is most common, but occupants
are the second most frequent category of producers, respectively 14%, 8%, and 12% in Agreste, Sertão,
and Borborema.

48.     In times of drought, a critical coping strategy is moving the herd to pasturelands that have
retained vegetation (Figure A2-15). Whether or not a rancher has access to pasture reserves is an
important factor of adaptive capacity. Collective action to preserve communal pasture land is important,
but rarely are these lands titled and ranchers must be able to defend outsiders from using their land,
which is not always possible especially in times of drought when competition for resources is high.
Other ranchers, miners, and land-grabbers also threaten ownership of common lands.

Figure A2 - 14: Schematic Cycle of Land Tenure and Vulnerability for Semi-Arid Ranchers82




49.     It is more common to raise goats on common pasturelands because they require less investment
in fodder than bovines and are lower-value than cows. Fabiano and Holanda (2008) conclude that
ranchers who use common pasturelands are less vulnerable to droughts because goats are better adapted
to very dry conditions and require fewer resources to maintain.

50.       Land occupation, without title, is even higher for temporary crops in Paraiba (Table A2-9).

51.    About one third of total agricultural establishments with temporary crops are located in the
Sertão Paraibano and 40% in the Agreste Paraibano, where roughly half of all properties with
temporary crops have title. Land ownership with title for permanent crops, typically of higher value, is
much higher (80%).

52.    The Land Fund (Crédito Fundiário) is run by INTERPA, the Paraiba Institute for Land and
Agricultural Planning, regularizing land tenure by granting title to the land of occupants or facilitating
land purchase by offering subsidized loans to land-poor farmers. INCRA is more active in redistributing
land and creating agrarian reform colonies.

   b) Literacy and Education Levels

53.    Literacy and education levels play an important role in adaptive capacity because they mediate
the kinds of non-farm employment a person can access. Literacy and education also serve as a proxy for
a person’s general capacity to connect to a wide range of coping strategies to drought.

Amongst households with all members at least 10 years of age, the average number of years of study is
5.8 years. Illiteracy rates in population of 15 years and older is 18.59% (2012).

54.     Women with low levels of education that are heads of households with small children are
surprisingly common in Paraiba (Figure A2-16), surpassing 28.11% of all households in some of the
poorest municipalities of the state. The heavy demands on the single parent’s time of children make it
more difficult to seek alternative employment and adaptive strategies. It is not possible from this data to
say, though, if these families are receiving remittances from a male partner who has migrated or if the
female household head is a single mother.




                                                                                                       135

Fundamental Education and have Children less than 15 years of age




     c) Social Inclusion

55.    Members of historically marginalized social groups like women, quilombolas, indigenous, and
agrarian reform settlers have particular barriers to accessing adaptive strategies.

56.    Quilombolas and indigenous peoples, historically marginalized via discrimination and physically
remote areas, face particular barriers to recover after a shock due to lower access to services and
distance to markets. Paraiba has 25,043 indigenous people, 19,525 of which live in indigenous reserves.

57.     Female heads of households are typically disadvantaged in terms of seeking adaptive strategies.
As Luiz Gonzaga famously sung, ´Paraíba masculina, mulher macho sem senhor´, Paraiba has a long
history of disproportionate male out-migration, leaving women behind to tend the farm and the family.
Female-headed households are high in Paraiba (Table A2-10).

   d) Social Capital




                                                                                                    137
59.     Social capital is an important factor for resilience to risks. Social capital can be both horizontal
(between people with the same relative power within a community) and vertical (patronage or clientele
relationships between differential powers).

60.      Social relationships between community members are important to analyze, as communities with
strong social ties may pool resources together in times of hardship.87 However, formal membership in
associations was described as weak in qualitative interviews in Paraiba. There is not a strong tradition of
association formation in the Northeast compared to other places regions in the country, such as the
South. Just 6.74% are of the interviewees were associated to a union.88 However, it was highlighted that
incentives to organize the society must exist, since it is unlikely to happen spontaneously; with limited
public technical assistance available and resources distributed without the need of social formally
arrangements (associations, cooperatives, etc.), incentives for formal organization are limited. Councils
for Sustainable Rural Development are comprised of producer associations and municipal government
representatives to discuss municipal development planning, but experts noted that participation can be
erratic since representatives do not receive financial compensation for transportation costs or time.

61.      The Northeast Region presents a long history of patronage arrangements and, many times,
facilitate access to public services including investments and emergency responses: “Patronage
continues to be the dominant tool for survival,” and extreme competition exists over access to scarce
state services.89 The indústria da seca (drought industry) is a popular phrase that characterizes the
business of drought mitigation and emergency efforts in exchange or political support. Several
interviewees mentioned the fact that Paraiba has a large number of municipalities, given its small size
(223 –Pernambuco, a larger State, has 185), as an indicator of political capture and fierce feudalism-type
arrangements.

       e) Access to Markets, Technical Assistance, and Public Services

62.     Drought is a covariate shock, rather than idiosyncratic, meaning that it affects entire
communities, municipalities, and territories. While with idiosyncratic shocks, such as the death of a
family member, affected households can often turn to their social networks and community
organizations for support coping, covariate shocks like drought in areas where there is limited economic
diversification affects the resource upon which everyone depends. Typical agricultura familiar in the
Semi-Arid involves a system of staple crops like manioc, corn, and beans, along with herds of goats and
sheep. While rural families consume some of their production, increasingly these crops are sold more
often than they are consumed in the household, as cash transfers and remittances from off-farm income
supplement household revenues.

63.    The lack of diversification between farmers reduces coping capacity of whole regions and
increases competition for limited resources, like water and pasture or forage material for animals.

Coping strategies are often very similar and the homogeneity makes for a less resilient system: when
farmers seek to sell their animals, as a last resort, many others are attempting to do the same. While
there may be cases of collective action to commercialize animals, more commonly, the bump in supply
of animal meat exceeds demand and presses down prices.

64.     Distance from markets and infrastructure for supply chains are also very limited. Agricultural
producers – especially for milk and meat – face challenges marketing their product in the absence of
cold storage facilities and distance to markets.

65.    A number of productive inclusion projects, including COOPERAR, exist at the municipal level90
that provide investments in small farmers or guaranteed markets, as in through Food Acquisition
Program from smallholders (PAA) for different crops and milk.

66.     A number of municipal, state, and federal level relief services exist to support rural populations
during drought (See Stocktaking of Projects and Programs related to Agricultural Risk Management in
Paraiba), including Cesta Básica (food distribution) to traditional populations,91 Water for All program
(investments in emergency water infrastructure), Garantia Safra (for municipalities that lose over 50%
of agricultural production due to drought). Access to these programs often requires farmers to register as
a family farmer, submitting a DAP (Declaration of Aptitude for PRONAF) at a local EMATER office.
In 2006, 11,340 establishments received occasional technical assistance, 29% of which could not read or
write; 3,985 received regular technical assistance, 24.8% of which could not read or write; and the
remaining 151,961 establishments did not receive technical assistance. The majority received assistance
from the government, followed by private technical assistance (4,394), and trailed by cooperatives (412)
and other organizations.

67.     Technology transfer is sporadic and limited in Paraiba, and agricultural research faces a
bottleneck at the stage of application to the producer since EMATER is essentially the only institution
offering technical assistance and has about 500 agents for the entire state.

E. Exposure:

68.      Exposure is discussed in the climate section of this report in greater detail, but the main message
is that the Semi-Arid is not homogenous in climate. Aridity indices are often used to measure this aspect
of vulnerability.

F. Scales of Vulnerability Analysis

69.    In this section, the focus was on vulnerability of the household. However, vulnerability can be
measured at different scales of analysis: the individual, household, community, municipality, region, and
so on.

70.     Commonly, it is assumed that households share resources equally and ownership is collective
within the household. In reality, ownership of many household assets is not shared and it is rare to find
decision-making jointly distributed between heads of households.92 In a region with a history of male
out-migration, women-headed households are fairly common and respondents noted that gender roles
allow women to participate actively in agricultural production and important risk-management activities
like water use.

ANNEX 4: OUTLINE OF WEATHER RISK MANAGEMENT RELATED PROGRAMS AND
PROJECTS

As a result of recurrent droughts, many initiatives of risk management were created, mainly by the
Federal Government and institutions but also by State institutions. The most important ones are listed
below.

The MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, LIVESTOCK AND SUPPLY (MAPA) is responsible for the
Agricultural Climate Risk Zoning (ZARC), which aims to minimize the risk related to weather
phenomena, and allows identify the best moments for planting in selected municipalities considering
different types of soil and crop cycles. Based on these parameters it is estimated that 2 out of 10 years
face considerable losses when the planting is done on the recommended period. The ZARC started in
1996 for the wheat crop and nowadays it includes 40 crops, 16 of annual cycle and 24 permanent crops,
covering 24 states (BRACALE, 2012).

The FEDERAL GOVERNMENT created by law nº 5,969, from December 11th 1973, the Agriculture
and livestock Activity Guarantee Program (PROAGRO) (Table 1). Basically the covered risks are
adverse weather phenomena, plagues and diseases afflicting crops and livestock. The PROAGRO is a
public insurance operated by the financial institutions. Its management is under the responsibility of the
Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), which articulates permanently the Ministries of Finance (MF),
Planning, Budget and Management (MPOG), Agriculture, Livestock and Supply (MAPA) and
Agricultural Development (MDA). The revenue of the PROAGRO is constituted in its majority by the
Federal Government funding. On the other hand, payment of coverage (indemnity) constitutes the
biggest portion of the expenses. The claim adjustment to confirm the losses are done by technical
assistance institutions. The farms eligible for PROAGRO are the ones which are associated with
agricultural costing, funded or not, and the they should necessarily follow the ZARC recommendations,
except the properties which are associated to the National Program for Family Farming Strengthening
(PRONAF) and the ones located in states not covered by the ZARC. The maximum liability per agent of
the PROAGRO is US$ 130,434 (Resolution nº 4,111/12). The insurable risks are: a) Excessive rainfall,
frost, hail, drought, excessive temperature oscillations, strong winds, cold winds, and disease and
plagues without methods of control; b) on livestock costing credit operations: losses incurred by diseases
without methods of prophylaxis. The compensation of the program may range from 70% to 100% of the
coverage limit. In case where there is irrigation in the farm the compensation will be 100% of the
coverage. The PROAGRO premium rates are: i) 1% for irrigated farms; ii) 2% for the farms associated
to PRONAF, except irrigated farms; iii) 3% for the others; and, iv) 5% for the non-funded farms
(OZAKI, 2013);

The FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, through the resolution nº 3,234/04, created the Agriculture and
livestock Activity Guarantee Program for the Family Farmers (PROAGRO MAIS). The difference
between PROAGRO, also known as TRADITIONAL PROAGRO, and the PROAGRO MAIS, is the
target public. The PROAGRO MAIS focuses only on the Family Farmers and the TRADITIONAL
PROAGRO aim the remaining farmers. The PROAGRO MAIS is regulated according to the Traditional
PROAGRO, including the ZARC rules. The most important rules regarding the program are: i) The
coverage is equal to 100%; ii) Obligation of associating to the program when obtaining agricultural
costing credit from PRONAF; iii) It is possible to insure up to 65% of the expected net revenue; iv) The

                                                                                                      154
trigger for receiving the compensation is the gross revenue, that is, if the gross revenue obtained is less
than 70% of the expected gross revenue then the farmer is compensated; v) Covered risks: excessive
rainfall, frost, hail, drought, excessive temperature oscillations, strong winds, cold winds, and disease
and plagues without methods of control; vi) The premium rate is 2%. In case where the farm is irrigated
and located in the semiarid region, the rate is 1%.

Table 1. Operational results of PROAGRO TRADICIONAL (PT) and PROAGRO MAIS
(PM).

From the crop year 1998/99 to the crop year 2009/10, the total number of contracts of PT
and PM presented relative growth until the crop year 2006/07, when it started to decrease
because of the relative increase of the private crop insurance (Figure 1).

Another important variable in the program is the liability that shows how much is being
insured each year. In both programs, the liability increased until the crop year 2008/09,
when it started to decrease.

Considering only the PT, until the crop year 2004/05 the liability was, on average, equal to
US$ 339 million. From 2005/06 to 2011/12, the average number increased to US$ 1 billion.
After the creation of PM, the liability of both programs increased to US$ 1.8 billion, on
average. (figure 2).




                                                                                                       155

The Figures 3 and 4 show, respectively, the quantity of claims and the total indemnity for
the PT and PM, in the period from 1998/99 to 2011/12. Four considerable peaks can be
noticed: 2004/05, 2005/06, 2008/09 and 2011/12, with respectively (in thousands) 282.3,
184.4, 101.8 and 123.4. In these four years, the PM was responsible for respectively, 96%,
82%, 83% and 90% of the total claims.

Regarding the total indemnity, the crop year 2011/12 presented the highest value, summing
a total close to US$ 434 million (figure 8). The crop years 2004/05, 2008/09 and 2005/06
also presented high values. The total indemnity paid in the period accounted for a little over
US$ 1.6 billion.

From the crop year 2004/05 to 2011/12, considering the average number of contracts, the
most important crops were corn (43.6%), soybean (18%) and coffee (8.7%). Regarding the
territorial concentration, the south region of Brazil presented considerable importance. In
average values, the region was responsible for 67.5% of the contracts, followed by the
northeast region (13.6%) and southeast (14.9%). In the south region, the state of Rio Grande
do Sul (36%) is the most important, followed by Paraná (19%) and Santa Catarina (12%).


                                                                                               157
Accounting for the average indemnity in the analyzed period, the corn crops represented
almost 48.2%, and average value equal to US$ 100 million, followed by the soybean
(29.1%) and wheat (15.7%). Besides the short average participation on the total number of
contracts, the wheat crops have relatively high importance on the average indemnity. The
south region accounted for almost 91.9 % of the total indemnity. The state of Rio Grande do
Sul was responsible for about 48.2%, Paraná, 33.6% and Santa Catarina, 10.1%. The
northeast region accounted for 5% of the total indemnity. In the region, Bahia (2%), Sergipe
(1%) and Ceará (1%) were the most important states. Among the risk covered, in the period
analyzed, drought accounted for over 86% of the total indemnity


The MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, LIVESTOCK AND SUPPLY (MAPA) is responsible to
operate the Rural Insurance Premium Subsidy Program (PSR) created by the law 10,823/03 (Almeida,
2007; Ramos, 2009). In general, the program consists of establishing percentages of subventions for
each modality of insurance and crops. This percentage corresponds to the liability taken by the
government. For instance, if the total premium is equal to US$ 10 thousand and the percentage of
subsidy is 50%, the farmer is responsible for US$ 5 thousand and the Federal government the remaining
premium. The limit for the subvention in the agricultural modality, per farmer and year, is US$ 41.740.
The farmer will be able to receive subsidy for more than one crop, since the total does exceed the
maximum value. For the modalities of livestock, forests and aquaculture insurance, the limit is US$
13.900 per modality (Resolution nº 26/12).

Table 2. Operational results of PSR.

Since the beginning of the PSR, in 2005, until the year of 2009, there was a relative growth.
In 2005, the total area insured by PSR was close to 68 thousand hectares and reached the
maximum area in 2009, covering almost 6.7 million hectares. From 2009, the total area
decreased and stabilized in 2012, covering approximately 5.2 million hectares (figure 5).

The causes for the reduction of the growth rate in PSR are related to the budget constraints
and operational difficulties. Up to 2008, the resources available for the PSR were sufficient
to the insurance companies to operate the subsidy program. In that year, out of US$ 70
million available, US$ 69 million were effectively spent. However, this scenario changed in
2009, when the demand exceeded the total budget available in US$ 39 million. That is, the
government owed money to the insurers.

In December 2009, the government approved a bill for extra resources to cover the dept.
However, according to the PSR regulation, the subvention resources must be used in the
same year of its availability. Since there was no use for the same year, the insurance
companies did not receive the resources.

At that time, the government signaled that part of the budget for 2010, in total US$ 104
million, would be used as payment for the US$ 39 million debt from 2009. This situation
stressed the market. Besides not having increased the amount of resources to the PSR, the
budget decreased in US$ 39 million. However, in May 2010, the government approved the
law 12,241 giving additional credit of US$ 39 million for that year’s budget. Despite of this
fact, the problem reoccurred in the second semester of 2010, and all the following years.

Nowadays, the insurance companies authorized to operate in the PSR are: Allianz Seguros
S.A., Essor Seguros S.A., Fairfax Brasil Seguros Corporativos S/A, Grupo BBMapfre
(Companhia de Seguros Aliança do Brasil e Mapfre Seguros), Nobre Seguradora do Brasil
S.A., Porto Seguro Companhia de Seguros Gerais, Sancor Seguros do Brasil S.A. and Swiss
Re Corporate Solutions Brasil Seguros S.A (MAPA, 2013).

The reinsurance companies operating rural insurance are: Austral Re, Catlin Brasil Serviços
Técnicos Ltda, Everest RE Group Ltda, Hannover Re Escritório de Representação no Brasil
Ltda, Instituto de Resseguros do Brasil – IRB, Lloyd`s Escritório de Representação no
Brasil Ltda, Mapfre Re Assessoria, Münchener do Brasil Serviços Técnicos Ltda, PartnerRe
Escritório de Representação no Brasil Ltda, Scor Brazil Ltda, Swiss Re Brasil Serviços e
Participações S/C Ltda and XL Re Holding.

According to data from the Superintendency of Private Insurance (Superintendência de
Seguros Privados – SUSEP), in the crop year 2012/13, the Insurance company Aliança do
Brasil accounted for 58.4% of the total premium of the sector, followed by Mapfre Seguros
Gerais, accounting for 10.2%, Nobre Seguradora do Brasil, 7.5%, and Allianz Seguros,
6.4%. The five companies together accounted for 83% of the market. The participation of
the first two mentioned accounted for approximately 70%.

In 2012, the grains insured, such as soybean, wheat, corn, rice and others, represented
almost 91% of the total insured area, almost 75% of the subvention paid, 73% of the total
premium collected and 73% of the global liability. The soybean was responsible for 40% of
the total liability and of the total premium collected, 57% of the total insured area and 37%
of the subvention paid.

Regarding the regional concentration, in 2012, the south region demanded the highest
quantity of resources of the PSR, accounting for approximately 61% of the total. The states
of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul were demanded over 50%. The Central West and
Southeast regions accounted for 18% each. Considering the total liability, collected
premium and insured area, the results are similar. There is relative concentration in the
states of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul (Figure 6).

The MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT (MDA) is responsible for the Garantia
Safra (GS) since 2002. It aims to guarantee minimum conditions of survival of the rural family farmers
of municipalities located in the area which the Superintendence of Northeast development (SUDENE)
works on and are also affected systematically to losses due to drought or excess rainfall (Law nº
10,420/02 and 4,962/04). The family farmers may receive a benefit on the occurrence of drought or
excess rainfall which causes at least 50% of loss on productions of beans, corn, rice, cassava or cotton
crops.

The MINISTRY OF NATIONAL INTEGRATION (MI), MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURAL
DEVELOPMENT (MDA) AND MINISTRY OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT (MDS), manage the
program “Drought Benefit” (BE) created by the Law nº 10,954 from September 29th 2004. The program
supports agricultural families , which receive a limit of an average of two minimum wages monthly as
income and are located in municipalities that are considered to have suffered a disaster or emergency
situation recognized by federal government. The criteria for being eligible are: i) Being a Family farmer
with a declaration of aptitude to PRONAF (DAP); ii) Being registered to the “Single Registration for

Social Programs of the federal government”; iii) Not being associated to the GS program. The associated
worker receives US$ 76,00 per family.

The BRAZILIAN COMPANY FOR AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK RESEARCH
(EMBRAPA) developed an agrometeorological monitoring system (AGRITEMPO), which allows
access of meteorological and agrometeorological information for all the Brazilian territory, on an
aggregated level. Since 2002, the products available are drought maps, water available in soil, rainfall,
agricultural drought areas, necessity of reposition by rainfall and accumulated rainfall. The
AGRITEMPO also allows the consultation of information from the weather stations, although there are
limitations for data access.

THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR SPACE RESEARCH (INPE/CPTEC) supplies products on
weather monitoring information, such as, drought, frost, soil moisture and weather forecasts for all the
Brazilian territory with applicability to agriculture and livestock. Among the available products are the
maps of: i) soil water availability; ii) irrigation necessity; iii) soil management conditions; iv)
phytosanitary treatment conditions. The CPTEC also allows the consultation of information of weather
stations, although there are limitations for data access.

The WORLD BANK, MINISTRY OF NATIONAL INTEGRATION (MI), THE NATIONAL
WATER AGENCY (ANA) AND STATE INSTITUTIONS are conducting the technical assistance
named “Preparation for drought and resilience to weather changes”, because of the long lasting droughts
in 2012 and 2013. The main objective is to define specific instruments for drought management, in a
proactive manner, and it is based on the concept of risk for all the northeastern region. The drought
monitor is based on two indexes named SPI (standardized precipitation index) and SPEI (standardized
precipitation evapotranspiration index).

ANNEX 6: BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON PESTS AND DISEASES IN PARAIBA

Sugar cane. Despite several pests are associated with the sugarcane cultivation, according to the historic
records the broca do colmo (Diatraea saccharalis), broca gigante (Telchin licus) and cigarrinha
(Mahanarva fimbriolata) are considered the key pests, due to the frequency and intensity of its attack
and the potential or actual damage to the crop. Possible damages caused by the broca do colmo are
reduced yield, death of gems, cane lodging by wind (if the galleries are transverse), dying of tips -
known as dead heart - aerial roots and lateral shoots. The damages of the broca gigante produce vertical
galleries inside the stem, causing the complete destruction of the stem, reduction in germination, and
also open the doors for fungi that cause rots. Damages caused by the attack of the cigarrinha are
extraction of large quantities of water and nutrients from the roots by nymphs, reducing sugar content in
the stalks, increasing fiber content, increasing the number of dead stems (which reduces the milling
yield), and increasing content of contaminants, making it more difficult to recovery sugars and inhibiting
the fermentation.

Although the attack of these pests is frequent, the impact is relatively low, because the farmers suitably
manage them. Control can be made via cultural practices, suppression of alternative hosts, and
biological or chemical control.

On the farms owned by the sugar cane processors there is an intensive use of biological control, which
includes parasitic wasps and fungi that parasitizes the insect pests. The biological agents, both wasps
and fungi, are produced by the processors on their own laboratories, and sprayed or released on their
farms. Only occasionally there is a need to supplement the biological control with pesticide applications.

The ASPLAN (Autonomous Sugarcane Producers Association of Paraiba) also maintains a commercial
production of biological control agents. Prior to the present and lasting drought season, the laboratories
located at the Camaratuba Experimental Station produced an annual amount of 30 tons of Metarhizium
anisopliae (fungi), which is enough for the biological control of cigarrinha in approximately 8,000
hectares. Regarding Cotesia flavipes (wasps), 138.000 insects used to be produced each year, which
corresponds to a coverage of 27,531 hectares (Personal Information, Engo. Agr o. Vamberto
Freitas110). The estimated sugarcane area in Paraíba for the 2013-2014 season is in excess of 122,000
ha (CONAB, 2014), from which roughly 35% will be conducted by autonomous growers (Personal
information, ASPLAN). In this case, biological control coverage on the autonomous cane growers
would be around 20-60%, depending on the pest to be controlled.

A potential threat to sugarcane production is the quarantine disease Ferrugem Laranja, caused by the
fungus Puccinia kuehinii, which is present in sugarcane plantations in São Paulo, but absent from

Paraiba up to the moment. It is very difficult to anticipate when and if the disease will be introduced in
Paraiba, and once introduced if the fungus will adapt to the environmental conditions and effectively
become a serious threat. There is no assessment of its impact to local plantations and the probabilities of
entering the state and successfully establish on the cane plantations. In other countries where it is present
- like in Australia - the impact is rated as high. Nevertheless, considering its potential damaging impact
for Paraiba, this disease risk should be assessed as of high impact.

Fruticulture. Pineapple, coconut and bananas are the most largely produced and traded fruits in Paraíba.
Several species of citrus, besides manga, mangaba and grapes are also cultivated.

Banana plantations are subject to the attack of sigatoka amarela (caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella
musicola). The pest is conveniently managed by adequate cultural practices, resistant varieties and the
application of fungicides. The key pest present on coconut in Paraiba is the broca do olho do coqueiro
(Rhynchophorus palmarum). The pest is conveniently controlled by trapping or using biological control.
Citrus, mango and mangaba are frequently attacked by the fruit fly mosca negra dos citrus
(Rhynchophorus palmarum). Insect trapping or insecticide applications are used to control this pest.

The pineapple disease fusariose is caused by the fungus Fusarium subglutinans f.sp. ananas and is very
frequent on pineapple plantations. Control of the pest can be made by means of cultural practices (clean
seedlings, eradication of contaminated plants), use of resistant varieties or spraying of recommended
fungicides.

Potential serious threats to the fruticulture in Paraíba are the diseases sigatoka negra (Mycosphaerella
fijiensis) and moko (Ralstonia (Pseudomonas) solanacearum (Race 2), which attacks bananas, and the
cancro bacteriano (Xanthomonas campestris pv. viticola), a pest of grapes. Both are quarantine pests for
Paraiba and present on other Brazilian states. They may be extremely damaging if introduced in the fruit
regions of Paraiba, but there is no definitive assessment of its potential impact up to the moment.

Family Agriculture in Semiarid Zone. The natural vocation of this region is the livestock production,
mainly sheep and goats, being agriculture a side activity, normally for self-consumption. The crops
grown in the semiarid zone are cassava, beans and maize, normally cultivated under low technology
production systems, with minimum or none use of inputs like fertilizers or pesticides, being the seeds or
manivas (cassava) supplied by the goverment. As the climatic risk is very high, growers do not take into
account the phytosanitary risks, this way pests are usually not controlled, exception made for a small
group of family growers more closely supported by technical assistance.

In order to feed the herd (and also as a water supplier), smallholders cultivate a cactus called palma
forrageira. A pest called cochonilha do carmim (Dactylopius coccus) is a serious threat for the yield and
even the production of palma. The State Government Research Institution (EMEPA) developed four
varieties resistant to the cochonilha and the public technical assistance (EMATER-PB) is freely
distributing this genetic material to the family farmers, to substitute their traditional susceptible
varieties, leading to an almost complete control of the pest. Although important, the program must be
enhanced to benefit the majority of the smallholders of the semiarid.

                                                                                                         166
 Livestock Production Chains. The state of Paraiba is free of the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) with
vaccination, certified by the World Animal Health Organization (OIE) in May 2014. During the last ten
years, there was no record of FMD cases in the state. Currently this risk has even diminished because the
bordering states are also free of FMD with vaccination and because there is a strict national program to
control movement of animals and animal products in the country. Paraiba is also a territory considered
free of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) and the risk is low as the state is not on the major
routes of migratory birds, which are the main vectors that spread the disease. There is no specific risk
classification for the Bovine Spongiform Encefalopatitis (BSE) for Paraiba, but Brazil has been included
on the “Negligible” status, the safest of all, therefore the state can be classified in the same risk status.

Paraiba is also apparently free of Classical Swine Fever (CSF) as the last outbreak in the state was
recorded in 2006. Similar situation is verified regarding Newcastle Disease Virus (NCDV) as no recent
outbreaks were detected, but no epidemiological studies were conducted to confirm this status.

The Bovine, Goat and Sheep Brucellosis and Bovine Tuberculosis are endemic zoonosis. A SEDAP
study of 2013 demonstrated that the prevalence of bovine brucellosis ranged between 2% to 4% in
Paraiba, and in an evaluation of the Federal Program carried out in 2010 it was observed that there was a
decrease in the number of cases of brucellosis in the Northeastern Region from 4,138 to 2,082 (50.3%)
between 2001 and 2010. Salomon and collaborators carried out a study on bovine tuberculosis in 2010,
which found that: of the herds investigated, 62 (0.57%) had at least one positive animal, and of the
animals examined, 136 (0.25%) were positive. Prevalence of tuberculosis in goats it was found to be
10.7% of positive in 10.7% of herds. Regarding the presence of Brucella mellitensis in goats and sheeps,
there is no evidence of its presence in Brazil.

There are no official records of serious recent foodborne outbreaks in the state of Paraiba; however, it
was found that small producers do not have enough official assistance to control and inspect their
facilities for processing food derived from animals. This situation can lead to risks of contaminated
products and presentation of foodborne outbreaks. On the other hand, the lack of official control and
inspection system for small producers limit their marketing possibilities, including the selling of the
production for the federal food acquisition programs (PNAE and PAA) that requires the products to be
officially controlled and inspected.
