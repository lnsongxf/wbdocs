Participatory Budgeting (PB) is being tested in five counties as a way to achieve more
inclusive and effective citizen engagement processes while complying with national legal
provisions. The Kenya Participatory Budgeting Initiative (KBPI) is implemented under the
Kenya Accountable Devolution Program (KADP) and is jointly led by the Social, Urban, Rural
and Resilience Global Practice and the Governance Global Practice of the World Bank.

KPBI partners with key government institutions namely, the Council of Governors, the Ministry
of Devolution and Planning, the Kenya School of Government, Commission on Revenue
Allocation and the participating counties: Makueni, West Pokot, Baringo, Kwale and Elgeyo
Marakwet. The photos capture the key highlights of participatory budgeting in the counties
from October 2015 to March 2017.

KADP is funded from the governments of Denmark, Finland, Sweden, United Kingom, the
United States (USAID) as well as the European Union.

39	        The County Executive Committee member for Finance and Economic Planning, Joshua Ngolekong, at the start of the PB forums. His department is responsible for running the budget forums.
40 - 42	   A glimpse of the vast terrain in the county that the officials have to cross to access citizens at the sub-location level, where for the first time PB meetings were held. A total of 164 meetings were
           organized in 2016 up from only 28 (ward level) meetings in 2015.
43	        The ward administrator Tapach ward, explains to community residents in Kokpwosis sub-location the public participation process and how the priorities will be arrived at. Through the PB process
           the county adopted a system of selecting 3 main citizen project priorities.
44	        A county official records the details of community members present at the Kokpwosis sub-location public budget meeting in a register.
45 – 47	   Citizens present their views during the Kokpwosis sub-location public budget meeting.

51 - 53	   Community members broke into their respective sub-locations to deliberate and come up with their three main priorities.
54	        Community members take a welcome refreshment at the close of the Serewo public budget meeting. Holding the meetings close to the community residences, means the county does not have
           to pay a transport allowance to citizens. It does however provide them with refreshments.
55	        The MCA Chepararia ward addresses participants at the Chepararia Ward Budget meeting. The meeting had a large number of women present given the proximity of the venue to their homes.
56 - 58	   During the meetings, women sat separately from the men, but during the selection of priorities, there was deliberate engagement of women by the ward administrators particularly sub-
           locations that were closer to urban centers such as Korellach in Chepararia Ward. Women’s priorities included construction of maternity wings in local dispensaries, construction of Early Childhood
           Development (ECD) centers and boreholes to address water issues.
59	        It was a fete to celebrate when a woman was selected to represent Kokpwosis sub-location in the final ward prioritization meeting which are held at the sub-county level. She was the only female
           representative from the sub-locations to attend the meeting.
60 - 63	   The county introduced voting as a method for deciding on the top three priorities out of the long list of projects that citizens propose. In Simotwo citizens voted by raising their hands and then
           stood aside to facilitate the counting of votes.
62	        There was a lot of excitement in Chepararia when citizens had to vote to select their representative to the ward prioritization meeting.
63	        Voting carried the day in Serewo sub-location when community members could not reach a consensus on priority projects.
64	        Children play outside their school in Serewo as their parents deliberate on projects affecting their lives. Water and good roads were a priority in this very remote location.
65	        The final ward prioritization process was characterized by intensive discussion, negotiation and consensus to arrive at decisions. The meetings were held at sub-county level and each representative
           from the sub-location congregated in their respective wards to arrive at final ward priority list.
66	        Devolving budget meetings to sub-location levels led to the opening up of roads to once inaccessible places. This grader was captured breaking down a rocky, hilly terrain to pave way for a road.
67	        Residents in the remote Suam ward were amongst the beneficiaries of PB meetings held within their locality.

79	        Two young girls stand outside the cattle shed as the community prepares to take their cattle to the dip.
80	        The young men lead the cattle to the dip, which was built by the county after it was proposed by community members as a project through the public participation process.
81 - 83	   Cattle go through the dip, which has proved useful to the community, but still faces a shortage of water to adequately cater for regular use.
84	        Water is the lifeline of the community. The pastoralist community largely rely on the livestock for their livelihood. The livestock struggle to drink the water in the shallow water reservoir.
85	        This goat tries a different angle but is still unable to access the water due to its low levels.
86	        The main source of water for the community is this shallow manually operated borehole. Following the introduction of PB consultative meetings at sub-location level, community members
           identified the upgrading of the borehole to a solar powered one.
87 - 88	   The community representative to the PB ward level meeting, demonstrates how the women struggle to fetch water from the borehole.
89	        These women wait in anticipation for the meeting to commence, hopeful that their concerns would be effectively captured during the meeting.
90	        The ward administrator officially opens the meeting and presents its agenda and outline. This meeting would be different from previous public participation meetings as citizens would be required
           to vote and select top priorities.
91	        The ward MCA Mr. Thomas Minito, gives opening remarks and impresses upon the community the importance of their participation in the PB prioritization process.
92	        Head of Budget, Mr. Jacob Kendaghor, presents the budget ceilings to the community and guides them in selecting priorities as per the KShs. 25 million ceiling.
93	        Community representatives break out into their respective sub-locations to deliberate on their final priorities.
94	        Representatives from Churo-Amaya shelter from the hot sun behind this vehicle to deliberate on the key concerns affecting their community. They maintain that water remains a priority and select
           the upgrading of the borehole into a solar powered borehole and construction of pipes from the borehole to feed water to the cattle dip and water reservoir.
95	        Community members also select ward flagship project during the meeting. Here these women strategize to vote together with their youth for a local youth polytechnic to minimize cases of drug
           abuse and unemployment.
96	        A section of the youth vote for the polytechnic and simultaneously celebrate as the show of hands within the entire community forum indicate a clear win for them.
97	        The CEC for Lands, Housing and Urban Development gives the floor to two youth representatives to present the issues affecting them before the community members.
98	        Community members applaud priorities selected by the sub-location representatives and the ward flagship projects.
99	        This young boy runs off to fetch water after the meeting. If the Assembly approves the ward level priorities as selected by the community, life for him and other children will improve due to closer
           access to water points.
