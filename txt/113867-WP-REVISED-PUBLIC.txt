Management Response
Management of the World Bank Group institutions would like to thank the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) for its extensive and informative evaluation of
support for higher education development. The report provides a comprehensive and
balanced account of World Bank Group activities in support of the development of
higher education in client countries, reinforcing the importance of its involvement in the
sector and providing useful insights and guidance for the future. It finds that the World
Bank Group’s interventions in higher education support its twin goals and contribute to
social and economic development in client countries. Considering the significant
growth of tertiary education globally, especially in low- and middle-income economies,
the report will help the World Bank Group to more effectively focus its support for
advanced human capital as part of its effort to meet its strategic goals.


World Bank Management Comments
Management appreciates the opportunity to comment on the IEG report’s
comprehensive review of the World Bank Group’s work on the higher education
subsector. Management concurs with many of IEG’s observations—in particular, that
developing innovative ways to measure the impact of interventions will allow more
effective support to client countries in this area, and that work in higher education can
be greatly improved by fostering more collaboration with related Global Practices and
relevant external players and donors. Management notes, however, that although the
report provides useful feedback to Management of the World Bank Group’s institutions
and staff working in the subsector, it does not sufficiently discuss the relationship
between higher education and the overall tertiary education sector—especially the
Technical and Vocational Education and Training subsector—and the linkages with the
other levels of the entire educational system. Management’s more detailed comments
follow.

STRATEGIC INTEGRATION
Management appreciates IEG’s observations about the need to more effectively align
higher education with the World Bank Group strategy. It is well known that a sound
tertiary education sector—and for that matter the higher education subsector—can have
a direct impact on a country’s competitiveness by preparing individuals with advanced
skills, for which higher economic return is expected. Nonetheless, more analytic work is
needed to demonstrate how higher education also contributes to reducing extreme
poverty and enabling shared prosperity—for example, in such areas as the following: (i)
the overall impact that higher education institutions have on the surrounding


xiv
                                                                     MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


communities from the economic activities they generate; (ii) noneconomic benefits in
the society resulting from having larger numbers of individuals with higher education
degrees (who are in general healthier, more environmentally conscious, and more
civically informed and active); and (iii) the existence of higher education institutions
that are more efficiently managed and more effectively aligned with the needs of the
community at large. The IEG report informs the ongoing evolution toward a more
integrated World Bank Group approach that includes such dimensions in the rationale
for interventions in higher education.

Management agrees with IEG that a further review of the contribution of the World
Bank’s work in higher education will help develop a more focused approach that takes
account of country needs. Further studies and strategic analysis would be useful to
assess the contribution of tertiary education to economic and social development, and,
for that matter, to World Bank Group’s twin goals. The report notes that, even though
projects should be generally aligned to the overall World Bank Group strategy, they
also need to respond to specific country-level needs. Analysis in this area will help
inform Management’s decisions about what interventions should be pursued.

Management appreciates IEG’s recognition of the value of the recently released SABER-
Tertiary Education tool, designed to assess different domains of a national tertiary
education system as they contribute to national priorities and to the World Bank Group
twin goals. As more countries adopt this tool in support of policy dialogue and project
preparation, the Education Global Practice will be able to accumulate additional
knowledge and further refine interventions to respond more directly to both country
needs and World Bank Group goals.

A number of ongoing regional and country specific studies are expected to contribute to
informed policy dialogue and operations design in higher education. To avoid over-
generalizations in defining what matters in higher education from a strategic point of
view, in recent years the World Bank Group has conducted several regional higher
education studies—for example, studies in financing of higher education in Europe and
Central Asia, teacher training in Latin America and the Caribbean, science collaboration
in Sub-Saharan Africa, and governance in the Middle East and North Africa. These
studies have informed policy dialogue and operations design at both the national and
regional levels. In addition, the World Development Report 2018: Learning to Realize
Education’s Promise will provide useful information about the higher education
subsector.

To be prepared to respond in a timely way to increased demands from client countries,
it is important to understand what capacity and knowledge the relevant World Bank
Group staff now have. With such an understanding, Management can plan for the


                                                                                      xv
MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


adequate availability of properly qualified staff. There is already in place a very active
community of practice—the Core Higher Education Group (COREHEG)—that brings
together more than 120 World Bank Group staff from across the globe who are involved
or interested in the tertiary education sector. COREHEG facilitates regular exchanges of
information on best practices and lessons learned in designing, implementing, and
evaluating interventions. Their efforts to collect and make available the acquired
knowledge can contribute to informing current staff as they work on new projects, and
can reduce the learning curve of new staff in the sector.

Management agrees with the report’s assessment on the importance of reflecting on the
role of other international players. A variety of international players have interest and
involvement in tertiary education: funding entities whose mandate and scope of work
are similar to the World Bank Group’s, development agencies working to build capacity
in a particular subsector or country, and other international players conducting
analytical work and/or advocating for particular causes directly or indirectly related to
tertiary education. Management believes that it is important to establish and maintain
good coordination with other international players when planning country-level
interventions. In countries where multiple donors and development agencies are
involved, the World Bank can assume a leading role in establishing channels of
communication and coordination to mitigate overlaps and maximize overall results. At
the Regional level, promising efforts in coordination with other key players are in place.
For instance, the Regional dialogue on tertiary education being conducted in Latin
America and the Caribbean, in collaboration with the Organization of American States,
Inter-American Development Bank, Corporación Andina de Fomento, and the
Iberoamerican Organization of States, has resulted in a set of actions that are being
implemented with the active involvement of client governments in the Region. At the
global level, Management is actively involved in the International Donor
Harmonisation Group, which brings together key development agencies working in
tertiary education. Also, collaborative work is in place with other global players such as
the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the International Association of
Universities. The World Bank Group can play a co-convening role with these global
players in more closely reviewing trends and fostering increased awareness of the
importance of higher education. Communication and collaboration ties with these and
other relevant organizations are crucial as the policy and political landscape of higher
education becomes more complex and sophisticated.

DATA ON RESULTS AND EVIDENCE
Management agrees that the evidence base for interventions in higher education should
be strengthened. Attribution of results requires a scope of analysis that usually exceeds



xvi
                                                                      MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


project life-cycles. For instance, a project may support higher education institutions in
modernizing their academic programs by introducing academic subjects and teaching
techniques aimed at improved employability at graduation. To see the results of such
interventions will take at least five years after project closing—the time it will take for
students who have benefited from the new academic program to graduate and enter the
labor market. Moreover, attributing hiring results to specific interventions is often a
challenge because many factors contribute to outcomes—for example, not just the
quality of the education received, but also the reputation of the institution from which
the job seeker graduated, the employment opportunities available in a particular
economic sector, the overall economic situation prevalent at graduation time, and so on.

The newly launched SABER-Tertiary Education is expected to serve as a good base of
analysis on what works in tertiary education. Its design took into consideration global
best practices in a range of areas: vision of the tertiary education system; regulatory
framework; governance; financing; educational quality; equitable access, retention, and
successful completion; and relevance of tertiary education. A total of 12 policy levers
have been developed and properly validated by an external panel of 17 global tertiary
education experts. Currently, SABER-Tertiary Education is being piloted in several
countries for full implementation in the upcoming fiscal year. As more countries
participate in the SABER-Tertiary Education, a stronger evidence base will be built.
World Bank Group-supported projects can draw on this consistent shared base in
designing analysis and interventions. Also, the resulting benchmarking will provide a
good basis for future impact evaluations on what interventions are effective and can be
replicated.

Management has taken steps to improve monitoring instruments and define new
indicators. Management agrees that further work should be done in developing
innovative ways to properly measure the effectiveness of the interventions that are
typically included in higher education projects. With support from COREHEG, a
working group of experienced tertiary education specialists, supported by external
experts, has been charged with proposing new and improved monitoring instruments
and indicators. The working group will discuss and present a set of new and revised
indicators, which will be piloted before their use is widely recommended.

LINKAGES WITH EMPLOYERS
Management agrees that the participation of employers and the integration of their
perspectives are important to ensure a link between tertiary education and increased
competitiveness. However, Management is also aware that each country’s regulatory
framework, historical context, and political environment are unique. When it is relevant
and feasible, World Bank Group-financed operations support public-private
partnerships in tertiary education, participation of employers in boards of governors of


                                                                                       xvii
MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


tertiary education institutions, development of co-op and other types of practical
training of students in industry, participation of employers in the design and oversight
of academic programs, and so on.

Leveling the playing field helps increase options and improve the responsiveness of
higher education institutions. Management considers that allowing a range of high-
quality post-secondary public and private (not-for-profit and for-profit) providers to
enter the field is the most efficient way to meet the diverse needs of secondary school
graduates for further learning or training. At the same time, this principle calls for
establishing adequate quality assurance mechanisms that do not differentiate between
public and private providers.

GREATER INTERNAL COORDINATION
Management will explore options to involve the relevant GPs and CCSAs more broadly
and frequently in higher education projects and discussions. There is a potential to
strengthen useful linkages—for instance, by including members of other GPs in teams,
by having them as peer reviewers, and by establishing more effective consultation and
coordination with them. Incentives and mechanisms to enable a larger scale of cross-GP
collaboration also need to be strengthened.

THE EXTERNAL LANDSCAPE OF SUPPORT OF HIGHER EDUCATION
Management recognizes the need for sustainable funding to support higher education
projects. The typical life-span of projects poses a significant limitation in fostering larger
systemic change in the tertiary education sector. Evidence from long-standing higher
education projects seems to show that there is a good chance of fostering substantial
long-term or permanent policy change when Bank support is in place for a sustained
period. Also, the impact of interventions can be measured more adequately when
projects extend beyond the typical life-span—as happened, for example, in the
Technical Education Quality Improvement Project in India; support for ICETEX, the
Colombian Student Loans Agency; and support to MECESUP, the Chilean Fund for
Performance-based Grants to Higher Education Institutions.

Management also agrees that more effective communication and collaboration with
other players in the financing of higher education would reduce potential overlap. In
several countries and at a regional level, the World Bank Group can play a more active
role as a convener of a coordinated approach toward funding support for higher
education. The World Bank Group will explore more active collaboration with relevant
players—international development agencies, foundations, private funders, NGOs, and
so on—in an effort to more effectively define trends and areas of opportunity for
collaborative support for higher education.

 There are already some mechanisms in place for such collaboration. For example, the
semiformal discussions held by the International Donor Harmonisation Group can be
the basis for a more structured exchange of information and identification of areas of
common interest for joint funding of large-scale projects. Valuable lessons can be drawn
from experiences with a more systematic approach, such as the funding of the African
Centers of Excellence and the combined funding for a project to establish new technical
colleges in Ecuador. And, as noted above, Management is committed to collaborating
with other key players in the global policy landscape for higher education and
supporting joint work in areas of common interest.


IFC Management Comments
IFC Management would like to thank the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) for its
extensive and informative evaluation of IFC’s support for higher education. The report
provides a reasonable and balanced account of World Bank Group activities to support
higher education, reinforcing the importance of that work and providing insights and
guidance going forward. IFC Management commends the IEG team for a thorough
process, including consultations with a broad array of stakeholders, experts, and peer
reviewers, leading to a detailed, well-written, and thoughtful report. The report is
particularly timely, given the growing importance of education to IFC’s strategic goals.

In higher education, IFC aims to increase reach and impact, develop skills, and enhance
employability. To achieve this, its strategy is to (a) invest in private education players,
with a focus on viable and scalable models; (b) support innovation by investing in new
service delivery models to increase affordability and quality and replicate successful
models in existing and new emerging markets; and (c) leverage WB’s convening power
to share best practices and foster partnerships. Through financing, knowledge transfers,
and partnerships, the team has helped its clients innovate to offer integrated, high-
quality programs and scale up their operations for network effects and economies of
scale.

With this background, IFC Management makes the following points relevant to the
report before discussing the recommendations.

      First, in line with the report’s analysis that argues for private providers to
       enhance lower income groups’ equitable access to education, IFC has been
       making significant efforts to promote access to higher education by lower income
       segments: investing in student lending companies, engaging with affordable
       private providers interested in diversifying into less developed regions, and
       applying blended delivery models.



                                                                                       xix
MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


        Second, IFC reports publicly on its investment projects’ gender reach. In the
         higher education portfolio, Management is pleased to share that several projects
         have been achieving strong results—for example, in Colombia’s Uniminuto the
         percentage of women students exceeded the national averages.
        Third, IFC appreciates the importance of educational technologies, emphasizing
         them in its investment strategy. To catalyze innovations in education technology,
         IFC has also invested in an education innovation fund.
        Fourth, IFC Management shares the concerns raised in the report about
         education quality as providers continue to increase and diversify. However, it is
         Management’s opinion that the growth in private education in emerging markets
         is not directly responsible for an overall decline in education quality. In this
         regard, IFC’s appraisal and due diligence processes focus rigorously on
         evaluating quality on the basis of several facets, including governance, academic
         standards including accreditation, management depth, technology, and quality
         and diversity of student services. Only those providers that are seen to deliver
         tangible value and positive learning outcomes are cleared for further deliberation
         processes for IFC support.
        Finally, IFC Management supports the role played by higher education
         institutions in leveraging linkages and alliances, especially in addressing
         employment challenges. Several IFC investee companies in higher education
         serve their local communities, including through students’ volunteer work
         (providing, for instance, pro bono legal services under the guidance of their
         faculty) and provision of free medical, dental, and psychological counselling. As
         the report noted, going forward, IFC could help them also connect more
         efficiently with local resources and address their graduates’ employability needs.

The IFC team is also broadly in agreement with the analysis on trends and challenges in
higher education, including the growing demand; the demographic bulge in some
regions; the increasing need for skilled and professional workers to increase
competitiveness; the renewed importance of equity, quality, gender, and employability;
and recent growth in private providers, given government budgets that are increasingly
constrained by conflicting public priorities in the social sector.

IFC Management notes that including technical and vocational education projects in the
analysis would have enhanced the report’s ability to give a comprehensive picture of
IFC’s higher education support, as such projects constitute an important part of IFC’s
portfolio, in line with our strategic objectives. Providers that offer skills-based programs
and credentials that are well recognized in the labor market are an important part of the
higher education landscape, regardless of whether students exit with a degree Future
analyses may want to take this into consideration.

Overall, however, IFC Management welcomes the findings and conclusions of the
report. It especially agrees on the importance of higher education to development and
to the World Bank Group goals of eliminating extreme poverty and promoting shared
prosperity, particularly in the context of the post-2015 development agenda.

IFC Management broadly concurs with the recommendations, which are clearly
articulated. On Recommendation 1, IFC is broadly supportive. In particular, regarding
the factors listed in paragraph 5.7 for World Bank Group’s consideration, it strongly
agrees on the need to examine the aspect of the rapid proliferation of new institutions of
variable quality that offer credentials of limited value to students and pose grave
reputational risks for the private sector. To protect the public interest in these aspects,
IFC has supported robust and effective government regulation of higher education
systems and high-quality institutions and programs. IFC Management also notes that
including technical and vocational education projects in future analysis would enhance
IEG’s ability to give a comprehensive picture of IFC’s tertiary education support as they
constitute important parts of IFC’s portfolio, in line with our strategic objectives.
Providers that offer skills-based programs with well recognized credentials in the labor
market are an important part of the higher education landscape.

On Recommendation 2, IFC’s institutional views are aligned. To strengthen the
evidence base and knowledge in accordance with IFC’s business needs, new results
indicators are constantly evolving. In particular, IFC has been trying to develop more
rigorous methodologies for deeper insights about the relationships between higher
education and employability, a critical but relatively new area of focus of research in
higher education that is only now beginning to attract the attention of academics,
institutions, and employers. IFC is planning to expand its collection of this data,
currently being piloted with a few strategic clients, to a broader client base in emerging
markets since these datasets are not readily available in private institutions in
developing countries. In this process, IFC will also help strengthen the capacity of those
educational institutions to measure educational impact.

On Recommendation 3, while IFC has been advancing in the direction recommended,
including the participation of employers in and the integration of employers’
perspectives into IFC operations, its Management would welcome IEG suggestions to
strengthen this effort. Some past and current initiatives include engaging with
employers as part of its investment appraisal process and in various sector forums,
from student lending in Brazil to trade associations in MENA and LAC. IFC also
regularly consults with the private sector in higher education as part of its ongoing
knowledge management initiatives.




                                                                                       xxi
MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


On Recommendation 4, while there is already good collaboration between IFC and the
Education GP on projects and other one-off initiatives, the IFC team is very receptive to
the suggestion to better coordinate with Global Practices. As the report notes, IFC’s
approach to higher education is well aligned with World Bank strategies, focusing on
access and equity, relevance, and quality. That said, IFC looks forward to renewed joint
WB-IFC work toward achieving the SDGs, particularly regarding affordable tertiary
education access for all. IFC is committed to building equitable, high-quality, relevant,
and efficient higher education systems and supporting quality private sector providers,
working with the Education and other Global Practices.

Report to the Board from the Committee on
Development Effectiveness Subcommittee
The Subcommittee of the Committee on Development Effectiveness considered the
report of the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) entitled Higher Education for
Development: An Evaluation of the World Bank Group’s Support, together with the draft
response of Management of the World Bank Group institutions.

The Subcommittee welcomed IEG’s evaluation and Management’s broad concurrence
with the report’s findings and recommendations. They were encouraged to learn the
World Bank is already carrying out activities to address the recommendations,
including analytical work to have a more policy and country-specific approach. The
Subcommittee acknowledged that the World Bank Group has risen to the challenge of
the growing demand for higher education in client countries but noted that its
contribution could be broader and not only focused on building systems and
governance structures. Members highlighted the timeliness of the evaluation,
particularly in light of the upcoming World Development Report 2018: Realizing the
Promise of Education for Development.

Members stressed the importance of making higher education affordable to the poor, of
enhancing the quality of teaching and learning, and of addressing demand for skilled
manpower, particularly in low income developing countries. They noted that equitable
access to higher education is one of the drivers of economic growth and poverty
reduction, and that learning has to be addressed in connection with the challenges of
employability including within changing job markets, high mobility, and the impact of
digitization and technological.

The Subcommittee encouraged the World Bank Group to carry out a strategic review of
its support for higher education and asked it take into account the quality of primary
and secondary education, employment, and job creation as well as the relationship
between higher education and technical and vocational education. They stressed the
need for forward-looking thinking on how to address key issues identified in the
evaluation such as finding ways to neutralize undesirable distributional consequences
and unintentional marginalization of groups; to improve access for the underprivileged
and disadvantaged; and to make higher education affordable for the poor, including
attracting donor funding. While much of the World Bank Group’s support has focused
on middle-income countries, the Subcommittee noted that a growing number of low-
income countries are increasingly receiving support. They added that while the World
Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) experiences were mostly

concentrated in middle-income countries, many lessons could be applicable to low-
income countries.

Members emphasized the need for the World Bank and IFC to improve the quality of
results indicators, ensure their adequate measurement, and further build and draw on
the evidence base for higher educations. They also noted the relevance of benchmarking
learning to improve outcomes by establishing standardized tests and metric for learning
outcomes. Additionally, they observed that more impact evaluations of education
projects should be considered in the medium and longer terms.

The Subcommittee underscored the need to diversify funding sources and to put in
place proper regulatory frameworks to monitor performance and the adequacy of
higher education service providers. They urged IFC and the World Bank to identify
ways to increase the role of the private sector in higher education and to include the
input of employers’ perspectives in World Bank and IFC investments to ensure the
desired link to industry competitiveness. They agreed that wider stakeholder
participation could help establish coherent policy frameworks and help inform the
discussion of how to bridge skills mismatches and address gender gaps.

Members underscored the importance of increasing coordination within the World
Bank Group and strengthening the synergies among the Education Global Practice and
other Global Practices. They encouraged Management to foster South-South
cooperation to develop and build curricula, share best practices, student exchange
programs, and teacher training and posting. They also encouraged Management to
work closer with other development partners, including the wide range of
nontraditional donors.

1. Introduction
Higher education lies at the nexus of growth, jobs, and competiveness and has the
potential to serve as a catalyst for economic transformation. The higher education
system sits at the apex of the education system, supporting the lower levels of
education, preparing professionals and skilled labor, and serving as an incubator for
research. As developing countries expand basic education systems and increasingly
transition into the knowledge economy, higher education will play an important role, as
acknowledged in the Sustainable Development Goals, serving as an incubator for the
knowledge base and human capital needed to promote and sustain development across
many sectors. In particular, Sustainable Development Goal 4 aims to “ensure inclusive
and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”
(UNGA 2015).

Given this context, the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) is evaluating past World
Bank Group interventions in higher education. The evaluation can serve as a guide to
help address the challenges posed by the post-2015 development agenda as well as
those inherent in the World Bank Group strategy. In particular, the World Bank Group
must address the twin goals (eliminating extreme poverty and promoting shared
prosperity) by building evidence, developing solutions, and providing insight to
understand how to support future interventions (World Bank Group 2013).


The Importance of Higher Education in Development
Higher education can make an important contribution to building a stronger society,
ending extreme poverty, and boosting shared prosperity. It can serve the community by
contributing knowledge and advanced skills as well as basic competencies and
research. Knowledge plays a growing role in the global economy, driving economic
growth and productivity. Economic studies have shown a positive relationship between
education and economic growth, particularly those that take into account the quality of
education (Barro 2013; Hanushek and Woessmann 2008, 2012). Although it has been
more difficult to identify the direct contribution of higher education to growth,
evidence suggests that countries with a greater proportion of educated graduates in the
labor force have greater labor productivity and increased capacity to adapt technology
and to innovate (Bloom et al. 2014). This leads to higher labor productivity and greater
total factor productivity (Altbach 2013). These results are present in a number of
countries, such as China, Pakistan, and Cameroon (George and Augustine 2009; Stengos
and Aurangzeb 2008; Whalley and Zhao 2010). Studies have also shown that higher
education leads to robust private returns to graduates and have further shown, over the


                                                                                       1

INTRODUCTION
years, that the average returns are increasing and these returns now exceed those at the
primary and secondary level (Montenegro and Patrinos 2014).

However, the simple act of graduating does not guarantee significant individual returns
or increases in productivity. In fact, in many countries, ranging from China and India to
Tunisia and Jordan, some graduates are experiencing difficulties in finding gainful
employment. Furthermore, although demand for more educated workers is growing,
there are emerging concerns about the quality and relevance of higher education, and
about value for money and resource allocation in the sector.

The IEG evaluation of the World Bank Group’s contribution to jobs and competitiveness
builds on the Global Competitiveness Index methodology and provides a useful
conceptual model for identifying higher education’s contribution to competitiveness at
each stage of development (Sala-i-Martín et al. 2015; World Bank 2016).

In this model, economies compete based on factor endowments such as unskilled labor
and natural resources and can increase their competitiveness by strengthening
governance and institutions, building a stable economy, and providing basic services. In
more advanced, efficiency-driven economies, increasing competitiveness is driven by
higher education and training, efficient and well-functioning markets, and access to
domestic and global consumers. In innovation-driven economies, countries produce
specialized products through sophisticated business processes and innovation.
Different types of firms operate at each stage. For example, factor-driven firms
dominate in factor-driven economies but continue to play a role in efficiency- and
innovation-driven economies (see figure 1.1).

                                                                               INTRODUCTION

The Roles and Missions of Higher Education
The higher education community generally identifies three distinct but interrelated
missions (Sánchez-Barrioluengo 2013): (i) teaching and learning, (ii) research, and (iii)
community engagement. In practice, these missions are not discrete, and they interact
and complement each other.

TEACHING AND LEARNING: PREPARING STUDENTS FOR THE FUTURE
The first mission is perhaps the best known—that of imparting knowledge and skills to
educate professionals and skilled workers in both the public and private sectors. As
economies move up the value chain, they require a more educated and productive
workforce. This requires improved management and specialized skills such as those in
physical and social sciences, engineering, and business management.

There is little evidence on how to improve learning in higher education. In part, this
reflects the lack of data on student learning and instructor interaction at this level
(Carrell and West 2008). The World Bank Group’s education strategy indicates that
monitoring teaching and learning is weak in higher education. The strategy also notes a
paucity of impact evaluations on higher education interventions (World Bank 2011). A
recent systematic review identifies 175 studies on evidence at the higher education level
in developing countries, of which only 24 were quantitative or evaluative. The
systematic reviews find that most of the studies focus on access (Clifford et al. 2013).
The absence of significant literature on the quality of teaching and learning in higher
education is surprising given the abundance of literature in basic education. The basic
education literature documents teacher quality as the single biggest determinant of
learning and has also identifies a series of interventions that can improve this impact
(Bruns and Luque 2014; Green 2010; Hanushek, Piopiunik, and Wiederhold 2014).

RESEARCH: CREATING KNOWLEDGE AND INNOVATION
The second mission consists of research that can lead to greater competitiveness, and
foster innovation (Altbach, Reisberg, and Rumbley 2009). This varies greatly, ranging
from applied research, which largely generates private benefits, to pure research, which
creates public goods. Both pure and applied research are important foundations for
future innovation and complements education (Salmi 2009). Research has network
externalities and increasing returns to scale: having more researchers work together
produces better results. Likewise, research tends to be costly and therefore concentrated
in a small proportion of institutions. Often, certain types (such as in agriculture or
public health) are better produced locally to help generate local spillover effects
(Altbach, Reisberg, and Rumbley 2009; Kantor and Whalley 2013; Schneider and
Sadowski 2015).



                                                                                            3
CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
As with teaching, there is limited evidence on what works in promoting research.
Research is a risky endeavor with significant information asymmetries between the
researcher and the financing agency, and the measurable impacts tend to appear with
significant time lag (Schneider and Sadowski 2015; Tödtling and Trippl 2005).

The economy-wide impact of research is often measured by what is known as the
“residual” approach; namely by total factor productivity after the contributions of labor
and capital to productivity have been subtracted (Isaksson 2007).

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT: SUPPORTING UNIVERSITY AND COMMUNITY COLLABORATION
The third mission, community engagement, encompasses the support higher education
institutions give to bringing groups with diverse interests together to work toward a
common goal. This happens through cooperation between the university and
community in generating mutual benefits and includes a number of stakeholders, such
as the public and private sectors, community organizations, and the general public
(Buys and Bursnall 2007; Hanover Research 2011; AUCEA 2006). In particular,
community engagement involves a broad range of stakeholders generating action and
creating change on multiple and complex community issues (Tamarack 2002). Higher
education can serve as a “development pole” that engages with the community to
improve productivity (Oketch, McCowan, and Schendel 2014). In partnership with local
industries, higher education institutions may harness local resources more efficiently
and address employment challenges (Fetters 2010). This ranges from extension services
to community radio and is generally aligned with the institution’s other mission
(McDowell 2003; Soeiro 2012). Community engagement goes beyond traditional efforts
to improve equity and the pro-poor focus of teaching and research.


Approach and Methodology
The evaluation aims to understand the design of the World Bank Group’s support for
higher education and its contribution to the World Bank Group’s objectives, in
particular the World Bank Group strategy (World Bank Group 2014). It seeks to provide
clarity on the World Bank Group’s objectives in higher education and identify areas in
which a coherent vision is lacking. The evaluation has three central questions:

       Is World Bank Group support for higher education consistent and well
        articulated?
       How has World Bank Group support contributed to higher education systems?
       How has World Bank Group support for higher education contributed to social
        and economic outcomes?

                                                                                                INTRODUCTION
The World Bank Group focuses on the economic contribution of the higher education
system within the context of competitiveness. The evaluation aims to understand the
design of the World Bank Group’s support for higher education and identify areas in
which a coherent vision or an evidence-based approach are lacking. This can play a role
in ensuring that the World Bank Group’s support continues to a make a contribution to
achievement of the World Bank Group’s objectives, particularly the World Bank Group
strategy (World Bank Group 2014).

The evaluation covers the period from July 2003 to May 2016, focusing on the portfolio
that the World Bank Group identified as higher education or tertiary education. This
evaluation uses the term higher education since it is the one most commonly used by
policy makers and in the majority of the projects included in this portfolio review. This
evaluation bases the higher education portfolio on the World Bank Group’s internal
definitions. In classifying interventions, the World Bank Group defines its support for
higher education as “efforts to improve the teaching and research capacity of degree-
granting educational institutions that support students beyond the secondary school
level, specifically colleges, universities, graduate schools, and professional schools.”
This closely corresponds to United Nations Education, Social, and Culture
Organization’s International Standard Classification of Education levels 5–8, which
typically offer academic programs of at least two years (UNESCO 2015).

The methodology is discussion in appendix A, which provides further detail on the
evaluation design and methodology. It also includes a listing of the World Bank Group
portfolio that the evaluation reviewed. Appendix B provides more information on the
country case studies developed for this evaluation.

2. Higher Education in Development: Trends and
Challenges
    Highlights
     The demand for higher education is increasing, leading to growing enrollment.
     Employers are concerned with the readiness of graduates, including whether they have basic
      cognitive and “soft” skills.
     Enrollment in higher education favors wealthier groups, though equity has been improving.
     The share of women in higher education is growing, and in some Regions, women outnumber men.
      However, men outnumber women in science and technical fields in all countries.


Higher education faces many perennial challenges, including expanding and promoting
equitable access, improving learning achievement, fostering educational quality and
relevance, strengthening knowledge and technology transfer, and encouraging desired
values, behaviors, and attitudes. Even when governments recognize these challenges,
most governments lack the fiscal resources to address them using the existing financing
model.

completion of the primary education cycle have resulted in increasing enrollment at the
postprimary level and, consequently, in higher education. A demographic bulge has in
many instances, accompanied this momentum: in 2010, 1.8 billion youth between 10
and 24 years of ages accounted for 28 percent of the world population (UNFPA 2014).
This is compounded by economic growth and the emergence of a middle class—likely
to increase from 1.8 billion in 2009 to 3.2 billion by 2020 and reach 4.9 billion by 2030
(Pezzini 2012)—that is more likely to enroll in higher education.


Growing Demand for Higher Education
As seen in figure 2.2, there is a rapidly growing demand for higher education because of
the substantial expansion in primary and secondary education. In some cases, the
enrollment rate in higher education has outpaced that of secondary education,
particularly in the East Asia and Pacific and South Asia Regions. However, there is also
a great deal of inequality, in that students from poorer households often lack the same
access to quality education as students from wealthier backgrounds. Access and
completion often differ for male and female students. Likewise, many students lack
access because of discrimination on the basis of caste, ethnicity, or other minority status.
Likewise, the lack of accommodation is often a real barrier for students with disabilities.

Many factors drive rapid growth in higher education. The two main proximate
determinates are growth in secondary education and an increased transition rate from
secondary to tertiary education. In many countries, this is the result of government to
increase the coverage of primary and secondary education. Behind these trends are
many cultural and economic factors, including the increased role of females in school
and work, higher incomes, and improved learning for many students (Sharma 2012).

CHAPTER 2
HIGHER EDUCATION IN DEVELOPMENT: TRENDS AND CHALLENGES
Growth in the knowledge economy and the perception that the most desired
employment requires a university degree, particularly in countries with high
enrollment rates, also drives demand.

Looking forward, there are important demographic changes. From the present until
2050, the Sub-Saharan Africa Region will continue to see growth in the youth
population, which will further increase the number of students. In contrast, countries in
the East Asia and Pacific Region will see the total number of youth decline relatively
quickly, whereas other Regions will see a more gradual decline (Filmer and Fox 2014).


Equity in Higher Education
In both the developed and developing worlds, higher education faces perennial
challenges of access, equity, and diversity. Traditionally, higher education has been a
privilege largely enjoyed by students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, and
current growth in enrollment raises questions about who gains access to it, and who
derives benefits from it. (Appendix D on equity and inclusion in higher education
provides a detailed discussion and analysis.)

Although tertiary enrollments have surged globally, there are clear disparities in access
based on socioeconomic status and gender. Global data on higher education
participation from Demographic and Health Surveys and other sources suggest a
number of trends and stylized facts:

        Access inequality is higher in low-income countries and in countries with low
         overall rates of participation. In some countries, there is extremely limited or no
         participation from the bottom two quintiles, particularly in low-income countries
         in the Sub-Saharan Africa Region, such as Tanzania, Burundi, Mozambique,
         Madagascar, Mali, Sierra Leone, Burkina Faso, and Liberia.
        Although equity is an issue for all countries, the patterns show higher education
         participation is more equitable in the East Europe and Central Asia Region.
        Although participation has increased for all quintiles, the gap between the
         wealthiest and the poorest quintiles has widened in most countries.

Equity has many dimensions. Within higher education, there are potential issues in
terms of access or enrollment (who attends), results or completion (who graduates and
how fast), and learning and employability outcomes (what value-added graduates
demonstrate).

Policy makers have a wide range of policies to improve equity at the tertiary level.
Broadly speaking, these can be divided into four groups: (i) financial assistance,
including targeted scholarships and student loans; (ii) academic support, covering

                                             HIGHER EDUCATION IN DEVELOPMENT: TRENDS AND CHALLENGES
supplemental teaching and tutoring; (iii) personal support, including academic
guidance and counseling; and (iv) institutional support, comprising affirmative action,
accommodation, and tracking (Rowan-Kenyon, Savitz-Romer, and Swan 2010).

Because of the inequality is enrollment, the allocation of public resources for higher
education is usually regressive. Several recent World Bank Public Expenditure Reviews
completed during 2012–16 categorized the concentration of public spending through a
benefit incidence analysis and show that it overwhelmingly favors the wealthiest
quintiles.

Gender inequality in higher education is a complicated issue that varies greatly by
country, with differing causes and consequences. Unequal access for women to higher
education persists in most of the developing world. Figure 2.3 helps to illustrate a
number of important points in that regard:

                                                           The Sub-Saharan Africa Region has the

CHAPTER 2
HIGHER EDUCATION IN DEVELOPMENT: TRENDS AND CHALLENGES
        Lower-middle-income countries have generally reached gender parity at the
         higher education level and upper-middle-income countries generally have a
         growing gender disparity, with men not enrolling at the same rate as women.

Understanding gender in higher education also requires deeper analysis. A common
observation is that men and women tend to pursue different fields of study. This has
implications for how resources are allocated within higher education. Moreover, the
different choices of men and women regarding the fields of study may have important
implications for their occupational choices and their earnings. Although country
contexts differ greatly, in all countries with data, the GPI of students in the science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics fields is substantially less than 1. These
differences may be even greater within specific subfields. There is need for further
research on the unemployment rate by gender and on the wage gap.

People with disabilities also encounter significant barriers to furthering education, as
few institutions have introduced differentiated accommodations, transportation, and
learning modalities to address physical and learning disabilities. This reflects the cost
associated with accommodations as well as simple awareness on the part of
administrators and instructors. In addition, in many countries, ethnic and religious
minorities are excluded from the national economy and face discrimination in the
education sector (Buchmann and Hannum 2001; Filmer 2008).


Quality of Higher Education
Quality in higher education can be seen from multiple perspectives. From an external
perspective, quality is associated with higher education’s contributions to society,
including economic and social benefits. From student-centric perspectives, quality
focuses on the student experience (Tam 2001). There are also higher education
institutional perspectives that often measure quality by aggregating input and output
data on students, faculty, programs, and institutions as a whole. Institutions typically
have information on facilities and staff, such as faculty credentials, student-to-instructor
ratio, or library size. Institutions often measure faculty outputs such as number of
articles produced or patents issued (Dwyer, Millett, and Payne 2006). Institutions may
also monitor quality through quality assurance, accreditation, and ranking, which can
provide guidance to potential students and the institution’s administration.

Many countries are focusing on improving the quality of teaching and learning. This
mirrors a similar focus in basic education, which increasingly emphasizes the role of
quality. Understanding quality in teaching and learning needs to be grounded in the
theory of how teachers teach and adults learn. Adults learn differently from children

                                                                                   CHAPTER 2
                                       HIGHER EDUCATION IN DEVELOPMENT: TRENDS AND CHALLENGES
because of differences in experience, motivation, and cognition. In particular, adult
learning draws from previous experiences, inspires acquisition of knowledge and skills
in different ways, and requires higher cognitive understanding to permit critical
thinking and problem solving (Fry, Ketteridge, and Marshall 2009). The higher levels of
cognition build on Bloom’s taxonomy, which scaffolds the complexity of learning:
remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and create (Bloom 1956).

At the student level, higher education institutions primarily gather input and output
data, with little focus on outcomes beyond grading students in individual classes and
possibly a thesis or similar graduation requirement (Cunha and Miller 2014; Dwyer,
Millett, and Payne 2006). Assessment of student learning and how they apply learning
can be used to certify student aptitude and achievement as well as to improve course
curricula and instructional processes at the program level. This can help create
accountability at the institutional level (Parekh 2016). This assessment may take the
form of standardized tests such as generic aptitude and achievement tests as well as
discipline-specific tests and licensing exams (Martin 2014). Although still relatively rare,
these types of assessments are on the rise and form part of the practice in countries such
as Colombia and Mexico. Similar to the Program for International Student Assessment,
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has made a
large-scale attempt to measure student learning (known as AHELO). Within the higher
education community, the development of AHELO has raised many questions about its
purpose, implementation, and use of outcomes (Parekh 2016).

Instructors in higher education typically receive minimal or no training in teaching
practices, under the assumption that mastery of a subject is sufficient (Robinson and
Hope 2013). The lack of understanding of how adults learn can result in teaching and
learning in higher education that is focused more on the transmission of knowledge
than on higher-order thinking and application. Improving teaching and learning in
higher education can potentially include improving the selection of instructors;
upgrading instructor knowledge and competencies through formal training; developing
technological platforms and other innovative means, such as massive open online
courses; improving learning environments; and providing pedagogical support to
instructors (OECD 2009). A system of self-evaluation by students and professors also
complements these initiatives. Improving quality can also be supported at the
institutional- and system-level through quality assurance and accreditation
mechanisms. As with any assessment or evaluation system, it is important to have
baselines and a mechanism to measure improvements.

CHAPTER 2
HIGHER EDUCATION IN DEVELOPMENT: TRENDS AND CHALLENGES

Employability
In addition to access pressure generated by secondary graduates, higher education is
also under stress to provide quality and relevant education to ensure the employability
of school leavers and graduates. As defined by the International Labor Organization,
employability requires a combination of technical skills and broader socio-emotional
skills (ILO 2013). A recent review of survey evidence of employer’s perspectives reveals
that employers view socio-emotional skills as the most important set of skills
(Cunningham and Villaseñor 2014). These are followed by cognitive skills (for example,
problem solving or communication skills). In many cases, employers identified the lack
of soft skills as more important than the gap in technical skills. These results are quite
robust across different regions, types of countries, professions, and education levels
(Cunningham and Villaseñor 2014). A survey of higher education institutions in high-
and middle-income countries found that higher education administrators believe their
graduates are ready for the job market more so than employers and even students
(Mourshed, Farrell, and Barton 2012). Some graduates prefer to stay unemployed rather
than accept a job below their expectations whereas other accept jobs for which they are
overqualified (Pushkar 2016).

Although many factors contribute to youth unemployment, the quality and relevance of
education is a major factor, as documented by IEG’s evaluation on youth employment
(World Bank 2012). Broadly speaking, graduates must have relevant technical,
cognitive, and noncognitive skills to match the demands of their employer (Cleary and
Van Noy 2014). Figure 2.4 outlines the relationship between the qualities of education
that students receive and the demands of employers. At a minimum, for graduates to
have any economic value-added, they have to be at least at the bottom of the pyramid.
Below this level, there is no economic reason to hire a higher education graduate. As
defined in the previous chapter, employers in efficiency-driven firms require graduates
to have the capacity to apply their knowledge, whereas employers in innovation-driven
firms require an even higher level of cognition.

The Changing Higher Education Landscape
There is a large variety of colleges and universities, with different objectives as well as
types of governance and ownership. Growing demand for higher education and
changing economic and political needs have led to a greater role for private and
autonomous public providers in domestic and international contexts.

The private provision of higher education. There has been a marked increase in the
share of private enrollment in higher education. Figure 2.5 shows steady growth in
private provision in lower-income countries compared with upper-middle-income
countries that traditionally had a higher share of private provision (Levy 2013). Higher
education institutions have a wide range of management and financing models. The
ownership structure of private providers can range from nonprofit and faith-based
institutions to for-profit providers. In general, most private providers rely on tuition for
their budgets. However, in some countries, such as Chile, private higher education
institutions can receive public subsidies, and in other countries, such as Colombia,
private higher education students can receive public financial aid (Levy 2015). Most
private providers in “soft” fields that do not require substantial capital investment
(Altbach, Reisberg, and Rumbley 2009).

In many countries, the lack of educational standards and weak quality assurance
systems have raised concerns about the quality of private providers. The rapid growth
in enrollment has led to the concern that many private providers are “diploma mills” or
“garage universities” that offer limited value-added to their students. These concerns
have grown substantially with the growth of internationalization and online education
(Levy 2013; Parker 2012). Without some sort of quantitative measure of quality
(academic or labor outcomes), all that can be conclusively said is that there are both
good- and bad-quality public and private providers and that increasing private
provision has the potential to help many students. This is by no means certain or
automatic; ensuring this will require good policy as well as information for students.

Autonomy. Traditionally, there has been a wide range in the degree of autonomy
among higher education providers. Institutions from the Anglo-American and Latin
American context have historically had a high level of autonomy, either as public
institutions or private institutions relying heavily on public subsidies (Raza 2009). This
has encouraged other countries to increase autonomy. This push for autonomy,
combined with growing demand for enrollment and increasing costs, has led many
public institutions to rely more on tuition and partnerships with the private sector
(Levy 2015).

Internationalization. Increasing numbers of higher education students are studying in
overseas universities. In 2012, at least 4 million students went abroad for some sort of
higher education study, up from 2 million in 2000 (UNESCO 2016). This reflects the
ability and willingness among certain relatively privileged students to pay for high-
quality education, the growth of the knowledge economy, and increasing global

                                      HIGHER EDUCATION IN DEVELOPMENT: TRENDS AND CHALLENGES
integration. Many institutions have created satellite campuses and affiliated programs,
while universities in the developing world have adopted internationalized curricula to
develop high-quality academics and employable graduates locally. A wide range of
institutions—from top universities to medium-tier institutions that primarily focus on
teaching—have organized and formed international networks. Likewise, a number of
private firms have expanded their own international network, through a combination of
equity investments and management contracts.

Related to internationalization is the migration of the higher education graduates to
wealthier countries (“brain drain”). Traditionally, many have seen brain drain and, its
counterpart, “brain gain,” as a zero-sum game. However, in recent years, there has been
growing recognition of “brain circulation,” which implies that migration can benefit
both the origin and host countries; the cases of India and China are typically cited as
positive examples (Daugeliene and Marcinkeviciene 2015). Likewise, the establishment
of international campuses may also serve to ensure that individuals can receive
international education and continue to contribute to local development.


Setting Priorities
The supply and demand for higher education sits within a broader context. Depending
on the state of development, higher education systems face differing challenges and
priorities. Although basic education is a major constraint for many economies, higher
education plays an important role in all countries. Table 2.1 presents higher education’s
as position in its particular development context, including illustrative challenges and
interventions. This is a stylized description that minimizes major differences among
countries. There are also other potential typologies—for example, transition economies
often have more developed higher education systems than might be expected. These
categories apply equally to firms and productive organizations and to the economy as a
whole. In reality, countries have a mix of firms that operate simultaneously. In other
words, even an advanced innovation-driven economy will have factor-driven firms.

A country’s approach to higher education depends on its context. For example, fragile
and conflict-affected states need to focus on stability by restoring institutions and
establishing rule of law. Their higher education systems are likely to be nascent, and
therefore should focus on basic educational infrastructure and alternative systems of
education delivery. At the national level, the more stable factor-driven economies
should prioritize building stable and robust economies. In these countries, higher

education systems need focus on building basic infrastructure, improving systems and
policies, and strengthening institutions. Finally, more advanced efficiency-driven
economies are transitioning into manufacturing and service economies. Their
economies require a diverse and better-skilled workforce, and their higher education
systems should focus on improving higher education opportunities for all students and
prioritizing relevant teaching and learning and research.

3. The World Bank Group and Higher Education
 Highlights
  The World Bank Group has a coherent set of strategies for broad education sector development and
    for higher education, with specific reference to the competitiveness and jobs agenda.
  The overarching framework for World Bank Group support to higher education may need to be
   adjusted in light of a rapidly changing context and the twin goals of the World Bank strategy.
  While there is communication between the Education Global Practice and other global practices and
   the International Finance Corporation on higher education, there is little evidence of coordination.
  Many external financiers support higher education with room for more cooperation and collaboration,
   both among themselves and with the World Bank Group.


Higher education has been a central part of the World Bank Group’s support for
education since the 1960s. From 1963 to 1970, it accounted for 17 percent of education
lending. Most of these early projects focused on providers, particularly construction and
equipment. From 1971 to 1984, the proportion of higher education projects increased to
38 percent. The World Bank complemented this with a gradual move toward “soft”
investments, such as training and developing skills (World Bank 2011). However, by the
mid-1980s the World Bank and other donors shifted away from higher education
toward basic education (Bloom et al. 2014; World Bank 1999). Increased support for
basic education from other international financial institutions and donors, and the
renewed focus on competitiveness in the 2000s led to a reevaluation of World Bank
support for higher education in areas such as higher education diversification,
educational standards, curriculum reform, and science and technology (World Bank
2000, 2002, 2011; Altbach, Reisberg, and Rumbley 2009). Likewise, the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) began investing in the education sectors in the late 1990s,
focusing on higher education.


The World Bank Group’s Strategies and Its Approach to Higher Education
INSTITUTIONAL STRATEGIES
The World Bank Group has a number of strategic documents that guide its support for
higher education. Although these have different purposes, these strategies complement
each other, with differences reflecting different regional priorities. Higher education
may contribute to the broader World Bank Group strategy, in particular promoting
shared prosperity through economic growth, inclusion, and sustainability by producing
employable graduates, while strengthening institutions and economies. Although



                                                                                                      21
CHAPTER 3
THE WORLD BANK GROUP AND HIGHER EDUCATION
discussed, higher education does not play a major role in the World Bank Group’s
education sector strategy, Learning for All. The broad thrust of the education strategy is
to strengthen the education system and to develop a knowledge base.

Although there is no single higher education strategy, the World Bank has articulated
its views in knowledge work, for example, in Constructing Knowledge Societies (World
Bank 2002). It argues that the World Bank plays an integral role in higher education by
facilitating policy dialogue and knowledge sharing in higher education. The World
Bank also provides financing to client countries to support a number of goals: (i) greater
access and equity; (ii) improved relevance and quality; (iii) strengthened research; (iv)
improved management and financial systems; and (v) institutional diversification and
innovation. The detailed portfolio analysis presented in chapter 4 reflects these
priorities.

IFC has aligned its strategies with the World Bank’s approach, with particular reference
to access and equity, quality, and relevance. IFC has updated its education strategy
twice since 2001—in 2008 and 2012—but its basic strategic priorities have remained
consistent over time. IFC’s strategic approach combines a business objective, a catalytic
objective, and a development objective. IFC investments must be financially viable to
make a positive contribution to development and should help mobilize resources. IFC
investments also prioritize access for poorer students, although not necessarily the
poorest students. The most recent strategy emphasizes scalability, innovation, and the
World Bank Group’s convening power. Skills, competencies, and employability are
strategic priorities of IFC’s higher education strategy.

COUNTRY STRATEGIES
Education was identified as a key objective in 88 of the 92 Independent Evaluation
Group (IEG) country strategy reviews between FY12 and FY 16. Higher education is a
key issue in 30 of those 88 cases. The heaviest concentration of higher education-related
objectives is in the East Europe and Central Asia Region with a relatively equal
distribution among the remainder of Regions. The thematic emphasis differs from
Region to Region. For example, governance is the most common issue in East Europe
and Central Asia Region, skills and employability in Middle East and North Africa
Region, and access and enrollment in Sub-Saharan Africa Region.

Higher education features in 6 of the 17 IEG country program evaluations that cover the
evaluation period, including Kazakhstan, Zambia, Tunisia, Afghanistan, Nepal, and
Mozambique. In general, country strategies that supported higher education have
promoted it primarily by improve (i) access and equity, (ii) skills and employability, (iii)
competitiveness, and (iv) governance and institutional reform.

                                                  THE WORLD BANK GROUP AND HIGHER EDUCATION
In 2013, the World Bank Group introduced a new approach to the development of
country-level strategies that aims to make its support more systematic, evidence-based,
selective, and focused. This incorporates two instruments: (i) the Systematic Country
Diagnostic, which is a diagnosis of constraints and opportunities; and (ii) the Country
Partnership Framework, which guides the World Bank Group’s support. A forthcoming
IEG evaluation of the new country engagement model identified 22 Systematic Country
Diagnostic / Country Partnership Frameworks approved pairs by May 2016, and this
evaluation used this set to explore the degree to which higher education is likely to
feature in future country-level strategies. Two-thirds of the Systematic Country
Diagnostics (14 out of 22) identified education as a priority issue. Although universities
were directly referenced in only two instances (Costa Rica and Côte d’Ivoire), one-third
of the Country Partnership Frameworks (7 out of 22) included some aspect of higher
education as a priority. Broadly speaking, economic concerns such as skills shortages
and mismatches drive the motivation for engagement in higher education. There is
some element of emphasis on access and equity, marginal emphasis on governance and
building institutions, and no emphasis on research.


The World Bank Group’s Portfolio
The World Bank Group’s support for higher education has been growing substantially.
The World Bank has invested nearly $12 billion in higher education over the past
decade, as shown in table 3.1. As developing countries expand basic education systems
and transition into the knowledge economy, the World Bank Group is facing increased
demand for support of higher education. Appendix E presents more details about the
portfolio and the results of the evaluation.

WORLD BANK PORTFOLIO
For the analysis of the public sector portfolio, this evaluation divided higher education
projects into two categories. The first, core higher education projects, refers to projects
whose primary function is to support higher education. A second group of operations
(noncore higher education projects) include a higher education intervention or objective
as part of a typically larger project with broader scope. Table 3.1 shows that there were
139 projects that supported higher education during the evaluation period, of which 54
had a significant focus on this subsector.

The majority of core projects and about half the noncore projects were from the
education sector. In the Sub-Saharan Africa and the Europe and Central Asia Regions,
most noncore higher education projects are part of general education or postprimary
education projects (12 out of 16 and 10 out of 13, respectively). Many noncore projects
are in other global practices to support other interventions.

appears to be growing. Although the bulk of lending is to middle- and high-income
countries (about 85 percent of commitments of core projects), the World Bank provided
support to low-income countries, including a regional project in Sub-Saharan Africa
and projects in Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Malawi, and Uganda, among others.

Among 117 higher education investment projects, improving quality and relevance of
teaching and learning in higher education was the most common project development
objective (PDO), followed by strengthening the higher education system, increasing
access and equity, and improving skills and employability (see table 3.2).

 The evaluation identified 22 individual development policy operations (DPOs) that
 have at least one prior action with a higher education focus, including 4 DPOs in two
 series that entirely focused on the sector. During the evaluation period, this accounted
 for 63 individual prior actions. Likewise, it is not surprising that DPOs focus on
 financial sustainability as well as governance and system reform.

 ANALYTICAL AND SECTOR WORK IN HIGHER EDUCATION
 The evaluation identified 87 different advisory services and analytics products
 associated with higher education (figure 3.1). Based on this analysis, the evaluation has
 identified a number of trends and stylized facts:

          The increase in the number of advisory services and analytics in higher
           education after the approval of the Education Sector Strategy in 2011 was
           notable—increasing from an average of 4.7 per year to 7.5 per year, particularly
           after 2013.
          Governance within higher education (including quality assurance systems and
           accreditation) became a major theme after 2011.
          Teaching and learning (including employability and skills) were most common
           in the Sub-Saharan Africa and the Europe and Central Asia Regions.

This evaluation was not able to cover a number of knowledge products, particularly
many Reimbursable Advisory Services and some trust fund-supported products due to
access issues (for example, confidentiality of some Reimbursable Advisory Services and
incomplete filing of reports from trust fund operations). Box 3.1 discusses reimbursable
services.


 Box 3.1. Reimbursable Advisory Services
 A Reimbursable Advisory Service is an instrument that enables the World Bank to deliver
 targeted technical assistance that the beneficiary government finances. The country and the World
 Bank work together to develop a program that may include technical advice, analytical services,
 and capacity building. The World Bank provides its experience and expertise developed through
 its knowledge and project support. The instrument has enabled the World Bank to work across a
 wide range of higher education issues in upper-middle and high-income countries, primarily in
 the Europe and Central Asia Region. The topics include quality assurance, internationalization,
 and strategic planning and management, among others.
 For example, in 2013 and 2014, the World Bank collaborated with the government of Latvia to
 evaluate its higher education financing, building on country-specific European Commission
 recommendations. The joint team analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of the current approach
 to financing public higher education financing and the government in 2015 formally adopted its
 alignment to national strategies.

Knowledge work plays an important role in the World Bank’s approach to higher
education. The World Bank has provided technical support to a range of countries,
including high- and upper-middle-income countries and fragile and conflict-affected

states. The World Bank often relies on its knowledge work to focus on system issues
such as quality assurance and governance. For example, in recent years, the World Bank
has developed knowledge products to help restore higher education governance in
Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Côte d’Ivoire. These products include support to develop
higher education strategies and reforms as well as analysis of labor market demands
and education finance (World Bank 2016). The World Bank has also prepared a number
of regional publications and country-specific sector studies, such as those on Vietnam
and Chile. These studies generally focus on both the economy-wide benefits of higher
education and the context-specific challenges.

IFC PORTFOLIO
From 2003, IFC committed approximately $721.8 million to higher education (officially
classified as “colleges, universities, and professional schools”) through 42 investments.
This represented 69 percent of IFC’s total commitment to the education sector during
this period. Table 3.3 shows there were investments in all six Regions, with a particular
focus on Latin America and the Caribbean. Nearly 70 percent of IFC’s investments were
in upper-middle-income countries, with the remainder in lower-middle-income
countries. Nineteen advisory service projects—worth $7.8 million—complemented
these investments, with 10 projects being in the Sub-Saharan Africa Region and 6 in the
Middle East and North Africa Region.

IFC’s higher education portfolio focused on infrastructure, including construction,
expansion, and rehabilitation of campuses and facilities. IFC’s focus on access also
included emphasis on distance learning, and provided support to student financing
initiatives, primarily through student credit.

IFC defines additionality as the unique contribution it brings to the table. Additionality
can be monetary or nonmonetary; it can directly benefit the client or the client’s project.
In higher education, IFC’s additionality justifications at approval included providing
the client with global knowledge, sector expertise, or best practices in the higher
education sector; enhancing the credibility of a sponsor, business model, or loan
program; providing otherwise unavailable long-term financing; providing innovative
financing; and improving environmental and social standards.

IFC’s advisory services included support for strengthening the capacity of business
schools in Sub-Saharan Africa (Global Business School Network); developing skills,
competencies, and qualification framework development; providing labor market
information in the Middle East and North Africa; and facilitating public-private
partnerships, student loan studies, and monitoring and evaluation. Its support has also
included strengthening local evaluation capacity and building regional partnerships.

Coordination in Higher Education
No sector operates in a vacuum, and the World Bank Group’s capacity to coordinate its
support internally and externally plays an important role in promoting development
effectiveness. Coordination here refers to the World Bank Group’s organization of
different complex elements or activities so that they work together efficiently. It implies
an awareness of different activities related to higher education as well as active efforts
to build complementarity between these actions when appropriate.

INTERNAL COORDINATION
Evidence from interviews and country case studies indicates a high level of
communication and collaboration within the Education Global Practice. The World
Bank’s Higher Education Thematic Group, known as the Core Higher Education Group
(COREHEG), comprises both education and noneducation specialists and has been
quite active in exchanging knowledge and experience in discussions of operational and
technical challenges in higher education. Most World Bank staff interviewed were
actively involved in exchanging lessons with higher education experts in other Regions.

                                                 THE WORLD BANK GROUP AND HIGHER EDUCATION
The country case studies and Project Performance Assessment Reports note turnover in
project team leaders appears to be a challenge, particularly for noncore projects outside
of the Education Global Practice. Other IEG evaluations have found similar results in
many sectors and in the recent evaluation, Learning and Results in World Bank Operations
(World Bank 2014).

Coordination across global practices may be more of a challenge for noncore higher
education projects. For example, in Malawi, two different investment projects
supported the same program. However, coordination and communication between the
project teams seemed limited. In other noncore projects with important higher
education elements (for example, in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Liberia),
there did not appear to be an education specialist on the design or supervision teams. In
other countries, coordination among global practices appeared to be ad hoc and
opportunistic. For example, in Armenia, there was coordination with the Social
Protection Global Practices but other global practices presented missed opportunities.

The evidence suggests a good level of communication and collaboration between the
World Bank and IFC during project preparation. In the 16 countries where both are
active in higher education, a review of project documents suggests that both institutions
had a high level of awareness of each other’s portfolio. Usually, this appears as a
reference in project documents. For example, in Chile, IFC made specific mention of
both World Bank investment projects and analytical work, and in Jordan, the World
Bank’s technical assistance on financial aid referred to IFC’s operations. In India, there
were many instances of formal and informal collaboration between the two institutions.

In some cases, the two institutes worked together. In Chile, for example, there is an
ongoing joint study on the role of public and private institutions. In Vietnam, the World
Bank coordinated with IFC through its knowledge and project work. In Colombia, the
World Bank and IFC signed a memorandum of understanding to formalize
collaboration for a student loan project.

EXTERNAL COORDINATION
There is a long tradition of international support and cooperation for higher education,
although traditional development partners greatly reduced support of higher education
in the 1980s and 1990s (Bloom et al. 2014). Current data sets on donor funding in higher
education are somewhat limited. The OECD and AidData’s databases are incomplete
and often include technical vocational education and training. According to OECD,
since 2003, the largest bilateral aid donors in postsecondary education are Germany and
France, followed by the United States and Japan (OECD 2016). France appears to be the
largest provider of bilateral assistance in higher education, focusing on francophone

THE WORLD BANK GROUP AND HIGHER EDUCATION
African countries, divided equally between system support and scholarships (Lewis
2009). Germany provides most of its support as scholarships (Varghese 2011).

Unlike in other sectors, nontraditional donors such as foundations and other agencies
contribute to higher education. This support includes in-kind donations, scholarships,
partnerships, and exchanges (Varghese 2011). The identification and portrayal of both
traditional and nontraditional donor aid in higher education is often incomplete in
World Bank project documents. For example, the Higher Education Project in Pakistan
did not refer to the British Council’s support for improving higher education
governance and underestimated the amount of external scholarships and grants
available. In Vietnam, universities reported receiving donations of equipment from
external sources. In both cases, this support was directly relevant to the World Bank’s
activities. Likewise, interviews with other donors suggested a lack of awareness of the
World Bank’s activities. More recently, the World Bank has begun reaching out to
nontraditional donors, by participating in international forums.

The higher education investment portfolio includes only five co-financed projects,
including two trust funds and a nontraditional donor (the Commonwealth of Learning),
for $92 million. The World Bank sometimes works with other development partners
informally. More recently, the two African Centers of Excellence are actively
coordinating with other financiers to raise funds in parallel with the projects’ financing.

4. Evaluation Findings: World Bank Group
Support to Higher Education
 Highlights
  The results frameworks in World Bank Group investments in higher education typically focus on
    measuring inputs and outputs with little information on outcomes.
  There is little use of evidence to justify one particular type of intervention over another and little use
   of impact evaluation or other types of evaluations.
  The World Bank relies heavily on grants to provide direct support for universities.
  Many World Bank projects support strengthening the higher education system, generally promoting
   institutional autonomy and quality assurance.
  With important exceptions, improving access and equity has not been a major area of focus for the
   World Bank. In contrast, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) has generally had an equity
   focus.
  Employability is a major consideration underpinning World Bank support, primarily addressed by
   strengthening the quality and relevance of teaching and learning.
  Research is a major theme in World Bank support and is included in most higher education projects.
  The World Bank has provided limited explicit support to community engagement, the “third mission”
   of higher education.

This chapter presents findings on World Bank Group support for higher education
between FY03 and FY16. The chapter first details common issues in the World Bank
Group’s higher education portfolio. The chapter then moves on to a presentation of
findings regarding the core areas of focus in the World Bank Group engagement in
higher education as follows: higher education systems; access and equity; teaching and
learning; employability; and research.


Common Threads
Improving equitable access, the employability of graduates, and the quality of research
are all major goals of the World Bank’s support for higher education through both its
stated objectives and its activities. The International Finance Corporation (IFC)
predominantly focuses on expanding access. In reviewing projects supporting access,
employability, and research, the evaluation identified a number of common findings
that apply across the World Bank, and to a lesser extent, IFC portfolios.

                                  EVALUATION FINDINGS: WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT TO HIGHER EDUCATION
The World Bank uses both competitive and noncompetitive block grants, known as
performance agreements or academic funds, as its primary instrument to provide financing
to higher education institutions. Grants have been used in low-income and fragile and
conflict-affected states (for example, Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Malawi, and Nepal), as
well as in countries with more developed higher education systems (such as Armenia,
Chile, and Vietnam). As shown in appendix B, virtually all core higher education
projects include some sort of grant program that provides financing to higher education
institutions, programs, or research teams. The World Bank also uses grants to support
equity-oriented interventions. The provision of support through grants to noncore
projects is less common. Given its focus on access, IFC generally invests in
infrastructure and supports financing of student loans.

This evaluation notes the World Bank appears to be moving away from smaller grant
programs that target individual researchers and programs toward larger grant
programs and performance agreements at the institutional level. The latter represent a
natural evolution in World Bank support of institutional autonomy. The World Bank’s
support of larger and targeted grants has explicitly promoted autonomy. For example,
in Chile, the World Bank has increased the size of grants to focus more on institutional
priorities. The World Bank has also decreased the number of participating institutions
to generate more institutional impact in Vietnam.

Results frameworks in World Bank core higher education projects tend to be weak.
They usually concentrate on measuring inputs and outputs with little attention paid to
outcomes. For example, projects often measure access and equity in terms of total
enrollment or number of scholarships without considering student retention and
dropout rates. Result frameworks typically measure employability by looking at the
quality of the faculty, with little focus on outcomes or outputs. The use of grants puts
investment projects at “arm’s length” from beneficiaries, which may limit the World
Bank’s capacity to gather and analyze data. Project result frameworks could incorporate
more results from the grants.

CHAPTER 4
EVALUATION FINDINGS: WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT TO HIGHER EDUCATION
The evaluation also shows limited use of rigorous evidence in the design and
development of specific interventions. Micro-interventions to improve equity, teaching
and learning, employability, and research outcomes are all amenable to rigorous
piloting and evaluation, unlike systemwide reform, which is more difficult to measure.
It should be possible to evaluate what types of interventions are appropriate to reach
specific objectives, as is commonly done in other areas of education. The evaluation
found that implementers must generally develop interventions on their own and that
the lessons learned cited in project documents are generic. Thus, it would be safe to say
that the World Bank contributes too little to generating new evidence despite the World
Bank Group’s commitment to using evidence-based interventions.

The design of systemwide reforms appears to be based on limited evidence. The
evaluation finds that, despite careful preparatory work and attempts to understand
local context, many World Bank interventions default to the following standard set of
interventions: promoting autonomy, creating or strengthening quality assurance
mechanisms, and financing interventions through grants. Although the World Bank
supports both first-tier institutions and lower-tier institutions, it uses an approach
typically justified by reference to similar practices in top-tier universities in the United
States or the United Kingdom but without sufficiently discussing whether the particular
setting warrants such an extrapolation. Although these macro-level interventions are
generally not amenable to rigorous quantitative analysis, there are a number of rigorous
qualitative evaluation methods that could shed light on “what works” at the systems
level.

Given the lack of outcome indicators, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the
contribution of higher education interventions. The universe of evaluated public sector
projects is small. In the absence of outcome indicators, it is often not possible to
decompose the relationship between a project’s efficacy rating and a particular
intervention. Thus, the evaluation draws on information from the portfolio review
along with the country case studies and interviews to describe and analyze World Bank
engagement in the sector. This is especially true for noncore projects. Beyond project
development objectives, project activities provide further guidance on the World Bank’s
goals and objectives.

Although IFC projects do not have formal development objectives, various elements of
project documents provide insight into its investments’ intended purposes and
objectives. IFC is aware of the potential reputational risk associated with investments in
private education and, as such, its due diligence in the higher education sector is
extensive. The IFC’s due diligence provides assurance that its investments are in
institutions with a reasonable level of quality, thus generally avoiding so-called
“diploma mills.” The low number of evaluated projects hinders an analysis of its

developmental results. Four of the seven evaluated projects were rated moderately
successful or higher on development outcome; however, this rating includes factors
other than development effectiveness, including project business success, economic
sustainability, environmental and social management, and private sector development.
There is little evidence of the extent to which IFC has contributed to improving
employability or access for lower-income students.

The World Bank explicitly targeted vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, mainly
defined by income, gender, and ethnicity, in about one-third of its investment projects.
Projects targeting lower socioeconomic groups predominate in the South Asia and Latin
America and the Caribbean Regions as well as in upper-middle countries. Likewise,
higher education interventions targeting women were more common in the South Asia
and East Asia and Pacific Regions as well as lower-middle income countries. (For more
information, see table 4.2 on Projects Targeting Specific Population Groups).

However, few projects specified mechanisms to target vulnerable and disadvantaged
groups. In 21 projects, the World Bank used geographic location to target populations.
For example, projects in Vietnam, Mexico, Afghanistan, Mozambique, Peru, and
Guyana supported higher education institutions located in isolated areas with a higher
proportion of vulnerable students. Other projects opted to focus on particular fields or
programs in which target groups are concentrated. This is particularly the case for
projects that target women, such as those in Sri Lanka that supported female-dominated
disciplines like the arts, management, and science. In a few cases, World Bank projects
used more sophisticated methods built around an assessment of micro data. In
Colombia, student targeting for loans and grants used an existing national system that

students that qualified for scholarships.


Laying the Foundations: Strengthening Higher Education Systems
The evaluation starts its analysis of specific aspects of World Bank Group support with
a focus on governance and system issues because support in this area forms the
cornerstone of World Bank Group support. The World Bank Group’s education strategy
emphasizes the importance of education systems and commits the World Bank Group
to promote a systems approach that focuses on policies and accountability mechanisms
that binds higher education to the broader education system and, ultimately, the
broader economy (World Bank 2011). Although adequate financing is important,
strengthening higher education systems involves the improvement of the effectiveness
and efficiency of higher education—producing outputs and outcomes for the resources
invested. A systems approach involves improving institutional management,
developing more sustainable and realistic financing systems, and developing incentives
for staff, units, and programs. Given the diversity of higher education’s missions and
institutions, the system requires monitoring and evaluation as well as quality assurance.

The World Bank often includes an explicit governance focus in its operations.
Interviews with World Bank staff emphasized the importance of different types of
governance reform, particularly in establishing quality assurance mechanisms.
Interviewees also confirmed a general interest in taking a systems approach, although
such an approach was not always apparent in interventions. Interviews with IFC staff
emphasized the importance of having a strong system as a way to manage risks and
ensure better results.

About 45 percent of core investment projects include governance in their PDOs, and 60
percent of core projects support activities that have a clear focus on governance. Of the
32 core and noncore projects that focus on governance at PDO level, 17 focus on
institutional management and 14 on systems governance, with many mixing both. In
practice, there appears to be little difference between the two approaches when
comparing activities. The most common types of interventions involve quality
assurance mechanisms and improvement plans. The evaluation team got firsthand
feedback on these types of intervention as part of country visits to Malawi and Vietnam.
Less common interventions focus on improving financial mechanisms, introducing
performance incentives, and building capacity (see table 4.3).

Improving governance is a major focus of development policy operations (DPOs). Of
the 28 DPOs that include higher education in at least one prior action, 20 have a

                          EVALUATION FINDINGS: WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT TO HIGHER EDUCATION
governance focus, with specific attention paid to promoting autonomy, strengthening
regulations, and strengthening financing. Pakistan and Vietnam both had DPOs that
focused on the establishment of external and institutional quality assurance
mechanisms as ways to promote private participation and greater autonomy. In the case
of Pakistan, the DPO included a number of indicators directly related to specific policy
areas supported by the World Bank (such as greater participation by private providers)
with other indicators related to the government’s larger program (such as increase in
articles published or students enrolled). By contrast, the Vietnam DPO focused more on
outcomes directly related to the World Bank’s investments, such as the establishment of
autonomous bodies and of quality assurance mechanisms.

Much of the World Bank’s support for governance focuses on increasing university
autonomy. As previously discussed, grants to higher education institutions play an
important role in World Bank support. Since grants typically support other goals (such
as promoting research and improving teaching), they are not classified as “governance
interventions.” However, in practice, the interventions clearly relate to efforts to
support institutional capacity.

The World Bank also provided support through stand-alone knowledge work, capacity
building in the project preparation phase, and technical assistance embedded in project
components. As detailed in chapter 3, the number of knowledge products that focused
on strengthening higher education systems significantly increased starting in 2011,
coinciding with the publication of the World Bank Group’s education strategy (World
Bank 2011). It is not possible to identify the contribution of these knowledge products;
however, they clearly intended to contribute to project design and the development of
government policy and may have done so successfully. Currently, the Education Global
Practice is developing an instrument, known as Systems Approach for Better Education
Results, to measure the implementation of reform in higher education systems. The
Education Global Practice has designed its conceptual framework and is piloting the
instrument.

Since IFC invests at the institutional level, its support for systems development is
indirect. The country case study for Vietnam found IFC’s support became an important
model for other private and international higher education institutions. Interviewees
confirmed that IFC support also had a demonstration effect for the government. As
private provider and autonomy are important in the World Bank’s program, IFC
support complements the World Bank. In all of the case study countries, the World
Bank addressed financial sustainability through knowledge work. In some cases (India,
Malawi, Vietnam, and to a lesser extent, Chile), this influenced higher education
financing policy. One DPO (Armenia) and one investment project (Malawi) directly
addressed financing. Both appear to have been successful, although the support in

CHAPTER 4
EVALUATION FINDINGS: WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT TO HIGHER EDUCATION
Malawi is quite recent. The country case studies also show that although the World
Bank provided support for regulatory and governance reform, it primarily focused on
quality assurance and autonomy through the World Bank’s Reimbursable Advisory
Services (see box 3.1). Among the case study countries, World Bank support for
governance was often justified by concerns that the growth in enrollment outpaced
public financing. With the exception of India, the World Bank provided support to
create or reform an accreditation agency or a semi-independent system governing
council. In the case of India, the World Bank worked at the local level and supported
regulatory reforms, generally through investment projects, often bolstered by
knowledge products. For example, in Vietnam, the World Bank focused on a range of
issues, including establishing quality assurance, promoting foreign investment,
improving financial management, and university autonomy.

The World Bank uses a variety of governance indicators. Table 4.3 broadly categorizes
them into systems governance and institutional management. Systems governance
includes establishing legal frameworks and accreditation frameworks and related
agencies. Institutional management includes university-level planning, improved
budget execution and transparency, and reformed university governance, among
others. Almost all of these indicators are intermediate level. The only indicator that
measures higher education institutional management is the number of institutions with
accreditation. It appears that seven projects have used a quantitative measure of
accreditation. Others focus on the establishment of accreditation bodies.

The evaluation identified four closed projects that included a clear higher education
system PDO (Indonesia, Mexico, Tunisia, and the West Bank and Gaza). The IEG
reviews rated efficacy in meeting this objective as substantial in all four cases. However,
given the lack of data on outcomes, it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding the
specific impact of the higher education objectives.

The country case studies provide some additional insight into the World Bank’s
contribution to reforms. For example, the World Bank supported the establishment of

regulatory bodies (primarily focusing on quality assurance) in Armenia and Malawi,
and provided assistance to regulatory bodies in Chile and India. This suggests that
progress on reforms was usually slower than expected and the World Bank’s
contributions need further work.


Supporting the Missions
The World Bank Group contributes to the development of many aspects of the higher
education sector. This section explores its support for the three so-called missions of
higher education, as outlined in chapter 1. Given the World Bank Group’s strengths and
its commitment to working toward client-owned priorities, it is neither possible nor
desirable to give the same level of support to all missions in all instances.

THE FIRST MISSION
The first mission focuses on the traditional definition of education. In other words,
higher education’s support for students. This section looks specifically at the World
Bank Group’s efforts to target disadvantaged students, to retain students in higher
education, and to improve the quality of teaching and learning.

Access, Retention, and Equity

Enhancing equitable access to higher education is one of the goals set out in
Constructing Knowledge Societies as well as other statements of strategy at the regional
level (World Bank 2002). Although, in interview and during country case study visits,
World Bank staff recognized equitable access as an important issue – that is
emphasizing equity in opportunity and social mobility as a rationale for investing in
higher education—a relatively slight weight was given to this topic in country program
documents, including those for country case study countries. Only 1 of the 22
completed Country Partnership Frameworks analyzed for this evaluation explicitly
focused on increasing access to and improving quality of higher education (Costa Rica)
—access and equity issues are more commonly referenced in lower levels of education.
An analysis of country strategies reviewed from 2012 to 2016 shows that only 5 of the 30
country strategies that addressed higher education focused on access and equity
(Kenya, Mozambique, Niger, Colombia, and Pakistan).

Portfolio analysis indicates that about 20 percent of the World Bank investment projects
focused on increasing participation in higher education, including five projects
(Colombia, Mexico, Mozambique, Cambodia, and Romania) that supported student
retention objectives. Most of them were core projects implemented in upper-middle-
income (11) and low-income countries (8), located in the Latin America and the
Caribbean, the South Asia (6), and the Sub-Sahara Africa (7) Regions.


                                                                                              39
CHAPTER 4
EVALUATION FINDINGS: WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT TO HIGHER EDUCATION
The number of projects that specifically addressed inequalities in access to higher
education is low—17 projects. Those projects primarily addressed equity in access,
followed by graduation, and only one specified equity in retention. A common feature
was the lack of specificity regarding the target population group. Even projects use
terms such as disadvantaged, underprivileged, or needy, there was a lack of clarity
regarding the target groups. Only three projects clearly defined all the relevant equity
dimensions (access, graduation, and retention)—two in Colombia, which sought to
increase equity in access and graduation for lower socioeconomic groups, and one in
Jordan, which defined equity in terms of access for male and female students. (For more
information, see appendix D on equity and inclusion.)

Interviews with World Bank staff highlighted the role of student financial support—
such as scholarships and subsidized student loans—in reducing financial barriers to
access and progression in higher education studies. As shown in table 4.4, the portfolio
evidence shows that almost one in every two of the World Bank’s core projects that
addressed access, retention, and equity included direct support for student financial aid
in countries across the World Bank Regions (in Mexico, Colombia, Tanzania,
Mozambique, Uganda, Malawi, Nepal, India, Pakistan, and Cambodia). Even when the
World Bank was not directly involved in providing student-targeted scholarships,
country case studies show that there was considerable indirect support to student
finance through technical assistance and advisory work (as in Chile, Vietnam, Malawi,
Jordan). Most of this knowledge work is relatively recent.

Another important intervention to increase access to higher education has been the
expansion and improvement of physical infrastructure with an explicit focus on
accommodating growth in higher education enrollment, such as in Mozambique,
Burkina Faso, and Costa Rica. The World Bank generally channels its support through
grants to higher education institutions, based on specific proposals. Grants also
supported less academically prepared students to both enter and progress in their
studies, through preparatory and remedial courses (as in Armenia, Chile, Colombia,
Mozambique, Cambodia, and Romania).

The objectives of IFC investments in higher education are contained in various
components of project documents, such as the purpose of the investment and the
expected development impacts. The primary objective of all but two of IFC’s operations
was to increase access to education, through infrastructure (construction, expansion,
and rehabilitation), expansion into new markets, and student financing. In the vast
majority of cases, support for access focused on employment-oriented education. In the
case of student financing, several loan programs focus funding on majors (or
disciplines) demanded in the labor market.

                                         EVALUATION FINDINGS: WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT TO HIGHER EDUCATION
The rationale for IFC’s investments in higher education is the gap in access and excess
demand caused by demographic changes and the increasing numbers of secondary
graduates, particularly from middle- and lower-income households. Investments rely
on the growth of this population, limited access to subsidized education, and the
inability to pay the out-of-pocket costs.

Country case studies shed further light on World Bank interventions toward inclusion
of ethnic minorities. In Chile, grant recipients had to include pro-indigenous actions,
such as preparatory courses for indigenous students from low-quality secondary
schools. Projects also financed studies on targeting mechanisms of current programs for
scholarships. In India, grant recipient institutions had to develop an Equity Action Plan
with indicators to track progress for traditionally excluded groups that included the
establishment of book banks, special remedial classes, guidance for taking entrance
exams, counseling, communication and soft skills, preparation for job interviews, and
others. In Vietnam, the World Bank addressed ethnic minorities indirectly, through
targeting grants to universities in the highlands where these groups represent a larger
share of enrollment. However, there were no specific indicators to monitor inclusion.

The most commonly used indicators are those related to student enrollment (mostly
measuring number, rather than proportion, of students), followed by number of
graduates and completion rates, retention, and dropout rates. The use of graduation
indicators based on headcounts in the absence of a comparison with enrollment figures
may not be sufficient to indicate improved internal efficiency, as the number of
graduates may have increased due to higher rates of participation and not necessarily as
a result of progression. In terms of equity, the number of projects including at least one
gender-based indicator outweighed those with indicators disaggregated by
socioeconomic groups. The former are often related to the number of project
beneficiaries and, to a lesser extent, to student enrollment data disaggregated by
gender. Few projects included indicators disaggregated by ethnic minority groups.

CHAPTER 4
EVALUATION FINDINGS: WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT TO HIGHER EDUCATION
The evaluation assessed the effectiveness of the World Bank’s support for increasing
equitable access and retention from a narrow sample of closed projects as well as from
the country case studies and Project Performance Assessment Reports (PPARs). Most
investment operations had relevant efficacy ratings that were substantial or higher. Two
projects in Colombia achieved their output targets for financial aid received by students
from low-income, indigenous, and other ethnic backgrounds. Impact evaluations
showed that student financial assistance was effective in improving transition rates
from secondary to higher education, student participation, and graduation. Enrollment
and graduation outcomes for economically disadvantaged students, including greater
participation by gender and caste, also increased in Mexico, Uganda, and Nepal.
Evidence regarding the World Bank’s contribution to student retention was scarce.
However, student loans contributed to student retention and graduation in Colombia,
and competitive grants for tutoring and other programs resulted in greater first-year
retention in specific universities in Chile.

Forty-five percent of the World Bank’s investment operations (19 of 42) targeted
middle- and lower-income students. This excludes nine student loan investments with a
stated equity objective but with no mechanism or evidence to support the claim at
approval. In the case of Chile, IFC showed its equity focus using data on student
income by quintiles. IFC targeted lower socioeconomic strata by expansion into new
regions and the locations of campuses, as in IFC’s investments in Brazil. For IFC,
targeting usually relied on the profile of the student body (primarily working students)
or the affordability of the institutions. IFC projects do not generally focus on other
dimensions of equity, such as gender, ethnicity, or disability. Clients are required to
report data disaggregated by gender for the Development Outcome Tracking System.
While number of students are counted in IFC’s own monitoring system based on
clients’ reporting, the external assurance provider observed significant divergence in
the students reached indicator results as clients were using definitions that differ from
IFC’s, which were subsequently corrected to align with IFC’s definition (IFC 2016).
Except few cases with in-depth evaluation, there is little concrete evidence of the extent
to which IFC has contributed to improving employability or access for lower-income
students.

IFC has learned some lessons over time regarding private sector student financing. It
has not proven to be a successful means to improve access to higher education. Ramp-
up of lending was slow and use of facilities was low in the majority of IFC investments.
In Jordan, a lack of consumer lending culture caused difficulties for IFC’s risk-sharing
facility. Changes in government policy also affected private student loan schemes. In
the Latin America and the Caribbean Region, competition from subsidized loans
reduced the overall reach of IFC’s investments; subsequent policy changes led to
increased use. On the other hand, in a middle-income African country, the student loan,

                           EVALUATION FINDINGS: WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT TO HIGHER EDUCATION
which catered to civil servants and not lower-income students, was largely successful in
improving access.

Almost one-third of the 28 education-related DPOs focused on improving access to
higher education for disadvantaged students. Equitable, access-specific prior actions
were related to government resolutions on student financial support in Poland, Chile,
and Latvia; such actions involved enrollment policies for subsidized higher education
institutions in Pakistan and Vietnam. Overall, there is a good level of linkage among
policy areas, prior actions, and selected indicators in the DPOs supporting access. The
majority of indicators measure equity in the provision of financial aid to students.
Others measure the enrollment rates.

Teaching and Learning

Teaching and learning lie in the broader context of employability for the World Bank
Group. World Bank analysis for the East Asia and Pacific, the Latin America and the
Caribbean, and the South Asia Regions all note the strong relationship between
education and training with employment (World Bank 2003, 2012b). Currently, many
Regions identify a disconnect between the pedagogy and curriculum and the skills
needed in the workforce (World Bank 2012b). For example, employer surveys in the
East Asia and Pacific Region show poor academic skills, as demonstrated by literacy
deficiencies in Vietnam and numeracy deficiencies in Malaysia and Thailand. They also
show poor cognitive skills, such as problem solving, and noncognitive skills in
Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam (World Bank 2012b). These World Bank
technical reviews identify the importance of improving the data available to measure
quality (learning assessments) and to track employment outcomes (World Bank 2012a).

Design

There are 49 projects that identify quality or relevance of teaching and learning in the
PDOs, including 34 core and 15 noncore projects. Although teaching and learning play
an important role in projects in all Regions, they are most prevalent as project attributes
in the South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa Regions.

The World Bank Group supports teaching and learning at multiple levels, from the
ministerial level down to the institutions, faculty, and students. Grants often include
support for initiative to improve teaching. For example, Sri Lanka used institutional
block grants to improve teaching infrastructure. Indonesia and Vietnam used
competitive or semicompetitive institutional grants to improve academic programs.
Grant recipients developed proposals to improve the quality of teaching through a
variety of interventions. Although the World Bank supervised the grants, there is little
evidence that it provided support or direction to project staff or beneficiaries in the form


                                                                                          43

of evidence on “what works” in higher education pedagogy. The Implementation
Completion and Results Report ratings for these projects typically rate the design of
most teaching and learning components as substantial. However, it is also not possible
to rate teaching and learning outcomes due to the composition of the project’s PDO.

Teaching and learning activities concentrate on improving the research and learning
environment. Typical indicators include improving student learning outcomes and
performance, and creating student and faculty self-assessments and evaluations related
to teaching and learning. They also include teaching and learning innovations in
institutional reform, infrastructure development, and sustainable financing. Other
means of supporting teaching and learning involve improving faculty qualifications,
improving curriculum, and creating quality assurance mechanisms. Indicators for
quality assurance include establishing and expanding accreditation and quality
assurance programs at the university and program level and, to a much lesser extent,
establishing national coordinating bodies and frameworks on quality. At times,
teaching and learning are also coordinated with improving research (see table 4.5).

Implementation and Results

PPAR analysis reveals that the majority of teaching and learning activities intended to
increase employability, which is in accordance with regional strategies. For example, in
Chile the World Bank’s support concentrates on improving curriculum with specific
outputs such as adult training, technical and professional education, and vocational
pathways. In India, projects tied to employability to teaching and learning outputs such
as the provision of equipment and labs, upgrading faculty qualifications, and
curriculum linked to the labor market.

IEG reviews show that even well-designed teaching and learning interventions do not
always lead to successful outcomes, often due to measuring issues. For example, in
Jordan, Yemen, and the Arab Republic of Egypt, project design articulated clear input,
process, and output indicators but failed to articulate outcomes. In other words, there is
no evidence of student outcomes in either increased learning or better preparation for
the labor market. On the other hand, a project in Vietnam that conducted teaching and

                           EVALUATION FINDINGS: WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT TO HIGHER EDUCATION
learning activities—such as upgrading faculty qualifications—used tracer studies to
track student employability outcomes. That is the type of approach required to be able
to demonstrate whether teaching and learning activities related to employability
contribute to actual employability.

THE SECOND MISSION
Higher education around the world seeks to provide research and development as one
of its primary missions. Research and development contributes to the World Bank’s
twin goals of ending extreme poverty and shared prosperity. World Bank strategies,
particularly in the Latin America and the Caribbean and East Asia and Pacific Regions,
identify research as critical to advancing the knowledge economy, increasing
competitiveness, and fostering innovation. In particular, these strategies note that
research and development with a strong emphasis on science and technology within
universities plays an integral role in training the professional and highly skilled
workers needed to advance technological capability and innovation (World Bank 2002,
2003, 2012).

More recent higher education investments prioritized science and technology. For
example, in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela in the late 1990s and early 2000s the
World Bank provided support the Millennium Science Initiative (World Bank 2002).
Beyond science and technology, research also can encourage entrepreneurship in higher
education; give rise to university incubators, which leads to innovation; and create
university and private sector and industry partnerships (World Bank 2012).

Program Design

The World Bank’s higher education portfolio on improving the quality and relevance of
research are in 16 core projects and 6 noncore projects. World Bank higher education
investments usually knit some element of research into the PDOs. Of the World Bank
higher education projects, only Vietnam, Indonesia, and Kazakhstan were stand-alone
research projects. There are few research-oriented projects in the East and Central Asia
and Middle East and North Africa Regions, while in the other Regions there were
between 4 to 6 projects each.

Country strategies rarely identify research as a priority, although they often implied its
importance in improving competitiveness. Of the country case studies, only Armenia
and Chile’s World Bank strategy directly identified research as a stated goal within
higher education. Higher education projects often include some element of research,
which is justified for competitiveness and economic growth. World Bank projects in
Uganda, Nigeria, Kazakhstan, and Bangladesh explicitly note research as the

 Note: R&D = research and development.

Most higher education projects with research components do not include indicators to
measure impact, as outlined in table 4.6. The most prevalent indicator is the number of
articles published in professional journals, in particular in international, peer-reviewed
journals. Although this is a common indicator of scientific production, it does not
necessarily measure broader goals of competitiveness and economic growth and may
underestimate return on investment. Indicators such as number of university-private
partnerships or funding for research may better represent broader goals and are
sometimes included in projects. Finally, research projects appear to struggle with
baseline and target data. Of the seven restructured research components, the majority of
modifications were to include baseline values or target data.

Program Implementation and Results

Competitive or semicompetitive research grants are the World Bank’s main instrument
to finance and research at the higher education level. Research grants often include
financing to educate graduate students and faculty, provide equipment, and facilitate
research partnerships. For example, Burkina Faso’s Africa Center for Excellence
included scholarships, faculty development, minor rehabilitation, provision of research
equipment and materials, and partnerships.

There is generally little focus on equity and access in research although a project in
Kazakhstan funded graduate students for research, and a project in Uruguay built on
previous lessons to create research programs in disadvantaged areas by earmarking
funding for smaller research initiatives.

Country case studies and PPARs reveal that some projects were successful in
strengthening the links between higher education and the private sector. A World Bank
project in Uganda aimed to produce more qualified graduates and better-quality
research. Its activities provided incentives to junior and senior researchers to conduct
relevant high-quality research; upgrade relevant basic science and engineering

                           EVALUATION FINDINGS: WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT TO HIGHER EDUCATION
undergraduate programs; liaise with the private sector to create technology platforms;
and provide internships in science, engineering, and business. A World Bank project in
Kazakhstan supported efforts to link research with industry and graduates with jobs by
upgrading faculty and strengthening partnerships with the private sector. Other
projects did not always facilitate activities to strengthen the relationship between
universities and the private sector. For example, Chile had active university-private
partnerships with cooperative research consortia, research teams, and postdoctoral
researchers. However, a review suggested a weak impact on research and development
and limited contribution to developing capacity in science and technology.

Some research grants addressed relevance by prioritizing areas of competitiveness,
usually in science and technology, both on national and local levels. A World Bank
project in Uruguay incorporated competitive research grants in high-priority areas as
defined through its national science and technology strategy. The World Bank project
Uganda awarded six grants among higher education researchers and industry,
including grants related to student internships in relevant firms, commercial feasibility
studies in relevant fields, and product innovation and development. However, even in
relevant areas, only two of the grants resulted in adoption of technology. Projects in
Chile, Indonesia, Uganda, and Vietnam also prioritized grants in science and
technology, with Indonesia prioritizing agriculture, technology, and natural sciences. In
Uganda, the project also prioritized a wide range of applied research fields.

THE THIRD MISSION

The evaluation notes World Bank support of the “third mission” (community
engagement) is limited. The portfolio review of projects through objectives did not
indicate any direct evidence of “the third mission.” Given the nature of World Bank
Group support, it is likely that at least some of its interventions have a community
focus. However, that focus is not explicit in project documentation at the PDO,
subobjective, component, activity, or indicator levels, making it unamenable to
systematic review.

The country cases and PPARs provide some additional insight. In Vietnam, the World
Bank provided grants to five “group 2 universities” located in the poorest regions, and
it supported a number of agricultural universities and faculties. The reporting does not
present the required level of detail to identify if the project contributed to the
community. The project’s internal ratings of these five universities were above average.
The design of the World Bank’s projects in Indonesia and Uganda make it likely that
some of the research targeted to the local level. In both cases, grants financed relevant
activities. As with Vietnam, there is no information on the contents of these research
grants or their specific contributions from a local development perspective. Likewise,


                                                                                         47

projects that focus on research in top regional universities may contribute to community
needs to improve productivity and local living standards.


Social and Economic Contributions of Higher Education
Higher education has the potential to affect a broad range of social and economic goals.
The evaluation looks at a number of select areas of interest in that regard—
employability, private sector development, and public sector development.

EMPLOYABILITY
The foreword to Education Strategy 2020 notes the need to develop a more highly skilled
workforce, particularly in middle-income countries (World Bank 2011). Persistently
high levels of youth unemployment also highlight the failure of education systems to
prepare young people with the right skills for the job market. Interviewed World Bank
staff almost universally identified competitiveness and expanding the skill base as a
rationale to support higher education, given the demand for enrollment. Interviews also
identified a number of issues and challenges, including ensuring quality and labor
market relevance. As noted in chapter 3, skills and employability represent a major
thematic emphasis in advisory services and analytics carried out during the evaluation
period, particularly from 2011 to 2016. (For more information, see appendix C on
employability).

Country-Level Findings on Employability

The evaluation’s country case studies found a widespread concern among employers
about the readiness of graduates for employment. In particular, employers expressed
concern about the low level of soft skills (in, for example, Chile, India, and Vietnam) as
well as an overly theoretical approach to learning (in, for example, Burkina Faso,
Malawi, and Vietnam). In Chile, where private institutions enroll more than 80 percent
of 1.2 million higher education students, the World Bank concentrated on improving
relevance and quality through grants. IFC worked with private providers to expand
provision of quality education. In India, the World Bank focused on improving
employability in poorer states. In Vietnam, IFC supported a foreign university to focus
on producing high-quality employable students, both to encourage students to study in
the country and to serve as a model for other private providers.

Higher education features in 5 of the 17 country program evaluations conducted by IEG
during the evaluation period. Tunisia, where youth employment is a major issue, is a
prominent example. The World Bank supported assistance to revise curricula to
improve relevance. The Tunisia country program evaluation found that the
implementation of the new system focused on current students without supporting

                              EVALUATION FINDINGS: WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT TO HIGHER EDUCATION
measures such as the provision of credit for experience. Employability-related issues are
prominent in about a quarter of 30 Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report
Reviews conducted by IEG since 2012 that identified higher education as a priority. The
evaluation’s review of 22 Country Partnership Frameworks for this evaluation revealed
that six Country Partnership Frameworks focused on employability-related areas,
specifically technical education and industry linkages.

Employability in the Higher Education Portfolio

 The World Bank addressed employability in about one-fifth of its higher education
projects (23 of 117). They were notably concentrated in the South Asia (7) and Sub-
Saharan Africa (6) Regions. About 40 percent of projects focused on science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (that is, STEM) fields. Analysis of the project appraisal
documents for core and noncore projects shows that previous in-country projects,
international experience, and knowledge products were the primary source of design.
With the exception of a core project in Burkina Faso, there is no mention of
collaboration with other World Bank Group institutions or external partners. The
provision of grants to higher education institutions was common in core projects (10 out
of 12). Grants are less common among noncore projects (4 out of 11), which tend to
emphasize the development of the policy framework through technical assistance (6 out
of 11). Most projects provide their support at the institution level. Nine (4 core and 5
noncore) of the 23 employability projects targeted disadvantaged groups, although the
targeting mechanisms are not always apparent in project documentation.

A quarter of employability projects included graduate employment rate (within six
months) as an indicator. Two projects have indicators that seek to measure graduate
employability in a relevant field of study. Other indicators include graduation rates,
student satisfaction, and employer satisfaction. Analysis of the portfolio of all core and
noncore higher education projects shows discussion of tracer studies in 26 of the 131
project appraisal documents, whereas the Implementation Completion and Results
Report only referred to tracer studies on five occasions. A tracer studies can be a
valuable measure of outcomes, although the typical World Bank project cycle means
that the project closes before the administration or analysis of surveys. However, the
development of a permanent tracer study mechanism is an important element of a
quality assurance system.

 As noted earlier, IFC support to higher education is largely associated with
infrastructure and expansion, particular concerning access. Sixty percent of IFC’s
operations support the goal of improved employability or labor market outcomes
(excluding student loans, for which the results chain is weak). Statements that
emphasize either course offerings related to areas of market demand or the


                                                                                            49
CHAPTER 4
EVALUATION FINDINGS: WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT TO HIGHER EDUCATION
employment history of graduates generally support claims of increasing employability.
IFC often invests in institutions that provide professional and technical degrees, and in
community colleges. IFC’s Education for Employment initiative is the only investment
to include soft skills as a development outcome (box 4.1).


 Box 4.1. Education for Employment

 Education for Employment is a joint IFC-Islamic Development Bank initiative focused
 on job-oriented education in the Middle East and North Africa Region. The initiative
 addresses challenges such as low enrollment in technical and vocational education,
 limited relevance of education, and outdated pedagogical methods. It promotes
 qualification frameworks, independent quality assurance, governance, and
 institutionalized job-matching processes. The investments and advisory services
 target high-priority sectors with both the potential for growth and a shortage of skills.
 Under the initiative, IFC supported (i) the creation of an information and
 communication technology Sector Skills Organization in Jordan; (ii) market-
 responsive information and communication technology training in Tunisia; (iii) a
 qualifications framework for the tourism and logistics sector in Morocco; and (iv)
 standards for the information and communication technology sector in the Egypt. IFC
 also supported student loan programs in Egypt, West Bank and Gaza, and Jordan, as
 well as investments in community colleges.

There is limited evidence on “what works” in higher education to improve
employability of graduates. Individual project success in employability, as identified
through the Technical/Engineering Quality Improvement Project in India PPAR, notes
the following: “The small numbers of postgraduate students in engineering [is] . . . a
long-term concern. In 2007–08, the [number of] Masters and PhD students had
increased by 50% and 69%. The achievements of the 127 project institutions in this
regard (587 PhD students graduating in 2007–08) is a significant break from this trend.”

Other evidence suggests less-favorable outcomes, including that contained in the
Implementation Completion and Results Report Review for the Innovation for
Competitiveness project in Mexico. “The intervention that substantially under-
performed expectations was the effort to promote hiring of doctoral and masters’
graduates as researchers in industry. Hindsight showed the demand for employees
with advanced degrees of Mexican firms was far more limited than had been expected.”

IFC projects focused on employment either (i) did not provide indicators at approval or
(ii) did not report on employment indicators. IFC recently supported two investment
clients to develop internal monitoring that provide clients with evidence of quality and

                             EVALUATION FINDINGS: WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT TO HIGHER EDUCATION
results. Two recent quasi-experimental impact evaluations found positive effects on the
employability and income of graduates of two IFC investment institutions; however,
IFC needs to do further work in this area. In Mexico, employers regarded graduates of
IFC’s client highly, and these graduates earned more than their peers who attended
private universities. In Chile, graduates of IFC’s investment client find jobs faster than
graduates of other higher education institutes.

Private Sector Development

Supporting competitiveness has long been an important element in the World Bank
Group’s strategies. Country strategies often include higher education under the pillar
that addresses competitiveness and private sector development. In addition, many
higher education institutions have become more entrepreneurial, seeking to generate
revenue and to improve relevance. Higher education’s position in increasing
employability demonstrates its role in providing education for private sector
development. For research, the cooperation between higher education and industry falls
into four broad categories (Santoro and Chakrabarti 2002): (i) research support to
industry, where firms provide seed money; (ii) cooperative research, where a university
undertakes research in collaboration with industry; (iii) knowledge transfer, where
knowledge is transferred from the university to the private sector; and (iv) technology
transfer, where technology is transferred through commercialization or similar
partnership arrangements.

An explicit focus on private sector development as an objective in World Bank projects
does not capture the full extent of World Bank Group support. First, it excludes IFC,
which has a strong private sector development focus. Much of IFC’s focus is on opening
up the education sector to private investors that will lead to increased opportunities for
higher education institutions and students. Second, a large number of World Bank
projects include “relevance” of either teaching or research or both in their PDOs. This
implies support for strengthening the private sector. Some projects explicitly
incorporate the private sector development in their design. Table 4.7 presents data on
the number of projects that include the term “relevance,” including 60 percent of all
core projects.




                                                                                           51

Considering the projects that included private sector development or competitiveness
in the PDOs, one core project (in Mexico) and several noncore projects (in Argentina,
Kazakhstan, and Uruguay) supported joint research or private sector incubators.
However, collaboration was also included in other projects, such as in Uganda. In the
latter, collaboration and private sector development were important elements even
though few PDOs directly referenced this as an objective. Other global practices
organized several projects, including a mining project in Malawi, aimed at
strengthening the private sector through higher education provision.

Private sector development is an important institutional objective for IFC. Although
none of IFC’s investments directly supported private sector development at the
economy-wide level, many served as “demonstrations” that helped to promote new
types of investments in higher education. As previously mentioned, IFC’s investment in
Vietnam played an important role in opening the higher education market to new
players. At least three advisory services (in Jordan, Mexico, and Tunisia) supported
direct links with the private sector, through qualification frameworks or studies.

Likewise, IFC had a number of financial innovations that also serve as demonstrations.
This includes developing a bond-financing mechanism in Chile, which was later
adopted in Peru and explored in Pakistan through advisory services. IFC
documentation indicates that improving capital markets is often part of the institution’s
approach in student financing investments.

Few indicators directly measure higher education’s support for private sector
development. The World Bank’s support for research includes some relevant indicators,
such as the share of research that, as previously discussed. Likewise, IEG only rates one
project (Mexico) on its contribution to the private sector with a substantial rating.

Public Sector Development
Much of the World Bank’s early support for higher education implicitly supported the
strengthening of the public sector. This built on other initiatives to strengthen
government capacity, such as the Colombo Plan and its focus on educating
professionals in all sectors. More recently, the World Bank Group has increased its focus

                                                                                               CHAPTER 4
                                       EVALUATION FINDINGS: WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT TO HIGHER EDUCATION
on public sector reform and governance to improve the impact of “hard” investments
(Santiso 2001). This is likely to require efforts to improve the education and skills of
public officials, as was incorporated in a noncore World Bank in Madagascar.

Although public sector development was rarely included in the PDOs of World Bank
projects, many investment projects included relevant activities. This primarily involves
activities that specifically target and educate public officials. (For more information, see
table 4.8 on World Bank support for public sector development.) Few projects have
indicators associated with strengthening the public sector, and where they do, the
indicators largely measure output. Only on project, in Madagascar, appears to have a
public sector development outcome indicator.

With existing data, it is not possible to identify the World Bank’s contribution to public
sector development. Noncore projects may have other outcome indicators that combine
higher education and other outputs, which makes it difficult to evaluate the particular
contribution of higher education to public sector development and governance. None of
the country cases had a direct focus on public sector development. In the case of
Malawi, there was an implicit focus on strengthening the capacity of the public sector.
This support is recent, and it is not possible to evaluate its contribution. Likewise, in
Vietnam, the World Bank supported some public administration programs.

Conclusions
Enrollment in higher education will continue to increase as incomes and secondary
enrollment numbers rise. In line with findings from a recent Independent Evaluation
Group (IEG) evaluation, the growth in enrollment needs to match the growth in
demand for an educated workforce (World Bank 2016). These two factors will put
pressure on governments to expand their support at the higher education level, placing
inevitable strain on limited fiscal resources. The growth in enrollment may place
pressure on the quality of higher education, both because of the likely reduction of
public financing per student and because of the potential for an increasing number of
unregulated private providers.

The type of support provided by the World Bank Group is broadly consistent with the
competitiveness model described in chapters 1 and 2. In middle-income countries, the
World Bank primarily supports interventions on improving student learning and the
quality of research, with a focus on improving employability. The World Bank also
concentrates on strengthening governance and, in some cases, equity.

The World Bank also plays a role in financing higher education in low-income
countries, such as Burkina Faso and Malawi and, in fragile and conflict-affected states,
such as Afghanistan and Yemen. In these countries, support focuses on improving
learning and establishing basic research capacity. Through investment projects and
knowledge products, the World Bank additionally promotes improved governance.

International Finance Corporation (IFC) support is concentrated in upper-middle-
income countries, principally in the Latin America and the Caribbean Region. That
support seeks to strengthen the private sector provision of higher education and focuses
on access. Many of IFC’s investments serve as models for others in the sector.


Recommendations
IMPORTANCE OF ALIGNING HIGHER EDUCATION WITH WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY
The World Bank Group has been proactive in a sector that is rapidly evolving and likely
to become increasingly important for the development of low- and middle-income
countries. Investing in higher education contributes to competitiveness, but it has
important distribution consequences. The World Bank Group’s twin goals and its new
country-level engagement model raise the bar in relation to the rationale for investing in

higher education, given that this investment tends to disproportionately benefit
advantaged groups.

Recommendation 1: Carry out a strategic review of the World Bank Group’s support
for higher education and make strategic choices. Through a strategic review, the
World Bank Group should reflect on its institutional mission and on the global
development agenda. Based on this review, it should design a focused approach for
higher education that takes into account country needs.

There is no single approach to preparing a strategic review. Options include the
development of a formal strategy, preparation of an ongoing series of policy papers,
and discussions to develop consensus. A strategic review requires the input from a
variety of internal and external stakeholders. The Education Global Practice’s work on
Systems Approach for Better Education Results instrument for higher education may be
an important element in the strategic review.

The strategic review should reflect what the World Bank Group understands to be its
value-added and comparative advantage to higher education. To determine this, the
World Bank needs to reflect on the following: (i) its role in providing evidence-based
solutions; (ii) the institutional mandate (the twin goals and Sustainable Development
Goals); (iii) the existing capacity and knowledge among the relevant World Bank Group
staff; (iv) the other international players’ role; and (v) specific country needs, competing
priorities, and limited financial resources. More specifically, the following should be
analyzed: (i) growing enrollment; (ii) the shifting role of higher education in the
economy; (iii) the need to improve employability; (iv) concerns about equity and the
distribution of public resources; (v) the rapid proliferation of new institutions of
variable quality; (vi) strained governance and financial sustainability; (vii) the role of
second-tier universities and community colleges; and (viii) the trade-off between higher
education benefits and equity.

LIMITED DATA ON RESULTS AND A LACK OF EVIDENCE
The World Bank Group is committed to using evidence to develop solutions. This is
clearly reflected in the World Bank Group’s strategy and is a key principle of the World
Bank Group’s education strategy (World Bank 2011; World Bank Group 2013). The
World Bank should strengthen its evidence base for interventions in higher education.
Higher education’s heavy reliance on grants appears to complicate many aspects of
monitoring and evaluation. World Bank projects do not offer robust evidence for why
the World Bank chose the selected model. Likewise, there is little guidance on what
interventions work. Indicators are often based on headcounts that provide little insight
into improvements from baseline measures. There is rarely collection of data from
treatment and comparison groups as well as from external factors that can influence

                                                          CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
outcomes, so as to be able to carry out rigorous impact evaluations. For policy advice
not amenable to quantitative analysis, qualitative methods that could justify the
intervention do not seem to be used.

    Recommendation 2: Improve the quality of results indicators, ensure their
     adequate measurement, and further build and draw on the evidence base for
     higher education in both World Bank and IFC investments. The World Bank
     Group should design improved monitoring instruments and define new
     indicators to capture the desired outcomes. The World Bank Group should
     develop an evidence base of what works in higher education and should support
     rigorous case studies and impact evaluations to understand what interventions
     are effective and how they can be replicated. Projects should also more clearly
     show what evidence they are based on and identify gaps.

WEAK LINKAGES WITH EMPLOYERS
The evaluation showed that while employability and competitiveness are major themes
in the World Bank Group support, the connection with the private sector could be
stronger. Many World Bank projects have created linkages between higher education
and the private sector to develop relevant research. However, there is less evidence of
collaboration to leverage the private sector in the governance issues such as promoting
increased autonomy and contributing to quality assurance systems. The World Bank
could also use industry and employers to improve the quality and relevance of teaching
and learning including curriculum design. This sort of collaboration goes beyond
employers discussing the weakness of their employees and focuses more on ensuring
that the private sector has a voice in the higher education system.

    Recommendation 3: Increase the participation of employers in and the
     integration of employers’ perspectives into World Bank and IFC investments.
     The World Bank can promote the integration of employer and private sector
     groups in higher education reforms, for example, through participation in
     independent accreditation institutions and university governance bodies. Both
     the World Bank and IFC could promote more collaboration between the
     employers and higher education institutions in preparing grants to improve
     learning and in developing curricula reform.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREATER INTERNAL COORDINATION
There is a high level of internal communication, collaboration, and coordination within
the Education Global Practice and between the Education Global Practice and IFC.
However, coordination is not strong among the global practices. It appears that only
some noncore projects have a team member from the Education Global Practice.




                                                                                         57
CHAPTER 5
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
   Recommendation 4: Develop stronger coordination among global practices.
    This may include the establishment of formal and informal mechanisms to
    facilitate dialogue and allow the Education Global Practice to engage better with
    other units. This could potentially include participation of World Bank Group
    higher education specialists in more noncore projects.

Creating incentives to encourage collaboration across global practices is a major
challenge throughout the World Bank Group. Although COREHEG has a significant
number of members from other global practices, collaboration requires a different set of
incentives. Within the Education Global Practice, Reimbursable Advisory Services
constitute a major contributor to the work plan. This service may be able to support
other global practices in a similar fashion.

A COMPLICATED EXTERNAL LANDSCAPE OF SUPPORT FOR HIGHER EDUCATION
The World Bank Group is one of the largest financiers of development assistance for
higher education and a leader in providing policy support. Many traditional donors are
reengaging after limited participation. However, nontraditional donors play a major
role, providing scholarships, equipment, research networks, and even policy support.
External coordination presents a major challenge: The World Bank and other related
nontraditional donors need to improve their channels of communication and
coordination, considering they often provide similar support.

   Recommendation 5: Develop a more comprehensive understanding of external
    financing for higher education. Identify more thoroughly the landscape of public
    and private organizations that provide financing of higher education and analyze
    areas of overlap as well as possible collaboration. As appropriate, the World Bank
    can establish a convening role to improve coordination among donor
    organizations and other international partners involved in higher education.

Recently, the World Bank has been exploring contacts with a spectrum of financiers at
the institutional and project level. Although these contacts are nascent, they may serve
as a model for further engagement.

Appendix A. Evaluation Design and Methodology
Objectives and Evaluation Questions
OBJECTIVES

1.     The evaluation aims to understand the design of the World Bank Group’s
support for higher education and its contribution to the World Bank Group’s objectives.
The evaluation seeks to provide clarity on the complementary and sometimes
competing objectives for higher education that inform the World Bank Group’s support
and to identify areas in which a coherent vision is lacking. It attempts to discern the
underlying rationale behind the World Bank Group’s support for higher education,
what strategies have worked to address the challenges for higher education in
developing countries, and how the World Bank Group might improve its capacity to
learn from its experience with higher education. This includes the range of strategies
pursued in interventions from improving teaching and research, to addressing
governance issues, to promoting autonomy, to bolstering capacity in quality
assurance—interventions that are expected to support inclusive economic growth, jobs,
and competitiveness. It examines how the World Bank Group combines these types of
interventions at the country level. The evaluation identifies lessons based on the World
Bank Group’s recent experiences that can inform future support for higher education.

EVALUATION QUESTIONS

2.     The evaluation’s overarching question is, “How has the World Bank Group’s
support to higher education contributed to its twin goals of poverty reduction and
shared prosperity?” To address this subject, the evaluation is divided into three
questions and 13 subquestions. Each of the evaluation questions was designed with
three criteria: (i) the question should serve the evaluation’s purposes and objectives, (ii)
a viable methodology should be available to answer it, and (iii) the question should not
be merely descriptive. Although the evaluation does have an accountability function, it
will not rate the efficacy or relevance of the World Bank Group’s overall higher
education program.

3.     The first evaluation question asks, “Is the World Bank Group’s support for
higher education consistent and well-articulated?” This question focuses on the logic
behind the World Bank Group’s strategies in higher education. It aims to understand
whether the World Bank Group’s approach to higher education is internally coherent
and in line with established policy approaches. Likewise, it focuses how the World
Bank Group generates and applies evidence and lessons, and how the World Bank

EVALUATION DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Group works in partnership with other actors. This question is divided into four
subquestions:

        How has the World Bank Group incorporated higher education in its strategic
         documents?
        How does it coordinate its support for higher education internally within the
         World Bank Group?
        How does it coordinate its support for higher education with external
         development partners and nongovernment actors?
        How does it conceptualize higher education and incorporate local context into
         the design of its operations?

4.     The second evaluation question asks, “How has World Bank Group support
contributed to higher education systems?” This question focuses on the linkages
between the design of the World Bank Group’s operations and outcomes affecting
higher education systems. The evaluation analyzes its support that contributes to the
reform of higher education institutions and systems. The evaluation addresses this line
of inquiry through four subquestions:

        How has the World Bank Group contributed to changes in the financial
         sustainability and management of higher education systems?
        How has its support strengthened the connection between higher education and
         both the public and private sectors?
        How has it supported regulation and quality assurance in public and private
         universities?
        How has its support contributed to internal efficiency in higher education?

5.     The third evaluation question asks, “How has the World Bank Group’s support
for higher education contributed to social and economic outcomes?” This question
focuses on the linkages between the design of the World Bank Group’s operations and
outcomes affecting society and the economy. The question identifies how the World
Bank Group’s support has addressed vulnerable groups and improved opportunities
for women. The evaluation question has five subquestions:

        How has World Bank Group support improved access and equity for lower-
         income households?
        How has its support addressed gender and other traditionally excluded groups
         in higher education?
        How has its support contributed to external efficiency through developing skills
         and improving the employability of graduates?
        How has its support contributed to external efficiency through private sector
         development and increased industry competiveness?

                                                               EVALUATION DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY

Evaluation Universe, Scope, and Limitations

 Box A.1. The World Bank Group’s Definition of Higher Education
 The World Bank Group defines its support for higher, or tertiary, education under the
 Sector Definition Guidelines of Operations Policy and Country Services as “efforts to
 improve the teaching and research capacity of degree-granting educational institutions
 that support students beyond the secondary school level, specifically colleges, universities,
 graduate schools, and professional schools.” This captures the dual objective of improving
 teaching and improving research capacity. The definition excludes nondegree technical
 and vocational programs and dedicated research institutions that are not under the
 jurisdiction of education authorities.
 This broadly corresponds to levels 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the International Standard Classification
 of Education, which includes short-cycle tertiary, undergraduate, and graduate
 professional education. Tertiary education builds on secondary education by providing
 learning activities in specialized fields of study. Learning is at a high level of complexity
 and specialization.

6.      The evaluation covers the period from FY03 to FY16. The portfolio review
included all World Bank Group investments and knowledge work approved between
July 1, 2003, and April 30, 2016. Inclusion is based on the approval date, not the date of
effectiveness. Tables A.1, A.2, and A.3 report the included interventions.

7.       The evaluation universe broadly corresponds to categories 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the
International Standard Classification of Education (UNESCO 2015). It included teacher
training carried out through a degree program as well as diploma programs offered at
community colleges. The evaluation primarily used the World Bank classification of
operations to define the evaluation universe. For public sector projects, the initial
screening was conducted for the projects that are classified to the tertiary education (ET)
sector or to the education for the knowledge economy (theme 66). The evaluation team
inspected all of these projects and included those that had a clear and direct focus on
the higher education. This included projects that made a direct reference to universities,
higher education students, or the higher education sector, particularly in the description
of project activities or indicators. The evaluation uses the term higher education because
it is the one most commonly used by policy makers and in the majority of the projects
included in this portfolio review. This avoids confusion, given the long list of terms,
including tertiary education, higher education, postsecondary education, and third-
level education, that generally describe the same type of intervention.


                                                                                                  61
APPENDIX A
EVALUATION DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
8.     Once the universe of the higher education projects for this evaluation was
identified, the projects were divided into two categories: core and noncore projects.
Core projects refer to projects the primary function of which is to support higher
education. This includes stand-alone higher education projects and projects that have a
substantial focus on the higher education sector. Noncore projects refer to those that
had a higher education component or activity but that were not primarily focused on
higher education. 10F




9.    Based on this methodology, the evaluation acknowledges that the approach may
exclude projects that supported higher education and were not so classified by the
World Bank (false negative). It also excluded projects that are notionally mapped to
higher education but have no clear relationship to the sector in their design or
monitoring and evaluation framework.

10.     The International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) portfolio included all investments
and advisory service operations that were classified as colleges, universities, and
professional schools. This was followed by an inspection to ensure appropriateness for
inclusion in the portfolio.

11.    The evaluation reviewed World Bank’s knowledge work as identified by its
operations database. It appears that several important pieces of work were excluded
from the database. These include some work that was supported as Reimbursable
Advisory Services (that is, partially or wholly financed by the beneficiary country) as well
as some financed by trust funds (that is, with support from a development partner).

12.    The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) evaluation on youth employment
provides insight on alternative forms of postsecondary education (World Bank 2012) as
does IEG’s evaluation on jobs and competitiveness (World Bank 2016a). There are
several interventions that the evaluation did not analyze, including

        other types of postbasic and postsecondary education, including nondegree
         technical and vocational training programs at the secondary and postsecondary
         level, typically classified as 4 in the International Standard Classification of
         Education (UNESCO 2015); and
        nondegree adult education, such as “second-chance” learning or lifelong
         learning initiatives.


1Current World Bank practices requires that a task team indicate the share of each sector
classification, in the project, ranging from 1 percent to 100 percent. Most of the projects
classified ET greater than 50 percent were categorized as core projects, whereas the projects
classified ET less than 50 percent became, with a few exceptions, noncore projects.

13.     In addition, the evaluation did not focus on higher-level objectives or impacts
that are beyond the immediate influence of the World Bank Group’s operations. This
reflects the difficulty in establishing causality and the paucity of data. Specifically, the
evaluation did attempt to quantify directly

         impacts on broad education outcomes, such as the average level of education; or
         direct impacts on broad economic outcomes, such as employment rates,
          productivity, poverty reduction, and economic growth.

Approach and Methodology
14.    The evaluation used a variety of methods to develop an understanding of the
World Bank Group’s support for higher education. The evaluation triangulated
qualitative and quantitative data to understand how the World Bank Group’s support
for higher education works. Figure A.1 presents a conceptual model for World Bank
Group support and the evaluation’s approach.

15.   The evaluation aimed to provide qualitative answers to the evaluation questions
to develop a better understanding of the World Bank Group’s contribution to higher
education. The evaluation did not attempt to rate or grade the World Bank Group’s
performance against any particular question and thus reports on existing self-
evaluation and IEG ratings of World Bank Group operations.

EXTERNAL DATA

16.    Review of academic and policy literature. The evaluation reviewed the existing
academic and policy literature to provide a better understanding of current thinking
about the sector. It was complemented by a number of technical literature reviews that
focused on specific areas.

EVALUATION DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
17.    Consultation with country higher education stakeholders and key informants.
The evaluation team consulted with higher education leaders at the country level to
identify key issues in the sector, including government officials, university
administrators and staff, students, private sector actors, and nongovernmental
organizations. The evaluation team held consultations and reviewed literature to
understand higher education priorities. Through consultations with stakeholders in
France, Malawi, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and
through country case studies and other interviews, the evaluation team developed an
analysis of the state of thinking on higher education.

18.    Data. Secondary data played a major role in the evaluation. The evaluation did
not produce any primary quantitative data. Secondary data came primarily from the
World Bank’s World Development Indicators (World Bank 2016) and from the World
Bank’s results frameworks and IFC’s investment database. The evaluation also used
data in its country cases from the World Bank Group and other sources, including
governments and universities.

WORLD BANK GROUP DATA

19.    Analysis of the public sector portfolio. The portfolio analysis examined project
documents and evaluations: Implementation Completion and Results Reports,
Implementation Completion and Results Reports Reviews, and Project Performance
Assessment Reports. This included both a description of the portfolio and analysis of
individual operations as well as a review of the lessons reported by the World Bank
Group in both project and evaluation documents. The initial screening used data from
FY03 to FY14, downloaded on December 1, 2014. This was later supplemented by
operations approved between July 1, 2014, and April 30, 2016.

20.    The portfolio analysis classified the public sector portfolio into a variety of
categories. The World Bank portfolio analysis identified the projects’ beneficiaries
(including institutional level, faculty level, students, public officials, and higher
education agencies) and if any disadvantaged groups were specifically targeted. Each
project objective was classified according to its contribution to broader social and
economic objectives, if any, and its specific sector objectives, which refers to the goals
that are specific to higher education. Likewise, the evaluation coded each activity
according to its contribution to a specific set of sector objectives. Given their design,
most projects had multiple classifications because they supported various objective
areas and focused on multiple goals. The evaluation also classified projects according to
the type of instrument or intervention that used and the specific approaches for each
activity. Table A.4 outlines the categories for projects’ broad objectives, sector
objectives, and type of support.

21.   Analysis of the private sector portfolio. A standard quantitative portfolio
review was conducted of IFC’s higher education portfolio detailing the number of new
investment projects committed between FY03 and April 30, 2016 and the volume of
investments committed. A similar review was conducted for the number and
expenditure of IFC advisory services approved between FY05 and May 30, 2066.

22.    The private sector qualitative portfolio review consisted of analysis of IFC
documentation (Board reports, investment review memoranda, credit risk ratings,
Development Outcome Tracking System indicators, Expanded Project Supervision
Reports, and evaluation notes). A protocol was developed to capture salient aspects of
IFC’s higher education portfolio, including the extent to which IFC ensured key
strategic priorities up-front (for example, focus on lower-income groups) and the
project’s intended development impact. As far as possible, the IFC review paralleled the
World Bank review while maintaining its intention to capture all IFC-specific expected
development impacts (capital market development).

23.    Review of the World Bank Group’s strategies. The evaluation analyzed
corporate, sector, and country strategies as well as associated documents, such as
Systematic Country Diagnostics. A total of 92 Country Assistance Strategy Completion
Report Reviews completed between FY12 and FY16 were screened to identify higher
education as a priority issue based on relevant keywords. The evaluation analyzed
specific areas of the World Bank Group support based on the description of the pillars
and objectives of the country strategies. Likewise, the evaluation reviewed and
analyzed the 22 completed pairs of Systematic Country Diagnostics /Country
Partnership Frameworks based on the description of the pillars and objectives
pertaining to higher education.

APPENDIX A
EVALUATION DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
24.    Review of World Bank knowledge work. The evaluation identified the relevant
portfolio of higher education analytical and advisory work during the evaluation period
2003–2016. Portfolio identification was based on the higher education sector and the
education for the knowledge economy theme, resulting in a total of 87 knowledge
products. The evaluation reviewed the portfolio of knowledge products based on a
description of their development objectives.

COUNTRY CASE STUDIES

25.    The country case studies were selected as a purposeful sample to cover the
diversity of support the World Bank Group provides and the diversity of country
contexts where it supports higher education. Therefore, selected countries were not
intended to be a random sample of beneficiary countries or of World Bank Group
interventions. The unit of observation was the World Bank Group’s country program in
higher education, that is, the portfolio of public and private investments in the country,
the World Bank Group’s knowledge work, and its advisory services. The country case
studies included collection of data and interviews with government officials,
beneficiaries, and local stakeholders.

Selection of Country Cases

26.   Countries were classified according to two primary criteria based on World Bank
support to ensure a mix of different types of country interventions. The primary criteria
included the following:
        The public and private sector mix of World Bank Group support for higher
         education. Support is provided through both the public sector window—
         primarily from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
         (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA)—and the private
         sector window primarily from IFC. The first category consists of countries in
         which the World Bank Group has only provided support through its public
         sector window (IBRD and IDA). The second category is for countries that receive
         IFC support, either alone or in conjunction with public sector support. For a
         country to be included, it must have either a core higher education World Bank
         project or an IFC project.
        The continuity of the World Bank Group’s support for higher education. In
         some countries, the World Bank Group has long provided support for higher
         education, and the investment represents part of a long-term engagement with
         the sector. In other cases, this support is more recent. For purposes of the
         evaluation, the cutoff date is 2005. When the World Bank has an engagement in
         higher education from 1995 to 2005, the World Bank Group country portfolio will
         be classified as having a continuous engagement. Otherwise, it will be classified as
         having a recent engagement in higher education.

secondary criteria based on country characteristics:




                                                                                                                         77

EVALUATION DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
        Enrollment in higher education. The evaluation divided countries according to
         the size of the higher education sector, measured by the average gross
         enrollment rate for tertiary education in the period 2002–12 available from the
         World Bank Group’s education statistics database (EdStats).
        Share of private enrollment in higher education. Countries were also classified
         according to the share of private higher education in total higher education
         enrollment. As before, the source of the data is EdStats for the period 2002–12.

26.    After mapping countries according to primary and secondary criteria, the final
selection of prioritized candidates was based on regional diversity, number of projects,
and estimated mission budgets, resulting in a sample of seven country case studies.

Country Cases Implementation

27.    Of the seven countries originally chosen as country case studies, the evaluation
team was able to visit five (Armenia, Chile, Jordan, Malawi, and Vietnam). The
evaluation team carried out the India case study as a desk study due to administrative
limitations in visiting the country. Given the availability of data and the support from
the World Bank’s Country Office, the India country case study is equivalent to the
studies carried out in the field. Due to security concerns, the proposed mission to
Burkina Faso was canceled. A local consultant was hired to carry out a partial
assessment of the World Bank’s support for higher education. Given the time constraint
and unexpected change in plans, the country case study for Burkina Faso is not
complete and is used as appropriate.

28.     Although the results of the country case studies are confidential, the evaluation
has summarized the findings and developed a selection of tables. The draft instrument
is also available, and the team can provide additional tables.

1.     Country case studies are an important input in understanding the World Bank
Group’s support for higher education. They use a combination of quantitative and
qualitative data to study the country context and the contributions of World Bank
Group’s support for higher education in the country. The evaluation team selected
specific country case studies based on criteria to serve as a purposeful sample of the
World Bank Group’s support for higher education. The country case studies include
Armenia, Burkina Faso, 2 Chile, India, Jordan, Malawi, and Vietnam.

Systems and Major Challenges
ARMENIA

2.     Higher education in Armenia was first organized under the Soviet system, which
traditionally separated teaching and research. Today, higher education institutions have
begun to integrate teaching and research but the Academy of Science still remains the
country’s premiere research institute. Higher education comprises both public and
private universities. Currently, there are 67 public and private universities, including
roughly twice as many private universities than public universities. Public universities
are better regarded in quality and some private universities are questioned as having
poor quality. Roughly 75 percent of the private universities and 80 percent of the public
universities are located in the capital city Yerevan, and the remaining institutions are in
the provinces. Both higher education institutions and the number of students enrolled
have decreased over time, partly due to a declining population.

3.     Higher education is associated with low public expenditures. Universities are
financially autonomous, and governing councils submit budget projections for state
funds to the central government and have discretion over nonstate funds. Students bear
the burden of their education through tuition. Only merit-based scholarships are
available to students, and student loans are provided only by the commercial sector.

4.     Challenges in the sector include insufficient public financing of higher education,
lack of access for all students, including poor access for women to nontraditional fields,
lack of relevance of employable and relevant skills, lack of capacity in the areas of
quality assurance and evaluation, poor quality of teaching and research, poor linkages
with the private sector, and low relevance of research. The Bologna Process has

encouraged the Armenian higher education system to harmonize quality assurance
such as accreditation and certification processes with that of the rest of Europe through
the Armenian National Quality Assurance Agency.

5.     The World Bank Group has supported higher education in Armenia through
investments supporting competitive grants, one development policy operation, and
knowledge work over the years. There are no stand-alone higher education projects,
and higher education is provided as an additional component to education or health
projects. Nevertheless, higher education is important and has focused in the areas of
improving access to and quality and relevance of higher education. Projects, through
competitive funds, have focused on research, including promoting skills and
employability in competitive sectors, private sector development, and university and
industry linkages to increase competitiveness.

6.      Projects have resulted in the establishment of national institutions to support
quality such as a national agency for quality assurance, a national agency for education
management, and separate national agencies for assessments and curriculum. Support
for strengthening existing institutions through the competitive grants program has
improved the quality, relevance, and efficiency of higher education institutions by
providing skills development for students, improving quality and relevance of teaching
and research, and facilitating linkages with industry. Knowledge work in higher
education has prioritized reforms in governance; access, including equity;
strengthening quality; and strengthening higher education support in the
pharmaceutical sector. The World Bank’s competitive grants program has contributed
to institutional financial sustainability but has been critiqued for lack of attention
toward corruption.

CHILE

7.     There are three types of higher education institutions in Chile: universities,
professional institutes, and technical vocational centers. The latter offers technical
degree programs for shorter durations. The 1980s education reform led to an enormous
proliferation of private providers in a largely unregulated system. The most prominent
“traditional” universities belong to the Council of Rectors, known as CRUCH. These
institutions play a central role in the higher education systems and operate under a
different set of regulations. Currently, there are a total of 162 higher education
institutions, of which there are 16 public and 9 private CRUCH universities.

8.     Although most higher education institutions are autonomous, only about half of
them are accredited. In 2005, the government passed the Quality Assurance Law, which
created the National Accreditation Commission and aimed to consolidate the
accreditation process. This led to an increase in universities seeking accreditation.
Accreditation is on a voluntary basis except for medicine and education programs.

9.      Public expenditure for higher education has increased substantially over the past
decade, as shown in figure B.1. Despite these trends, higher education is highly
dependent on tuition and fees—over two-thirds of total revenue comes from tuition and
fees at the undergraduate and postgraduate level. The government finances higher
education through student aid (59 percent), block grants to institutions (22 percent), and
grants for science and technology (19 percent). About 50 percent of students receive
some form of student aid through student scholarships or loans. There are 12 types of
scholarships available for both public and private university students. Most of them
target academically performing students from lower socioeconomic groups. On
average, public funds account for about 10 percent of revenues. However, public funds
for CRUCH universities account for more than one-fifth of total revenues. Accordingly,
both public and private CRUCH universities depend substantially less on tuitions and
fees. CRUCH universities benefit because they are allocated resources based on historic
budget. This contributes to inequity in the higher education system as these institutions
tend to be the best in the country.

10.     From 2003 to 2013, enrollment rates almost doubled, from 43 percent to 79
percent. The proliferation of private higher education institutions along with the
expansion of student scholarships and state-guaranteed loans transformed higher
education from an elite into a mass system in the 1980s. Despite the rapid increase in
higher education participation in recent years, low-income students continue to be less
likely to enroll in higher education than those from the high-income backgrounds.

11.    As the system shifts from an elite higher education system to a mass system,
student retention has become an important issue. The system has absorbed a higher
proportion of vulnerable students who are more like to drop out because they are less
prepared to cope with university studies and take longer to graduate because of
expenses associated with university. Students with exam scores close to the threshold
for admission are less likely to successfully complete first semester courses, calling for
the need to create remedial courses to improve their performance.

INDIA

12.    India’s higher education system is the third largest in the world, after the United
States and China. The system comprises more than 30,000 higher education institutions,
such as universities and colleges (FICCI Higher Education Summit 2014; Stolarick 2014).
As a result, the government is not able to regulate, monitor, and accredit all the
institutions. Many institutions are too small to have a critical mass of students or
qualified faculty to offer good-quality education. Some of the lowest-quality education

                                                                      COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
comes from private institutions. However, the system also contains four to six “world-
class” institutions, based on international rankings (FICCI Higher Education Summit
2014).

13.    The gross enrollment rate in higher education increased from 15 percent to just
over 20 percent between 2010 and 2012 (Stolarick 2014). There is significant variation
across states and union territories in India, ranging from 2.3 percent (Daman and Diu)
to 47.9 percent (Delhi Capital Territory). Enrollment is further complicated by disparity
based on geographic location, gender, caste, or tribe. Scholarships constitute a small
percentage of the budget for higher education. Significant efforts are needed to achieve
the government’s goal of increasing the average enrollment rate to 25 percent by 2020.

14.     The system is highly centralized, with institutions having limited autonomy to
govern and manage without interference by state or central governments. In response,
the World Bank has designed specific leverages to make systemic changes at the state
level. For example, through World Bank support of second-tier technical and
engineering universities (rather than the top tier), the World Bank introduced eligibility
criteria for state and institutional autonomy and emphasized a changing role for
government from directly administrating institutions to shaping and monitoring
institutional performance.

15.    There has been consistent support from the World Bank directed to technical and
engineering higher education institutions throughout the country with three loans
spread over more than a decade. (The third operation is currently being prepared.)
Lessons have been applied within each operation, but central issues of governance,
autonomy, and quality continue to be addressed across all loans. With direction
provided by the latest country partnership strategy, the World Bank is much more
focused on low-income states and its higher education portfolio is now directed to state
loans and analytical work (such as Madhya Pradesh and Odisha), in addition to
national projects. These two state directed loans provide both general and technical
higher education, which is a change from the previous concentration on technical.

16.    Higher education loans have also addressed persistent challenges, such as
supporting higher education institutions to attain accreditation, including conditions to
improve institutional performance; improving postgraduate education; supporting
faculty development; and increasing the number of postgraduate students. Industrial
linkages between private sector and institutions have also been emphasized. The
International Finance Corporation (IFC) no longer provides support for higher
education in India.

APPENDIX B
COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
JORDAN

17.    Jordan places significant value on higher education. There are 28 universities—10
public and 18 private—offering higher diplomas, bachelor’s degrees, master’s degrees,
and doctorates. There are also 50 community colleges: 29 public and 21 private. Public
universities account for 68 percent of total enrollment. The ratio of university to
community college students is 6 to 1 (see figure B.2).

18.    Growth in higher education is driven by increases in secondary school
completion and new “parallel programs” in public universities. Declining government
transfers, rapidly increasing student enrollments, and caps on raising student fees
prompted universities to introduce parallel fee-paying programs in the late 1990s. The
parallel program was designed to solve the problem has, however, created its own
problems. It allows students with lower grades on the entrance examination (the
Tawjihi) to enter certain programs by paying a higher tuition fee. The parallel tuition fee
system is inherently regressive, as students from advantaged socioeconomic
backgrounds tend to receive better schooling and do better academically.

19.    Jordan’s higher education system faces many challenges. Enrollment in tertiary
education has steadily increased over the past two decades (see figure B.3). High gross
enrollment rates (47 percent, higher than the regional average) have made it
increasingly difficult to maintain the quality of education at public universities. Private
universities can absorb some excess demand; however, they receive no public subsidies,
and private university enrollment is capped at 8,000 students. Combined with declining
public financing for higher education, subsequent increases in tuition fees, and the
absence of significant student aid schemes, universities are financially strained, and
higher education is out of reach for the poorest Jordanians.

20.   Universities have not been able to adapt and respond quickly to the emerging
needs of the economy given the rigid governance system. Furthermore, lack of
university autonomy is hindering innovation. This has contributed to high
unemployment of university graduates. Community colleges have strayed from their
mandate and become a “bridge” to a university education instead of institutions that
provide the technical needs of the labor market.

21.     The World Bank Group’s vision for Jordan’s higher education system is in line
with the country’s Human Resources Development Committee, which is intended to
address issues surrounding employability. The committee is focusing on technical and
vocational education. The World Bank has engaged in higher education with a project
already under implementation and with technical assistance. The World Bank’s
assistance was relevant to the needs of the sector; however, little progress was made in
improving the quality and relevance of education (especially in community college
education’s relevance to the labor market), governance, and student financing. IFC’s
portfolio is highly aligned with the needs of Jordan’s education system. IFC made one
investment and had one advisory service project under the Education for Employment
initiative, but it is too soon to judge the outcomes of these activities.
MALAWI

22.    Higher education in Malawi consists of the following types of institutions: (i)
university colleges, (ii) teacher training colleges for primary school teachers, and (iii)
technical colleges. Traditionally, Malawi’s higher education system has been
predominantly public. There are currently four public universities including the
University of Malawi, which is the largest higher education institution and consists of
four colleges.

23.    The higher education subsector in Malawi is still very small. Access to higher

time, the expansion of secondary education since late 1990s has led to a growing
demand for higher education, although the completion rate of secondary education
remains very low compared with other countries. Limited access to public higher
education exacerbates the issue of equity. The lowest share of students come from the
poorest families, whereas more than 80 percent of students come from the wealthiest
quintile. Malawi’s higher education system is highly regressive in that student loans are
not needs-based and are almost never recovered, which further worsened inequities.

24.    The capacity of higher education institutions is too limited to meet this growing
demand. For example, only 3,000 out of 70,000 eligible secondary graduates were
selected for the public universities in 2015. Overall, inadequate infrastructure and
equipment has constrained access and compromised quality.

25.     As the demand for higher education increases, private universities have been
growing rapidly, particularly since the mid-2000s. The establishment of these
universities helped ease the pressure and support steep enrollment growth. However,
many of these new private higher education institutions are not accredited and raise
critical concerns about quality.

26.    Although the World Bank’s education portfolio in Malawi has mostly focused on
basic education until recent times, higher education has been explicitly included in
strategic documents and operations since 2010. The World Bank’s goals of supporting
higher education are overall consistent, aiming to increase skilled labor in key growth
areas identified in government strategy. This is congruent with the government’s
Malawi Growth Development Strategy, which recognizes the crucial role of higher
education as a key driver of competitiveness and growth. Under the most recent Skills
Development Project, the World Bank provided the support to address a wide range of
issues including access, quality, and equity. It provided performance-based grants for
major higher education institutions in Malawi, as well as technical assistance to
strengthen quality assurance systems for all public and private universities.

VIETNAM

27.   Vietnam’s higher education system was built under a socialist government,
incorporating elements from both the colonial French and the Soviet education systems.
The system was traditionally divided into three levels of school: primary, lower
secondary, and upper secondary.

28.    Before independence in 1945, there were only three universities in the country.
The system now includes numerous universities and colleges, along with technical and
vocation schools. The public system had several national universities, under the
Ministry of Education. Most public universities operated under different ministries or

under local governments. The 1986 economic reforms led to the initially unofficial
introduction of fees. Later, private education was introduced, which accounts for a
growing share of enrollment.

29.    The higher education system has grown quickly, reflecting increases in higher
education enrollment and growing household incomes. Enrollment has grown from
about 2 percent in 1991 to 25 percent in 2013. According to a recent report, half of the
budget for universities is spent on the top income quintile, and for colleges it is about a
third of the budget (see figure B.4, panels a and b.) The overall budget for higher
education has been growing steadily. Data from 2009 to 2012 (the only data available)
suggest that spending has increased to roughly 50 percent during the four-year period.
However, higher education has also grown rapidly and has to rely on fees and other
sources of financing. This has led some universities to the point of bankruptcy (World
Bank 2016).

30.     In response to a changing higher education landscape, the World Bank Group
has supported efforts to strengthen the autonomy of universities, allowing them to
experiment and respond to priorities. It has supported efforts to transform the role of
the government as a “steward” of the higher education system. World Bank support has
also financed grants to universities to promote improved learning and research.
Consistent with this vision, both the World Bank and IFC have worked to develop
innovative university models through investment and policy support. The World Bank
Group’s approach does not have a strong focus on supporting “lower-level” public and
private higher education institutions, and it has not provided much direct support to
improve equity.

Appendix C. Employability
1.     With many countries increasing their primary and secondary completion rates,
higher education represents the next significant policy challenge. More schooling is
widely considered a pathway to development, with postsecondary studies often
associated with sizable private and social benefits (McMahon 2009; Oketch, McCowen,
and Schendel 2014). However, increasing access and average attainment is the
beginning of a long-term process. One of the main challenges is ensuring that skilled
workers obtain jobs that maximize their productivity. This appendix describes available
knowledge about the skilled labor force and employability of higher education
graduates to pinpoint key areas for intervention and future research. While countries
may have specific priorities, the aim here is to identify common challenges across the
world. This appendix also acknowledges that there are many reasons for
unemployment that go beyond the scope of this evaluation.

2.     Labor force participation. Skilled individuals make up 15 percent of worldwide
labor supply (see figure C.1, panel a). However, this share varies widely across Regions.
Although the skilled workforce is only 8 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa, it is almost 20
percent in Europe and Central Asia.

Note: AFR = Sub-Saharan Africa; EAP=East Asia and Pacific; ECA = Europe and Central Asia; LAC = Latin America and the
Caribbean; MNA = Middle East and North Africa; SAR = South Asia

3.     The size of the skilled workforce has grown over time (see figure C.1, panel b).
Observed changes are largest in South Asia, Middle East and North Africa, Latin
America and the Caribbean, and Europe and Central Asia. Available data indicate small
declines in the Sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia and Pacific Regions.

4.   Using the World Bank’s income classification, we explore differences across this
dimension. Panel a of figure C.2 shows that the skilled workforce rises with income


                                                                                                                        89

level. On average, 3 percent of the labor force has a tertiary degree in low-income
countries. This fraction is five times higher for lower-middle-income countries and
almost sevenfold for high-income nations. Income levels are correlated with the growth
in the size of the skilled workforce. Although low-income and low-middle-income
countries show virtually no change, the labor force has become more educated in
general (see figure C.2, panel b).

5.      Gender inequality is more prominent in some Regions (see figure C.3, panel a).
More male graduates participate in the labor market in Sub-Saharan Africa and South
Asia, whereas the opposite is true for other Regions. More female graduates have joined
the labor force over time, denoted by rising female-male labor force participation ratios
(see figure C.3, panel b). In fact, more women with tertiary degrees are currently
attached to labor markets in all Regions except South Asia.

6.     Gender differences are smaller in lower-income countries (see figure C.4, panel
a), which also have the lowest amount of skilled labor. The most unequal nations are
upper-middle-income and non-OECD countries. For countries with available data, the
female-male ratio has risen, denoting that more women are both obtaining tertiary
degrees and joining the labor force (see figure C.4, panel b). The only exception is low-
income countries, where estimates indicate that more skilled women are active in the
labor market.

7.     We now discuss several challenges to employability: high rates of youth
unemployment and underemployment, job search duration, skills mismatch, student
preferences and major choice, quantity-quality trade-offs, and the importance of
complementarity among sectors in higher education policy.

8.      Youth unemployment and underemployment. Rising enrollment in higher education
will increase the supply of skilled labor. Since different countries value different skills,
it is imperative to align these changes with labor demand to prevent increases in
already high unemployment and underemployment rates. Previous research finds that
skilled unemployment tends to be high in some countries. Panel a of figure C.5 shows
considerable heterogeneity across Regions. Although 7.3 percent of tertiary graduates
are unemployed in Latin America and the Caribbean, this fraction is 31.3 percent in
Sub-Saharan Africa.

9.      Unemployment rates for tertiary graduates are highest in low-income countries
(see figure C.5, panel b), where almost one of every two individuals is out of work. In
comparison, all countries above middle income have unemployment rates at least four
times lower.




                                                                                                                    91

10.    Moreover, this level of unemployment is occasionally higher when compared
with that of less educated workers. Estimates of the ratio between tertiary- and
secondary-level unemployment rates in figure C.6, panel a, show that more skilled
workers are out of work in the Middle East and North Africa, East Asia and Pacific, and
South Asia Regions. The ratio between skilled and unskilled unemployment is less than
1 for higher-income countries and larger for low- and lower-middle-income nations (see
figure C.6, panel b). In these cases, unemployed tertiary graduates outnumber those
with secondary studies, likely because job seekers outnumber available skilled positions
(Drine 2012).

12.   Unemployment rates for young college graduates are higher in developing
countries (see figure C.8). In Latin America, 13.4 percent of workers ages 20–24 who
have a tertiary degree are jobless. Figure C.8 shows that unemployment is largest in
Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Colombia. Academic research has found similar rates in
China (Soo 2015), South Africa (Oluwadoju et al. 2016), and Tanzania (Ndyali 2016). In
the Middle East and North Africa Region, unemployment increases for more educated
youth (Drine 2012).

13.    A way to address skilled youth unemployment is to foster cooperation between
higher education systems and employers (Yamada 2015). A successful example is Costa
Rica, which invested in training skilled workers in the electronics industry that
attracted foreign investment from Intel (Rodríguez-Clare 2001). Intel’s impact is
currently reflected in a series of higher education programs designed to increase both
the number of graduates and their proficiency in skills valued by the firm (MIGA 2006).
The Russian Federation has also embarked on similar initiatives among firms, colleges,

leaders (figure C.9, panel a). The best performing Regions are North America and East
Asia and Pacific, while Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia lag behind. The 7th pillar
measures worker performance and the attractiveness of the country for talent (figure

may be set in place to minimize unemployment duration by designing or expanding
programs that attach graduates to the labor market. Many tertiary programs across the
world require students to complete mandatory internships or training before granting
degrees. Evidence for Germany shows that such requirements lower the probability of
lengthy unemployment spells and increase average earnings (Saniter and Siedler 2014).
Nevertheless, less evidence is available on the effectiveness of these requirements in

developing countries. It is important to evaluate whether demand-driven interventions
are sufficient to improve job matches or whether employer incentives are also
necessary. For instance, an assessment of Colombia’s recently passed Ley Projoven
would provide valuable insight into this matter.

employer surveys reveal that
noncognitive or “soft” skills are at least as            Socio-emotional         Higher-order cognitive

important in the labor market (Brunello
and Schlotter 2011; Busso et al. 2012). As
shown in figure C.11, firms actually value     Source: Table 2 in Cunningham and Villaseñor 2014.

noncognitive skills more than cognitive or
technical skills (Cunningham and Villaseñor 2014). In theory, coordinating taught skills
to desired abilities would likely increase firms’ incentives to invest in further training,
since workers’ human capital maximizes their productivity in that job and lowers the
probability of leaving.

19.     Programs that enhance the socioemotional skills of higher education graduates
may have an important place in a portfolio of educational policies (Heckman and Kautz
2012). However, only providing soft skills training is not necessarily the best way to
boost employability. Experimental evidence for Jordan shows that training programs
for female community college graduates have no employment impact (Groh et al. 2016).
Further evidence for university graduates and men is required to comprehensively
assess the effectiveness of soft skills training. An interesting direction would be to
evaluate the relative importance of cognitive and noncognitive skills in the labor
market. Results from such studies would be useful to determine any potential changes
to tertiary-level curricula to supply workers with skills desirable to employers,
mitigating the “disconnection” between labor demand and supply.

often fare well in the labor market
(Abel and Dietz 2015). Majors that are quantitatively oriented (for example, accounting,
business analytics, economics, and finance) also tend to have positive employment
outcomes. In turn, graduates in the humanities (for example, English, ethnic studies, art
history, or anthropology) are often unemployed (Drine 2012) or underemployed
(Pushkar 2016). Figure C.12 shows underemployment by field for U.S. college
graduates.

21.     The effectiveness of interventions that disclose the returns to basic education has
led to studies that replicate these campaigns at the postsecondary level to study changes
in demand and major choice (see review in Bonilla et al. 2016). Overall, these studies
find that providing information on the returns to college does not increase the demand
for higher education but has small intensive margin effects on college and major
selectivity. In other words, informed students choose better colleges and higher paid
careers. Since the demand for tertiary degrees is growing, providing useful information
at the correct time may guide individuals into certain programs that benefit each
country’s comparative advantages. However, much remains unknown about the effects
of information campaigns at the college level. More research is needed with regard to
scaling up, what information is useful, and its ideal timing.

22.    Quantity and quality of higher education supply. Given the sustained growth in
higher education demand since the turn of the century, more efficient service provision
is required. On one hand, countries where college is free will need to expand their
current service, for example, creating more sections, teacher hiring, and so on. On the
other, countries where college has high financial barriers to entry have seen a rise in
alternative (usually private) institutions. An interesting question for future research is
whether higher college demand is better served by creating more institutions or
expanding the capacity of current colleges, that is, extensive versus intensive margin
supply.

23.    Consequently, any supply-side discussion will eventually lead to a debate about
the quantity and quality of higher education. Are labor markets interested in more
college graduates or better-prepared graduates? Surely, the answer to this question is
country specific and depends on the stage of development (Castelló-Climent and
Hidalgo-Cabrillana 2012). For example, low-income countries may be interested in
increasing the size of the skilled workforce (Hanushek 2013). Countries with a sizable
skilled workforce, such as China, are more concerned with improving quality (Zhong
2011). In fact, higher-quality workers are more likely to be employed and have better
jobs (Boccansfuso, Larouche, and Trandafir 2015). It is essential for countries to assess
their current standing in the higher education process to form a long-term policy
strategy that will allow nations to guide their institutions into creating a suitable
workforce for the future.

24.    Linkage between higher education systems and employers. Throughout this appendix,
a common theme has been the necessity for cooperation between employers and higher
education systems to maximize the gains from a growing skilled workforce. The
employability of skilled workers will depend on efficient matching mechanisms
between the demand and supply of labor. Surveys that help understand what
employers want in graduates and what students seek in a job are useful tools to
construct such mechanisms. These information sources have been implemented in the
United States (Robinson, Garton, and Baughn 2007), the United Kingdom (Bridgstock
2009), Latin America (Busso et al. 2012), and East Asia (Li and Zhang 2010). The policy
scope of any intervention would involve finding middle ground between the demand
and supply of college graduates, which is no easy task. Moreover, different countries
require distinct efforts. Although some may prioritize reducing unemployment, others
may focus on reducing unemployment duration or involve industry in shaping tertiary
curricula.

Appendix D. Equity and Inclusion in Higher
Education
1.    The contribution of higher education to economic growth and development is
widely acknowledged. In addition to private market and nonmarket benefits, higher
education generates social benefits that spill over to others, including future
generations. Although higher education generates significant economic and social
externalities, access to higher education tends to be very unequal for the most
vulnerable and disadvantaged population groups. Thus, externalities as well as equity
considerations constitute a rationale for public sector support to higher education
(McMahon 2009).

2.     Higher education inequalities refer not only to equity in access (the opportunity
to participate in tertiary education), but also to equity of results (equal possibility of
progressing through and timely completing studies) and equity of outcomes (the value-
added of higher education— the chances of finding employment within a reasonable
amount of time). Since unequal labor market outcomes may be influenced by multiple
factors inside and outside the higher education system, it will be discussed in appendix
C on employability. This appendix focuses on access inequalities in higher education
across different population groups identified in the literature: low-income, women,
ethnic minorities, and people with disabilities. Secondary data sources are used to
present stylized facts and trends in higher education inequalities (Rowan-Kenyon,
Savitz-Romer, and Swan 2010).

Socioeconomic Inequalities
3.      Equity in higher education is a major challenge particularly in low- and middle-
income countries. Social, economic, and educational changes have dramatically
increased the number of students, including the substantial expansion of primary and
secondary education. Despite the extensive efforts to improve access worldwide,
tertiary education—especially the university sector—is generally accessible only to the
wealthier segments of society.

4.    Global data from Demographic and Health Surveys 3 show that inequalities in
                                                                     2F

3The Demographic and Health Surveys offer comparable data on gross attendance rate in post-secondary
education disaggregated by household income. Although this indicator is less accurate than gross
enrollment rate to measure access to higher education, both indictors are highly correlated and will be
used as a proxy for higher education participation. Between 2003 and 2014, the World Bank’s database on

rate is low (figure D.1). Disparities in attendance between the poorest and richest
quintile are particularly high in low-income countries in Sub-Sahara Africa, such as
Tanzania, Burundi, Mozambique, Madagascar, Mali, Sierra Leone, Burkina Faso, and
Liberia, where for some countries there is little or no participation from the bottom two
income quintiles. Although equity concerns in higher education is present in all
countries, it seems to be a smaller challenge in Europe and Central Asia (figure D.2). 4                                3F

5.      Figure D.3 compares the change in the first and fifth income quintiles over time
for select years when data is available. The gap in higher education participation
between the wealthiest and the poorest quintiles has widened in most countries. A
notable exception is Armenia where access has become more equal between
socioeconomic groups. Participation rates had greater increases for the bottom quintile
(6.5 to 19 percent) than for the top quintile (53 to 55.6 percent) from 2005–2010. Other
countries such as Cambodia, Côte d’Ivoire, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Ghana, Guyana,

6.     From an access perspective, the first obvious barrier for students to higher
education are the secondary education qualifications that would enable entry into
higher education institutions. To the extent poorest segments of the population have
lower chances to graduate from secondary schools, policies aiming at expanding higher
education participation (such as student aid programs) would have a limited impact on
reducing higher education inequalities (World Bank 2016). Although enrollment in
secondary education is also unequal, the level of inequity is higher at the tertiary level.
Thus, inequality at the university level is not simply driven by inequality at the
secondary level.

7.      Other factors may limit access to higher education, including parents’ education
level, cost of education, insufficient academic preparedness, low motivation, and lack of
access to information about labor market prospects from various higher education
institutions and academic programs.

8.     Inequality in access is more significant in developing countries, although even
OECD economies historically have inequality. Participation in tertiary education has
been strongly correlated with family socioeconomic status and the educational
attainment of parents. Intergenerational mobility, including family background and
parental education, play a major in determining access to higher education. A study
based on survey data from 68 developing countries shows that intergenerational
educational mobility is higher in Latin America than Asia.



                                                                                                                        103
APPENDIX D
EQUITY AND INCLUSION IN HIGHER EDUCATION
9.     Financial constraints are one of the major barriers for greater equitable access to
higher education. Education costs vary greatly across countries, from almost negligible
tuition fees in Norway to large expenses in Mexico (Figure D.4). Emphasis on cost-
sharing rules may contribute to increasing inequality because only those who can afford
to pay tuition fees have access. Since higher education is a scarce good in many low-
income contexts, with diplomas conferring positional advantage over others in society,
access inequality in higher education may result in a cycle of intergenerational
reproduction of inequalities (McMahon 2009).

10.    Financial aid programs—namely student loans and scholarships—are important
policy tools to potentially boost access and completion in tertiary education (Dynarski
2003). Despite the widespread use of student loans, there have been concerns about
their high default rates and complex rules. The selection of loan candidates, the
management of large numbers of borrowers, and the collection of loan repayments
postgraduation have proven to be burdensome. State-guaranteed loans in Chile and
zero-interest loans in Colombia are examples of well-targeted programs (Beyer et al.
2015; Melguizo, Sanchez, and Velasco 2016).

11.    Scholarships based on merit may disproportionately favor students from middle-
and high-income families, who are likely to attend tertiary education, thus worsening
disparities. Need-based scholarships, in contrast, have been found to reduce inequality
in contexts with high enrollment rates and in which financial support for higher
education is not based on high regressive taxes (McMahon 2009; Oketch 2003). If
scholarships cover only a portion of the costs of higher education—that is, partial

tuition costs and contributions for living allowances—they may be of limited use to the
poorest students.

12.     An important challenge is to identify the best combination of funding
mechanisms that could significantly contribute to greater equity in access. This will
result in greater opportunities for social and economic mobility and ultimately reduce
income inequality (Oosterbeek 1998). Evidence on the progressivity or regressivity of
public expenditure in tertiary education based on benefit incidence analyses is scarce.
Figure D.5 summarizes the main findings of available data from a reduced set of World
Bank’s public expenditure reviews. All such analyses indicate that a larger proportion
of public funds for higher education are targeted to the wealthiest groups in countries
where postsecondary education participation rates are highly unequal.

13.    Table D.1 presents a more detailed analysis of various financing instruments in
Chile. This disaggregation provides analysis on mechanisms that are more likely to
reduce income inequality (OECD and World Bank 2009). Although low-income
students are underrepresented in higher education enrollment, they receive a
disproportionate share of public resources—the poorest quarter of student population
receives 38 percent of total public subsidies. In particular, well-targeted scholarship and
loan programs are the most effective instrument to improve equity and inclusion in
higher education. The distribution of competitive grants for higher education
institutions supported by the World Bank is relatively neutral since regional

universities—which concentrate on a larger proportion of low-income students—also
benefit from these quality improvement resources. Other public funds for improving
science and technology research and indirect funding for universities are regressive
mechanisms, since they concentrate in top institutions and have the highest proportion
of students from wealthy backgrounds.

14.     Insufficient academic preparedness, associated with poor-quality secondary
education and lack of family encouragement for first-generation students also limits
access to higher education among other reasons. Even those who manage to be
admitted in a tertiary program are more likely to drop out during the first year. Higher
education systems may be faced with challenges in supporting students with basic
academic readiness when absorbing larger number of students from the lower two
quintiles of the income distribution due to expansion of higher education participation
(see figure D.6).
15.     Outreach and bridge programs between secondary education and higher
education institutions have been a global practice to expand tertiary enrollment among
disadvantaged populations. These programs are generally implemented through
school-university partnerships, which entail university staff and student volunteers that
providing mentoring and counseling support for tertiary education preparation and
planning. University partners play an important role within the school community in
molding future students’ aspirations and promoting the importance of higher education
within first-generation university students’ families. Similarly, remedial courses are
designed to help less academically prepared current higher education students succeed
in their studies. Although remedial programs tackle student dropouts due to lack of
academic preparedness, student aid programs do so due to financial constraints. These
bridge and remedial programs look very promising to boost secondary school
completion rates and provide access to and retention in higher education, but evidence
is not robust.

Gender-Related Inequalities
16.     Unequal access of women to higher education persist in most of the developing
world. Figure D.7 depicts a positive relationship between the overall level of tertiary
education enrollment and its gender parity index (GPI). Gender imbalances against
women are more challenging in lower-income countries, particularly in the Sub-
Saharan Africa and South Asia Regions, and in countries with lower tertiary enrollment
rates. The East Europe and Central Asia Regions has long had a well-balanced tertiary
GPI, whereas higher education enrollment in Latin America and the Caribbean Region
has turned to have higher female enrollment. East Asia and Pacific and Middle East and
North Africa have also increased women participation over time, but the former is
becoming increasingly imbalanced, while the latter has had more gender parity in
recent years (figure D.8).

  17.      As with socioeconomic inequalities, gender imbalances can be largely explained
  by factors outside of the tertiary education system, such as earlier stages of schooling.
  Figure D.9 shows that low enrollment of girls in secondary education will inevitably
  lead to low female enrollment at the tertiary level. However, this does not appear to
  fully account for inequalities in access. In low-income countries, the gender balance is
  increasing faster at the tertiary than at the secondary level, whereas lower-middle-
  income countries have reached gender equality at the higher education level after
  constant progress, and upper-middle-income countries have a growing gender
  imbalance, with men not enrolling at the same rate as women (figure D.10). In Chile,
  more women than men successfully complete secondary education (77 percent
  compared with 69 percent in 2005) and thus a larger proportion have school-leaving
  certificates required for higher education. Also, more women than men take the
  university admissions exams but a lower proportion obtain scores high enough to allow
  them to enter more prestigious universities (OECD and World Bank 2009).

                     18.    Labor market factors certainly influence women’s participation in tertiary
                     education. Discrimination against women in the labor market may reduce their
                     incentive to invest in or complete tertiary education. But, at the same time, knowledge
                     economy and labor market pressures may require women higher education credentials
                     to secure better-paid jobs.

                     19.     Access disparities by gender are also driven by culture and traditions that mandate
                     different roles for females and males, narrowing the educational choices available for
                     girls. A number of barriers facing female students have been identified such as strong
                     social pressures to marry and bear children and gender stereotypes relating to particular
                     disciplinary areas. A common observation is that men and women tend to pursue
                     different fields of study. This has implications for how resources are allocated within
                     higher education as well as the value of a university degree in the job market. Figure D.11
                     shows that are more male students pursuing science, technology, engineering, and
                     mathematics (called STEM) fields in select countries with available data.

                     20.    The underrepresentation of women in specific disciplines that lead to high-
                     paying jobs (such as engineering) calls for policies to expand the pool of women who
                     pursue careers in science and technology. policy makers need to ensure that careers and
                     role models are not gender specific and support girls in science and math before they
                     reach higher education level (World Bank 2003).

Ethnicity and Urban-Rural Divide
21.     These traditionally excluded groups, including indigenous, religious, and social
castes, are often concentrated in lower-income quintiles of the income distribution, and
face difficulties in affording education costs and competing academically. In addition,
linguistic minorities may experience difficulties in mastering literacy at school level
where the spoken language differ from the national language. This could lead to
student repetition and dropouts, and eventually may reduce the share of linguistic
minorities who obtain the credentials to pursue higher education studies.

22.    Students from rural and remote areas often lack both nearby higher education
institutions and information about study programs and possible student finance
options. Unconditional differences in access to higher education tend to be large among
rural and urban areas (see Figure D12). A recent World Bank report (2016 forthcoming “At a
Crossroads Higher Education in Latin America and the Caribbean”) shows that access
inequalities in terms of ethnicity and urban-rural divide tend to diminish once parents’ income
and education level is taken into account.

23.    The transition from rural and poor areas to pursue higher education studies
includes a shift in a culturally different environment and is often a challenge for ethnic
minorities (World Bank 2014). In many countries, ethnic minorities are excluded from
the national economy and face discrimination in the education sector (Buchmann and
Hannum 2001; Filmer 2008).

Students with Disabilities

discussion of higher education inequity is centered on socioeconomic disadvantaged
groups and gender. Although there are not internationally agreed definitions for
disabilities and learning difficulties, the first term refers to students with difficulties that
are often visible in all settings, such as physical and cognitive impairments, and the
second includes students whose difficulties may often be invisible learning disabilities
and behavioral or emotional disorders.

25.    Disabilities remain a major barrier to furthering education, as few institutions
have introduced accommodations to address physical (visible) and learning (invisible)
disabilities. Equality of access for these group of students may require teaching
adaptations, since many disabilities affect the way the curriculum is accessed, and
funding mechanisms must consider the additional time students may require to
complete their studies as well as the higher living costs.

26.     There is limited data available on students with disabilities and their difficulties
in tertiary education even within OECD countries. In the Netherlands, for example, the
majority of these students are unaware of the support and facilities available to them,
and almost half consider unsuitable teaching materials puts them in a disadvantaged
position. On average, graduation rates are lower than their peers in tertiary education
and those with learning difficulties may not complete their courses. It is estimated that
50 percent of students with disabilities fall behind in their studies. Essentially, they are
more likely to drop out and are twice as prone as their nondisabled peers to discontinue
their undergraduate studies. Although they do receive additional resources, the
proportion of students with disabilities and difficulties in tertiary education receiving

support varies substantially among countries (from 0.4 percent in France to 18.9 percent
in Germany in 2006). These figures likely reflect differences in data collection methods
and definitions of disabilities (Evans and Ebersold 2012).

Higher Education Project Distribution by Region

2.     The ratio between core and noncore projects varies significantly among the
Regions. The majority of higher education projects in the Latin America and the
Caribbean Region are core projects, whereas the majority of higher education projects in
the Europe and Central Asia Region are noncore projects. The Sub-Saharan Africa
Region has more higher education projects than any other Region, although the number
of core projects dedicated higher education falls slightly below the Latin American and
the Caribbean Region.

3.     The high lending volume of core projects in the South Asia Region is largely
based on three higher education projects in India (Technology and Engineering Quality
Improvement Projects I and I and the Higher Education Quality Improvement Project)
and two projects in Pakistan (the Higher Education Support Project and the Tertiary
Education Support Project). India has the first highest lending amount with US$850
million from three projects, followed by Colombia with a total of US$700 million from
three projects. For more information, see table E.5 on support for higher education

HIGHER EDUCATION PROJECTS IN THE WORLD BANK EDUCATION PORTFOLIO

4.     Figure E.5 presents the percentage of higher education lending as a percentage of
total education lending for core projects. By the end of the evaluation period in 2016,
higher education made up approximately 15–20 percent of total education lending. The
increased priority for higher education is also commensurate with an increased priority
for education in general. For more information, see figure E.5 on the percentage of
higher education lending from total education lending.

Objective Areas
5.     Out of 117 investment projects, higher education projects included teaching and
learning as the most frequent program development objective. There are some regional
and income-level trends, such as the emphasis of governance in the Latin America and
the Caribbean Region and strengthening of institutional management of higher
education institutions in lower-middle-income countries. However, the limited number
of projects makes it difficult to identify any patterns. For more information, see table
E.7, “Higher Education Projects by Program Development Objectives.”

6.     Projects that addressed the broader objective of competitiveness and private
sector development in their program development objectives seem to also prioritize
research. In contrast, projects that do not have these broader objectives focus on
teaching and learning. Support to higher education systems, including institutional
strengthening at the university level and national levels, was found at the activity level
instead of the program development objective level. For more information, see table E.8,

7.     Core and noncore projects showed relatively similar pattern in terms of the
intermediate objective areas of project activities. For both types of projects, (i)
improving learning and research environment and (ii) strengthening management and
strategic planning capacity were two of the most commonly addressed intermediate
objectives. Strengthening regulation and quality assurance seemed to be more
commonly addressed among middle-income countries. For more information, see table
E.9, “Number of Projects by Intermediate Objectives and Intervention Areas.”

Type of Support
8.     The majority of support for core higher education projects is through grants to
higher education institutions. Specifically, grants were used for approximately 80
percent of projects in lower-income countries and lower-middle-income countries,
whereas they were only used for 50 percent of projects in upper-middle-income
countries. Conversely, grants were not the most prominent type of support among
noncore projects. Approximately 32 percent of noncore projects supported grants to
higher education institutions, and about 40 percent of them supported technical
assistance. Grants are used for many different purposes, with the improvement of
learning and research environment and the strengthening of management or strategic
planning capacity of higher education institutions as the most common.

out of 23) of them showing satisfactory or moderately satisfactory outcome rating. This
is the above the average of all World Bank projects rated between FY2003 and 2015, of
which approximately 71 percent received more than moderately satisfactory outcome
rating. The ratings for other areas such as World Bank and borrower performances, and
Quality of entry and supervision also indicate that the core projects have generally
performed well, all shows the same or above the average of all World Bank projects.

10.    In contrast, noncore projects received more mixed ratings. Over 40 percent (11
out of 26) of these projects were rated moderately unsatisfactory or unsatisfactory
outcome rating, which is lower than average of all World Bank projects. In addition to
the outcomes, the noncore projects were rated particularly worse in World Bank and
borrower performances. Overall, the noncore education projects and other noncore
projects show similar patterns in outcome and World Bank/borrower performance
ratings.

11.    The analysis of the noncore education projects with low outcome or performance
ratings provided no clear pattern of the reasons for these ratings. The majority of the
low ratings do not seem to be related to the higher education activities. It also did not
provide enough evidence to show that the lower ratings of these noncore education
projects resulted from the complexity of the project design and implementation by
including multiple subsectors within one education project. The breakdown of the
noncore projects by sectors indicates that the lower ratings are concentrated in the
certain sector projects.
