This case study of the city of Kanpur contributes to developing an understanding of the factors that
drive city competitiveness in general and in India in particular. The city of Kanpur in the state of Uttar
Pradesh (UP) in India offers a contrasting case to the economically successful city of Coimbatore (Tamil
Nadu, India) and other economically successful cities elsewhere that were studied as part of the World Bank
Group’s report on Competitive Cities for Jobs and Growth.

Kanpur’s lagging growth trajectory cannot be understood purely in terms of city-level factors;
national and state-level factors also play an important role. Kanpur’s economy was adversely affected
by economic liberalization initiated in 1991 and the closure of large mills and, unlike most other Tier 1 or
Tier 2 cities, it underwent a prolonged decline (until 2004). While the city did benefit from support by the
Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission (JnNURM) during the fragile recovery that started in 2005, the
lack of adequate funding to meet city-level co-financing requirements under the scheme limited access to
infrastructure development programs. Compared with economically successful cities, Kanpur’s investment
expenditures remained very low. The completion of the Delhi-Kolkata segment (in 2008) of the Golden
Quadrilateral national highway network has contributed to Kanpur’s fragile recovery, as it provided
improved connectivity and market accessibility for Kanpur’s manufacturing firms.

In the context of a weak city government, this study focuses on proactive interventions made by
various city-level stakeholders, in this case largely the private sector, to improve Kanpur’s
competitiveness. By looking at who were the main actors, what were their efforts, and the impact of those
efforts on the city as a whole, the study identified three main factors that affected the competitiveness
trajectory of Kanpur. First, similar to other cities studied, and especially Coimbatore, the private sector
played an important role in the economic development of Kanpur, but its impact was limited by the political
economic context. In Kanpur, while selected industry or business associations were able to tap into state
support for industrial parks, the economic impact of these strategic alliances for infrastructure investments
was limited because common sector- or economy-wide benefits were not factored in. These alliances failed
to grow into the more broad-based and sustainable “growth coalitions” that were crucial to the economically
successful cities studied elsewhere. Second, some segments of Kanpur’s economy were able to connect to
global markets and diversify with the support of foreign buyers and largely without government support.
However, the benefits were not industry-wide, and certainly not Kanpur-wide. Third, while the few firms
relying on research and training used these as a cornerstone of growth, more generally the major educational
and training institutions were little used in Kanpur. Poor standards of living and lower salaries had the effect
of driving away locally-trained talent, leaving unfulfilled local demand for white-collar workers and
underutilized first-class technical training institutions.

From these lessons and the contrast with Coimbatore, some insights emerge as to which city-level
initiatives may improve the prospects for Kanpur and other cities facing similar conditions, factors
and challenges:

    1. Widening the membership of industry associations and facilitating cross-association membership.
    2. Broadening the coalitions that seek strategic alliances with the state of UP to ensure more economy-
       wide and institutionalized benefits.
    3. Establishing relevant local academic/training institutions. While the gap between Kanpur’s first-
       class academic institutions and largely low-tech industry may not be easy to overcome, the example
       of Coimbatore shows the benefits of firms investing in local academic/training institutions.




                                                                                                              5
For Kanpur to play its role in Uttar Pradesh’s ambitious development targets, the central and state
governments could consider undertaking the following:

    1. Increase transfers to the Kanpur Nagar Nigam, first to allow it to cover the costs of the
       maintenance roles assigned to it and, over time and with increasing capacity of the urban local
       body (ULB), allow it to fulfil its other functions.
    2. Place the burden of industrial park location decisions, land purchases, and park design and
       operation on those best placed to undertake them and navigate the local political economy of
       implementation, namely the future occupiers of the park. Experience from industrial park
       programs globally, and in India in particular, suggests that programs that take into account the
       needs of the private sector, on location and design in particular, but also local political economy
       conditions, are more likely to attract investment and be self-sustaining. In contrast, park projects
       that are government-led, with little or no private sector input, as was often the case in Kanpur, have
       generally resulted in low investment and a limited ability to adapt to business needs and maintain
       adequate levels of maintenance.
    3. Facilitate public investment that increases the quality of life in the city. Low quality of life
       makes it harder to attract skilled, technical and entrepreneurial talent from outside the city. It also
       leads to graduates trained at IIT Kanpur —the city’s premier and globally renowned educational
       institution—leaving the city on completion of their training.

Kanpur’s recent economic recovery provides hope but remains fragile. Kanpur’s future will hinge on
the ability of all stakeholders to foster more broad-based growth coalitions and linkages in order to mobilize
public and semi-public goods to translate the city’s potential into wider, stronger and more sustainable
economic benefits.

                                                   INTRODUCTION

This case study of the city of Kanpur contributes to developing an understanding of the factors
driving city competitiveness in general and in India in particular. It builds on and complements the
World Bank Group’s report on Competitive Cities for Jobs and Growth that analyzes what makes a city
competitive and how more cities can grow their economies. 1

One reason why Kanpur was selected for this case study is that it offers a contrasting trajectory to
the economically successful city of Coimbatore and to economically successful cities elsewhere.
Historically, Kanpur was a successful city and a leading industrial hub for the whole country until the late
1980s. The city then fell into a prolonged decline (1989-2004) relative to the rest of India and sometimes
even in absolute terms, before finally experiencing a fragile recovery (2005-12), albeit still founded largely
on what had been its key sectoral strengths (Figure 1; Table 1). In 1991, at the beginning of the period of
economic liberalization, Kanpur seemed better poised than other “Tier 2”2 cities for economic growth, with
a skilled workforce, first-class educational institutions and the presence of a manufacturing hub. However,
between 2001 and 2012, Kanpur’s GDP growth lagged behind GDP growth of other Tier 2 cities that are
today seen as the mainstay of India’s economic future (Figure 1).

Another reason for studying Kanpur is India’s specific urban-governance context and the relevance
of a contrasting case to the successful one of Coimbatore. Both Kanpur and Coimbatore were once
labelled as a “Manchester of India”, in the north and south of the country, respectively. Both were strong
manufacturing hubs but they evolved quite differently. Coimbatore pursued a path towards greater
prosperity over several decades within a context of limited powers resting with Indian cities compared with
other levels of governance in the Indian federal structure. The contrast between Coimbatore and Kanpur
sheds light on the power of coalitions formed between city-level private and public players, the “strategic
alliances” city-level players or coalitions formed with the state and national authorities, and the consequent
impacts.

Finally, Kanpur is of interest because of the key challenges the city has faced, which many Indian
cities and possibly cities elsewhere also face. Kanpur’s challenges include: being landlocked; being
located in a low-income state with below average GSDP growth that is losing ground as an industrial base;
having particularly weak city authorities compared with the already weak average Indian city; experiencing
a shift from a centrally-planned to a market-based economy; and struggling with industrial pollution issues.

This study uses the city’s economic performance over time to highlight triggers and related strategic
interventions in the context of India’s overall urban governance context, as well as Kanpur’s specific
challenges. Considering the relatively large influence of state governments on Indian cities, the analysis is
set in the context of national- and state-level policies and trends that impacted the city. It examines the
city’s competitiveness and growth trajectory—relative to the state and national context—by looking at the
development of its core sectors, the way decisions were made for strategic planning, and implementation
arrangements. It extends its analysis beyond the role of city leaders to include the role of the local private
sector and other local stakeholders, working in conjunction—or out of sync—with other levels of
government in achieving city-level economic outcomes and in working to resolve its specific challenges.

  The Sixth Central Pay Commission classified cities as “X”, “Y,” and “Z” based on the p opulation of the urban agglomeration
area. Cities classified as “X” are commonly called “Tier -1” cities and have generally more than 5 million inhabitants and cities
classified as “Y” are generally between 1 -5 million inhabitants and are commonly referred to as “Tier-2” cities.

While the research methodology focused on the private sector, it added to the “usual” competitiveness
analysis of the private sector by looking at the various levers used by stakeholders in the public,
private and civic sectors to enhance city competitiveness. The study was undertaken with a view to
adapting the framework used for the analysis of economically successful cities worldwide to the specifics
of the Indian urban scenario. A chronological narrative of the economic development of the city was
created, after which key players were identified. In-depth interviews were conducted with stakeholders in
the public, private and civic sectors to understand their formal and informal roles and relationships, as well
as to examine the deliberate interventions that were undertaken by these actors. The study thus
predominantly relies on interview findings, using qualitative research methods such as triangulation to
validate findings.

diversification over the past half-decade into services, primarily IT/ITES/BPO. Family-owned textile
and engineering firms are the mainstay of Coimbatore’s manufacturing economy, while emerging
sectors such as logistics/distribution, food production, tourism and health care are still in their infancy
but have growth potential.
Coimbatore’s success is the result of a confluence of multiple factors, some inherited or driven by its
relatively positive national and state contexts, and some enabled through deliberate interventions,
mainly by local private-sector actors. The city’s key economic characteristics include: educational
attainment and talent formation levels higher than the rest of Tamil Nadu and much of India; a
tradition of small, family-owned manufacturing; and diversification from traditional sectors such as
textiles and industrial machinery into precision engineering and electromechanical components.
Deliberate economic development efforts in Coimbatore took a variety of forms, although none of
these included a strong role of city-level public authorities:
 1. Local industry associations and the Chamber of Commerce, based on healthy “coopetition”
     (competitive cooperation) among their member firms, helped to build local capacity and upgrade
     technologies within their respective industries and helped to promote the city as a place to do
     business through publications, events and inbound/outbound business development missions.
 2. Coimbatore’s associations acted as advocates for the city and its business community at the state
     and national levels, resulting in long-term strategic alliances between local business associations
     and the state and central government. Moreover, cross-membership made the associations’ joint
     initiatives more effective, and facilitated coordination among them. This resulted in
     institutionalized alliances between associations and state-level authorities or agencies for the
     development of special economic zones and training, research and testing facilities.
 3. In addition to advancing local economic development through their own business activities,
     Coimbatore’s for-profit firms have acted as the city’s main promoters. For example, private real
     estate developers have worked to attract multinationals to invest in Coimbatore.
 4. Coimbatore’s family engineering firms have established technical colleges, schools, hospitals,
     etc., through corporate trusts/foundations, maintaining collaborative relationships and mutually-
     beneficial training arrangements. As a result, industry-academia linkages are exceptionally strong
     and directly influence curriculum development.

                               NATIONAL, STATE AND CITY CONTEXT

Kanpur’s trajectory was affected by the national and state context that influenced all cities in India and
Uttar Pradesh, respectively, as well as specific national-level and state-level factors that affected Kanpur
specifically. While the study focuses on the past decade of Kanpur’s economic trajectory, this section takes
a longer historical perspective, given that these earlier periods provide important insights.

                                            National and State Context

Kanpur’s economic troubles and recent fragile recovery occurred within a changing national macro -
environment of economic liberalization. In 1991, India shifted to trade opening and economic
liberalization, moving away from import substitution and towards export orientation. In the past two
decades, India’s average annual growth rate has accelerated to nearly 7 percent, against an average of 4
percent in the previous four decades. 4 The shift was accompanied in a number of Indian cities, including
Kanpur, by the closure of large government-owned industries, most symbolically large textile mills. 5
However, as part of its industrial policy of 1991 and onwards, the Government maintained several programs
of industry-wide and sector-specific support, especially for less industrialized areas, as well as for micro,
small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).

Among Indian states, Uttar Pradesh’s GDP growth and investment in hard and soft infrastructure
lag behind other low-income states and the rest of India. While growth in the state’s GDP rose from 4.7
percent per year in FY1993-99 to 6.0 percent per year in FY2000-10, it is the lowest among comparator
states. Per capita GSDP growth from FY1994 to FY2014 was almost 2 percentage points lower than in
India as a whole. 6 During the past three decades, the state has consistently underinvested in hard and soft
infrastructure compared with the “leading” states.7 In this period, the most successful (“leading”) states in
India have not only spent proportionally more on social and economic infrastructure than UP, but have
increased that spending at a higher rate, resulting in a widening gap. While investment in infrastructure per
capita by these leading states was already 47 percent higher than by UP in 1986, it became 82 percent higher
in 1996 and 132 percent higher in 2011. In 2011, UP spent Rs.4,354 per capita on social and economic
infrastructure compared with Rs.10,083 per capita in the leading states.8

Meanwhile, rapid urbanization has not been accompanied by improvements in cities’ institutional
capabilities and financial resources. While the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act (1992) sought
devolution of power to the ULB level, urban governance in India remains very weak and coordination is
poor. 9 Launched in 2005, JnNURM aimed to address the challenges of urbanization by facilitating
infrastructure investment and service delivery improvements. It envisaged 23 reforms (11 mandatory and
12 optional) to be implemented by 67 “mission c ities.” While the program has been successful in increasing
awareness of urban issues and catalyzing infrastructure investment in urban areas, limited capacity at the

functions under the 74th Amendment to the ULBs, the lion’s share of the budget is still managed by the
state. In 2011, only 4 percent of the 2011 state budget was transferred to the lower bodies. In comparison,
Tamil Nadu, which also devolved all functions, except fire services, to the ULBs, transferred almost 9
percent of the state budget to lower bodies in 2011. In addition, a higher per capita revenue base in Tamil
Nadu meant that in 2011 it transferred Rs.1,040 per capita, almost four times more than UP’s transfer of
Rs.262 per capita.11

       National-level and state-level factors that specifically impacted Kanpur’s growth

Kanpur’s economy was adversely affected by the change in the national economic framework and,
unlike most other Tier 1 or Tier 2 cities, it never really recovered from that change. Coimbatore, Surat,
Ahmedabad and Mumbai all recovered from the closure of their large government-owned textile mills.
More generally, comparable Tier 2 cities have exhibited much higher GDP growth than Kanpur (Figure 1).
In Kanpur, the state owned not just textile mills, through the National Textile Corporation, but also the
Tanneries and Fertilizer Corporation through the British India Corporation (BIC). All closed down in the
1990s. Large private sector firms, such as scooter-manufacturer LML Auto Ltd., were also unable to adapt
to new competition from foreign manufacturers, such as Honda and Yamaha, as well as fast-changing
market preferences, and LML stopped production in 2002. Over the past decade, Kanpur’s private sector
has become increasingly dominated by SMEs that had served as ancillaries to large industries, both public
and private.12

JnNURM supported long overdue infrastructure improvements in Kanpur and had a
disproportionate impact, albeit late and from a low base. Although constricted by its capacity to raise
its share of the funds,13 the Kanpur Nagar Nigam, Kanpur’s ULB, identified in its 2006 City Development
Plan a number of infrastructure projects, including solid waste management, water supply and the expansion
of the sewerage network in the inner city area, and also introduced a property tax reform. The solid waste
management program has been completed and the water supply and sewerage network expansions are
expected to be completed in 2015. A better database and improvements in collection helped to increase
revenues from property taxes by almost 50 percent between 2009 and 2012. However, Kanpur Nagar
Nigam’s lack of adequate fiscal capacity to meet the required financial contribution has hampered Kanpur
from accessing other infrastructure programs under JnNURM. 14 While improving over time, Kanpur lags
behind other cities in Uttar Pradesh on key infrastructure development criteria (Table 2).

The Golden Quadrilateral highway project has significantly improved connectivity and market
accessibility for Kanpur’s industries. The Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) highway project connects the four
major cities of Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai. Other Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, such as Pune,
Bengaluru, Ahmedabad and Surat, are also linked to the GQ network. Begun in 2001, the last segment of
the network was completed in 2013. The Delhi-Kolkata segment passes through Kanpur as National

                                                      City Context

Scale: Kanpur, until recently the largest city in UP, has a population of 2.9 million people over an area of
300 km2. Its central location in UP provides the city with good connections to neighboring states and the
National Capital Region, which together account for nearly 400 million people.

Governance: Kanpur is administratively divided into six zones and 110 wards. The 74th Amendment
ensured that regular elections take place to elect a municipal council and a mayor. The executive arm of the
ULB is the municipal commissioner who is appointed by the state government and de-facto operates along
policy lines established at the state level. The short tenure and the lack of legislative powers at the mayoral
level, together with the limited fiscal resources available to the ULB, limit the mayor to little more than a
figurehead. The municipal commissioner primarily coordinates with the state bureaucracy present in the
city—the district magistrate and regional commissioner—to implement state and national policies. 17 The
parshads and sabhasads (municipal and ward corporators) and the mayor lobby with city bureaucrats in
matters of civic administration, but do not have powers at the local level to implement policies or create
legislation for the city. 18 Key decisions for the city, such as hours of electricity supply, the building of roads,
and establishing industrial areas, are taken at the state level and implemented by state-level bodies. The
city-level authorities are left with the task of maintenance and operations, but are constrained by their
limited fiscal capacity. Municipal government is understaffed and underpaid, and its officers often lack the
technical training and education to adequately carry out their roles and duties, increasing pressure on the
few state-level officers who are in key positions in the city administration.

Institutional responsibility: The key functions that the Kanpur Nagar Nigam (KNN) undertakes are land
use management and town planning, for which it is dependent on the Kanpur Development Authority
(KDA), the parastatal land development authority of Kanpur. The KNN collects property taxes and is
authorized to allocate these revenues. Recent policy mandates that property taxes collected from industrial
areas must be allocated within those areas.19 The KDA works separately from the ULB and is responsible
for both housing and commercial development. It primarily operates on the outskirts of the KNN,

developing new areas for the increasing needs of the city. However, there seems to be little institutional
coordination between them. Interviews suggest that the KDA operates under very low margins and often
lacks resources to be able to buy land from farmers. 20 Water and sewage are currently handled by a separate
body, the Kanpur Jal Sansthan (KJS) that is a subsidiary of the Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam (UPJN). Similarly,
electricity supply is handled by the Kanpur Electricity Supply Company (KESCO), which is a subsidiary
of the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL). For industrial and private sector development, the
key bodies are at the state and central government levels. Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development
Corporation (UPSIDC) develops land and infrastructure for industrial use, which is then handed over to the
ULB for maintenance. The MSME-Development Institute (MSME-DI) located in the city is mandated to
assist MSMEs, create industrial clusters and provide common facilities. Over the past 20 years, the UP
Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has been very active in Kanpur as the city continues to struggle with
industrial pollution issues.

Fiscal resources: Its low revenue base, high dependence on transfers, and substantial running costs have
left the KNN with little room to plan strategically or implement new programs. On the revenue side, with
much underutilized land reducing its own tax base, nearly 70 percent of Kanpur’s total revenue comes in
the form of transfers from the State Finance Commission. 21 On the expenditure side, the KNN spent twice
as much of its budget on establishment and administration costs as other cities, about 65 percent in 2004
and 76 percent in 2011.22

Land ownership: While land is a significant resource for any city, this is not the case for Kanpur. Centrally-
located prime land, previously occupied by textile mills and TAFCO, remains in dispute with the National
Textile Corporation. A large area earmarked as “cantonment” is assigned to the Indian army. Having
underutilized or state-owned prime land within the city has reduced property tax revenue, as well as forced
UPSIDC, the KDA, and the private sector to look for land far from the inner city for industrial parks and
housing projects.

The private sector and external stakeholders: Industry associations are fragmented, not only along sector
lines, but also along political lines, with strong linkages to state- and national-level political parties. There
are several institutions of research and training in Kanpur, led by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)
Kanpur. While their association with industry and the city is limited, in recent years academia and research
are being increasingly leveraged by industry- and city-level bodies such as the KNN or the Ganga Pollution
Control Unit (GPCU) of the UP Jal Nigam (UP JN) to address specific needs. The main forum where the
private sector and state and city administrations interact is the Udyog Bandhu (friends of industry) program
launched in 2011 by the Infrastructure and Industrial Development Department. Udyog Bandhu aims to
improve industrial investment in UP. It has set up an online portal called Nivesh Mitra for obtaining
clearances for new firms. It also provides a forum to meet with relevant authorities at the district level in
monthly meetings, as well as at the state level through biannual meetings. Interviews with private-sector
stakeholders revealed that at the district level the forum is largely ineffective, as decision-makers only
participate in the high-powered meetings at the state level.

        ANALYSIS: KEY DETERMINANTS OF KANPUR’S COMPETITIVENESS

This section looks at how the various levels of government, the private sector and other stakeholders
collaborated, and their impact on Kanpur’s competitiveness. It focuses on proactive interventions—
within the set of contextual factors listed in the previous section—made by various stakeholders to improve
Kanpur’s competitiveness. Three factors are examined by looking at who were the main actors, what were
their efforts, and the impact of those efforts on the city as a whole:
    1. Strategic alliances between the local private sector and the state to access relevant industrial
         infrastructure.
    2. Active market and product diversification to break out of the stagnant local context.
    3. Limited but effective innovation and investment in human capital.


Factor 1: Strategic alliances between the local private sector and the state to access relevant
                                  industrial infrastructure

In the absence of city-level resources and significant decision-making power, and with a passive state,
the onus has fallen largely on the local private sector to undertake initiatives to access public
investment in critical industrial infrastructure and to enhance competitiveness. Given the nature of
industry in Kanpur, particularly with the disappearance of most, if not all, large-scale industry, the role of
industry associations and groupings is key. This section explores the nature of industry in Kanpur, how it
has opportunistically formed linkages with the state government to obtain the required infrastructure, and
how this has impacted the city.

What did Kanpur’s industry look like?
The trajectory of the private sector in Kanpur has been heavily influenced by its location in the
agrarian belt and its past, when it served the procurement needs of initially the British and later the Indian
government defense industry for leather and textile products (Figure 2). During the License Raj, the leather
and textile industries were nationalized and focused primarily on producing low-quality goods—shoes,
saddlery, and garments—serving the defense industry, and had little incentive to seek better technology,
skills, or new markets.

the closure of the nationalized textile
mills and increased competition, the
city’s economy became dominated by
MSMEs (Figure 3), many with limited
skills and technology, as they looked to
find new markets and new products in
their sectors. In the following years, not
only did Kanpur have a higher level of
MSME formation than Lucknow, but
these MSMEs also became a larger
source of new jobs in Kanpur.
Interviews suggest that since the
nationalized industries had not
upgraded skills or technology, most of
the MSMEs were started by low-skilled

employees let go by the large firms.23

The private sector has continued to focus on leather, garments and hosiery, prepackaged food
products, plastics and chemicals, and engineering with mixed results .

a. Leather: The leather sector in Kanpur experienced a strong growth trajectory, helped by a tenfold
   increase in global trade in leather products, from US$16 billion in 1985 to US$160 billion in 2010.
   Kanpur, with sales exceeding US$660 million in 2006-07, was the largest leather and footwear cluster
   in India, followed by Kolkata (US$506 million), Chennai (US$500 million) and Agra (US$256
   million).24 Turnover at the state level has doubled over the past four years from Rs.4,400 crores25 to
   Rs.9,500 crores. 26 Competitive strengths in the availability of raw materials, particularly buffalo
   leather, a large pool of cheap semi-skilled manpower, and marketing, have helped Kanpur’s leather
   industry diversify its product range. Kanpur has improved its position from being an exporter of tanned
   leather to its current position as a center for finished leather, safety and fashion footwear, saddlery,
   leather goods, and most recently, upholstery. While no reliable numbers are available on the number
   and size of firms in the city, it is estimated that there are more than 400 small and medium-sized
   tanneries in Kanpur, and 10-15 large tanneries. Besides the small and medium-sized tanneries located
   in the industrial parks in Jajmau, Banthar and Unnao, there are at least 1,000 units that produce open
   footwear,27 and belts and shoes, and operate from residential neighborhoods.28
b. Garments and hosiery: Many employees who lost their jobs when the large textile and defense
   garments firms closed moved into small-scale hosiery manufacturing or readymade garments
   production using the skills they had acquired. While the knitted garments market has increased
   worldwide, low investment29 and limited skills resulted in poor product quality in Kanpur compared
   with other textile and apparel producing centers, such as Ludhiana, Tirupur and Kolkata. As a result,
   Kanpur’s hosiery manufacturers have concentrated on producing basic products (e.g., innerwear and
   towels), with little scope for product differentiation. Most of the apparel production, especially cutting

   and stitching, continues within the city. Almost all of the products produced in Kanpur are destined for
   neighboring markets in Bihar, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh.
c. Prepackaged food: Kanpur’s location in the agricultural hinterland of the upper Ganges g ives it a
   natural advantage in the food industry. Kanpur used to be the major distribution center for wheat, spices,
   edible oil and pulses. This led to many small-scale industries such as bread-making, dairy products,
   confectionary, soaps, detergents and jarda30 factories locating in Kanpur. Between 2008 and 2013, the
   industry grew by an average 8.4 percent per year.31 The processed food industry has benefitted Kanpur
   as firms have become ancillaries to the large brands, and new brands are emerging from the city,
   including Goldie Masala, Mohini Tea, Ghadi detergent and Mayur Oil. While MSMEs continue to work
   from residential locations, some SMEs are located in industrial parks. Poor rural road connectivity,
   limited raw food material storage, and poor cold chain capacity were highlighted as major constraints—
   even for the firms located in industrial parks.32
d. Plastics and chemicals: The plastics and chemicals industry started as an ancillary to the fertilizer and
   textiles industries by providing bags for fertilizers, central cylinders for the textile mills, and tarpaulins
   for the defense sector. Plastics became an industry in its own right in the late 1980s and 1990s with the
   increased use of plastics in engineering and irrigation products, and later received a boost with the use
   of plastics in the food packaging industry. Most of the players in Kanpur continue to focus on low-tech
   products, initially supplying packaging to the jarda factories and subsequently to the prepackaged food
   industry. Recycling plastics is also emerging as an employment generator. Lohia Starlinger and Kanpur
   Plastipack are large firms that specialize in producing fiber-reinforced packaging for export. Local
   chemical manufacturing firms also supply the leather industry and have grown together with it.
e. Engineering-based: The engineering-based sector received a severe shock with the sudden closure of
   LML in 2002, as many ancillaries were left without a buyer. 33 The sector has looked for new markets
   with limited success. While auto manufacturing has increased in India, no new auto-manufacturing
   firms have moved to UP. The industry has also transitioned as most manufacturers, rather than working
   with many small component providers, now look for a limited number of solution-providers. Many
   firms have closed and the survivors are either serving local markets or looking to move to
   manufacturing hubs in other states. 34

What did infrastructure support for Kanpur’s industry look like?
Selected industry or business associations were able to tap into state support for industrial parks. For
example, the Indian Industries Association (IIA) lobbied the state government in the mid-1990s to provide
uninterrupted power supply in the Panki industrial area. They promised 100 percent revenue realization
from the area and agreed to pay a higher rate for the electricity. Separate industrial feeders were set up in
Panki limiting the power-cuts to just 1 hour per day, as opposed to 5-6 hours in the rest of the city. 35
Recently, a large leather industry association took the lead in forming a new industrial park, coordinating
with the state government to identify the land, and independently starting land acquisition. 36 Both
associations are composed of Kanpur’s larger industries that can use their influence to access key decision-
makers at the state level, especially during periods when political conditions are optimal (1997-2002 and
2012-now).

Smaller players found it far harder to connect with state-level authorities and tap into state
resources.37 Since smaller firms largely operate from the inner city or old industrial areas, low availability
of city-level infrastructure has increased the costs of doing business. While 24-hour power supply is meant
to be provided to the industrial areas (in practice the figure is about 22 hours), the rest of Kanpur only has
power for 16 hours a day. Most small manufacturers in the garments, plastics and leather industry are
located in the city, outside industrial areas, and face frequent power cuts. According to firms’ estimates,
even for non-intensive users of power in the saddlery industry, dependence on generators has increased the
cost of electricity by 250 percent.38 Bad transport infrastructure in the city also limits the benefits of smaller
players moving to industrial estates, as skilled workers live in the inner city and do not have the means to
travel to distant industrial estates. 39

Alliances between the private sector and the state government were often short-sighted and limited,
and failed to develop into a broad-based “growth coalition”. In the context of social divisions, strategic
alliances between the private sector and the state government for industrial parks were short-sighted and
limited in scope, and did not translate into a broad-based “growth coalition” that would have facilitated
city-level benefits or growth. Social divisions, including along religious and caste lines, limited
opportunities for Kanpur’s private sector to become better organized, preventing business and industry
linkages and the formation of a unified private-sector voice. 40 In contrast, Coimbatore’s business
associations acted as advocates for the city and its business community at the state and central government
levels, resulting in sustainable growth coalitions between local business associations and the state and
central governments.

What was the impact on the city?
The economic impact on the city of these strategic alliances for infrastructure investment was limited
because common sector- or economy-wide benefits were not factored in. While a few large industries
and prominent business associations are able to convince the state government to invest in industrial support
infrastructure, their scope is limited as these are often piecemeal benefits coming from ad hoc alliances that
do not benefit industry at large. For instance, industrial feeders for electricity supply in the Panki area only
benefitted the plastic packaging, auto and the very small steel parts industries, while the leather and apparel
industries continued to suffer. On the issue of the tannery pollution in Jajmau, the leather industry was
isolated and the larger industry associations did not present a unified voice to leverage interventions from
the state government.41 Moreover, there has been no concerted effort by industries to lobby for common
benefits such as common testing and skill development centers.

In the long run, the absence of the city government from this growth alliance created challenges to
competitiveness. The above-mentioned industry-state alliances were ad hoc and excluded city-level
government bodies, resulting in unplanned development that further increased pressure on those bodies. 42
The alliances resulted in the sector-specific industrial parks/estates or industrial park infrastructure
upgrades in areas located far from the city center with unreliable or non-existent public transport
infrastructure. There was rarely provision for affordable/low-cost housing for workers or relevant public
transport. Coordination with the KDA and the KNN in deciding the location and layout of industrial areas

was very limited. 43 This led to unplanned development in the areas around the industrial parks and
eventually more pressure on the already fiscally weak KNN to provide essential services to workers in the
area. After the first 20 years of operation, maintenance of industrial parks is the responsibility of the KNN.
However, given the weak fiscal capacity of the KNN, maintenance work is often neglected.44

Limited city infrastructure means that smaller firms continue to operate from mixed
commercial/residential neighborhoods, adversely impacting the livability of the city. The smaller firms
are located in the city center where a skilled workforce is easily available but where infrastructure
development remains limited. These firms are operating sweatshops in the middle of residential
neighborhoods, with workers often living on the factory premises. This in turn has an impact on the
livability of the city and deters highly skilled and technical workers required by the domestic industry. In
recent livability rankings, Kanpur comes 49th out of 50 Indian cities. 45

     Factor 2: Active market and product diversification to break out of the stagnant local
                                          context

Over the past decade, the private sector in Kanpur has actively sought to diversify markets and products,
reviving local industry that had previously been stuck in a stagnant local market with outdated products and
technology. The leather industry has been a leader, connecting with global markets and diversifying
products in line with demand from foreign buyers. Most of these connections have been autonomous with
very little support from the state and central government. While local industry has grown with these
linkages, the benefits are not industry-wide, and certainly not Kanpur-wide. The advances are typically
made by larger industries and risk being short-lived and limited in impact without adequate support.

How did industries diversify their markets and products?
Leather and segments of the plastic packaging industry have managed to find linkages to global
markets, driven by growing global demand. With the traditional quota-based markets dwindling, certain
sectors began looking for markets abroad. Over the past decade, Kanpur’s firms have focused on finding
new markets for their products overseas. The leather industry, which had primarily focused on low value-
added finished leather production, had seen margins in the domestic markets rapidly declining, and was
most successful in finding new markets. While certain export linkages existed in the 1990s, international
demand for leather steadily rose from the early 2000s onwards and was not significantly affected by the
2008-09 global financial crisis. 46 Larger leather firms in Kanpur initially found buyers, through
international fairs and exhibitions, for finished leather and subsequently diversified into shoe uppers, leather
accessories, dress shoes, leather garments and, more recently, upholstery. For instance, due to the increased
costs of manufacturing safety footwear in Europe, Kanpur’s high performing finishe d leather product
manufacturers received more orders and requests for newer products. These companies were initially
supported by global buyers with investment, technology and training. 47 The larger firms frequently
subcontract smaller firms to meet client orders. Meanwhile, the plastics industry in Kanpur grew through a
joint venture between the Lohia Group and Starlinger GmBH, and continued to supply bulk woven plastic
packaging materials in the international market even after the partnership ended in 2000.48 Former suppliers
to the local LML plant, struggling after its closure, also saw an opportunity and adapted accordingly.

Changing customer preferences for pre-packaged food allowed the food industry and plastic-
packaging industry to partner and serve a growing domestic market. A central location in the agrarian
belt and a growing demand for pre-packaged foods allowed Kanpur’s agro industry to leverage its locational
advantage. Growth in the pre-packaged food industry presented an opportunity for many of the plastic-
packaging manufacturers and over the past decade new brands such as Mohini Tea, Mayur Oil and Goldie
Masala have emerged.

Exposure to export markets in the leather industry increased learning and translated into a renewed
focus on the domestic market. While 90 percent of the leather market is focused on export, 49 the larger
firms, such as Superhouse and Mirza Tanners, see domestic opportunities and are developing new products
to meet domestic needs. Some manufacturers have been able to leverage their learning from serving the
export market into creating their own brands. Mirza Tanners has created the Red Tape brand, which is now
one of the largest casual and formal shoe suppliers in India. Homera Enterprises is making significant
investments to position itself as a leather upholstery manufacturer serving foreign and domestic auto
manufacturers.

In auto parts and injection molded plastics, where there is weak exogenous demand and few forward
linkages, finding new markets has been risky and expensive. The injection-molded plastics and auto
parts industry that grew as an ancillary to LML Autos faced a crisis when LML shut down in 2002 without
paying its suppliers. A majority of the local suppliers and ancillaries eventually closed, while the survivors
had to invest and diversify to find new markets. JS Auto, the largest sheet-metal supplier to LML, took
substantial risks and invested heavily, producing passenger- and freight-carriers to serve UP and
neighboring state markets and other low-income counties in Southeast Asia and Africa. Injection molded
plastics providers are struggling, with no new auto manufacturers replacing LML in the state.
Manufacturers located in other centers look for suppliers that are located close to the plants and are involved
in the design process (as “solutions providers”, not “parts providers”). Some injection molded plastics
companies have diversified into making bottles and cans to meet growing domestic demand for
consumables.

Industries that have remained focused on the local market are competing on price rather than
quality. In the garment and hosiery industry, there are very few composite firms. 50 Furthermore, most of
the firms are focused on producing low-cost, low-quality products that serve the local market in UP and
neighboring states. Given that there is stiff domestic competition from Kolkata and Tiruppur, the industry
looks to exploit cheap labor to produce larger volumes of goods.

While some firms succeeded in tapping into export markets, this failed to benefit the industry and
city as a whole. Firms that were able to diversify in products and markets were the ones that were able to
find “chance” investments for doing so, from their buyers or through family connections.51 The benefits
were limited to a few firms and rarely translated into industry-wide effects or spillovers. Furthermore, given
the low level of education and the lack of a workforce skilled in management and commerce, most firms
that transition from smaller to larger firms eventually seek to leave Kanpur. 52 Most large firms have
established commercial headquarters outside Kanpur, mostly in the National Capital Region (NCR) areas
around Delhi, with only manufacturing based in Kanpur. In some cases, manufacturing plants have also
moved out of Kanpur to neighboring districts or states with more attractive government policies.

How were firms supported by the government/public sector?
Some government programs supported access to foreign markets but take-up has been low due to the
difficult business environment, and actual implementation has been largely driven by ad hoc deals.
While the central and state governments offered credit-guarantee, market-access, and freight-support
schemes, most business-owners interviewed had not applied for support under these schemes, saying that
their effectiveness was limited due to bureaucratic delays and complicated processes. For instance, some
credit schemes require firms to make significant infrastructure investments and recover their investment
from the state, deterring smaller businesses, as trust in the bureaucracy is very low.53

Most players developed linkages to foreign buyers through individual or collective private-sector
efforts. While government schemes had limited impact, individual entrepreneurship yielded more results.
Most businessmen interviewed developed links to foreign buyers through individual outreach or family
connections. A large number of businessmen simply wrote to buyers abroad offering their products, while
many others financed visits to important industry or trade fairs. Once they had found a buyer, they were
able to build other connections and diversify their products according to the needs of the buyers. Word-of-
mouth, with one Kanpur-based firm referring a foreign buyer to another firm or vice versa, also helped to
create linkages. 54 The dominance of particular caste and ethnic groups in some industries also helped these
knowledge-sharing networks to evolve.

Key interventions to enhance market connectivity came from programs of the central government to
improve nationwide connectivity and private-sector logistics investments. The establishment of the
Golden Quadrilateral national highway NH2 connecting Kanpur with Delhi and Kolkata greatly improved
connectivity. The private logistics platform set up in the Panki industrial area in 2011 was a critical
investment for Kanpur’s connectivity. This provided freight services connected to the railway, though once
again its success was largely due to the closeness of the investor to the right decision-making authorities.

What was the impact on the city?
Compliance with environmental norms and standards improved due to pressure from global buyers.
Imposition of environmental and social standards on imported leather, and growing consumer awareness in
Western countries, which are the main importers of leather products, have forced the industry to follow
better environmental sustainability and social practices. Interviewees talked about inspection of premises
by buyers, as well as the benefits of obtaining certificate of standards. This has led to observable
improvements in working conditions in the leather sector, as well as a reduction in the use of harmful
chemicals, although many firms supplying foreign buyers outsource work to smaller firms that may not be
compliant. Small firms seek environmental and quality certification to convince global buyers of product
quality and production standards. 55

Technology and skill transfers from foreign clients/buyers to Kanpur were also apparent in the
leather and plastics sectors. Firms moved up the value chain with inputs from foreign markets. These
inputs could be “soft” such as standards and quality control forcing the manufacturer to invest in machinery
or labor, or “hard” such as transfers of machinery, capital investment and training. The leading leather
manufacturers benefitted from hard transfers of machinery and capital from European investors. Lohia-
Starlinger, the largest plastic-packaging and engineering firm, began as a joint venture between the Lohia
Group, which manufactured cones for textile weaving machines, and an Austrian firm, Starlinger. Soft
transfers have been in the form of standards and quality, enabling smaller firms to link with global buyers.

One of the small leather firms visited received specifications for manufacturing shoes for the Caterpillar
safety shoes label, which were then finished and branded elsewhere. 56

While diversification in markets and products is changing industry in Kanpur, the wider benefits are
currently limited. New markets are behind the revival of medium and small-scale industries in Kanpur
over the past decade. According to estimates of some industrialists, about 25 percent of such firms have
been able to grow into larger firms through their linkages to export markets.57 While this brings obvious
benefits in terms of jobs and revenues, more needs to be done to ensure that the benefits are spread more
evenly. Interviews with large industries reveal that the investment required for them to transition and
diversify mostly came from family sources or through the investment of a foreign buyer (either in terms of
capital or technology). Smaller firms unable to access such investment were mostly unable to compete or
continued to manufacture low-cost, low value-added products.

Smaller manufacturers bear the brunt of sub-standard infrastructure, making it difficult to compete
with larger firms. Lack of adequate transport has squeezed margins in the garments industry, as raw
materials now have to be shipped in from locations in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. 58 In injection-
molded plastics, manufacturers are absorbing the cost of shipping their products to manufacturers to
maintain their price competitiveness.59 Lack of an airport makes it difficult to attract high-end clientele,
with one large manufacturer expressing embarrassment in bringing clients to Kanpur due to its bad
connectivity. Recent private sector initiatives in servicing freightage have helped, but lack of adequate
infrastructure remains a problem.

             Factor 3: Limited but effective innovation and human capital investment

Limited coordination between academia/research institutions and the private sector has restricted the ability
of Kanpur to adapt to a new globally competitive environment. However, this could point to a way forward
in reviving Kanpur’s industry, if leveraged with its key sectoral strengths. The case of Coimbatore shows
the benefits of close industry-academia linkages for human capital development. Coimbatore’s family
engineering firms have established technical colleges, schools and hospitals through corporate trusts and
foundations, maintaining collaborative relationships and mutually-beneficial training arrangements. As a
result, industry-academia linkages in Coimbatore are exceptionally strong and directly influence curriculum
development. Recently, some city-level players in Kanpur tried to increase linkages between industry and
educational institutes, with individual firms reaping the benefits of investment in research and training.

What is the nature of academic institutions in the city?
Kanpur is one of the largest educational centers in northern India, hosting some 50 institutes of
higher education, including internationally renowned institutes of research and training. Kanpur is
home to several institutes for technical education and training, including a branch of the Indian Institute of
Technology (IIT), an internationally renowned institute of research and training. It has three universities
offering a variety of courses in sciences, commerce and the arts, around 20 colleges of engineering, and
five institutions for medical sciences training. 60 With the presence of several institutes for secondary and
higher education, Kanpur attracts students from across India. The presence of a large numbers of higher

   Aside from the IIT, the city hosts the Harcourt-Butler Technological Institute (HBTI), a nationally renowned engineering
college, which used to be a technical training institute established by the British to support the manufacturing activities in the
city; a government polytechnic; and an agricultural college. Government institutes for training chartered accountants and
company secretaries are also located in the city. Most of the newer technical training institutes are private-sector owned. Leading
private sector groups, such as the JK Group and Jaipuria Group, have also established vocational training institutions.


                                                                                                                                22
and technical training institutions considered desirable by students has spawned an educational “coaching”
industry, which provides support to students taking entrance exams to enroll in these institutions.

However, academic institutes for training do not focus on local or regional development; IITs are
exporters of talent. The IIT is the premier educational institution in India, with a curriculum designed to
create a national corps of engineers, drawing students from across the country. There is no focus on linking
the locational advantages of an IIT with regional development. Graduates from IITs are considered among
the best in their fields and command high salaried jobs in large and multinational firms nationally and
internationally. Discussions with industry and a review of the placement records at IIT Kanpur and HBTI
reveal that few graduates are employed in Kanpur. In recent years, local technical training institutes such
as the JK-ITI and post-graduate management institutes such as GHS-IMR61 have been more successful in
building skills that are relevant and absorbed by local industry.

Industry-specific institutes are also present in Kanpur and industry associations have set up their
own training centers. An extension center of the Central Leather Research Institute (CLRI) was
established in Kanpur in 1963 to support the local leather industry. While the institute’s main office in
Chennai provides testing facilities, research support and training in best practices, the Kanpur branch’s role
is limited to carrying out periodic research projects at the request of the government. Large private sector
firms and industry associations have also invested in sector-specific training and research. In the leather
park in Banthar, Unnao, around 15 km outside Kanpur city limits, the private sector is taking the initiative
in setting up training centers to create a skilled workforce. This is being done on land provided by state-
level authorities while the costs will be covered by the private sector.

How did the private sector utilize the presence of educational institutions?
There is a mismatch between the low tech-base of industries and the high-tech focus of the main
institutes, making academia-industry synergies less obvious. Most of the research and incubation that is
carried out at the institutions focuses on high-tech industries. For instance, the incubation center promoted
a new nano-material to the textile industry for sports clothing. In contrast, most industry in Kanpur operates
on a low-tech basis. As such, there is a major disconnect between the focus of these institutions and the
value-added they could provide to the local industry. The curricula offered at the premier educational
institutions have little relevance to the needs of the private sector in Kanpur. 62

Recent sector- or firm-specific technical training and research has played a role, albeit limited.
Technical training institutions established by the private sector have had recognizable benefits, but these
are limited to a specific firm or sector. Lohia Group’s Technical Training and Research Center has
specialized skill-training courses for plastics processing technologies and works closely with its production
facility to design courses, as well as conduct research. Most trainees are absorbed by the Lohia Group’s
production facilities.63 The JK Group also established the Center for Technical Training in 2011 for training
technicians and mechanical fitters, who are then largely absorbed into local industry. 64

In recent years, Kanpur has tried to increase linkages between industry and educational institutes,
with some success. The district magistrate requested IIT Kanpur to open a business advisory center in the
city, but this has not materialized because of staffing issues. IIT Kanpur has developed close links with The
Industrial Entrepreneurs (TIE) to bring together the institute and industry on a biannual basis, and holds
annual entrepreneurship training for 11th grade students. A three-year-old program provides engineering
students on-the-job training with some of the larger private sector firms. Discussions with the IIT Kanpur

Incubation Center revealed a new initiative to combine the research facilities of IIT Kanpur, Harcourt-
Butler Technological Institute (HBTI) and the Perfume Research Center in Kannauj to develop a common
facility center.65 The consortium is in discussions with UPSIDC to find a location for the center. Sector-
specific institutes report greater linkages to the private sector, with the latter employing trainees from these
institutes.66

What was the impact on the city?
Sector- or firm-specific initiatives have yielded results, but have not translated into sustainable
bridges. Recent vocational training initiatives have allowed certain large-scale firms to have sustained
access to skilled manpower, but these have not yielded industry-wide benefits, as they have so far remained
tied to specific firms. CLRI and IIT Kanpur have been involved in finding solutions to the Ganga pollution
problem, and have submitted various reports to the state and central governments. However, their
recommendations remain unimplemented. 67 Recent efforts by the private sector and IIT Kanpur to
collaborate in training students have yielded mixed results: while it has provided solutions in some areas,
the technology level mismatch and incompatible expectations between firms and academia remain a
challenge. For instance, while the IIT is not a quality certification institute, one large local hosiery
manufacturer that had tested the density of its fiber at the IIT claimed in its promotional material that its
product quality was “IIT certified.” 68

With better opportunities elsewhere and limited demand for their skills, highly skilled workers seek
alternative centers of employment outside Kanpur. Wages in Kanpur do not match the expectations of
highly skilled graduates of the city’s first-class technical training institutions. Until recently, SMEs in
Kanpur focused on remaining price competitive, producing low-cost, low-value added goods for a limited
market. Historically, they have invested very little in the development of “human capital” and res ources for
workers. Industries have exploited loopholes in labor laws to hire non-contracted workers at very low wages
and irregular working conditions. Bad infrastructure and pollution undermine the livability of the city, 69
leading graduates to seek alternative centers.

The private sector in Kanpur has placed less importance on education, training and industry-
academia linkages than other economically more successful industrial centers, such as Coimbatore.
As seen in the case study on Coimbatore, the private sector proactively collaborated with educational
institutions, or set up their own degree colleges, to design curricula and develop skills relevant to the private
sector. In Kanpur, however, the private sector has had little or no collaboration with the educational
institutions, whose curricula and research are out of step with the needs of local industry. Industrialists in
Coimbatore diversified from existing businesses into auto and engineering parts, and benefitted from the
state attracting foreign auto manufacturers. Many of these industrialists represented existing capital from
large businesses. In Kanpur, however, private large-scale businesses moved to other centers or stopped
production, leaving behind small and medium manufacturers that have only recently started growing
again. 70

Inability of the city to retain and attract talent leads to a vicious circle where the locational
advantages of first-class educational institutions remain underutilized. Absence of large-scale industry
in the city, uncompetitive wages and poor living standards mean that locally-trained technical talent seeks

education elsewhere rarely return to the city.

Industry has to look elsewhere for technology upgrades, as well as testing facilities. No local inputs in
innovation, quality enhancement or process efficiency lead firms to compete with each other to produce the
same products for the same market, leading to a race to the bottom. Most manufacturers have to send their
products to labs in Delhi for testing and certification in the absence of a competent local laboratory.


                           CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS FOR OTHER CITIES

The lagging growth trajectory of Kanpur needs to be seen in the state and national contexts that has
affected all cities in India and UP respectively, as well as the specific national-level and state-level
factors that have affected Kanpur specifically. Kanpur was particularly affected by three factors. First,
Kanpur’s economy was adversely affected by the economic liberalization initiated in 1991 and the closure
of large mills and, unlike most other Tier 1 or Tier 2 cities, Kanpur entered a prolonged decline (until 2004).
Second, while the city did benefit from JnNURM support during most of its fragile recovery starting in
2005, the lack of adequate fiscal capacity to meet city-level co-financing requirements under the scheme
limited the extent of its access to infrastructure programs. Compared with economically more successful
cities, Kanpur’s investment spending remained very low: the low share of transfers to the city as part of
total state financing reflected limited devolution, while the low level of transfers also reflected the low per
capita income in the state, resulting in particularly low levels of transfers to the city. Third, the completion
of the Delhi-Kolkata segment (in 2008) of the GQ highway network has facilitated Kanpur’s recovery by
providing improved connectivity and market accessibility for its manufacturing firms.

Comparing Kanpur and Coimbatore, the fragmentation of the private sector and the local political
economy in Kanpur, as opposed to greater social cohesion and cross-membership of industry
associations in Coimbatore, led to different growth trajectories.71 City-level proactive interventions in
three areas were analyzed in detail in Kanpur. First, strategic alliances between the local private sector and
state-level authorities were critical in the development of industrial infrastructure. In Kanpur, small groups
of firms or selected business associations were able to tap into state support for industrial parks. However,
the economic impact on the city of these alliances was limited because common sector- or economy-wide
benefits were not factored in. In Kanpur, alliances between the local private sector and the state were
temporary (exigent on conducive political economy conditions) and limited in scope. In contrast, the local
private sector in Coimbatore, being well-organized and benefitting from cross-membership across
associations, successfully attracted wholly privately-developed industrial infrastructure and—in some
cases—managed to establish long-term institutionalized collaboration with the state, in the context of a
comparatively stable political context. Second, some segments in the Kanpur economy were able to connect
to global markets and diversify, with the support of foreign buyers, mostly without city/state/central
government support. In Coimbatore, local industry associations and the Chamber of Commerce played a
larger role in helping firms to diversify their products and markets, thereby enhancing the impact on the
city’s economy. Third, while major educational and training institutions remained inadequately utilized,
the few firms in Kanpur that have made connections with research and training have used this as a
cornerstone of growth. In Coimbatore, close industry-academia linkages, based on a history of direct
intervention by the local private sector in establishing relevant technical colleges, schools and hospitals, are
a central pillar of Coimbatore’s economic success.

The “growth coalitions” that were a common feature across the six economically successful cities
analyzed elsewhere diverge from Kanpur’s ad hoc alliances between narrowly organized private
firms and the state, with detrimental consequences. According to the World Bank Groups’ report on
Competitive Cities for Jobs and Growth, “no single formula for city success has been observed, but rather
a combination of well-thought-out responses to specific local circumstances.” 72 The successful cities used
the full scope and capacity of the city administration, created growth coalitions and established linkages
with other levels of government and neighboring jurisdictions. Private firms, business associations, and
other stakeholder groups were involved in the implementation of their city economic development strategies
and interventions, though not to the same extent in all cities. Their involvement included, but was not
limited to, providing financial and in-kind resources, acting as the city’s public champions, collaborating
with educational institutions to train workers and design adequate programs, and in some cases—most
dramatically in Coimbatore—actually led several of the local development efforts. In Kanpur, the private
sector operated within a local socio-political context that influenced the outcomes of the interventions made
by it, and in some cases this impeded economic development. Social and political fragmentation of the
private sector creates challenges for developing common resources. Poorer sections of the population who
constitute the working class find little or no voice in growth coalitions, creating challenges for urban and
industrial park development, as well as adversely impacting the quality of life. Lastly, despite the presence
of technical training institutes and a pr oactive private sector, these “ingredients” of city success have not
been properly used in Kanpur due to the absence of a local coordinating body.

From these lessons and the contrast with Coimbatore, some insights emerge as to what city-level
initiatives may improve the prospects for Kanpur and other cities facing similar conditions, factors
and challenges:

         1. Widening the membership of industry associations and facilitating cross-association
            membership. Kanpur’s socio-political history resulted in a fragmented private sector.
            However, the private sector will have to overcome these obstacles if it is to become a stronger
            voice in the state and ensure that state-led investments or state co-financing in industrial
            infrastructure meet the needs of firms.
         2. Broadening the coalitions that seek strategic alliances with the state to ensure more
            institutionalized benefits. While ad hoc and narrow alliances have provided some benefits in
            terms of industrial infrastructure, other semi-public goods (such a training, research and testing
            facilities) are likely to require a broader base to facilitate this type of institutional development.
         3. Establishing relevant local academic/training institutions. The presence of major
            educational and training institutions remains inadequately utilized in Kanpur, while the few
            firms that have made connections with research and training have used these as a cornerstone
            of growth. While the gap between Kanpur’s first-class academic institutions and largely low-
            tech industry may not be easy to overcome, the example of Coimbatore shows that it can pay
            off for firms to invest in local academic/training institutes.

The local private sector can thus play an important role in re-starting economic development efforts
in Kanpur, but by itself may only achieve limited results. Kanpur’s leather sector was able to sustain
itself and grow by accessing global markets. These linkages changed local business practices by ensuring
better compliance with environmental and labor regulations (although firms routinely outsource work to
smaller firms that may not comply). Global markets also fostered innovation through transfers of
technology and knowledge, which local firms leveraged to attain competitive advantages. However, the
private sector remains dependent on local government actors for the effective provision of public and semi-
public goods that are essential to share the full potential of these opportunities more widely, such as market

For Kanpur to play its role in Uttar Pradesh’s ambitious development targets, the central and state
governments could:

         1. Increase transfers to the Kanpur Nagar Nigam, first to allow it to cover the costs of the
            maintenance roles assigned to it and, over time and with increasing ULB capacity, to
            allow it to fulfil its other allocated functions. With the municipal government disempowered,
            there is no voice for poorer sections of the population in decision-making processes. The
            industrial parks/estates that were established by local industry-state alliances have limited
            longer-term benefits when not paired with supporting infrastructure for workers and city-level
            (government) capacity for maintenance.
         2. Place the burden of industrial park location decisions, land purchases, and park design
            and operation on those best placed to undertake them and navigate the local political
            economy of implementation, namely the future occupiers of the park. 73 Experience from
            industrial park programs globally, and in India in particular, suggests that programs that take
            into account the needs of the private sector, on location and design in particular, but also local
            political economy conditions, are more likely to attract investment and be self-sustaining. This
            is the case in and around Coimbatore, where several industrial parks have been built through
            the Scheme for Industrial Textiles Parks (SITP) and other similar schemes, which put the
            entrepreneurs in charge, with financial support from the government and technical support from
            a dedicated project management agencies. Moreover, Coimbatore has also seen successful park
            development that was purely private-sector led. In contrast, park projects that have been only
            government-led, with little or no private sector input, as was often the case in Kanpur, have
            generally resulted in low investment and a limited ability to adapt to business needs and
            maintain adequate levels of maintenance.
         3. Facilitate public investments that increase the quality of life in the city. Low quality of life
            makes it harder to attract skilled, technical and entrepreneurial talent from outside the city. It
            also leads to graduates trained at IIT Kanpur —the city’s premier and globally renowned
            educational institution—leaving the city on completion of their training.

While Kanpur’s recent economic recovery provides hope, it remains fragile. The recent and hard
fought recovery of Kanpur’s SMEs can largely be explained by their fragmented ad hoc initiatives over the
past decade to form linkages with state authorities on one side and foreign markets on the other. However,
the narrow scope and fragility of these alliances present a major challenge to the city’s economic prospects,
as reflected in Kanpur’s slower growth rate in the most recent period compared with its peers. Kanpur’s
future will hinge on the ability of all stakeholders involved fostering the formation of more broad-based
growth coalitions and linkages, in order to mobilize the public and semi-public goods to translate the city’s
potential into wider, stronger, and more sustainable economic benefits.
