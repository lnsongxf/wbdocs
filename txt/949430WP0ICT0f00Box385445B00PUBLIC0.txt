This report was prepared as a strategic input to the Results Measurement and Monitoring Group of the
Bank’s HNP Global Practice. One objective of the group is to support governments in strengthening
information and communication technologies for health (e-health) to enhance the implementation of
Universal Health Coverage (UHC) programs and projects in low and middle income countries.

Abstract: ICT for health—or eHealth—solutions hold great potential for generating systemic efficiencies
by strengthening five critical pillars of a health system: human resources for health, supply chain
management, health care financing, governance and service delivery, and infrastructure. This report
describes the changing landscape of eHealth initiatives through these five pillars, with a geographic focus
on Sub-Saharan Africa. This report further details seven criteria, or prerequisites, that must be considered
and addressed in order to effectively establish and scale up ICT-based solutions in the health sector.
These criteria include infrastructure, data and interoperability standards, local capacity, policy and
regulatory environments, an appropriate business model, alignment of partnerships and priorities, and
monitoring and evaluation. In order to bring specific examples of these criteria to light, this report
concludes with 12 specific case studies of potentially scalable ICT-based health care solutions currently
being implemented across the globe at community, national, and regional levels. This report is intended
to be used by development practitioners, including task team leaders at the World Bank, to strengthen
their understanding of the use of ICT to support health systems strengthening (HSS) efforts as well as to
highlight critical prerequisites needed to optimize the benefits of ICT for health.

                                     EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
It is well known that information and communication technologies (ICT) have the potential to transform
health services delivery by strengthening health systems in developing countries, especially for rural and
underserved populations.

This report is intended for use by development practitioners, including task team leaders at the World
Bank, to strengthen their understanding of the use of ICT to support health systems strengthening (HSS)
efforts as well as to highlight critical prerequisites that are needed to optimize the benefits of ICT for
health efforts. The bulk of examples in this report focus geographically on sub-Saharan Africa (SSA),
though the discussions and lessons carry relevance across regions.

The report frames the discussion of ICT for health around five core pillars of a health system: human
resources for health (HRH), supply chain management, health care financing, governance and service
delivery, and infrastructure. As such, examples of ICT solutions highlighted throughout this report include
the use of ICT to improve the professional capacity and performance of HRH; increase the reliability and
predictability of the procurement, delivery, and stocking of health materials and supplies; prevent disease
and promote public health by obtaining data from patients and health consumers; democratize access to
and rating of health information and services by consumers; and reduce health care expenditures.

Despite the potentially transformative nature of ICT for health, or eHealth, in strengthening health
systems, many projects in African countries remain at the pilot stage and are unable to be scaled up even
when robust evaluations of these pilots show positive results. This difficulty in scaling up pilot projects is
linked to a number of structural and institutional weaknesses that are often not sufficiently addressed in
many ICT interventions, resulting in suboptimal benefits and operational inefficiencies. (Skoll World
Forum, 2013)

In this context, the report details seven criteria, or prerequisites, that must be addressed in order to
effectively establish and scale up ICT-based solutions in SSA health systems: infrastructure; data and
interoperability standards; local capacity; policy and regulatory environments; an appropriate business
model; alignment of partnerships and priorities; and monitoring and evaluation. Each criterion is
discussed with reference to examples from particular developing countries that are currently grappling
with these issues.

In addition, these criteria are explored in greater depth through a set of 12 specific case studies of
potentially scalable ICT-based health care solutions currently being implemented across the globe at
community, national, and regional levels. The common themes and indicators of success across these
promising innovations include the need to strategically leverage existing (even if limited) infrastructure, to
design for interoperability across health centers and systems, to strengthen rather than ignore local
capacity, to consider the need for specific policies and regulations, to employ a sustainable business
model, to develop thoughtful partnerships that align with national and local priorities, and to build in robust
monitoring and evaluation systems.

                       PART I – INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT

Information is a critical organizational ingredient in improving in the availability, quality, and financing of
health care. Health care is increasingly an information-based service: an effective public health care
system is one in which the right information gets to the right person at the right time in order to support
evidence-based decision making. Systematically collected and appropriately analyzed data can provide
information to guide improvement at all levels of the health care system and can hold providers and
institutions accountable to the patients they aim to serve. Moving toward this goal in the SSA region
would, in principle, enable more rapid, more widely scaled, and more significant improvements to health
care access for many of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable populations ( Crean 2010).

Traditional approaches to improving basic health care delivery, therefore, are giving way to a paradigm
shift toward the view that ICT can play a pivotal role in rapidly increasing access to data and information,
and, in so doing, strengthen the Health, Nutrition, and Population (HNP) sector (Box 1 provides definitions
and labels for common terminology). In particular, the availability of affordable Internet technologies in
developing countries, combined with tremendous growth in the number of mobile phone subscriptions
worldwide—spiking from 0.7 billion in 2000 to 6 billion by 2010, 77 percent of which are now in the
developing world (World Bank 2012)—has led the development community to explore and develop
innovative, and in some cases transformational, ICT solutions that attempt to overcome health systems
challenges, particularly in low-resource settings (infoDev 2007; WHO 2011; Vital Wave Consulting 2009).

To date, however, many eHealth solutions, particularly in the SSA region, have faced logistical and
resource constraints that restrict progress towards the results envisaged. Many interventions remain in
formative stages and are applied only at the margins, rather than as central components of HSS. Many
eHealth solutions are constrained by challenges such as poor ICT infrastructure and access, particularly
in rural settings where these solutions could have the greatest impact. Specific, often local eHealth
solutions can be efficient in meeting short-term information needs, but may not be scalable outside of
their project area since they are unable to be integrated with other data systems, or adapted by other,
similar programs elsewhere (Mair et al. 2012). As a result, ICT investments in SSA health systems have
not been optimized to produce the broad, systemwide impacts or long-term sustainability that were
predicted. Instead, many promising ICT solutions remain at the pilot stage.


Box 1: ICT for Health: Definition and Labels

The use of ICT in health care has engendered a number of related labels and definitions over the past 20
years as new technologies have emerged. They include information and communication technologies
(ICT), information and communication technologies for development (ICT4D), telemedicine, electronic
health (eHealth), and mobile health (mHealth). These are often used interchangeably, yet each implies its
own perspective.

In addition to discussing ICT for health, this paper will also use the term eHealth as a generic label for all
ICT-based health-related activities, including mobile phone –based health interventions (mHealth). As
defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), “eHealth is the cost-effective and secure use of
information and communications technologies in support of health and health-related fields, including
health-care services, health surveillance, health literature, and health education, knowledge and
research” (World Health Assembly 2005, 121). According to a broader explanation by Pagliari, “The term
characterizes not only a technical development, but also a new way of working, an attitude, and a
commitment for networked, global thinking, to improve health care locally, regionally, and worldwide by
using information and communication technology” ( Pagliari et al. 2005).

can be empowered to take control of their health care needs, do not need to provide the same information
many times over, can avoid unnecessary multiple examinations, enjoy faster access to providers by using
electronic booking systems, and have access to their own data. Health centers and hospitals enjoy
better coordination of health care resources, optimized system performance and coordination, improved
safety, and better disease surveillance and management (infoDev 2006).

eHealth applications can be strategically applied to five core areas of health systems strengthening (HSS)
(see Box 2): (1) human resources for health (HRH), (2) supply chain management, (3) health care
financing, (4) governance and service delivery, and (5) infr astructure. Each of these system’s pillars is
underpinned by a variety of activities and developed and implemented by relevant technical expertise (for
example, HRH experts, pharmaceutical experts, and so on). Many of these activities in turn can be
supported, improved, and extended by the judicious use of ICT, which brings the above-discussed
benefits for physicians, patients, and medical organizations, and thus the health system as a whole.

To date, and as highlighted in Table 1, the majority of eHealth applications implemented in the SSA
region have been directed toward the HRH and the governance and service delivery pillars. Nevertheless,
there are still important opportunities for eHealth in the other three pillars: public financing and health
insurance, supply chain management, and infrastructure. The following section provides a brief overview
of the use of eHealth applications areas across all five HSS pillars. Rather than an exhaustive listing of
applications within each area, illustrative examples are provided; some of these are elaborated in the
case study discussion in Part IV of this report.

                                   HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH

Africa and developing countries throughout the world are experiencing an HRH crisis: a situation in which
health workers are few in number, inequitably distributed, and do not perform well.

In response to this crisis, ICT tools have been developed and used to improve the performance of health
workers by linking providers with each other for advice, using e-learning platforms to deliver training even
in faculty-scarce areas, enhancing health management information systems (HMIS) for health-worker
monitoring and accountability, and applying tools for diagnosis and treatment support. These systems can
also assist in task shifting, by providing lower level staff with clinical decision support tools needed to
expand the range of interventions they can treat and providing medical oversight as needed.

Examples of these tools include Switchboard’s MDNet program—a free, closed calling network available
only to registered physicians, connecting doctors’ mobile phones in Ghana—which removes the cost and
connectivity barriers to doctors seeking advice or assistance from their peers. Recent ICT solutions
developed by Amref Health Africa—the largest African-led healthcare organization on the continent,
which provides health training and health services—have facilitated the piloting of e-learning software and
infrastructure to deliver theoretical modules of the midwifery curricula to rural areas, increasing the skills
and competencies of health workers despite a lack of on-the-ground faculty.




                                                    3
Other ICT solutions provide clinical and diagnostic support to providers by making medical knowledge,
care schedules, and patient data more readily accessible. Electronic health records (EHR) provide one
way to better serve patients by having patient medical history data available. Specifically, an electronic
health record system such as OpenMRS (now being used in 23 low-income countries) conveniently runs
off any computer operating system, can function on laptops, requires no expert programming to tailor the
system, and provides users with tools for data analysis and reporting within a single, integrated system.
Dimagi’s CommCare system similarly supports HRH by providing free and open source case
management software that runs on inexpensive mobile phones. Workers can complete and submit patient
registration forms on the phone, review checklists and danger signs, and be reminded of key health
knowledge via educational prompts.


                                     SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

Weak supply chain systems across low-income countries often result in remote health posts being
understocked or out of stock of essential commodities, including pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the WHO
estimates between 10 percent and 30 percent of drugs that do make it to shelves in the developing world
are probably counterfeit, putting millions of lives at unnecessary risk of death and disease if those
medicines make it into the system unnoticed.

ICT tools can play a role in monitoring stock levels as well as monitoring the legitimacy of
pharmaceuticals. eHealth can be used to support anti-counterfeiting measures, to manage supply chain
(inventory, stockouts), to support cold chain management, and to enable back-end financial transactions.
Although the application of possible solutions is at an early stage of development, current ongoing efforts
include StopStockouts, which allows field-level health workers to text (via short message service, or SMS)
accounts of stockouts on their mobile phones to a central database. These accounts are then converted,
via Global Positioning System (GPS) data, to a geographic visualization of the problem in order to alert
administrators and supervisors of the issue. Additionally, the organization mPedigree employs Sproxil, a
technology that can track counterfeit drugs in developing nations through barcodes and unique
identification mechanisms.


                                       HEALTH CARE FINANCING

Financial barriers to both receiving and providing quality care are a core bottleneck in the provision of
health services in many countries. There have already been significant efforts to integrate ICT into health
financing in many African nations, namely financial management systems like enterprise resource
planning (ERP) software, and systems to support the operation of national health insurance plans like
Ghana’s Claims Management System, supported by the World Bank’s Health Insurance Project. However
when it comes to the capacity for individual patients to manage their health finances, it is problematic that
the number of people globally who have no bank account but are in possession of a mobile phone is
estimated at 1.7 billion.

For these individuals, efficient health care financing mechanisms can help to improve health outcomes by
increasing their ability to pay for services, and by streamlining health systems management and
eliminating waste in procurement and payment systems. The proliferation of mobile money (or mMoney)
through systems such as M-PESA in Kenya, for example, have allowed even low-income people to
manage small payments from their mobile phones without requiring a bank account.

Access to traditional health insurance or savings accounts remains limited in developing countries.
Currently, the pairing of mobile technologies and offline mobile money agents has created the field of


                                                   4
mobile finance services (MFS), which enables mobile operators to act as banks, taking the place of ATMs
or bank branches. But such tools are not yet widespread. Of the 630 mobile network operators in the
world, only 124 mobile network operators have implemented mMoney systems. Companies such as
Changamka MicroHealth Ltd (an integrated health finance company in Kenya), however, have succeeded
in making prepaid smart cards available to the public. These cards allow users to obtain specific kinds of
health care at designated health facilities, and can be topped up by the mMoney system M-PESA or
physical terminals.

Opportunities for the worlds of personal finance and health to overlap to strengthen the health system are
numerous, since both systems require components such as user IDs, identity authentication, and security
measures. For example, integrating mobile money systems into healthcare management could result in
efficiencies for both supply and demand sides. Hospitals could more easily manage innovative provider
payment systems, such as the increasingly popular pay-for-performance schemes, and could more easily
collect health insurance premiums and payments from patients, such as through voucher schemes for
specific types of care. (USAID, 2013) The integration of health and financial systems promises a quicker,
more cost-effective, and more efficient delivery of health services in developing countries.


                                GOVERNANCE AND SERVICE DELIVERY

Health systems across the developing world are hampered by weak service delivery and governance
structures. Traditional paper-based reporting systems, for example, can hamper service delivery efforts
by distracting the time and attention of health workers from service delivery to data entry. Relatedly,
inadequate time and effort dedicated to this process can result in inaccurate and incomplete data.
Upstream, the absence of timely, readily accessible and accurate data can lead to reduced evidence-
based decision making, thereby negatively impacting governance efforts.

ICT can play an important role in improving healthcare governance primarily by improved data collection
efforts. These efforts, which in themselves also improve service delivery efforts, include ICT-based
mechanisms for referrals, tele-consultation, remote disease surveillance and health promotion initiatives.
Mobile phone–based data collection tools, for example, can save health workers time as well as data
entry and transportation costs associated with paper-based systems. In 2011, a World Bank–supported
project in Guatemala, for example, reported a 71 percent decrease in data collection costs when using
the Episurveyor program on a mobile phone compared to paper-based data entry. The nongovernmental
organization (NGO) Partners in Health employed a personal digital assistant for tuberculosis results
collection; its processing time of 6.2 days was significantly lower than baseline and control days, and
reduced errors from 10.1 percent to 2.8 percent. When designed appropriately, free and customizable
software such as Episurveyor, OpenXData, and Open Data Kit can enable remote data collection that is
faster, more accurate, and less costly than existing paper systems. Even more importantly, the higher-
level benefit of such systems is that by improving the quality of diagnosis, clinical follow-up, and referrals,
health systems can improve the quality of health data as well. When data is more easily collected, in user
friendly ways that evidence immediate benefit to the provider collecting the information, the data becomes
important to the person generating it, and the quality of the data collection process improves, with more
end-user buy-in.

Incorporating the ability to track and record GPS locations adds to the surveillance capabilities of ICT
tools. This is particularly helpful in emergency disaster relief scenarios. RapidSMS, InSTEDD’s GeoChat,
and Ushahidi are all technologies that have been used to assist governments with rapid response to
emergencies from famine to flooding and earthquakes.

The governance of health systems also involves promotion of public health to encourage healthier
behaviors that avoid future treatment costs. Many efforts have been launched to creatively use mobile

                                                    5
phones to engage citizens in their own personal health promotion. This includes the Praekelt
Foundation’s Project Masiluleke, a program that offers free information about HIV testing locations via
customer mobile phones. Praekelt sent more than 690 million text messages and provided HIV testing
information in six local languages; this resulted in 1.5 million calls to a local AIDS helpline.


                                            INFRASTRUCTURE

The health system in which human resources, commodities, health financing, and governance and
service delivery systems interact requires appropriate infrastructure. ICT tools can help develop
infrastructure, but “soft” and “hard” forms. Soft infrastructure includes data collection and HMIS, payment
and reimbursement systems, and logistics and management systems. Hard infrastructure that could be
improved by ICT initiatives includes asset management and maintenance systems, including biomedical
equipment maintenance, which maintain the useful life of facilities and equipment. Traditionally, health
systems in developing nations lack the resources to maintain facilities and equipment, and this comes at
major costs to the system.

ICT-based solutions for infrastructure that have been successful in systems outside the developing world
include systems like software that schedules and manages preventative and emergency maintenance of
large equipment and high-volume facilities. Solutions also exist at the individual level, not only within
systems, such as mobile phone–based tools that eliminate poor roads as a reason for not seeking care.
Mobile phone voice response menus, for example, can be used to provide real-time disease management
information to patients with chronic illnesses, or to spread information quickly during epidemics, thus
ensuring that patients have access to life-saving care even when infrastructure like roads are not
available. Mobile solutions (mHealth) are not as dependent on consistent power supplies as computer-
based solutions, which are problematic in rural settings where reliable electrical connections are rare. In
an evaluation of the WelTel program in Kenya, 62 percent of HIV positive patients who received text
message reminders about their medication adhered to their regimen, compared to 50 percent in the
control group. Additionally, suppressed viral loads were reported for 57 percent of the text message
recipients, compared to only 48 percent in the control group.

   PART III – ESTABLISHING AND SCALING ICT-BASED SOLUTIONS

While international donors and health agencies have increased investment in ICT to support HSS in
recent years, investment and policy approaches to eHealth initiatives often result in a proliferation of pilot
efforts rather than efforts to scale projects (infoDev 2006). Systems and applications are often developed
and implemented ad hoc, to meet the immediate requirements of specific activities, with a limited focus on
scalability. As a result, solutions that are successful in one locale are often unable to be integrated with
other data systems or adopted by other, similar programs. Figure 1 shows an example of donor-driven
“pilotitis” in Uganda by 2010; this includes over 50 eHealth projects from almost as many donors.
Uganda’s Ministry of Health has temporarily placed a moratorium on mHealth projects until the finalization
of a national eHealth policy and strategy. This tremendous duplication of effort results not only in a waste
of resources, but also in more complicated health systems. Rather than improve information flows among
stakeholders, a series of nonintegrated health systems create disjointed “information islands” that
become barriers to effective communication. Furthermore, the useful lifespan of many projects is often
determined by the availability of limited donor funding, and thus many cease to operate once initial
development funding ends.

Piloting, while useful for demonstrating the feasibility of new approaches, tends to encourage small-scale
thinking, even when a pilot has demonstrated new and better ways of providing services. The challenge
of sustainably growing effective ICT-based solutions from pilot to scale has been the focus of several
recent studies (Lemaire 2011; Management Sciences for Health 2007). These studies, as well as
resources like the WHO/ITU’s 2012 National eHealth Strategy Toolkit, all reach similar conclusions on the
seven elements that are necessary for developing scalable eHealth solutions:

        1. Adequate physical infrastructure
        2. Data and interoperability standards
        3. Sufficient local capacity
        4. Supportive policy and regulatory environment, including an integrated national eHealth
           strategy
        5. Appropriate business model
        6. Thoughtful partnerships aligned with national and local priorities
        7. Effective monitoring and evaluation (M&E)

Note: Red dots represent mHealth projects; the larger the dot, the more mHealth project activity.



The first four elements (infrastructure, standards, capacity, and policy) are closely tied to scalability, while
the remaining three elements (business model, alignment of partnerships with priorities, and M&E) impact
the potential sustainability of an initiative. Although each element can be described independently, it is
important to realize that these elements represent different perspectives within the health care
ecosystem, and they interact synergistically. The following sections discuss each in greater detail.



                                ADEQUATE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

A fundamental requirement for implementation and scaling of eHealth systems is the availability of
adequate technological infrastructure. Physical infrastructure across the Africa region, though still lagging

                                                     8
behind much of the rest of the world, has continued to improve rapidly, particularly in the area of
telecommunications and mobile telephony.

Consequently, mHealth tools have become some of the most popular eHealth innovations to date. While
fixed-line telephone service remains sparse and service is often poor, mobile telephony has become
increasingly accessible and the costs of mobile use and ownership are falling. Currently, the mobile
penetration rate in the Africa region is 54 percent. It is expected that this will increase steadily over time to
approximately 75 percent, or around 700 million connections by 2016 (GSMA 2012).

Another feature that makes mHealth more attractive than other eHealth solutions is that mobile solutions
are not as dependent on consistent power supply as computer-based solutions, which are problematic in
rural settings where reliable electricity connections are rare. Furthermore, as solar power chargers slowly
become more available in African markets, modest mobile handsets remain less power-intensive than
complex computer systems.

Like mobile telephony, Internet access is also increasing across the continent. However, there is still a
tremendous gap between most African countries and the rest of the world. At the end of 2011, Internet
penetration across Africa was about 13.5 percent, compared with a world average of about 36 percent,
with wide variations across countries. Kenya, for example, had a penetration rate of over 25 percent while
in Tanzania only 2.5 percent of the population had access to the Internet . Notably, 80 percent of African
Internet users log online via mobile phones, not desktop or laptop computers or tablets (Miniwatts
Marketing Group 2011). However, although current Internet access remains low, particularly in rural
areas, this scenario is likely to change rapidly over the next few years. Many African countries are
upgrading their internal digital infrastructure, and international Internet connectivity is rapidly moving from
satellites to high bandwidth undersea cables.


                               DATA AND INTEROPERABILITY STANDARDS

The function of a health information system (HIS), within which there are various components that require
thoughtful design to function interoperably, is to collect relevant data and transform those data into
actionable information for health care providers, system administrators, and health policy makers. In
general, the organization that has commissioned the HIS and its various components will define and
develop its functional requirements based on needs for analytical outputs and, in effect, data and
information to support evidence-based decision making.

HISs that run efficiently and support effective decision making are built upon well-defined requirements.
However, scalability issues can arise if the requirements are too restrictive. Creating a HIS that produces
detailed data on a small pilot project can be inexpensive and implemented quickly. However, once a
project aims to scale, this approach can become expensive and operationally complex. Inevitably, the
informational needs of end users change over time within a single institution; needs vary across
organizational units within a single organization as well, meaning that highly restricted systems must be
amended frequently to accommodate changing needs. Furthermore, when attempts are made to extend a
restricted system beyond an original user community, issues such as problems with security, reliability,
and maintainability are often exposed. These issues are magnified as a system grows, and are often not
resolvable without a complete redevelopment effort.

A more cost-effective and less complex approach to building HIS “rules” and requirements is one that
values linked systems and interoperability, and in low-resource settings these goals can often be best
achieved through the use of open standards. Open standards are a set of customizable information
system standards publicly available for free or at a nominal charge, and developed and maintained

                                                     9
through collaborative and consensus-driven processes. Key elements of open standards include (ITU
2005):


   Collaborative development: A transparent, consensus-driven process that is open to all interested
    parties, and is not dominated by any single interest group.
   Due process: A community of developers who are considerate of and responsive to comments by
    interested parties.

   Intellectual property rights: IPRs that are licensed to all applicants on a worldwide,
    nondiscriminatory basis.

   Quality and level of detail: Mass participation of global talent that enables the development of a
    variety of competing implementations of interoperable products and services.
   Publicly available: Development processes that are easily available for implementation and use, at
    free or reasonable prices.
   Ongoing support: Systems that are maintained and supported over a long period of time.
In addition to general adherence to Open Standards by country governments, international donors can
also play a cooperative role by committing to the “Principles for Digital Development,” a modified version
of the 2009 Greentree Consensus that “represents a concerted effort by donors to capture the most
important lessons learned by the development community in the implementation of information and
communications technology for development projects.” (ICT4D Principles, 2014). The current version of
the principles features the use of Open Standards as one of nine core principles, and was developed
together by major development partners such as The World Bank.



                                     SUFFICIENT LOCAL CAPACITY

Insufficient local capacity to implement and maintain eHealth solutions can be a significant bottleneck to
their scalability and sustainability. eHealth solutions in low-income countries are commonly developed
and implemented under contract by donor-funded NGOs, allowing systems to be developed and
implemented quickly at little or no cost to local organizations. However, without sufficient software
development and implementation expertise at the local level, and without ex-ante attention to scalability,
projects are rarely scalable or sustainable after temporary, foreign “experts” complete an initial launch.
Furthermore, technically qualified human capacity is not needed only in the development phase of an
initiative, but also in its system implementation and maintenance. Investment in human capacity,
therefore, must be prioritized across all phases of a system life-cycle.


Currently, there are many examples of innovation and technology incubators across Sub-Saharan Africa
that can provide skilled local information technology (IT) talent. High-profile centers include The
Innovation Hub in South Africa: Africa’s first internationally accredited Science and Technology Park and
home of the Open Innovation Solution Exchange, providing 47 tech businesses with Wi-Fi, professional
mentorship, and a community of peer innovators. Other centers include Kenya’s iHub in Nairobi, with
nearly 13,000 members; IceAddis in Ethiopia, with more than 500 active members; Botswan a’s
Innovation Hub; Zambia’s BongoHive; Uganda’s Outbox Hub; the iLab in Liberia; and the online network
AfriLabs, which successfully implemented Apps4Africa and comprises 14 hubs and labs across Africa.
When donors work collaboratively with these centers and their IT talent, local capacity can be fully utilized
and projects can be made more sustainable.



                                                   10
Investing in local IT talent is also beneficial to the scalability of projects because innovators in low-
resource settings, often by necessity, employ open source software options rather than paying for private
software. Open source software use means that:

           Software is freely distributable;
           Source code is included in the distribution, or the process of obtaining it is well publicized;
           Derived works and modifications are allowed; and
           Licensing is neither product-specific nor restrictive of other software, and is technology-
            neutral. 1


The open source development model is collaborative, as users are co-developers and maintainers of the
system. The strengths of this collaborative approach include lower total cost of ownership, better
functionality and security, and localization of the solution. The participatory, community-based open
source model also fits naturally with cooperative development approaches that emphasize local
ownership, knowledge sharing, public-private partnerships, and communities of practice. Resources
specific for health system managers—such as the California HealthCare Foundation’s 2006 report, “Open
Source Software: A Primer for Healthcare Leaders”—detail the steps necessary for implementing
successful open source systems.
Not every aspect of open source systems is without its challenges; a flexible, low-cost system could come
with higher risks and liabilities of self-deployment; however well-orchestrated open source systems can
avoid these potential pitfalls with rigorous pre-implementation, iterative testing and training for system
users, to identify and fix any system weaknesses and to familiarize all users with the system to increase a
sense of ownership. Coming full circle, the very cooperative nature of open source makes it is easy to
create additional opportunities for building local IT capacity to support sustainability (van Reijswoud and
de Jager 2008).


                       SUPPORTIVE POLICY AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS

In the past, telecommunications have not been a major focus of national health policies. If included at all,
telecommunications were seen as basic support infrastructure that allowed facilities to communicate via
phone and, more recently, e-mail. But with the increasing ubiquity of telecommunications infrastructure
and new communications norms, a more explicit acknowledgment of ICT within health policies,
particularly regarding mHealth programs, is necessary (Dzenowagis 2005). Until such arrangements are
fully coordinated, in an environment of pilotitis, most eHealth projects will remain limited in size and
externally funded, and they will operate outside of existing policy and regulatory structures.


In order to appropriately inform the eHealth strategy, including the scaling of pilots to national or regional
levels, country governments must develop policy frameworks to coordinate the large number of
stakeholders engaged in eHealth interventions—including ministries of health, finance, gender, social
planning/development, education, and telecommunications. Furthermore, these pilots must fit into a
coordinated growth strategy, as in the Ghanaian Ministry of Health’s National e-Health Strategy.2 This
strategy outlines implementation plans for governance of the eHealth systems, stakeholder involvement,

and coordinating mechanisms, thereby ensuring that all relevant government offices work efficiently
together to support the system. Section 7.0 on Implementation Arrangements of the strategy states:
       A number of the action areas serve as pilot stages. Mechanisms will be put in place to review such
       projects and use the lessons for scaling up where necessary. Such projects will therefore have
       suﬃcient scope for evaluation and the design of scale up programmes as part of the plan. (Ghana
       E-Health Strategy)

According to the WHO’s Global Observatory for eHealth, only thirteen countries in Sub-Saharan Africa
have formally established eHealth as part of their national health strategies (WHO, 2015). Several more
have developed mHealth committees, task forces, and working groups within their ministries of health to
begin the work of integrating mobile technology into health policies and regulations. However, various
stakeholders in the public and private sectors are not always aware of newly developed policies and
strategies. Many national operational plans feature increased cooperation with mobile network operators
(MNOs), the private sector bodies responsible for managing mobile telephony networks and key partners
in the development of national-level mHealth practices and policies. Appendix A provides additional
information about national eHealth planning across Sub-Saharan Africa.

Furthermore, at a transnational level, policy and regulatory issues become even more critical to the
scalability of eHealth projects. Restrictive transnational telecommunications regulations, for example, can
hinder the implementation of ICT-based health system solutions, by impeding important opportunities to
take advantage of economies of scale. In this regard, it is crucial for countries to work together and, when
relevant, together with MNOs across national borders, to build harmonized eHealth policies.


                                   APPROPRIATE BUSINESS MODEL

In order to deliver an eHealth product or service in a sustainable way, ministries of health and donor
agencies, together with the MNOs responsible for managing mobile networks, must have a coherent view
of the elements that constitute an ICT service’s business model. The core componen ts of any business
model are highly relevant to the development and implementation of eHealth systems in low-resource
settings, and include:
      Resources required: What inputs are needed to supply the service or product?
      Value proposition: How will clients benefit from the product? What is the product’s ability to
       improve efficiency, quality, and transparency of services?

    Market definition: Who are the beneficiaries and payers, and what is their willingness and ability
     to pay?

    Distribution channel: How will services and products be delivered to customers?
    Organizational format: What roles, including both staff and partners, are required to provide the
     product or service, and who will fill each role?
    Long-term viability: How will costs be covered or profit generated?


The business model should clearly identify how the initiative will remain financially sustainable beyond
initial pilot funding and how it will continue to add value as the user base expands. Without a thorough
consideration of all financial costs associated with eHealth programs, scale and sustainability are unlikely.
This requires a realistic consideration of the full cost of a service —the total cost of ownership (TCO)—
including hardware, software, servers, workstations, installation costs, warranties and licenses,
operational expenses, system maintenance, training costs, and replacements over a system’s useful

                                                   12
lifespan. However, often only initial technology-related costs are considered in calculations; these
represent only about 10–30 percent of the overall TCO, with 50–70 percent of costs attributable to costs
such as personnel training, system maintenance, and administration (MacCormack 2003).

Components of TCO, such as personnel costs, can become particularly costly to ignore, particularly in
uncoordinated eHealth systems with poor business models. For example, if data collectors within an
eHealth system are not the same people reading and analyzing those data on a daily basis, they may
perceive their work as an added burden with little value, and may commit more errors in data collection
than if they had some incentive to report the highest quality possible. eHealth solutions that do not have a
clear chain of value-add for all system users may be “sustainable” in the sense that they continue to
operate for a period of time, but the quality of data and information they produce may be quite suspect
and of little programmatic or actual value.

Furthermore, it is important for business models to articulate how an initiative will benefit each partner
within their own context, role, and responsibilities. eHealth initiatives involve many stakeholders—public-
private, government-community, and organization-individual—each of which wants to benefit from the
outcomes of the initiative. Although “social investment for the common good” is becoming a common
business model in eHealth initiatives, scale cannot be achieved if funding relies on short-term grant
opportunities or corporate social responsibility “gifts.” Given the competition for common resources, other
non eHealth models may be more profitable for stakeholders to support in the long run (Lemaire 2011).

A strong example of sustainable financing is evident in an SMS-based service launched in India in 2009,
called mDhil, which provided consumers between the ages of 17 and 25 with otherwise “taboo” health
information on sexual health and women’s health. mDhil shares content through applications on mobile
phones and desktops, and generates revenue by enabling pharmaceutical companies and other private
sector partners to sponsor content, and by charging telecom service providers for their SMS service. As
highlighted by Google’s Eric Schmidt in a 2013 article in The Times of India:
      They reach 30,000 users a day. They have attracted 5.6 million viewers of their YouTube videos.
      No one told mDhil to do this. Each of those views represents an economic benefit: a trip saved; a
      health check self-administered; a reminder on how to administer a drug safely. They did it because
      something that wasn’t possible in India before suddenly became possible and they took the
      opportunity.
Finally, it is important to highlight that a successful eHealth program capitalizes on market demand
through creative supply mechanisms that are made possible only as ICT infrastructure and tools become
more ubiquitous.


                              PARTNERSHIPS ALIGNED WITH PRIORITIES

As a project scales, the number of stakeholders involved in the project tends to grow. A greater number of
stakeholders means a greater need for the proposed eHealth solution to be aligned with their priorities.
Whereas, during the pilot phase, the benefits of an eHealth initiative are closely linked to the goals and
priorities of the pilot sites and involved organizations, as the project expands, new external
stakeholders—including national agencies and local communities —will need an eHealth solution that is
aligned with their prioritized objectives and plans.

One example of a health system coordinating multiple stakeholders around shared reform goals is the
Republic of Tanzania’s M&E Strengthening Initiative (MESI), a c omponent of the 2009-2015 Health
Sector Strategic Plan, which includes the development of an ICT strategy for the health system. In this



                                                  13
example and others, there is an explicit positioning of partnerships as value propositions, which foster
local ownership and investment in the program even when funded by global donors.

Aligning donors and stakeholders as ICT projects scale is not a simple task; expanding a project from one
geographic and cultural local to others across a country inevitably introduced challenges of building
systems that are acceptable to and followed by a diverse set of constituents. However, building an
eHealth system through the lens of both national and local priorities can lead to more committed
partnerships and thus improve uptake and support (Miniwatts Marketing Group 2011). Crafting a
partnership that is more than a symbolic connection requires a diverse body of stakeholders in content
development so that, rather than repackaging content from other locales with different sociocultural norms
and health behaviors, content is relevant, accessible, and appropriate for the levels of health literacy of
the target population.

The concept of stakeholders also goes beyond the implementation designers and the end users. As
initiatives scale, other funders who work in shared geographies also become involved. Collaborating to
leverage existing efforts and lessons learned from past projects, rather than running parallel solutions and
duplicating efforts, will result in the best possible program impact, including scale-up. Furthermore, it is
important that ICT project funders and coordinators engage with relevant ICT sector partners such as
MNOs and technology companies. Not only can private sector partners provide technical know-how,
resources, and networks that will support scale-up, but they also are aware of emerging technologies and
processes that may have a significant impact on scale-up designs. In addition, recent advances in citizen
engagement, often made possible through mobile phones, also have the potential to support expansion
and sustainability of eHealth initiatives.

                                    MONITORING AND EVALUATION

It remains critical for organizations and governments to monitor and evaluate eHealth solutions rigorously.
The potential benefits of open eHealth solutions are real and offer potentially transformative solutions for
HISs in low-income countries. However, without M&E practices in place across the eHealth field, both
donor partners and governments have a diminished capacity to make informed decisions about eHealth
investments, and thus have less confidence that these investments will lead to desired changes in health
outcomes.

Measuring the benefits of any particular eHealth solution, however, involves a complex mix of interacting
variables, and few eHealth systems are rigorously evaluated. Those which do produce evidence of
benefits may have published results in peer-reviewed literature, and still more evidence resides online
within blog posts or practitioner discussions on topic-specific listservs and cannot be found in journals.
Further, data that are available tend to focus on process improvements, rather than systemic impact on
health outcomes (Piette et al. 2012), and the strength and reliability of data that are not peer reviewed do
not always stir enough confidence to warrant investments in scaled systems.

Several online communities are now attempting to change this status quo by creating mechanisms for
more rigorously collecting and comparing eHealth evidence. One such example is the website mHealth
Evidence (http://www.mhealthevidence.org/) from the Knowledge 4 Health Initiative of USAID and Johns
Hopkins. mHealth Evidence exists as a searchable database of both peer-reviewed and gray literature on
mHealth activities globally, classified according to a harmonized taxonomy. Similarly, the NetHope Cloud
Services Community Portal presents a series of searchable, topic-specific webinars, IT strategies, and
case studies for low-resourced NGOs and nonprofits interested in integrating ICT solutions into social




                                                   14
services including health.3 Other sites, such as the Institute for Technology and Social Change, 4 offer
users university-style courses that detail existing evidence of technology creating positive impacts across
sectors and systems—including the popular course mHealth: Mobile Phones for Public Health.5

Although such initiatives are helpful, much more needs to be done to strengthen and standardize rigorous
M&E of eHealth solutions. M&E systems provide the core feedback loop that informs scale-up processes.
Ongoing M&E provides opportunities for corrective measures to be taken when necessary, and for
sharing best practices once proven. Transparent examination can also increase the willingness of
stakeholders to invest in systems by providing a way to determine the cost efficiency and return on
investment of a scaled system. As time passes and systems scale, complexity and resource-
intensiveness also increase, so work that may have been cost-effective for a single implementation may
not be when scaled to multiple implementations.

     PART IV – EHEALTH INITIATIVES OF NOTE: 12 CASE STUDIES

As previously indicated, an underlying purpose of this paper is to identify strategic opportunities for
expanding the use of ICT in health service delivery.

This section provides an overview of 12 eHealth initiatives that show promising potential for sustainable
scale beyond their current implementation. The case studies were identified following an Internet review
considering the various criteria for success. They concentrate primarily but not solely on Africa region
innovations (a focus of this study). Accordingly, the common themes and indicators of success across
these promising innovations include efforts to strategically leverage existing (even if limited) infrastructure,
design for interoperability across health centers and systems, strengthen rather than ignore local
capacity, consider the need for certain policies and regulations, employ a sustainable business model,
develop thoughtful partnerships that align with national and local priorities, and build in robust M&E
systems.

As is illustrative of the general trend, however, only very few of the cases are accompanied by a rigorous
impact evaluation, suggesting the need for some level of caution. Generally, eHealth pilots and
interventions should be considered as candidates for actual support provided that they are accompanied
by in-depth information; published, rigorous evaluations; and positive impact and results data that are
available for review. In an environment where resources are scarce, the impact of eHealth solutions on
efficiency, health outputs, or outcomes should also be accompanied by assessments of the cost-
effectiveness of the intervention. With the exception of a notable few (mainly Frontline SMS, and RAFT),
most interventions to date have been assessed by qualitative case studies or report descriptions.

The case studies presented here are grouped along a geographical axis (regional, national, community),
which reflects their defined potential market, as well as around four associated health systems pillars: (1)
HRH, (2) supply chain management, (3) health care financing, and (4) governance and service delivery
(see Table 2). A case study on the fifth pillar, infrastructure, is not discussed on its own because it
involves ICT tools that cut across each of the previous pillars (for example, websites, data collection
systems, etc.). Each initiative is described in greater detail in Appendix B (regional), C (national), and D
(community), summarizing its relevant business model and scalability.

                                         REGIONAL INITIATIVES

Three promising eHealth initiatives that reflect a regional market and hold potential for being scaled up to
a transnational implementation level are: m4RH, mPedigree, and RAFT (Table 3). Each of these
regionally focused eHealth initiatives is centered on activities that benefit from economies of scale or deal
with health issues that transcend national borders. Since health care is a highly regulated sector and
health care systems closely reflect national sociopolitical contexts, successful eHealth initiatives need to
be able to overcome, if not bridge, social and political divides. The three selected case studies
demonstrate this flexibility. A detailed description of each initiative is found in Appendix B.

Note: EAC = East African Community.


                                          NATIONAL INITIATIVES

Promising national-level eHealth initiatives with potential for scale up include Frontline SMS, ILS
Gateway, cStock, KimMNCHip, and mDhil (Table 4). The national-level marketplace of eHealth solutions
is the best established of the three geographic axes, both because tools are often developed as part of
more easily coordinated HSS efforts and because donor funding is more frequently available at this level.
Given the large number of potential ICT primed for scale, this review sought out the most unique
examples of integrating multiple ICT platforms into coherent programs that address a broad health need.
For example, consider the emerging relationship between the OpenMRS clinical record system, 6 the
Health Information Systems Program's District Health Information System (DHIS2),7 and the iHRIS suite

of human resource for health management applications. 8 Each of these open source initiatives is a leader
in its focus area and each could be extended to include functionality found in the others. But instead, the
respective communities of practice have decided to collaborate and develop a set of common
interoperability standards, paving the way toward a core national HIS that could be implemented across
many settings. A detailed description of each initiative is listed in Appendix C.

                                        COMMUNITY INITIATIVES

At the community level, some notable eHealth initiatives are MTrac, MOTECH, Changamka, and Trac FM
(Table 5). eHealth initiatives designed to serve at the community level tend to fall into two broad
categories: those that support community- level health care providers and those that focus on
empowering the individual health care consumer, thereby enhancing citizen engagement in health.
eHealth solutions that support health workers—whether these are physicians, community health workers,
or village birth attendants—are most often intended, theoretically, to support a nation’s overall health care
delivery system, and have therefore been included as national-level initiatives in this paper. eHealth
programs focused on the individual also serve to reconfigure health systems, but rather than doing so by

strengthening existing institutions, they redirect power to the patient as an active participant in achieving
health outcomes. The following case studies highlight ICT that empower individual patients to take a more
active role in their own health and to influence decisions of the health system from a community
perspective. A detailed description of each initiative is listed in Appendix D.

                                    PART V – CONCLUSION
ICT offer the potential to transform the delivery of health services. This can be particularly transformative
in developing countries, especially among rural and underserved populations. Specifically, by increasing
the availability and flow of important information, eHealth solutions hold great potential for generating
efficiencies among human resources, patients, and medical organizations and for helping to strengthen
critical pillars of a health system: HRH, supply chain management (including pharmaceuticals), health
care financing, governance and service delivery, and infrastructure. Yet, to date, the potential of ICT
remains largely unrealized; attention is being placed largely on the technologies rather than on their
integration into existing capacities and systems. In addition, small-scale, local solutions dominate the
eHealth landscape. Increased emphasis on the use of standards-based applications and open source
development models, however, is slowly beginning to shift this focus.

In an effort to highlight this changing landscape, and with an emphasis primarily on Africa, this report has
outlined seven important elements that help determine the success —in terms of scalability—of eHealth
initiatives and has highlighted 12 innovative cases that take these criteria for success into account during
both the development and implementation phases. Indeed, when contemplating further investment to
scale up eHealth, the following critical issues should be considered:
          To what degree do the health sector structure and the national regulatory framework support
           new approaches?
          Have national goals and action plans been clearly defined?

          Are there mechanisms for coordinating action in a way that links public, private, and social
           efforts?
          What progress has been made in expanding affordable ICT access?

          Are data-related standards and a regulatory and legal framework in place?

          Are there mechanisms in place for developing the capacity of program managers, health
           workers, and community members to make effective use of ICT?
          What options exist to ensure continuity and sustainability of eHealth projects and programs in
           terms of finance channels and public-private partnerships?
Although effective implementation of ICT solutions, particularly on a national or regional scale, does
require significant capital and human resources, these investments should not be viewed as diverting
funds from other health care needs. Faced with competing priorities, and despite the potential benefits
that ICT have to offer, government agencies and donors responsible for health care systems are often
faced with limited resources for implementing technology-based solutions. In this environment, a critical
consideration should be the multiplier effect that ICT tools have on scarce resources by improving access
to essential services, increasing the efficiency and quality of these services, and reducing both waste and
duplication of services (Lemaire 2011).

Problem
                 human resources limits opportunities to receive information and ask questions about
addressed
                 sexual and reproductive health.
                 The m4RH SMS system provides mobile customers with basic information about
                 contraceptive methods and nearby family planning services via a series of concise text
Strategic plan
                 messages. Reproductive health information is WHO-approved and structured according
                 to national family planning guidelines.
                    Programming software: m4RH services operating in Kenya and Tanzania,
                     provided by Text for Change, utilize open-source coding
                    Sending SMS: fees for end users (questions submitted via SMS and informational
                     text messages received) fully subsidized by funders. In the pilot, bulk SMS rates
                     were agreed upon with mobile phone providers; these ranged from US$0.03 to
                     US$0.06 per SMS. SMS costs vary by country, user volume, and scale of

                       because the SMS protocol is available across all makes and models of mobile
                       phones. Taking advantage of this universal aspect of mobile phone functionality
                       ensures that the potential reach of the m4RH service is maximized.
                      The m4RH pilot team recommends working with a mobile telephony provider so
                       that the follow key issues can be handled efficiently:
Sustainability              o the need for a technological platform to support m4RH,
and scale                   o the complexity of interactions offered by the m4RH system,
considerations              o the goal of providing m4RH free of charge for the users using a zero-rated
                                short code, and
                            o the anticipated volume of system traffic.]
                      In Tanzania, m4RH was found to scale significantly after it became part of the
                       “Jiamini” national family planning campaign, promoted through print and visual
                       advertising. Prior to Jiamini it engaged 3,000 unique users over three months;
                       during the campaign it drew 50,000 unique users over three months.

Problem          There is a critical shortage of competent HRH in the Africa region. Training and ongoing
addressed        development of the health workforce is therefore an urgent priority.
                 The RAFT network provides distance education, telemedicine tools, and IT-enabled
                 diagnostic devices such as portable echography to isolated care professionals by
                 establishing South-South collaborations between reference hospitals and
Strategic plan   regional/district hospitals. RAFT provides useful information to and a sense of
                 community among participants located in remote areas. It is sensitive to technology
                 constraints of its users while still aware of and responsive to changes in the technical
                 environment that allow for service improvements.
                    HR Network and Institutional Support: RAFT is organized and run by over 40
                     national coordinators throughout Africa and Geneva. The project is hosted at the
                     division for eHealth and telemedicine at Geneva University Hospitals, and focal
                     points in each participating country are responsible for national governance.
                     Further, a local medical coordinator and a technical coordinator manage day-to-day
Costs                operations, including communication with the care professionals, identification of
                     training needs, and maintenance of various sites within the country.
                    Satellite connections: Given the high costs of satellite connections (about
                     US$500/month), which are the only options in remote areas, sustainability can best
                     be achieved at large, district-level hospitals serving populations of 50,000 –200,000
                     because recurring connection costs can be included in operational budgets.

                 To strengthen access to health care for the poor and provide MCH services in the
                 absence of doctors/nurses, the government has trained and deployed over 40,000
                 HEWs in rural communities since 2003. However, HEWs are often isolated and their
                 communication with supervisors and patients is often unpredictable, hampering their
                 capacity to deliver quality care. Specifically, as articulated during World Bank –led
                 interviews in fiscal 2012, HEWs stated they lacked capacity to prioritize urgent,
Problem          unpredictable ante/post-natal care (ANC/PNC) needs, spread over a vast geographic
addressed        area. HEWs noted monthly vaccination deliveries are based on population estimates
                 and not new birth counts, so vaccine shortages and wastages commonly occurred, and
                 they expressed frustration over making referrals to emergency care when there was no
                 doctor present upon the patient’s arrival. Lastly, mothers preferred traditional birth
                 attendants (TBAs) over HEWs to preside over deliveries, despite TBAs lacking safe
                 delivery supplies. HEWs carry supplies, but are often not informed of expected or
                 occurring deliveries.
                 Together with Addis Ababa University, in September 2012 the World Bank and the
                 African Development Bank designed and implemented an innovative intervention
                 equipping rurally based HEWs with a mobile phone application designed on the

                 Poor data visibility of key health commodities leads to poor supply chain management.
                 When decision makers at high levels of health systems lack accurate and timely data
                 about stockouts and supply availability across their sub-units, it becomes difficult if not

                 thus occur only through improved logistics reporting between HSAs and health centers.

                   An ongoing challenge for eHealth initiatives, from a national perspective, is the lack of a
                   coherent framework for their implementation. As a natural result of pilot development,
                   most ICT solutions are focused on specific health interventions, even though such
Problem

addressed
                   Many funders of ICT projects remain focused on application development, rather than
                   development of pivotal inter-organizational relationships across government, private,
                   NGO, and civil society sectors.
                   KimMNCHip was built to show that more coordinated maternal/child care could be
                   achieved through the use of an integrated package of services supported by mobile
                   technologies. The KimMNCHip initiative began in early 2011 by bringing key maternal,
                   newborn, and child health (MNCH) stakeholders together to work with Safaricom, the
                   largest mobile phone provider in Kenya. This consortium united three existing
                   technologies, all evidenced to work and scale independently of each other, into one
Strategic plan     integrated system for improved MNCH care. The three services include (1) an
                   MNCHSMS-based advisory service for pregnant women who register and provide their
                   due date; (2) mFinancial services for health that provide pregnant women with
                   electronic vouchers to redeem in a collaborating clinic of their choice; and (3) mSupport
                   services that track primary care along a continuum for new mothers. In the SMS
                   advisory system, women receive a mix of “push” SMS and voice messages, and access
                   to call-in advisory hotlines and information databases for MNCH issues.
                      SMS/voice charges are funded via advertising that follows the health messaging
                      The mobile phone–based financial management system functions as part of a

                       the costs of delivery.
                   The KimMNCHip project currently remains in a pilot stage, and although individual
                   partners are sufficiently experienced in implementing eHealth initiatives, the integrated
                   nature of this project still requires a more complex business model. The technologies
Results            being used are both not-for-profit and for-profit, so the developing model must provide
                   sustainable support for both types of partners. Success over time, and at a national

                 CHWs are invaluable health human resources in rural communities; they promote
                 preventive care, encourage safe pregnancies, and refer ill people for diagnosis and
                 treatment at appropriate facilities. Studies demonstrate that CHW cadres have helped
                 reduce 30–50 percent of infant mortality in low-income countries (Darmstadt et al.
                 2005). However, CHWs can be a difficult cadre to organize and manage for the same
                 reason they are so effective: they live and work in the communities they serve. There is
Problem
                 often little day-to-day management or supportive supervision. Community-based
addressed
                 interventions are not always coordinated with other service delivery efforts, and few
                 tools are available to analyze and monitor the activities of CHWs to evaluate and
                 improve the overall performance of programs (Bogan et al. 2009). Furthermore, it is not
                 only CHWs but also their patients who are often isolated and marginalized, and who are
                 in need of health information so that they can make more knowledgeable choices about
                 the health services they receive.
                    MOTECH supports both patients and caregivers through a system of SMS and
                     voice messaging, timed alerts, and strategic data collection. Using CommCare
                     software on mobile phones, MOTECH offers CHWs a unique app through which
                     they collect data on care provided to patients and receive alerts about patients due
                     or overdue for services. Correspondingly, a patient-focused Mobile Midwife app
                     enables pregnant women and their families to receive weekly SMS or IVR
                     messages that provide time-specific information about their pregnancies. Messages
                     included a mixture of alerts and reminders for care seeking (prenatal care,
                     vaccinations, etc.); actionable information and advice, such as tips for saving
Strategic plan
                     money for transportation to deliver at a health facility; nutrition information;
                     promotion of good health practices; and educational tools about breastfeeding.
                    The MOTECH system connects the patient and provider apps, both run on low-end
                     mobile phones, by making sure that patients get the same care reminders that their
                     providers get, in an attempt to reduce the number of clients defaulting on
                     recommended health care. Using the data nurses have submitted to the server,
                     MOTECH also generates the monthly reports that facilities are required to submit to
                     their district and regional management offices, eliminating a formerly burdensome
                     three- to four-day process of report compilation.
                    As an open source development platform, MOTECH is integrated with several
                     other open source health initiatives such as OpenMRS and CommCare, and as an

                     allows for rapid iteration and product customization.
                 Initially piloted in two provinces in 2011, the project moved into a national rollout phase
                 beginning in 2012. The MOTECH Ghana implementation has been adopted by the

                     MOTECH has mitigated some of these challenges by involving Ghana Health
                     Service supervisors to monitor health worker participation, data entry, and data
                     uploading. Planning explicit evaluations early on in a project cycle and making
                     findings public in a timely manner suggests a desire for continuous quality
                     improvement.

Duration         2008–present
                 Roughly 1.7 billion global citizens lack access to a bank but have a mobile phone.
                 Efficient health care financing mechanisms could improve their health outcomes by
                 increasing their ability pay for services, and could also help streamline health systems
                 management and eliminate waste in procurement and payment systems. However,
Problem          access to traditional health insurance or savings accounts remains limited in
addressed        developing-country health systems. Currently, the pairing of mobile technologies and
                 offline mobile money agents has created the field of mobile finance services (MFS),
                 enabling mobile operators to act as banks, thus taking the place of ATMs or bank
                 branches. However, such tools are not yet widespread. Of the 630 mobile network
                 operators in the world, only 124 have implemented mobile money initiatives.
                    Changamka MicroHealth Ltd is a private, for-profit firm partnered with Safaricom,
                     Kenya’s largest mobile network operator, offering health-related microfinance
                     products to low-income Kenyans. In addition to developing new products based on
                     its basic business model, it has also entered into several partnerships with other
                     firms and with the Government of Kenya to provide services over a wider range.
                    Smartcards are ready for use upon purchase at any of more than 30 accredited
Strategic plan       medical establishments in Nairobi, Kikuyu, and Mombasa, where common health
                     services are lumped into predetermined price-contracted packages. The
                     “outpatient” card sells for KSh 500 and comes pre-loaded with KSh 450; the
                     “maternity” card is sold at participating Hospitals for KSh 25 (patients have 9
                     months to save up the recommended amount required for maternity at their facility
                     of choice, and the smartcard ensures access to potentially lifesaving maternal
                     health services).
                    Smart cards: Subscribers to the service are issued a personalized “smart card,” to
Costs                which they can add money in whatever increments they want, whenever they way,
                     through their mobile phone or at a general packet radio service (GPRS) terminal,


                                                 36
                     allowing them to save at their own pace. An unlimited amount of money can be
                     added to the card, there is no expiration date, and the smartcards come in four
                     broad categories: out-patient, maternity, third-party payer, and in-house.
                    Changamka estimates that moving from a paper voucher to an mVoucher system
                     could reduce administrative costs of a voucher program by approximately 15
                     percent to 27 percent, and could save up to 30 percent on administrative costs of
                     institutions such as universities, which run their own clinics.
                    While the patient benefits from procuring services at discounted prices, medical
                     providers also benefit from a higher volume of patients and ensured and timely
                     payments, free of administrative costs.
                 As of June 2011, 9,500 smart cards and 3,200 maternity cards had been distributed,
                 2,300 pregnant women had been given monthly health education, and 600 hospital
                 transactions were completed using the cards every month. The usage rate is 500 “top
Results          ups” per month, and there were 600 hospital transactions using the cards every month;
                 by June 2011, 35 providers accepted the cards. In addition, it was found that since
                 hospitals began accepting the cards, they have seen the number of women making
                 regular routine checkup appointments increase by 30 percent.

                    With nearly 10,000 clients currently using a Changamka smart card, there remain
                     several challenges for scalability and sustainability of the business model because
                     of the costs of smart cards and GPRS terminals, and because of a lack of venture
                     capital.
Sustainability      However, Changamka is developing a new mobile-based business model that
and scale            connects to the government-sponsored health insurance plan. Supporting an
considerations       expanded public-private partnership between Changamka, the Kenyan
                     government, and Safaricom would hasten the move to a fully mobile-based
                     application, addressing a number of logistics issues and increasing the likelihood of
                     a more widely scaled product. Because M-PESA is employed in other EAC
                     countries, there is also a potential for broader regional adoption.

Duration         2011–present
                 Radio remains the most widely used ICT platform for information, education, and
                 communication in the Africa region, even as mobile telephony rapidly expands.
                 Successful radio programs report extensive audience reach, often in the millions,

                 incurring relatively inexpensive production and distribution costs. Some talk show
addressed
                 formats even allow listeners to call in to a show and participate, although high
                 connection costs limits participation and public dialogue, thus relegating radio to mostly
                 a one-directional, “push” technology.
                 Trac FM allows radio audiences to interact with a broadcast via SMS and to make their
Strategic plan
                 opinions known on a range of public service topics, including health care. Such


                                                 37
                 interactive mobile polling is an increasingly used approach, enabling stations to solicit
                 listener comments via SMS, discuss comments on air, and then create and post online
                 visualizations of the results on Facebook. Questions cover topics such as quality of
                 public services (reporting on teacher absenteeism, availability of text books, drug
                 stockouts, waiting time at clinics, election proceedings, functionality of water points,
                 etc.), and thus create a powerful feedback loop that allows citizens to share views and
                 hold leaders accountable for public services.
                    Trac FM is a relatively low-cost solution that is licensed to participating radio
                     stations. Rather than fit the station to the software, the Trac FM software is
                     embedded into existing radio programming.
Costs
                    The system has encountered some sociopolitical struggles, such as streamlining
                     the process with different parties involved in running a poll, such as telecom
                     providers and radio station management.
                 Trac FM is currently used by four radio stations in Uganda and has conducted 44
                 interactive polls. Upon submission of replies, the system employs a string distance
                 algorithm that can filter out minor typos, detect “aliases” by linking every word to a
                 certain category, and sort hard-to-identify words under a category of “unknown” so that
                 the team can manually assign the response to the correct category. Submitted SMSs
Results
                 receive a confirmation message and the option to respond via keyword to join an active
                 user group, meaning that anyone submitting data to one poll will receive SMS updates
                 on upcoming polls. The Trac FM software then plots a data visualization of replies, and
                 radio presenters can get an overview of where reports are coming from and what key
                 issues are.
                 No impact evaluations of the tool’s efficacy are available online, but a detailed case

                    A similar SMS-based public polling system is UNICEF's U-Report launched in
                     Uganda in May 2011. In this system, users send an SMS message to register and
                     then are polled from time to time on issues of social and community importance.
                     For example, during the recent outbreak of a mysterious epilepsy-related illness
                     known as “nodding disease,” over 3,000 cases were reported via U-Report, which
                     helped UNICEF with their response to the outbreak. There are currently over
Sustainability       89,000 registered users of U-Report, and while it remains available only in English,
and scale            efforts are underway to include other local languages as well.
considerations      Trac FM and U-Report could very easily be combined to provide a robust
                     community-focused platform for social accountability and local knowledge sharing
                     that could be a model for other countries in the region.
                    The ability to engage underserved and rural populations in a governance dialog
                     around issues of health services and concerns has enabled an information
                     feedback loop in health service delivery, and could lead to a “routine reporting
                     system” for public input on a wide range of health (and other sectors) issues.

ICT for health—or eHealth—solutions hold great potential for generating systemic efficiencies by
strengthening five critical pillars of a health system: human resources for health, supply chain
management, health care financing, governance and service delivery, and infrastructure. This report
describes the changing landscape of eHealth initiatives through these five pillars, with a geographic focus
on Sub-Saharan Africa. This report further details seven criteria, or prerequisites, that must be considered
and addressed in order to effectively establish and scale up ICT-based solutions in the health sector.
These criteria include infrastructure, data and interoperability standards, local capacity, policy and
regulatory environments, an appropriate business model, alignment of partnerships and priorities, and
monitoring and evaluation. In order to bring specific examples of these criteria to light, this report
concludes with 12 specific case studies of potentially scalable ICT-based health care solutions currently
being implemented across the globe at community, national, and regional levels. This report is intended
to be used by development practitioners, including task team leaders at the World Bank, to strengthen
their understanding of the use of ICT to support health systems strengthening (HSS) efforts as well as to
highlight critical prerequisites needed to optimize the benefits of ICT for health.
