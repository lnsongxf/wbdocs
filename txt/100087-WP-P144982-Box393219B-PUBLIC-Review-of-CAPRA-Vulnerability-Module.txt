OVERVIEW
This technical note provides an overview for decision makers in the emergency management
community who wish to build vulnerability assessments and must develop mitigations
strategies and loss projections. It provides a peer-review of the advantages and challenges
for the different vulnerability methodologies proposed to date, such as the current version
of the ERN-Vulnerability module, and its vulnerability model.

Component-based vulnerability assessment

These methods estimate the hurricane damage of
a building by (1) assessing the wind damage at
each key component, and (2) tracking how
damage propagates to the rest of the structure.
Some tools that have been used to assess the
component damage include: failure-tree
analysis, and assigning fragility functions to key
components        and      considering        their
interconnectedness with traditional engineering
methods.

The analytical vulnerability model adopted in             The built-in hurricane vulnerability

The model fits into two of the categories                  adopted from the seismic vulnerability
presented above. It could be heuristic if the              function for buildings in inelastic the
function parameters are assessed by an expert              range. While there is no clear-cut set of

surveyed from the field.                                   functions candidates, it might be useful to
                                                           clarify the assumptions of this function. In

For experts who might not be familiar with
vulnerability     functions,     the    structural
interpretation of this particular function, unlike
other alternatives, is easily accessible. Besides,
the fact that the function has few parameters
allows the expert to quickly modify the curve
to match his experience.

In addition, it is helpful that the model
explicitly conveys the damage estimate
variance. The loss estimations using only
damage averages might prove misleading in
risk analysis, while expressing losses as ranges
might be more useful to the decision maker
who might be thus better estimate of a utility         Figure 7: Comparison of Weibull and Lognormal

Suggestions for the current                               By providing an expert with a certain

    these properties of the functions.
   In regards to the variance law of the mean
    damage estimation (), it might be helpful
    to justify the adoption of the Beta model.
    In the Beta case, it is assumed that the

    damage ratio ) is uncertain. As with any
    other distribution function, the Beta

Variability of damage estimation

   The model in Eq. (1) represents the median value of the physical damage estimated at a given wind speed
V. The model also provides an estimate of the spread of damage estimates at each median damage. Such
variance is assumed to follow a Beta distribution (Figure 11):

Preliminary Comments on the Hazards user interface
  This section lists some suggestions for enhancing the user experience of the hurricane hazard tool.
      Tutorial
          o While the voice in the tutorial is in English, all the images coming from the PC are in Spanish.
                Misleading for non-Spanish speakers.
          o The tutorial shows the roughness measured from 1 to 4. Maybe add the ranges of the coefficient z0
                for reference purposes.

      ERN-Hurricane interface
         o Interface has Spanish name ‘ERN-Huracán’.
         o General Data Tab:
                  ‘soil type’ is confusing, should say ‘roughness’.
                  A definition of how roughness (z0) should be added, i.e. meters.
         o Analysis Zone Tab:
                  ‘Points in shoreline’ should say: ‘grid points in shoreline to estimate storm surge’.
                  Tutorial voice says ‘boundary geographic data’ but should perhaps say ‘domain of wind
                     and rain estimation’ or similar
                  Tutorial says ‘distance between points’ but may perhaps say something like ‘domain of
                     evaluation of wind field model’ or similar.
                  In the interface, it is not immediately evident what the label ‘Delta’ means and what its
                     units are. Maybe write grid spacing.
                  Likewise wit ‘N’. Maybe write ‘Number of grid points’.
                  Maybe replace ‘Minimum’ and ‘Maximum’ with ‘South’ – ‘North’, or ‘Upper’ – ‘Lower’.
                  Do storm surge includes initial tide, or astronomical tide?
         o Hurricanes Tab
                  Tab lacks some details to guide the user.
                  Maybe add a label saying ‘load hurricane tracks’. Also maybe include an ‘Add’ button as
                     double clicking in white zone is not immediately evident.
                  See some suggestions for the hurricane track files below.
         o Simulations Tab
                  Specify what type of simulations are used.
                  Specify what ‘Sigma’ is.
                  Not clear what is the difference between ‘Group of simulations’, ‘Pure Simulations’, and
                     ‘No Simulations’. Besides, the ‘No Simulation’ option conflicts with the ‘Simulations’ tab
                     label.
                  The tutorial recommends keeping the same values as those already in the interface. Not
                     clear what control over the simulations is afforded to the user.
                  What is the role of the ‘Coefficient of variation’ options?
         o Run
                  There are four bars indicating the simulation progress, but are not labeled.
         o Other suggestions
                  Maybe add a visualization tool of the building features.
         o Hurricane track file (see below for sample):
                  For the sake of portability with other risk platforms, maybe consider the adoption of
                     ‘NOAA Best Track’ nomenclature, or similar, for the hurricane track files.
                  Change ‘Número de Avisos’ to ‘Stations’ or ‘Measurements’
                  Add the units for each table heading.
                  Explain if ‘Velocity’ is Intensity, i.e. maximum velocity, and specify the time averaging
                     used, i.e. 3-sec gust, 5-sec gust, 10-min sustained, 1-hr sustained, other. Is it located at the
                     radius of maximum winds (RMW)?
                  Specify projection system for GIS?
