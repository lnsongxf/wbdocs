FOREWORD




    The Ministry of Population Development and Social Protection has long been cooperating success-
fully with the World Bank towards improving social welfare outcomes in Mongolia. With the support of
the World Bank-financed Multisectoral Technical Assistance Project our collaborative efforts have been
committed to undertaking some policy analysis and review of the existing welfare benefits, improving
the welfare management information system,developing policy options for improving impacts of benefits
and capacity building of the sector human resources.
    This report on Mongolia’s social welfare program design and beneficiary profiles provides valuable
analysis for developing policy solutions for improving coverage and quality of social welfare services,
effectively targeting the members of the households in need of social assistance, consolidating numer-
ous benefits and increasing the effectiveness of resources used for welfare, especially at the times of
economic challenges. The report will also be a great contr ibution to the process of developing social
protection sector strategy.
    I would like to extend my appreciation to the World Bank social protection team and Ms. Junko
Onishi for prepar ing this report and Mr. Jehan Arulpragasam for his guidance in addition to all those
who have contr ibuted by providing their technical advice and comments.

   FOREWORD




    Over the past several decades,Mongolia has transformed its economic and political system from one
where most economic decisions were centrally made to one where outcomes are dr iven by markets. The
results at the aggregate level have been clear: r ising production, better services, and higher living stand-
ards for much of the population. At the same time,the vagar ies of the market can leave many vulnerable,
susceptible to shocks,unable to share in the country’s increasing prosper ity. As many countr ies have done,
Mongolia has sought to protect the vulnerable and ensure that the benefits of growth accrue to broader
population through its system of social transfers. But how well are these transfers working? How could
the system be changed to be even more effective? Before either of these questions can be answered,one
must understand how those systems are working in practice: Who are the reci pients? Are the transfers
effectively benefitting the poorest people? Using a detailed and comprehensive dataset, the authors of
this report provide some answers.
    The findings are,in some ways,encouraging: Mongolia has an effective delivery mechanism for imple-
menting social welfare programs and, compared to other countr ies around the world, Mongolia spends
generously on social welfare. These facts suggest that the social welfare system as a whole has promise
for achieving the objectives of helping the most vulnerable to avoid or escape poverty.
    The results also suggest,however,that some of the program features make it less effective than it could
be. While the delivery mechanism is effective, and the aggregate transfers are substantial, many of the
beneficiar ies are not those most in need. Only about 56% of total welfare spending goes to the poorest
40% of the population in the integrated household information database, while the top 40% received
28% of total welfare transfers.
    Mongolia’s current economic situation makes the efficiency of the social welfare system all the more
important. Slowing growth is making the prospects of the poor and near poor increasingly precar i-
ous—ensur ing the strength of the social safety net is more important than it has been for years. At the
same time,falling commodity pr ices and slower growth of tax revenues serve to amplify the need for the
programs to achieve their goals efficiently.
    As an institution devoted to the elimination of absolute poverty,the World Bank str ives to understand
the dr ivers of poverty reduction and the factors that help ensure that prosper ity is broadly shared among
the population. I hope that this review provides the evidence needed for Mongolia’s leaders to create a
more effective and efficient social welfare system, one that puts Mongolia’s poor and vulnerable first.

    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
   The Government of Mongolia, through the Ministry of Population Development and Social
Protection (MPDSP) and the General Oﬃce of Social Welfare Services (GOSWS), implements 71
social welfare programs. While some programs are needs-oriented, others are merit-oriented. All
programs are categorically targeted with one exception: the Food Stamp Program, which targets the
poorest 5 percent of the population by applying the Proxy Means Test (PMT) methodology.1
   To reduce fragmentation, the Government wishes to review and consolidate its social welfare
programs into a more effective and eﬃcient system. The objective of this note is to make policy
recommendations based on a review of social welfare program budgets and design and on an
assessment of coverage and characteristics of program beneﬁciaries. The review utilizes an analysis
of PMT data and social welfare program administrative data.
   Social welfare programs are deﬁned in the Social Welfare Law (2012) and other legislation
detailing the eligibility criteria for beneﬁciaries. These programs can be categorized into seven
program groups according to the way the programs are administered:
        Social Welfare Pensions
        Social Welfare Allowance
        Social Welfare Services, including Community-based Services and Specialized Care Services
        Social Welfare Service Allowance for the Elderly with State Merit
        Allowance for the Elderly
        Allowance for the Disabled
        Allowance for Mothers and Children
    In addition to these social welfare programs, MPDSP also executes the Child Money Program
(CMP), aimed at redistributing mineral wealth to the next generation. The CMP is funded from the
Human Development Fund, separately from the state budget for social welfare. The program provides
                                                                                                                                        11
cash amounts of MNT 20,000 (approximately USD 11) per month to all children from 0 to 18 years old.
Despite its objectives and the funding source being separate from the social welfare system, since it
is implemented by MPDSP along with other social welfare programs, it is often (although not always)
considered to be part of the social welfare system. Given the CMP’s large ﬁscal implications, it is
considered critical to include it in this review.

    I. Budgets and Expenditures on Social Welfare and Coverage of Programs
    In 2013, the government spent 2.78 percent of GDP on cash transfers for social welfare including
the CMP (1.37 percent excluding the CMP). This amount is relatively generous compared to the average
1.6 percent of GDP being spent by developing and emerging countries. It suggests that the government
is committed to allocating adequate ﬁscal resources for the social welfare of the population. In 2013,
the largest budget allocation for cash beneﬁts by far was for the CMP, comprising approximately
half of the total allocation for cash grants but also covering the largest number of beneﬁciaries. The
second largest expenditure was for Social Welfare Pensions (MNT 83 billion, approximately USD 50
million2), followed by the Allowance for Mothers and Children (MNT 67 billion, approximately USD 40
million3). The combined amount for these two larger program groups was still less than two-thirds of
the budgeted amount for the CMP in 2013.
   Excluding the CMP, the expenditures for all programs increased slightly between 2010 and 2013, taking
inﬂation into account (Figure 1). The largest increase was the two-fold increase for Social Welfare Pensions.
The expenditures on Beneﬁts for Pregnant and Lactating Mothers increased about 40 percent between
2011 and 2013, although the budget for Mother Heroes beneﬁts decreased about 45 percent.

        In terms of coverage, the CMP was the largest program in 2013, providing beneﬁts to one million
     beneﬁciaries. This is more than twice the size of the second largest program, the Allowance for
     Mothers and Children with 405,000 beneﬁciaries. The smallest program is the Beneﬁts for the Elderly
     with State Merits, with only 4,000 beneﬁciaries in 2012.
12
        Half (49.4 percent) of all individuals in the SW Admin/PMT database received at least one
     program beneﬁt when the CMP is included. This coverage of the CMP is impressive considering
     that the poverty rate in Mongolia was 27 percent in 2012. Only a handful of developing and emerging
     countries have coverage of social welfare beneﬁts higher than the poverty rate (World Bank, 2014).
     The analysis conﬁrms the overwhelming coverage of the CMP, with 94 percent of children 0-18 years
     old receiving the program. Interestingly, children 0-18 years old in every quintile received the CMP.
        Coverage drops considerably, however, when the CMP is not included, with only 19 percent of
     the population receiving at least one program. Beyond the CMP, the vast majority of individuals (81
     percent) did not receive any social welfare program beneﬁts. Around 14 percent received one program,
     3.4 percent received two programs, and just above 1 percent received 3 programs. Only 0.5 percent
     received four or more programs.
        Social welfare programs were generally pro-poor, with a larger share of the beneﬁts going to the
     poorer segment of the population. According to estimates based on the SW Admin/PMT database,
     the largest share of total beneﬁts was received by individuals in the lowest social welfare quintiles,
     estimated by PMT scores.4 The poorest 20 percent received 34 percent of total social welfare transfers
     (Figure 2).5 However, it is important to note that in European and Central Asian countries, the share of
     total beneﬁts going to the poorest 20 percent reaches over 40 percent (e.g., Croatia and Kosovo). In
     the best-performing countries around the world, the poorest 20 percent receive over 50 percent of total
     beneﬁts (e.g., Argentina, Panama, and Peru).


     4. The analysis of share of beneﬁts received assumes that those who were listed as program beneﬁciaries in the administrative data
     were indeed receiving the full beneﬁt amounts. For cash beneﬁts, the amounts were annualized according to program design (beneﬁt
     amounts and payment frequency). For reimbursements, it is assumed that all beneﬁciaries received their full amount in the year of the
     analysis (for programs that are provided less frequently than once a year), and the average reimbursement amounts were estimated
     using the 2012 expenditure ﬁgures obtained from GOSWS.
     5 “The State of the Social Safety Nets 2014” states that the beneﬁt incidence of total beneﬁts in Mongolia going to the poorest 20 per-
     cent is 22.5 percent, based on analysis of household survey data (HSES 2007). The beneﬁt incidence of 34 percent given in this report is
     estimated based on analysis of PMT and SW Administrative data.

   The largest program that contributed to the share received by individuals in the lowest social
welfare quintile was the CMP (16 percent). As shown in Figure 2 above, the next highest contributors
were Social Welfare Pensions (9 percent), Social Welfare Transfers including the Food Stamp Program
(4 percent), and the Allowance for Mothers and Children (3 percent).
    Although most programs were categorically targeted, some programs were more pro-poor than
others. The pro-poor programs (with a larger share of program beneﬁts received by quintile groups                                                  13
with lower PMT scores) were Social Welfare Pensions, Social Welfare Transfers, CMP, the Allowance
for the Disabled, and the Allowance for Mothers and Children (Figure 3).

6. In Figure 3, the ﬁrst bar (% individuals in quintile) for each quintile depicts the share of individuals in that quintile. Therefore, program
beneﬁt shares higher than the ﬁrst bar indicate that the quintile group received disproportionately more program beneﬁts. If program
shares are lower than the ﬁrst bar, it means that the quintile group received disproportionately less program beneﬁts.

         In contrast, some programs were less pro-poor (regressive). These programs were: the Beneﬁts for
     the Elderly with State Merits, and the Allowance for the Elderly. In particular, the proportion of Beneﬁts
     for the Elderly with State Merits that went to the non-poor is stark, with the vast majority of beneﬁciaries
     coming from the highest three social welfare quintile groups according to PMT scores. The fact that
     the Beneﬁts for the Elderly with State Merits were enjoyed by the non-poor is notable since the beneﬁt
     amounts of this program were the most generous compared to other programs.

     Household PMT Score Quintiles by Program7

         The gender distribution of beneﬁciaries differed across programs. The CMP and the Allowance
14   for the Disabled both had equal numbers of male and female beneﬁciaries. The beneﬁciaries of
     programs associated with motherhood—including many under the Social Welfare Transfers—were
     naturally women: beneﬁciaries of the Allowance for Mothers and Children were all female, and around
     58 percent of Social Welfare Transfers beneﬁciaries were women. More women received the Allowance
     for the Elderly (69 percent) and Social Pensions (54 percent), most probably due to the lower age of
     eligibility (55 years old for women compared to 60 years old for men) and the longer life expectancy of
     women compared to men. The only exception was the Beneﬁts for the Elderly with State Merits, which
     beneﬁted men (82 percent) far more than women.

         II. Program Participation by Beneﬁciary Type
        The elderly: Around 70 percent of pension-aged individuals beneﬁted from at least one social
     welfare program, not including social insurance pensions which are not part of this analysis. About
     76 percent of total social welfare beneﬁts received by the elderly went to those who beneﬁted from
     multiple programs, which may be a strong indication of the fragmented nature of programs addressing
     the needs of the elderly.
         The disabled: Around 66 percent of the disabled received beneﬁts from at least one social welfare
     program. Around 63 percent of the disabled over 16 years old beneﬁted from at least one program,
     while 87 percent of the disabled under 16 years old beneﬁted from at least one program. Among
     the disabled above 16 years of age, Social Welfare Pensions comprised the largest proportion (76
     percent) of beneﬁts that went to the disabled. Around 43 percent of the beneﬁts were received by those
     beneﬁting from only one program (predominantly Social Welfare Pensions), while those beneﬁting
     from multiple programs received a larger share of their beneﬁts from Social Welfare Transfers and the
     Allowance for the Disabled.


     7. In Figure 4, the ﬁrst bar (% individuals in quintile) for each quintile depicts the share of individuals in that quintile. Therefore, program
     beneﬁt shares higher than the ﬁrst bar indicate that the quintile group received disproportionately more program beneﬁts. If program
     shares are lower than the ﬁrst bar, it means that the quintile group received disproportionately less program beneﬁts.
               REVIEW OF PROGRAM DESIGN AND BENEFICIARY PROFILES OF SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAMS IN MONGOLIA




   The disabled under 16 years of age are not eligible for Social Welfare Pensions, and 81 percent of all
beneﬁts to this group were provided by the CMP. Although only about one in ﬁve disabled children under
age 16 received beneﬁts from three or more programs, when they did, they received a combination of
the CMP, Social Welfare Transfers, and the Allowance for the Disabled.
   The poor: Around 62 percent of individuals from households in the poorest quintile (according to
PMT scores) were direct beneﬁciaries of at least one social welfare program, but the ﬁgure dropped
to 29 percent when excluding the CMP. The majority of the poor received only one program—about
64 percent of total beneﬁts going to the poorest quintile went to beneﬁciaries who received only one
program, including the CMP. The largest share of beneﬁts for the poor came mainly from the CMP. The
Food Stamp Program was the only program targeted at the poor: all 15,118 household beneﬁciaries
were among the poorest 2.7 percent (according to PMT scores). Among the bottom 2.7 percent, 85.6
percent of households were beneﬁciaries of the Food Stamp Program.

    III. Policy Recommendations
    A. Consolidating Fragmented Programs
    Three strategies are recommended in consolidating the existing social welfare programs:
•   Consolidate small programs by prioritizing program design based on the need to provide
    comprehensive support to the targeted population so beneﬁciaries do not need to access multiple
    programs. For example, although the disabled derive their beneﬁts predominantly from Social Welfare
    Pensions, those who receive multiple programs are combining the Allowance for the Disabled and
    Social Welfare Transfers. This suggests that in order to better address the needs of the disabled,
    elements of these two programs may be combined into a more comprehensive program. In designing
    such a program, it would be important to take into account the different needs of male and female
    beneﬁciaries, in addition to the speciﬁc needs of the target group.
•   Strengthen programs that are needs-based and gradually phase out entitlement-based programs.
•   In the future, consider transferring health-related beneﬁts to be covered by Health Insurance.
                                                                                                                15
    B. Making Social Welfare Programs Poverty-Targeted
   To contain costs of social welfare programs while making them more effective, programs could
be made poverty-targeted. For example, beneﬁt amounts for the richer quintiles could be reduced or
eliminated, using the readily available PMT database.
   The CMP is expected to have a considerable poverty impact, but the level of program expenditures
may be diﬃcult to sustain. As discussed above, the program has wide coverage and a large beneﬁt
amount. At the same time, the total budget for transfers of this program alone was MNT 240 billion
(approximately USD 130 million) in 2013, accounting for 51 percent of total transfers made through
social welfare programs in Mongolia. Considering the ﬁscal deﬁcit faced by the government, this level
of expenditures on the CMP may be diﬃcult to sustain.

    Taking these facts into account, possible options going forward include:
•   Continue the CMP as is as the program is effectively reaching the poor, if the ﬁscal environment allows
    for the program to continue;
•   Introduce program design features to the CMP such that the poor receive larger amounts, while maintaining
    universal coverage of the program. This could be achieved by using the PMT to identify children in poor
    households or through categorical means of providing larger amounts for children in households with
    many (three or more, for example) children. Altering program beneﬁts for children in different types of
    households will make program administration more complex, and if poverty targeting is introduced,
    strong operational design and implementation plans would need to be prepared to address the
    potential exclusion of deserving children. Reallocation of beneﬁts could be done in a cost-neutral way
    or in a way that reduces total program cost:
    o To maintain cost neutrality, the grant amounts reallocated to the poor would be equal to the
        reduction in grant amounts for the better-off.
    o To reduce program cost, the sum of the grant amounts reallocated to poorer children would be
        lower than the sum of grant amounts reduced for better-off children.
     REVIEW OF PROGRAM DESIGN AND BENEFICIARY PROFILES OF SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAMS IN MONGOLIA




     •  Terminate the CMP and replace it with a new poverty-targeted cash transfer program. Termination
        of the CMP will give the government ﬁscal space to design a poverty-targeted welfare program, with
        clear poverty alleviation objectives. Two design options could be:
        o Implement the Poverty Beneﬁt program stipulated in the Social Welfare Law (2012).8 The new
            program would need to provide signiﬁcant levels of coverage and beneﬁts to compensate for the
            loss of beneﬁts experienced by poor households due to termination of the CMP, with a strong
            operational design to address the potential exclusion of poor households. The advantages are
            that the program would have a clear poverty alleviation objective, and depending on coverage and
            beneﬁt amounts, it could lead to considerable budget savings. The disadvantages are that this
            will be a new program, and as with any new program, considerable operational preparation will be
            required.
        o Add a child beneﬁt component to the new Poverty Beneﬁt Program described above to maintain
            the focus on providing support to the next generation (as in the CMP). Again, it would be very
            important to ensure that this new Poverty Beneﬁt Program (or at least the child component) would
            be large enough in terms of coverage and beneﬁt amounts to compensate for termination of the
            CMP. If the child beneﬁt component focuses on the poorest 40 percent of households, this would
            still cover half of the children currently covered by the CMP, as poorer households have more
            children. Adding a child beneﬁt component to the Poverty Beneﬁt Program would increase the
            complexity of program design as the transfer amounts per household would differ according to the
            number of children.
        Further simulation analysis is recommended to identify the most effective scenario for poverty
     impact. The HSES data could be used to determine the optimal beneﬁt size and the methods and
     threshold for targeting.
        Introduction of design changes must be accompanied by strengthening of certain features of
     program operations, particularly if poverty targeting will be introduced:
         •   Strong communication campaigns would be critical.
16       •   Introducing targeting, whether through PMT or other categorical means, is bound to introduce
             exclusion error (eligible beneﬁciaries being excluded). Therefore, an effective grievance redress
             mechanism would be essential.
         •   If targeting will be conducted through application of the PMT, continued efforts would be needed
             to ensure that the PMT database is up-to-date and complete and addresses grievances from
             individuals regarding their registered level of welfare according to the PMT scores.

         C. Increasing the Generosity and Coverage of Poverty-Targeted Program(s)
         Currently, total estimated transfer amounts from all programs going to poor households are
     small. The average household transfer amount is approximately 12 percent of household consumption
     at the poverty line for a household of ﬁve members. Most countries provide social welfare beneﬁts
     that represent 20-35 percent of the poorest households’ post-transfer consumption, although there
     is considerable variation worldwide. The most generous countries in the Europe and Central Asia
     region provide beneﬁts that represent between 40-55 percent of the poorest households’ post-transfer
     consumption (World Bank, 2013).
        There is an urgent need to focus the attention of social welfare programs in Mongolia on ensuring
     that the poor are better protected from economic shocks. Increasing the generosity and coverage of
     programs to protect the poor could involve implementing the Poverty Beneﬁt Program as described
     above or (in the short term) revamping the Food Stamp Program.

       D. Strengthening Active Labor Market Programs that Serve as a Safety Net for
     the Vulnerable
         To provide an effective safety net for vulnerable workers, it would be important to have effective

     8. The direct translation of the program title in the Social Welfare Law from Mongolian is: “Beneﬁt for members of HHs in need for social
     assistance” (Poverty beneﬁt).
              REVIEW OF PROGRAM DESIGN AND BENEFICIARY PROFILES OF SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAMS IN MONGOLIA




and robust Active Labor Market Programs. The current social welfare system provides no safety net
support for those who are poor (but not as poor as the bottom 5 percent) or near-poor who do not meet
the eligibility criteria for existing social welfare programs. Laborers with temporary jobs or seasonal
jobs do not qualify for unemployment beneﬁts due to program design, yet they are the ones who may
be most affected by an economic adjustment or other external shocks.
    Similarly, for social welfare beneﬁciaries who are currently unemployed or under-employed, social
welfare programs could be linked with co-responsibilities for able-bodied beneﬁciaries to engage
in work/skills accumulation activities. Welfare program beneﬁciaries are entitled to beneﬁts as long
as they remain within the categorical eligibility criteria. While the government needs to increase the
generosity and coverage of poverty-targeted programs, such programs should not create dependency
but encourage beneﬁciaries to engage in labor. New generation work activation programs could be
introduced for welfare beneﬁciaries who are unemployed, seasonally unemployed, or underemployed,
applying the principles of “welfare-to-work” transition approaches proven to be effective in many
middle-income countries.

   E. Strengthen Monitoring and Evaluation of Social Welfare Programs
   Stronger program monitoring and evaluation will enable the government to make more informed
policy decisions. To date, no impact assessment of programs has been conducted, and the government
has little understanding of program impact and how the programs can be improved. To help inform
future decisions, the government could:
   •   Request the addition of a speciﬁc module focused on social protection to the HSES questionnaire,
       or at a minimum request revision of the HSES questionnaire “other income” section to distinguish
       social welfare and social insurance beneﬁts.
   •   Fully utilize the social welfare management information system (MIS) when it is uniﬁed and put
       online.
                                                                                                          17
   •   Conduct periodic reviews of programs by analyzing administrative data to inform decision-
       making.

         1. BACKGROUND
        The Government of Mongolia through the Ministry of Population Development and Social
     Protection (MPDSP) and the General Oﬃce of Social Welfare Services (GOSWS) implements 71
     social welfare programs. These programs vary from housing for war veterans to social pensions for
     men 60 years old and above and women 55 years old and above. Some programs are needs-oriented,
     while others are merit-oriented. All programs are categorically targeted, with numerous and generous
     beneﬁts particularly for individuals with special state merits, a heritage from the socialist period. The
     one exception is the Food Stamp Program, initiated as part of an Asian Development Bank (ADB)
     investment project, which targets the poorest 5 percent of the population by applying the Proxy Means
     Test (PMT) methodology.9
        The Government wishes to review and consolidate its social welfare programs. Given the
     decentralized nature of current program data management, the MPDSP has little grasp of the proﬁle
     of program beneﬁciaries: who the program beneﬁciaries are or how many programs they receive. The
     objective of this note is to review the budgets, design, eligibility, and beneﬁt levels of social welfare
     programs; assess program coverage; describe the basic characteristics of program beneﬁciaries; and
     make policy recommendations.
        The current set of social welfare programs is based on the Social Welfare Law (SWL), enacted in
     2005 and last amended in 2012. The Law regulates the issues related to social welfare and provides
     the main framework for four types of beneﬁts: social welfare pensions, social welfare allowances, social
     welfare services, and social development services. The Law deﬁnes the categories of beneﬁciaries, beneﬁts,
     and institutional and ﬁnancial arrangements for each of the social welfare programs. The Social Welfare
     Law is planned to be amended in 2015, and it is hoped that this report can contribute some inputs to the
     amendment of the Law and the development of the Social Protection Sector Strategy.


18       Data
        The data for this study was provided by the MPDSP and GOSWS. Data on individual characteristics
     are from the 2013 PMT data collected by GOSWS. This data was merged by GOSWS with the program
     administrative beneﬁciary data, managed at the GOSWS district and aimag oﬃces. Merging of these
     two databases was possible thanks to the unique national individual identiﬁcation (ID) numbers
     recorded in both databases. The beneﬁciary data provides a snapshot of who the beneﬁciaries were
     as of June 30, 2014. For beneﬁts provided less frequently (such as once every three years or ﬁve
     years), beneﬁciary status was recorded as if they had availed of/beneﬁted from the service since June
     30, 2009.
        Given the high population coverage of the PMT, the analysis assumes that the program coverage
     presented in this study is a proxy for national coverage of these programs. The 2013 PMT data
     collection set out to cover all the households in the country, in census style. The combined PMT and
     administrative data (hereafter referred to as the SW Admin/PMT data) contained a total of 2,636,370
     individual records. However, 257,302 individual records from the administrative data could not be
     merged with the PMT data. These 257,302 individuals were not included in the analysis because
     without linking to the PMT data, there was no information on household or individual characteristics of
     these individuals that could be included in analyzing beneﬁciary proﬁles.10 Nonetheless, it is important
     to note that three-quarters of these individuals are recipients of the Child Money Program, which by
     deﬁnition suggests that they are children between 0-18 years of age.
        Information on expenditures on allowances and budgets for 2010, 2011, and 2012 and the
     budget summary data for 2010-2015 were obtained from GOSWS. These expenditures and budgets
     are broken down by program, listing the number of beneﬁciaries per program. These expenditures and


     9. The PMT data was updated in December 2013, with preliminary assessments indicating good quality of data.
     10. Although information on individual characteristics of these individuals is unavailable, the programs they received are known: around
     3 percent (7,981 individuals) received SW pensions, none received SW transfers, around 0.3 percent (836 individuals) used SW services,
     0.2 percent (474 individuals) received Beneﬁts for the Elderly with State Merits, and none received the Food Stamp Program.

budgets only include the budgets for transfers and reimbursements provided to beneﬁciaries, not the
operational/administrative costs of running these programs.

    Limitations of the Study
   Given the data issues described above (with 10 percent of individual records not linked to the
PMT data), it is not evident how biased the data is when presenting overall program coverage.
The total number of beneﬁciaries per program in the database does not neatly match with the
number of beneﬁciaries reported in the GOSWS expenditures/budgets. However, the data does allow
for presenting a good picture of the personal characteristics of program beneﬁciaries and program
coverage overlap.
    Another limitation is that the administrative data that was linked to the PMT data only provides
information on whether an individual received a speciﬁc program between July 2009 and June 2014
at least once. The data does not indicate how many times the individual received the same program,
when the beneﬁts were received, or how much was received. The estimated beneﬁts presented in this
note are based on how much individuals are supposed to receive as beneﬁciaries according to the
program design. Similarly, for beneﬁts that are provided less frequently than once a year, the estimation
assumes that the beneﬁt was provided in the year of the analysis. This estimation of individual beneﬁts
therefore represents the maximum amount an individual receives in a given year. For beneﬁts and
assistance that provide reimbursements (rather than a ﬁxed cash amount), the average amount per
beneﬁciary was based on 2012 expenditure data.11

    Structure of the report
   The report is structured as follows. The report begins with a summary of programs reviewed,
a description of the PMT targeting system, and the proﬁle of individuals in the database. It then
presents key ﬁndings from the review of budgets and the analysis of SW Admin/PMT data on program
coverage and distributional equity of program beneﬁts. The report concludes with a discussion of
policy implications and recommendations that emerged from the key ﬁndings and the process of data                                        19
gathering and analysis. The Annexes include program descriptions based on the corresponding laws;
the estimated beneﬁt levels per individual; government expenditure/budget trends for each program
since 2010; and information on social welfare program beneﬁciaries, by program grouping.12




11. The expenditures for 2012 were used since the more recent 2013 ﬁgures obtained by the authors were budget data, not the actual
expenditures.
12. The program groupings include: Social Welfare Pensions, Social Welfare Allowance, Allowance and Assistance for the Elderly, Ben-
eﬁts for the Elderly with State Merit, Allowance and Assistance for the Disabled, and Allowance for Mothers and Children. Although the
Food Stamp Program is included as a Social Welfare Allowance, the Food Stamp Program and Child Money Program are also reviewed
separately.

        2. SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAMS
        The Ministry of Population Development and Social Protection (MPDSP) currently executes 71
     social welfare programs as well as the Child Money Program (CMP).13 The social welfare programs
     aim to provide minimum social welfare to eligible individuals, while the near-universal CMP aims to
     redistribute mineral wealth to the next generation. This section provides a brief description of the
     programs analyzed for this report as well as how they were categorized.14
        The social welfare programs are deﬁned in the Social Welfare Law (2012) and other legislation
     detailing the program eligibility criteria. All but one program are categorically targeted, providing a
     combination of cash transfers and reimbursements. The Food Stamp Program is the only poverty-
     targeted program and bases program eligibility on the PMT data.
        The social welfare programs can be categorized into seven program groups according to the way
     the programs are administered:
            Social Welfare Pensions (cash allowance)
            Social Welfare Allowance (cash allowance)
            Social Welfare Services, including Community-Based Services and Specialized Care Services
            (service provision)
            Social Welfare Service Allowance for the Elderly with State Merit (cash allowance and
            reimbursements)
            Allowance for the Elderly (cash allowance and reimbursements)
            Allowance for the Disabled (cash allowance and reimbursements)
            Allowance for Mothers and Children (cash allowance)


20     The programs and beneﬁt amounts, as well as examples of types of beneﬁts provided, are
     summarized below.
        Social Welfare Pensions provide a monthly cash allowance for citizens who are not entitled to
     a pension under social insurance legislation. These include: senior citizens15; vertically challenged
     (“dwarf individual”) persons 16 years of age and above; disabled persons 16 years old and above;
     children under 18 years old without foster parents; and single mothers 45 years of age and above or
     single fathers 50 years of age and above with four or more children under 18 years old. The monthly
     transfer amounts are MNT 115,000 (approximately USD 62).
        Social Welfare Allowances are provided for those who require social welfare assistance and
     emergency livelihood support, including pregnant women and mothers with infants and those who are
     taking care of others requiring care. The allowances vary in amount and frequency and include:
        The allowance for caregivers, which provides MNT 52,800 (approximately USD 29) per month;
        One-time assistance of MNT 1,200,000 (approximately USD 649) for young adults (18-24 years
     old) who became orphans before turning 18 years old or for households who lost their shelter due to
     a disaster or accident;
        One-time assistance of MNT 1,000,000 (approximately USD 541) for those with twins and MNT
     3,000,000 (approximately USD 1,622) for those with triplets;
        •   An annual allowance of MNT 120,000 (approximately USD 65) for single parents with three or
            more children under 14 years of age;
        •   A quarterly allowance of MNT 60,000 (approximately USD 32) for individuals requiring permanent
            nursing care; and


     13. The programs are listed in Annex II.
     14. More detailed program descriptions are provided in Annex I.
     15. Deﬁned as men aged 60 years old and above, women aged 55 years old and above.

   The Food Stamp Program, which is included in this group of programs for the purposes of this
analysis. The Food Stamp Program merits attention because, as stated above, it is the only program
to date that applies the PMT data for eligibility. It targets the bottom 5 percent of households in terms
of welfare status, according to their PMT scores. The program provides food stamps to purchase food,
equivalent to MNT 10,000 (approximately USD 5) per adult per month and MNT 5,000 (approximately
USD 3) per child per month.
    Social Welfare Services include Community-Based Services and Specialized Care Services.
Community-Based Services include services such as counseling, rehabilitation, temporary
accommodation and care, day care service, and home-based care and services. These services are
targeted at groups such as the elderly, the disabled, and victims of violence, citizens released from
prison, or alcoholics and drug addicts. Specialized Care Services are institutional care services targeted
at the single elderly, single disabled persons, and children in diﬃcult circumstances.
    Social Welfare Service Allowance for the Elderly with State Merits has its legal basis in the “Law
on Additional Beneﬁts for Senior Citizens, who are the state hero, labor hero, and with the people’s
honor and the state honor“(2008) which speciﬁes ﬁnancial beneﬁts from the government for senior
citizens with state merits (such as war veterans and those awarded Hero of Mongolia, Labor Hero, and
other honors). The beneﬁt types include cash assistance of MNT 200,000 (approximately USD 108) per
month for veterans of war or surviving spouses and cash assistance of MNT 150,000 (approximately
USD 81) per month to winners of the Mongolian State Prize, state nominees, Udarnik of the State, and
senior veterans of the revolutionary struggle. In addition, reimbursements and vouchers for nursing
homes and sanitariums (cash value of MNT 140,000, or approximately USD 76) and annual assistance
for apartment and fuel costs (MNT 140,000) are also provided.
    Allowance for the Elderly provides assistance such as reimbursements for prosthetics, vouchers
for nursing homes and sanatoriums, and reimbursements for transportation for use of health facilities
and nursing homes. Most of this assistance is provided as reimbursements and in the form of vouchers.
The reimbursements for prosthetics, given once every ﬁve years, are for body parts such as false teeth,
                                                                                                             21
ﬁngers, and toes as well as for hearing aids and spectacles.
    Allowance for the Disabled is for individuals with no capacity or limited capacity to participate
in social relations like other persons due to body defect or mental, psychological, and perceptional
disorders. Assistance to the disabled includes reimbursements for services such as: annual ﬁnancial
assistance to pay for apartment fees or fuel costs; reimbursements for rehabilitation and prosthetic
correction; transport to and from school (or provision of a bus) for minors with disabilities and their
guardian or caregiver; a one-way transportation fee and 50 percent of the rest and treatment fee at a
sanitarium once a year; and land phone fee for the blind. Most of these allowances are reimbursements
of fees and are not assigned a monetary value, except for: MNT 140,000 (approximately USD 76) for
the annual apartment fee or fuel cost allowances, MNT 200,000 (approximately USD 108) annually
for school transportation costs for children with disabilities and their guardians, and MNT 20,000
(approximately USD 11) monthly for the communication allowance for the blind. Prosthetics for speciﬁc
body parts are covered as well as equipment such as wheelchairs, neck supporters, and walking sticks
for the blind.
    Allowance for Mothers and Children includes two types of programs: allowances for pregnant
and lactating mothers and allowances for the “Mother’s Glory” (also known as the Mother Heroes)
program, which recognizes mothers who have given birth to four or more children. Once a Mother
Hero, a mother receives beneﬁts for the remainder of her life. The allowance for pregnant and lactating
mothers is a monthly allowance of MNT 40,000 (approximately USD 22) provided for 12 months
starting from the ﬁfth month of pregnancy. Mother Heroes 1st medal recipients receive an annual
beneﬁt of MNT 200,000 (approximately USD 108), while 2nd medal recipients receive an annual beneﬁt
of MNT 100,000 (approximately USD 54). Although the allowance for pregnant and lactating mothers
is provided only when a women is pregnant or lactating, the Mother Heroes beneﬁts are provided for a
lifetime once the person becomes an honoree. These two programs—particularly the Mother Heroes
beneﬁts—could be considered programs to promote population growth rather than to provide social
welfare assistance for beneﬁciaries to meet minimum needs.

        •   In addition to these social welfare programs, MPDSP executes the Child Money Program
            (CMP). The CMP is regulated by the Law on the Human Development Fund for the purpose of
            distributing resources generated from mining revenues to citizens. As it is not regulated by the
            Social Welfare Law or related legislation, it is not strictly a social welfare program. The CMP is
            funded from the Human Development Fund, separately from the state budget for social welfare.
            It provides cash amounts of MNT 20,000 (approximately USD 11) per month to all children 0-
            18 years old. Despite its objectives and the source of funding being separate from the social
            welfare system, since it is implemented by MPDSP along other social welfare programs, the
            CMP is often (although not always) considered to be part of the social welfare system. Given
            its size, the CMP has major ﬁscal implications and therefore is considered critical for inclusion
            in this review. In some sections of the report (particularly on overall budget trends), the CMP
            is analyzed separately since its disproportionately large size distorts the scale and budgets of
            social welfare programs, making analysis of other programs diﬃcult.

 3. THE PROXY MEANS TEST AND DATA SOURCE FOR THE
ANALYSIS
   The ﬁrst targeting methodology to identify household livelihood levels based on the PMT was
approved by a joint order of the Chairman of the National Statistics Oﬃce (NSO) and the Minister for
Social Welfare and Labor in 2010. The PMT formula included seven types of observable variables and
a constant, identiﬁed by analyzing the 2007/08 Household Socio-Economic Survey (HSES). Targeting
data was collected between 2010 and 2012, and the ﬁrst PMT targeting database was applied to
identify beneﬁciary households for the Food Stamp Program.
   The PMT formula was most recently revised in 2013. The second PMT formula differed from the
ﬁrst formula in three ways: (i) addition of new variables such as type of employment, land ownership,
and disability; (ii) change in estimation of consumption from per capita estimation to use of per adult-
equivalent scale; and (iii) reduction from four to three strata16 by combining all rural areas (Castro,
2013). The PMT targeting database is expected to be renewed every three years.
   Assessment of the 2013 data indicates that the quality is acceptable with very high coverage,
good internal consistency, and external statistical validation17 with the 2010 census and 2012 HSES.
The household survey data was collected between November and December of 2013 and covered
666,673 households. Compared to the 2010 census (adjusted by the estimated annual population
growth to the population in 2013), the PMT data covered 86 percent of the population nationwide, with
the lowest coverage of 80 percent in Ulaanbaatar and highest coverage of 95 percent in the Western
Region (Asian Development Bank, 2014). 18
   The 2013 PMT data served as the basis for the analysis of this note. The PMT data was merged
with the social welfare program administrative data, using the unique national identiﬁcation number
assigned to each citizen of the country. The social welfare program administrative database contains
2,636,370 individual records. As discussed earlier, of these individual records, 257,302 individual
                                                                                                                                           23
records (9.8 percent) were not linked/merged with the PMT records.
    The remainder of this section provides a description of the characteristics of the individuals included
in the combined PMT and social welfare administrative data (SW Admin/PMT data). In the combined
data, there were 662,319 households. The average age was 28.4 years old, with 49 percent males and
51 percent females. In terms of geographic distribution, around 40 percent of the individuals were
from Ulaanbaatar (Table 1). The two largest aimags in terms of the population in the database were
Khuvsgul and Uvurkhangai. The smallest aimags were Govisumber followed by Dundgovi.

         School attainment of adults
        Among adults 18 years old and above, two-thirds had either completed secondary education or
     attained less than secondary school education. Around 4.8 percent had no education, while 8 percent
     had primary school education and 15.8 percent had some secondary education. About one-quarter of
     the adults had higher than technical/vocational school education.

        Around 4.3 percent of the individuals reported having some disability. Of those with disabilities,
     90.5 percent had certiﬁcates of disability. The most common disability (excluding the “others”
     category) was physical impairment (reported by 23 percent of those with disabilities) followed by
     mental impairment (reported by 20 percent of those with disabilities) (Table 3).

    Work
   Among the working-age group,19 58.3 percent of the individuals reported to have worked the
previous week. Among those who did not work in the previous week, only 14.3 percent worked during
the previous year.

    PMT score quintiles
  Although the household PMT scores were divided into quintiles, the individuals from those
households did not neatly divide into quintiles because households in the lower quintiles had larger
household sizes. Households in the lowest quintile had 5.2 household members on average, while
households in the highest quintile had only 3.6 members (Table 4 and Table 5).

    Poorer households had many more children between 0-18 years old compared to better-off
households (Table 5). On average, households in the poorest quintile had one more child than other
quintiles. Differences in the number of household members from quintile to quintile were driven by
differences in the number of children in those households.

        While the average age and gender of household heads were similar across wealth quintiles, the
     poorer households had much higher proportions of household heads who were disabled and who
     were less likely to have worked during the week of the interview (Table 6). This may be a reﬂection of
     the PMT formula, as households with disabled members were more likely to have lower PMT scores,
     thus being identiﬁed as poor.

    4. KEY FINDINGS

    Budgets and Expenditures on Social Welfare
    In 2013, the government spent 2.78 percent of GDP on cash transfers for social welfare including
the CMP (1.37 percent excluding the CMP). This is relatively generous, considering that the average
spending by developing and emerging countries is 1.6 percent of GDP (World Bank, 2014). It suggests
that the government is committed to allocating adequate ﬁscal resources to ensure the social welfare
of the population.
    In terms of trends in the total expenditure on beneﬁts, the largest allocation by far for cash
grants in 2013 was for the CMP.20 The CMP comprises approximately half of the total allocation for
cash grants but also covers the largest number of beneﬁciaries (Table 7 and Figure 5). The second
largest expenditure was Social Pensions (MNT 83 billion, approximately USD 50 million21) followed by
the Allowance for Mothers and Children (MNT 67 billion, approximately USD 40 million22). These two
programs combined were still less than two-thirds of the budgeted amount for the CMP in 2013 (Table
7).

        Excluding the CMP, the expenditures for all programs increased slightly between 2010 and 2013,
     taking inﬂation into account (Figure 6). The largest increase was the two-fold increase for Social
     Welfare Pensions. Expenditures on Beneﬁts for Pregnant and Lactating Mothers increased about 40
28   percent between 2011 and 2013, while the budget for Mother Heroes beneﬁts decreased about 45
     percent.

    Total Number of Beneﬁciaries
   In 2013, the CMP, the largest program in terms of coverage, had an estimated one million
beneﬁciaries. This is more than twice the size of the second largest program, the Allowance for Mothers
and Children, with 405,000 beneﬁciaries. The smallest program was the Beneﬁts for the Elderly with
State Merits, with only 4,000 beneﬁciaries in 2012 (Figure 7).

   Analysis of the SW Admin/PMT data conﬁrmed the overwhelming coverage of the CMP. Around
94 percent of children 0-18 years old received the program. Interestingly, even when broken down by
quintile, 94 percent of children 0-18 years old in every quintile received the CMP.
    In contrast to the trends in expenditures, the numbers of beneﬁciaries of social welfare programs
other than the CMP have largely remained constant since 2010. The only increase in number of
beneﬁciaries was for the Allowance for Mothers and Children between 2010 and 2011. This increase
was due to a rise in the number of beneﬁciaries of the Beneﬁts for Mother Heroes from 2010 to 2011,
following the softening of the eligibility criteria.23




23. The number of children to which mothers had to give birth to become a Level 1 Mother Hero was reduced from 7 to 6. For a Level 2
Mother Hero, the number was reduced from 5 to 4 children.

        Coverage of Social Welfare Programs
        When the CMP is included, half (49.4%) of all individuals in the database received at least one
     program beneﬁt. This coverage is very high, considering that the poverty rate in 2012 in Mongolia
     was 27 percent. Only a handful of developing and emerging countries have coverage of social welfare
30   beneﬁts higher than the poverty rate (World Bank, 2014). The coverage drops considerably, however,
     when the CMP is excluded, with only 19 percent of the population receiving at least one program.
        Analysis of the SW Admin/PMT data indicates that beyond the CMP, the vast majority of individuals
     (81 percent) did not receive Social Welfare Program beneﬁts (Figure 9). Around 14 percent received
     one program, 3.4 percent received two programs, and just above 1 percent of the individuals received
     three programs. Only 0.5 percent received four or more programs.

    Among those who received at least one cash transfer program, the average amount of estimated
cash transfers received annually was MNT 313,167 (approximately USD 179), including the CMP.24
An estimated average cumulative amount of MNT 219,197 (118 USD) was received by around 3.6
percent of individuals (approximately 86,000 individuals) who received reimbursements and vouchers
since 2009. As a reference, the cash component of the transfers represented between 15-18 percent
of the Minimal Living Standard in 2014, depending on where the beneﬁciary resided.25

    Equity in Beneﬁt Distribution
   According to estimates based on the SW Admin/PMT database, the largest share of total
beneﬁts was received by individuals in the lowest social welfare quintiles, estimated by the PMT
score.26 The bottom 40 percent received 56 percent of total social welfare transfers, while the top
40 percent received 28 percent of total social welfare transfers. Individuals from households in the
poorest quintile received 34 percent of total social welfare transfers, which is comparable to other
countries in the region (Table 8).27 However, in European and Central Asian countries, the share of total
beneﬁts going to the poorest 20 percent reaches over 40 percent (e.g., Croatia and Kosovo). In the
best-performing countries around the world, the poorest 20 percent receive over 50 percent of total
beneﬁts (e.g., Argentina, Panama, Peru).

   The largest program contributing to the share received by individuals in the lowest social welfare
quintile was the CMP (16 percent). As shown in Figure 10, the next highest contributors were Social
Welfare Pensions (9 percent), Social Welfare Transfers including the Food Stamp Program (4 percent),
and Allowances for Mothers and Children (3 percent). Individuals in the second-lowest social welfare
quintile received 22 percent of total social welfare transfers. As in the case of the lowest quintile, the
programs that contributed to the share of beneﬁts received by those in the second-lowest quintile
were: the CMP, Social Welfare Pensions, Social Welfare Transfers, and Allowances for Mothers and
Children.




24. This assumes that for those who received beneﬁts that are provided less frequently than once a year (for example, once every three
years or once every ﬁve years), the beneﬁt was provided in the year of the analysis. Therefore, the average amount of MNT 313,167 is the
average of the maximum amount that an individual could receive from social welfare programs.
25. Minimum Living Standards in 2014 were: MNT 146,600 in Western Region; MNT 149,600 in Khangai region; MNT 149,700 in Central
region; MNT 144,500 in Eastern Region, and MNT 169,000 in Ulaanbaatar. http://www.nso.mn/page/60 (accessed October 14, 2014)
26. The analysis of share of beneﬁts received assumed that those who were listed as being a program beneﬁciary in the administrative
data were indeed receiving the full beneﬁt amounts. For cash beneﬁts, the amounts were annualized according to the program design
(beneﬁt amounts and frequency of payment). For reimbursements, it assumed that all beneﬁciaries received their full amount in the year
of the analysis (for beneﬁts provided less frequently than once a year), and the average reimbursement amounts were estimated using
the 2012 expenditure ﬁgures obtained from GOSWS.
27. “The State of the Social Safety Nets 2014” states that the beneﬁt incidence of total beneﬁts in Mongolia going to the poorest 20 per-
cent is 22.5 percent, based on analysis of household survey data (HSES 2007). The beneﬁt incidence of 34 percent given in this report is
estimated based on analysis of PMT and SW Administrative data.

        Although most programs were categorically targeted, some programs were more pro-poor than
     others. The pro-poor programs, with larger shares of program beneﬁts received by lower PMT score
     quintile groups, were Social Welfare Pensions, Social Welfare Transfers, CMP, Allowance for the
     Disabled, and Allowances for Mothers and Children (Figure 11).

         In contrast, programs that were less pro-poor (regressive) were: Beneﬁts for the Elderly with
     State Merits, and the Allowance for the Elderly program. In particular, although the program is not an
     anti-poverty program, the proportion of Beneﬁts for the Elderly with State Merits that went to the non-
     poor is striking. The vast majority of beneﬁciaries were in the highest social welfare quintile according
     to their PMT scores.


     28. In Figure 11, the ﬁrst bar (% individuals in quintile) for each quintile depicts the share of individuals in that quintile. Therefore, program
     beneﬁt shares higher than the ﬁrst bar indicate that the quintile group received disproportionately more program beneﬁts. If program
     shares are lower than the ﬁrst bar, it means that the quintile group received disproportionately less program beneﬁts.

   The fact that Beneﬁts for the Elderly with State Merits were enjoyed by the non-poor is important
to note given that the beneﬁt amounts of this program were the most generous compared to other
programs. Estimating from the program expenditure and number of beneﬁciaries in 2013, the average
beneﬁciary of this program received approximately MNT 1,320,000 (approximately USD 713) per year.
This is 12 times the generosity level of the Food Stamp Program which exclusively beneﬁts those in
the lowest quintile, with an approximate annual beneﬁt of MNT 112,000 (approximately USD 60).

    The gender distribution of beneﬁciaries differed across programs (Figure 13). The CMP and
Allowance for the Disabled both had equal numbers of male and female beneﬁciaries. The beneﬁciaries
of programs associated with motherhood—including many under the Social Welfare Transfers—
were naturally women: beneﬁciaries of the Allowance for Mothers and Children were all female, and
around 58 percent of Social Welfare Transfers beneﬁciaries were women. More women received the
Allowance for the Elderly (69 percent) and Social Pensions (54 percent), probably due to the lower age
of eligibility (55 years old for women compared to 60 years old for men) and the longer life expectancy
of women compared to men. The only exception was the Beneﬁts for the Elderly with State Merits,
which beneﬁted men (82 percent) far more than women.

beneﬁt shares higher than the ﬁrst bar indicate that the quintile group received disproportionately more program beneﬁts. If program
shares are lower than the ﬁrst bar, it means that the quintile group received disproportionately less program beneﬁts.

        Program Beneﬁts Received by the Elderly
         According to the SW Admin/PMT data, around 70 percent of pension-aged individuals beneﬁted
     from at least one social welfare program, not including social insurance pensions which are not part
     of this analysis. On average, a pension-aged individual receiving at least one social welfare program
     received an estimated MNT 331,000 in cash allowances a year.

        Figure 14 suggests that the elderly beneﬁt from multiple programs and are combining beneﬁts
     from different types of programs. Around 76 percent of total social welfare beneﬁts received by the
     elderly went to those beneﬁting from multiple programs.

   Around 23 percent of social welfare transfers received by the elderly went to beneﬁciaries who
received only one program. The Allowance for Mothers and Children (in this case Mother Heroes
Program) and the Allowance for the Elderly were the two programs that provided beneﬁts to those
elderly who received only one program. This was similar for those who received two programs.
   The fact that the elderly were receiving multiple programs to meet their needs may be a strong
indication of the fragmented nature of programs addressing the needs of the elderly. Figure 14
above shows that Assistance for the Elderly, Social Welfare Transfers, and Social Welfare Pensions
were the three larger programs that were needs-based, which the elderly were combining to meet their
needs. This suggests that a more comprehensive program for the elderly would be a program with
elements from the Assistance for the Elderly and Social Welfare Transfers.

   Program Beneﬁts Received by the Disabled
   According to the SW Admin/PMT data, 66 percent of the disabled received at least one social
welfare program. Coverage of the disabled above 16 years old and those below 16 years old were
quite distinct, so they are reviewed separately below.
   For adults older than 16 years old, 63 percent received at least one program, predominantly Social
Welfare Pensions which comprised an estimated 76 percent of the beneﬁts going to the disabled.
Social Welfare Pensions provided among the most generous beneﬁts compared to other programs
beneﬁting the disabled. Around 43 percent of beneﬁts were received by those receiving only one
program (mainly Social Welfare Pensions), while those receiving multiple programs received a larger
share of their beneﬁts from Social Welfare Transfers and the Allowance for the Disabled (Figure 15).
The fact that the disabled were combining multiple programs but with beneﬁts coming predominantly
from Social Welfare Pensions suggests that a comprehensive program for the disabled largely based
on Social Welfare Pensions could replace programs that currently provide smaller shares of beneﬁts.

   On average, a disabled person above 16 years old receiving at least one social welfare program
received an estimated MNT 924,000 in cash allowances a year. They were the largest beneﬁciaries in
terms of average beneﬁt amount per individual due mainly to the size of the Social Welfare Pensions,
after the beneﬁciaries with state merits and honors.

        Among the disabled below 16 years of age, 87 percent received at least one program and received.
     Around 81 percent of the share of transfers to the disabled younger than age 16 was provided by the
     CMP. About one-ﬁfth of the disabled younger than 16 years old received beneﬁts from three or more
     programs, namely the CMP, Social Welfare Transfers, and Allowance for the Disabled (Figure 16).
     Those younger than 16 years old are not eligible for Social Welfare Pensions.

        Program Beneﬁts Received by the Poor
        Estimates based on the SW Admin/PMT data indicate that 62 percent of individuals from
     households in the poorest quintile according to PMT score were direct beneﬁciaries of at least one
     social welfare program, but the ﬁgure drops to 29 percent when the CMP is excluded. On average,
     an individual in the poorest household quintile beneﬁting from at least one social welfare program
     received an estimated MNT 362,542 in cash allowance per year. Around 64 percent of total beneﬁts
     going to the poorest quintile went to beneﬁciaries who received only one program, including the CMP
     (Figure 17). The majority of the poor only received one program. The largest share of beneﬁts for the
     poor came predominantly from the CMP followed by Social Welfare Pensions, although the CMP was
     the single and largest beneﬁt received by many individuals in the poorest quintile.

    The Food Stamp Program is the only program that speciﬁcally targets the poor. Around 2.3
percent of households in the SW Admin/PMT database (15,118 households out of 662,559 households)
received the Food Stamp Program. All households belonged to the poorest quintile, with the exception
of one household which belonged to the third quintile. Figure 18 shows the proportion of households
in the poorest quintile who received the Food Stamp Program by PMT score. The PMT score for the
poorest 5 percent was between 0 and 244, and as shown in Figure 18, all (but one, not shown in
the graph) of the beneﬁciaries were among the poorest 5 percent. In fact, all the beneﬁciaries were
among the poorest 2.7 percent according to PMT score. Among the bottom 2.7 percent, 85.6 percent

        5. POLICY IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
         To better protect the poor and ensure the ﬁscal sustainability of social welfare programs, options
     for making social welfare programs more eﬃcient and effective are sought urgently. Given the
     relatively generous distribution of social welfare programs, it is possible for the government to contain
     costs while making programs more effective in terms of protecting the poor from negative shocks and
     reducing poverty. This section discusses the recommended strategies, based on the review of social
     welfare programs.

        Consolidating Fragmented Programs
        Three strategies are recommended in consolidating the existing social welfare programs and are
     discussed in greater detail below:
        •   Consolidate small programs that share similar objectives and are targeted to the same beneﬁciary
            types by prioritizing program design based on the need to provide comprehensive support to the
            targeted population through a more comprehensive program;
        •   Strengthen programs that are needs-based and gradually phase out entitlement-based programs;
            and
        •   In the future, consider transferring health-related beneﬁts to be covered by Health Insurance.
        Consolidate small programs. As noted earlier, the MPDSP/GOSWS currently implements 71
     programs, although the number of programs is partly derived by the way these programs are counted.
     While these programs can be grouped in a thematic way, the individual programs are very speciﬁc
     and narrowly deﬁned. These fragmented programs lead to administrative burdens and complicated
     processes for applications and requesting claims. They also result in low beneﬁt amounts and low
     beneﬁciary coverage.
38
        Some programs have higher beneﬁt amounts but very low coverage. The “beneﬁts for citizens
     nursing children in their family who require protection because of being target of violence” provides
     MNT 52,800 (approximately USD 29) on a monthly basis. The “allowance to be provided to citizens
     taking care of single, disabled, elderly person who does not have any child or relative” provides the
     same beneﬁt amounts. In 2012, these programs covered 365 and 340 beneﬁciaries, respectively. With
     these small programs, it is diﬃcult to avoid beneﬁt overlaps and ineﬃciencies. Consolidation of these
     smaller programs should focus on designing programs to be comprehensive enough to provide the
     necessary coverage and beneﬁt support to meet the needs of the targeted population.
         As discussed earlier, the analysis revealed that beneﬁciaries—particularly the elderly—are combining
     multiple programs to meet their needs. Social Welfare Transfers and the Allowance for the Elderly
     are two needs-based programs that the elderly are accessing to combine beneﬁts. A more detailed
     analysis and qualitative beneﬁciary feedback study is required to understand which speciﬁc elements
     of these programs should be combined to provide a more comprehensive program for the elderly.
        Similarly, in addition to Social Welfare Pensions, the disabled are accessing the Allowance for the
     Disabled and Social Welfare Transfers. In parallel to the review of beneﬁts for the elderly, a more
     detailed review including a qualitative beneﬁciary feedback study is recommended to ensure that a
     more comprehensive program can be designed to meet the needs of the disabled appropriately.
         In consolidating these programs and designing comprehensive programs, it would be important
     to take into account the different needs of male and female beneﬁciaries within the speciﬁc target
     groups.
        Strengthen needs-based programs and consider exit strategies for entitlement-based programs.
     Programs such as Beneﬁts for the Elderly with State Merit and Mother Heroes program are based
     on entitlements to beneﬁts rather than need for social welfare. Entitlement-based programs are
     more regressive than programs designed to address speciﬁc needs. As discussed earlier, the most
     regressive program that provides allowances and assistance for the well-off is Beneﬁts for the Elderly
              REVIEW OF PROGRAM DESIGN AND BENEFICIARY PROFILES OF SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAMS IN MONGOLIA




with State Merit, which also has the most generous estimated beneﬁt amounts by far.
    Given that the vast majority of the beneﬁts are received by the better-off, these programs should be
phased out, to be replaced by non-cash-based recognition of the honor or by a one-time award instead
of lifetime monthly beneﬁts. The Mother Heroes program and Beneﬁts for the Elderly with State Merit
together comprise about 7 percent of the social welfare transfer budget, which was about 0.45 percent
of the 2013 state budget. If these programs are eventually phased out or replaced by a one-time cash
award, the government will have considerable ﬁscal savings in the long run that could be reallocated
to poverty-targeted or needs-based programs.
    Transfer speciﬁc health-related beneﬁts to the Social Health Insurance Program. As described
above, the Allowance for the Elderly and the Allowance for the Disabled provide reimbursements for
prosthetics of speciﬁc body parts as well as equipment such as hearing aids and false teeth. In 2012
alone, MNT 5.3 billion (approximately USD 2.9 million) in nominal terms was spent for these programs
together. The categories for each provision under the programs are extremely speciﬁc, although
it is unclear how effectively these reimbursements are addressing the needs of beneﬁciaries. The
reimbursements for prosthetics and concessions for sanatoriums, nursing homes, and institutional
care may be better suited to being covered under social health insurance and hence addressed in a
comprehensive manner.

   Making Social Welfare Programs Poverty-Targeted
   Social welfare programs can be made poverty-targeted by eliminating or reducing beneﬁts for
the richer quintiles, using the readily available PMT database. The most effective way of containing
the costs of social welfare programs while making them more effective is to add poverty targeting
to existing programs that are currently categorically targeted. The Ministry already owns an updated
PMT database, which allows the government to identify the poor. This is a very powerful tool that is not
readily available to many governments around the world, which allows the government to make any
program poverty-targeted if desired.
                                                                                                           39
   The CMP is expected to have a considerable poverty impact, but the level of program expenditures
may be diﬃcult to sustain. As discussed above, the program has wide coverage—beneﬁting the poor
as well as non-poor—and a large beneﬁt amount (MNT 240,000 or approximately USD 130 per child
per year). At the same time, the total budget for transfers of this program alone was MNT 240 billion
(approximately USD 130 million) in 2013, accounting for 51 percent of total transfers made through
social welfare programs in Mongolia. Considering the ﬁscal deﬁcit faced by the government, this level
of expenditures on the CMP may be diﬃcult to sustain.

   Taking these facts into account, possible options going forward include:
   •   Continue the CMP as is as the program is effectively reaching the poor, if the ﬁscal environment
       allows for the program to continue;
       •     Introduce program design features to the CMP such that the poor receive larger amounts,
             while maintaining universal coverage of the program. This could be achieved by using the
             PMT to identify children in poor households or through categorical means of providing
             larger amounts for children in households with many (three or more, for example) children.
             Altering program beneﬁts for children in different types of households will make program
             administration more complex, and if poverty targeting is introduced, strong operational
             design and implementation plans would need to be prepared to address the potential
             exclusion of deserving children. Reallocation of beneﬁts could be done in a cost-neutral
             way or in a way that reduces total program cost:
       •     To maintain cost neutrality, the grant amounts reallocated to the poor would be equal to
             the reduction in grant amounts for the better-off.
   •   To reduce program cost, the sum of the grant amounts reallocated to poorer children would be
       lower than the sum of grant amounts reduced for better-off children.

             Terminate the CMP and replace it with a new poverty-targeted cash transfer program. Termination
             of the CMP will give the government ﬁscal space to design a poverty-targeted welfare program,
             with clear poverty alleviation objectives. Two design options could be:
         o Implement the Poverty Beneﬁt program stipulated in the Social Welfare Law (2012).31 The
           new program would need to provide signiﬁcant levels of coverage and beneﬁts in order to
           compensate for the loss of beneﬁts experienced by poor households due to termination of the
           CMP, with a strong operational design to address the potential exclusion of poor households.
           The advantages are that the program would have a clear poverty alleviation objective, and
           depending on coverage and beneﬁt amounts, it could lead to considerable budget savings. The
           disadvantages are that this will be a new program, and as with any new program, considerable
           operational preparation will be required.
         o Add a child beneﬁt component to the new Poverty Beneﬁt Program described above to maintain
           the focus on providing support to the next generation (as in the CMP). Again, it would be very
           important to ensure that this new Poverty Beneﬁt Program (or at least the child component)
           would be large enough in terms of coverage and beneﬁt amounts to compensate for termination
           of the CMP. If the child beneﬁt component focuses on the poorest 40 percent of households,
           this would still cover half of the children currently covered by the CMP, since poorer household
           have many more children than the better off. Adding a child beneﬁt component to the Poverty
           Beneﬁt Program would increase the complexity of program design as the transfer amounts per
           household would differ according to the number of children.
        Further simulation analysis using the HSES data is recommended to identify the most effective
     scenario for poverty impact. Given the limitations of the HSES questionnaire design, the analysis does
     not allow for a clean evaluation of the program. However, a simulation exercise could use the HSES
     data to analyze the different scenarios described above and determine the optimal beneﬁt size and the
     methods and threshold for targeting.
40      Introduction of design changes must be accompanied by strengthening of certain features
     of program operations to ensure that there is wide understanding and acceptance of the policy
     changes and that the intended beneﬁciaries will receive the programs. Strengthening of the following
     operational features is recommended, particularly if poverty targeting will be introduced:
         •   Strong communication campaigns to widely communicate the objectives of the policy change
             as well as changes in program design including eligibility, program beneﬁts, and how to report
             issues and grievances would be critical.
         •   Introducing targeting, whether through PMT or other categorical means, is bound to introduce
             exclusion error (eligible beneﬁciaries being excluded), no matter how good the targeting
             methodology is considered to be. Therefore, an effective grievance redress mechanism would
             be essential.
        If targeting will be conducted through application of the PMT, it would be very important to ensure
     the effective parallel implementation of the “Updating the information stored in the database” section
     of Cabinet Decree 404 (December 30, 2014). This will help keep the PMT database up-to-date in terms
     of changes to household welfare status made in response to grievances regarding registered welfare
     status based on the PMT scores, as well as ensure that the database is complete in case households
     were missed during the assessment.
        It is also important to note that the option of altering beneﬁt amounts by type of household would
     complicate administration of the program, so the MIS system would need to be prepared and designed
     accordingly.




     31. The direct translation of the program title in the Social Welfare Law from Mongolian is: “Beneﬁt for members of HHs in need for social
     assistance” (Poverty beneﬁt).

   Increasing the Generosity and Coverage of Poverty Reduction Programs
    As discussed earlier, the coverage of poor households by social welfare programs and the
generosity of beneﬁts received by those in the lowest quintile according to PMT score are low.
When translated into per-household transfer amounts, the transfer amounts are clearly small. Around
94 percent of households in the poorest quintiles had a household member who receives some social
transfers, with an average of MNT 867,443 received (including the CMP) per year per household.
Considering that the 2012 per capita poverty line was MNT 118,668 and that the average household
consisted of ﬁve members, this average household transfer amount was approximately 12 percent of
household consumption at the poverty line for a ﬁve-member household. Most countries provide social
welfare beneﬁts that represent 20 to 35 percent of the poorest households’ post-transfer consumption,
although there is signiﬁcant variation worldwide. The most generous countries in the Europe and
Central Asia region provide beneﬁts that represent between 40-55 percent of the poorest households’
post-transfer consumption (World Bank, 2013).
   The generosity and coverage of programs to protect the poor could be increased by establishing
a new program targeted to the poor or (in the short term) by revamping the Food Stamp Program.
There is an urgent need to focus social welfare programs on ensuring that the poor are protected from
economic shocks. The poor do not have a program that caters to their needs, and a large portion of
their beneﬁts are derived from the CMP, which equally beneﬁts those in all social welfare quintiles.

  Strengthening Active Labor Market Programs that Serve as a Safety Net and
Designing Social Welfare Programs that Promote Labor Force Participation
   Having effective and robust active labor market programs would provide an important safety
net for vulnerable workers. A gap in the current social welfare system is that there is no safety net
support for those who are poor (but not as poor as the bottom 5 percent) or near-poor and do not ﬁt
in any of the categories for social welfare program eligibility. Unemployment insurance only covers
formal workers who have contributed for at least 24 months with 9 months of consecutive coverage.             41
Laborers in temporary or seasonal jobs do not qualify for unemployment beneﬁts, yet they are the
ones who may be most affected by economic adjustment or other external economic shocks.
    For social welfare beneﬁciaries who are currently unemployed or under-employed, social welfare
programs could be used to promote engagement in work/skills accumulation activities. The current
design of social welfare programs is categorically targeted, so most beneﬁciaries are entitled to beneﬁts
as long as they remain within the categorical eligibility criteria. While the generosity and coverage of
poverty-targeted programs need to be increased, such programs should not create dependency but
should encourage beneﬁciaries to engage in labor. New generation work activation programs could be
introduced for beneﬁciaries who are unemployed, seasonally unemployed, or underemployed, applying
the principles of “welfare-to-work” transition approaches proven to be effective in many middle-income
countries. These programs could aim to link vulnerable individuals (including the poor, migrants, and
those living in the gher district) with seasonal jobs and skills development programs. The linkages
could be forged through co-responsibility for able-bodied welfare recipients to engage in work/skills
accumulation activities. An assessment of existing employment promotion programs implemented
by the Ministry of Labor could help inform the integration of effective activation policies into social
welfare programs.

   Strengthening the Monitoring and Evaluation of Social Welfare Programs
   Stronger monitoring and evaluation of programs would enable the government to design effective
social welfare programs in the future. No impact assessment of programs has been conducted to
date, so the government has little understanding of program impacts and how programs can be
improved. The government could consider:
   •   Requesting the addition of a speciﬁc module focused on social protection to the HSES questionnaire,
       or at a minimum, requesting revision of the HSES questionnaire “other income” section to distinguish
       social welfare and social insurance beneﬁts.
     REVIEW OF PROGRAM DESIGN AND BENEFICIARY PROFILES OF SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAMS IN MONGOLIA




        •   Fully utilizing the social welfare management information system (MIS) when it is uniﬁed and put
            online.
         • Conducting periodic reviews of programs by analyzing administrative data to inform decision-
            making.
         Although the HSES module that includes social welfare programs could potentially be a good
     source of information, the categories of programs included in that section of the current HSES
     questionnaire do not allow for systematic analysis of program effectiveness and impact. The module
     that includes the data on social welfare programs is the “other income” section that asks household
     respondents about individual income from sources other than jobs. Unfortunately, the program
     categorization mixes contributory (insurance) programs and non-contributory (welfare) programs, and
     the programs are deﬁned too broadly. Therefore, it is currently not possible to analyze the information
     in a meaningful manner. With some input from the MPDSP, the questionnaire may be revised for future
     surveys, which would serve as an important data source for monitoring and impact assessment of
     social welfare programs.
         It is important to ensure the accuracy of data entered at the local level and to build capacity to
     analyze the data for timely monitoring and reporting. The social welfare administrative data used
     for this analysis are all maintained at aimag and district-level welfare oﬃces, with very little oversight
     ensuring the quality of data entered into the system. With the establishment of the online MIS (currently
     under development), the GOSWS will be able to access the data on a regular basis to monitor and
     report on program implementation.
        In addition, a general clean-up of program codes would help ensure better data management. With
     the development of social welfare programs over time, the coding used as program identiﬁers also
     proliferated. However, programs that have been discontinued continue to be on the code list.

   6. CONCLUSION
    The above recommendations provide broad strategies for reforming social welfare programs but
do not address the speciﬁc design or operational details on how to make individual programs more
eﬃcient and effective. Each of the recommendations, if adopted, would require careful consideration
of program design and implementation details. The focus however, must remain as stated in the Social
Welfare Law: to ensure and protect the minimum welfare of vulnerable groups.
   Finally, an area that has not been covered by the analysis for this report but merits attention is tax
incidence and its potential contribution to wealth redistribution. Analysis is needed to understand the
effect of the ﬂat income tax rate on all income groups in Mongolia whether it dilutes the impacts of the
generally progressive nature of social welfare programs.

        ANNEX I: REVIEW OF INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS
        Social Welfare Pensions
        According to Article 12 in the Law on Social Welfare (2012), Social Welfare Pensions are granted on
     a monthly basis for citizens who are not entitled to a pension under social insurance legislation. These
     include the following categories of people:
        •   Men aged 60 years old and above, women aged 55 years old and above;
        •   A vertically challenged (“dwarf individual”) person 16 years and above;
        •   A disabled person 16 years old and above who has lost 50 percent or more of his/her capacity
            to work;
        •   A child under 18 years old whose foster parent has died; and
        •   A single mother aged 45 years old and above or a single father aged 50 years old and above with
            four or more children under 18 years old.
        The current monthly transfer amount of Social Welfare Pensions is MNT 115,000 (approximately
     USD 62), increased from MNT 103,600 (approximately USD 56) per month in January 2014. This
     monthly amount is between 68 to 79.5 percent of the Minimum Living Standard in 2014, meaning that
     with the income from Social Pensions alone, a one-person household would be considered to be living
     below the Minimum Living Standard.

        Expenditures on Social Welfare Pensions
        The budget for Social Welfare Pensions has increased steadily in the past three years, with total
     expenditure almost doubling between 2010 and 2012 in real terms. This trend is driven by the substantial
     increase in the allocation for the disabled (deﬁned as those with labor capacity lost by 50-60 percent
44   and those with over 70 percent lost) as well for children who have lost their breadwinner (Figure 19).

   Characteristics of Beneﬁciaries of Social Welfare Pensions
    In the SW Admin/PMT data, a total of 46,958 individuals received Social Welfare Pensions. This
is about 2 percent of the individuals in the SW Admin/PMT data and does not include contributory
pensions. Generally, beneﬁciaries only received one type of Social Welfare Pension but also received
other social welfare program beneﬁts. However, a small minority of individuals (199 individuals)
received multiple types of Social Welfare Pension beneﬁts. The vast majority (over 88 percent) of
individuals who beneﬁted from multiple pensions programs were those who received pensions for the
disabled as well as pensions for caring for children who lost a breadwinner.

   School attainment
   Social Welfare Pensions beneﬁciaries 18 years old and above had lower school attainment than the
general population, with over 86 percent of them having completed secondary education or less. The
percentage of those with no education was over ﬁve times higher than that of the general population
(4.82 percent) in the SW Admin/PMT database (Table 10).

         Disability
        Around 62.3 percent of Social Welfare Pensions beneﬁciaries reported having disabilities. Around
     33.2 percent of them suffered from mental impairments, followed by 20.7 percent suffering from
     physical impairments. Around 11 percent suffered from multiple disabilities (Table 11).
       Surprisingly, around 18 percent (6,065 individuals) of the 34,402 recipients of Social Welfare
     Pensions for the disabled reported not having disabilities, as indicated by the PMT data.

         Work
        Among working-age Social Welfare Pensions beneﬁciaries, 33.8 percent had worked in the past one
     week, while only 5.4 percent had worked in the last year. These percentages are considerably lower
     than those of the general population.

         PMT score quintile
         Possibly reﬂecting the high proportion of disabled among the beneﬁciaries,32 Social Welfare
     Pensions beneﬁciaries were overwhelmingly assessed as being among the poor according to their
     PMT scores. Around 48 percent of Social Welfare Pensions recipients were categorized as belonging
     to the poorest quintile, and 23.3 percent were in the second-lowest quintile (Table 12). The progressive
     and pro-poor nature of Social Welfare Pensions is evident when the proportion of the population in
     the database in the estimated wealth quintiles is compared to the proportion receiving Social Welfare
     Pensions (Figure 20).

     Table 12: Social Welfare Pensions Beneﬁciaries by PMT Score Quintile
     PMT score quintiles                                         Number of Social Welfare              Percentage
     1 - lowest (poor) to 5 - highest (better off)               Pensions beneﬁciaries

     32. Since disability is one of the variables in the PMT formula, households with disabled household members are more likely to get a
     lower PMT score than a household with no disabled member. Therefore, households with disabled members are more likely to be identi-
     ﬁed as being poor.

   Social Welfare Allowances
    According to Article 13 of the Law on Social Welfare (2012), Social Welfare Allowances include the
following:
   •      Allowance for caregivers;
   •      Allowance for individual household members requiring social welfare assistance;
   •      Allowance for emergency and livelihood support; and
   •      Allowance for pregnant women and mother with infants.
   The beneﬁt amounts for Social Welfare Allowances vary in amount and frequency. The allowance for
caregivers currently provides MNT 52,800 (approximately USD 29) per month.33 One-time assistance
of MNT 1,200,000 (approximately USD 649) is provided to young adults (18-24 years old) who became
orphans before turning 18 years old or to households who lost their shelter due to a disaster or accident.
One-time assistance of MNT 1,000,000 (approximately USD 541) is provided to those with twins and
MNT 3,000,000 (approximately USD 1,622) to those with triplets. An annual allowance of MNT 120,000
(approximately USD 65) is provided to a single parent with three or more children under 14 years old,
and a quarterly allowance of MNT 60,000 (approximately USD 32) is provided to individuals requiring
permanent nursing care.




33. This was increased from MNT 48,000 in January 2014.

          Expenditures on Social Welfare Allowances
        From 2010 to 2012, overall expenditures for Social Welfare Allowances increased by 60 percent in
     real terms. The budget allocation for 2013 indicates that this increased further, with the total amount
     more than doubling the 2010 level (Figure 21).

          Characteristics of Beneﬁciaries of Social Welfare Allowances
         According to the SW/PMT data, a total of 63,263 individuals received at least one Social Welfare
     Allowances program.34 The average age of recipients was 45.7 years old, and 58.2 percent of
     beneﬁciaries were female. The distribution of beneﬁciaries for Social Welfare Allowances and Social
     Welfare Beneﬁts and Concessions was similar to the distribution of the population in the SW Admin/
     PMT database. As for the Food Stamp Program, Khuvsgul, Arkhangai, and Uvurkhangai had relatively
     higher coverage, while Ulaanbaatar had lower coverage (Table 13).

     School attainment
   Beneﬁciaries of Social Welfare Allowances and household heads beneﬁting from the Food Stamp
Program were less well-educated than the general population in the database (Table 14). Around 80
percent completed secondary schooling or attained less than secondary schooling (compared to 66
percent for the general population in the database). The proportion of those with no education was
more than twice the level of the general population in the database.
                                                                                                            49

     Disability
   One-quarter of Social Welfare Allowances, Beneﬁts, and Concessions beneﬁciaries and household
heads beneﬁting from the Food Stamp Program reported having disabilities. The most common
disability was physical impairment (25.0 percent), followed by mental impairment (22.2 percent).
Around 17 percent of those with disabilities suffered from multiple disabilities (Table 15).

        Work
         Labor participation among beneﬁciaries was low, with only 39.5 percent reporting to have worked
     in the past week. Among those who did not work in the past week, only 10.6 percent worked during
     the previous year. The proportion of long(er)-term unemployed adults among the beneﬁciaries with no
     work in the past year was high, close to double that of the general population in the database.

        PMT score quintiles
         Social Welfare Transfers are largely progressive, providing more beneﬁts to the poor compared
     to the better-off. Half of those receiving Social Welfare Allowances, Beneﬁts, and Concessions or the
     Food Stamp Program were categorized as being in the poorest quintile, according to their PMT scores
     (Table 16 and Figure 22).

   Social Welfare Services
  Articles 18 and 19 in the Social Welfare Law (January 19, 2012 version) specify the services provided
under Community-Based Welfare Services and Specialized Care Services.

   •Organized training for conﬁdence building, self-reliance, working skills talent development;
   •Counseling;

   •Temporary accommodation and care;
   •Day care service;
   •Home-based care and service;
   •Other social welfare services based on the needs of citizens and households;
   •Support to homeless citizens and their family members for socializing, civil registration, and
    temporary shelter; and
  Socialization of citizens and households requiring social welfare assistance, help in forming a

   • Disabled;
   • Children in diﬃcult conditions;
   • Victims of violence;
   • Citizens released from prison;
   • Alcohol- and drug-addicted persons;
                                                                                                              51

   These specialized care services are targeted to the following types of beneﬁciaries:
   •   A single elderly person who cannot live independently and has no child and/or has a child who
       is elderly/disabled and thus cannot take care of him/her;
   •   A single disabled citizen incapable of living independently who has no child and requires
       professional service and special conditions;
   •   A child in a diﬃcult situation, a child speciﬁed in paragraph 25.5 of the Family Law, and a disabled
       child 18 years old and below; and
   •   Triplets, quadruplets, and so on who are four years old or younger, with parental permission to
       be based in a specialized home at the expense of the State.

   Expenditures on Social Welfare Services
   In absolute terms, the expenditures and budget for Social Welfare Services are the smallest
compared to all other programs. Nonetheless, total expenditures on Social Welfare Services doubled in
real terms between 2010 and 2012, heavily driven by rehabilitation services. Other than the expenditures

     on rehabilitation services, the expenditures for all other Social Welfare Services programs have been
     ﬂat in real terms since 2010 (Figure 23).

         Characteristics of Beneﬁciaries of Social Welfare Services
         Assuming that there were no technical issues with the administrative data for Social Welfare
     Services, according to the SW Admin/PMT data, there were only 6,455 users35 of Social Welfare
     Services nationwide (Table 17). This is approximately 0.3 percent of the population in the database.
     The very low utilization of Social Welfare Services is most likely due to the fact that these programs are
     still new and emerging. Among the recorded Social Welfare Services users, the average age was 53.7
     years old, with 63.7 percent being female and 36.3 percent being male.

   In general, the numbers of service users/beneﬁciaries are very small. In particular, “organizing
people with similar needs” and “training on nursing and caring service skills” have small numbers
of beneﬁciaries recorded in the administrative data. As for specialized care, nursing services for the
disabled and for disabled children under age 16 both have small numbers of beneﬁciaries recorded in
the administrative data (Table 18).

          Work
        Among working-age users of Social Welfare Services, labor participation was low. Around 29
     percent reported working the previous week, and among those who did not work during the previous
     week, 5.7 percent reported working during the previous year.

          PMT score quintiles
        Social Welfare Services are neither progressive nor regressive and seem to have even coverage
     across the wealth quintiles (Figure 24). Around 27 percent of the users were identiﬁed as being in
     the least well-off category, while around 11 percent were categorized as being among the well-off,
     according to their PMT scores (Table 21).

     donor senior citizen or senior citizen in unavoidable need of medical treatment and care in a domestic
     sanatorium and nursing center;
         Financial assistance equal to 75 percent of funeral expenses speciﬁed in the Social Welfare

     1,000 kilometers or more from the capital city and is hospitalized or has medical examinations in the
     capital city according to a decision by the physicians’ commission of the local medical center.
        Most of the allowances and assistance above are provided as reimbursements, except for the
     annual assistance for apartment fee which provides MNT 140,000 (approximately USD 76).

        Expenditures on Allowances and Assistance for the Elderly
        Although there has been some increase in the expenditures for Orthopedic Facilities for the Elderly,
     the expenditures for Allowances and Assistance for the Elderly have remained constant in real terms
     since 2010 (Figure 25).

    Among the beneﬁciaries of Allowances and Assistance for the Elderly, the average age was 67.5
years old, with 68.9 percent being women and 31.1 percent being men. The higher proportion of women
is most likely attributable to the fact that women are considered senior citizens at age 55 while men
are considered senior citizens at age 60 (according to the Law on Social Security for Senior Citizens),
in addition to the longer life expectancy of women.

   School attainment
    The elderly receiving Allowances and Assistance were less well-educated than the general population
in the database. More people had no education (almost 9 percent among beneﬁciaries compared to
4.8 percent among the general population) or only primary education (21.3 percent compared to 8.0
percent). However, there were more beneﬁciaries of this program who had completed technical or
vocational education (15.2 percent) compared to the general population in the database (8.9 percent)
(Table 23).

         Disability
        Around 6.8 percent of recipients of the Allowances and Assistance for the Elderly had disabilities.
     Physical disabilities (28.3 percent) were most common, most likely because these disabilities require
     prosthetic and orthopedic treatments (Table 24).

         PMT score quintiles
        Allowances and Assistance for the Elderly are slightly regressive and seem to beneﬁt the higher
     wealth quintiles more than the lower quintiles (Figure 26). Only 15 percent of the beneﬁciaries were
     from the poorest quintile (Table 25).

   Beneﬁts for the Elderly with State Merits
    Article 5 on assistance and allowances for senior citizens in the Law on Social Security of Senior
Citizen (2005) includes additional ﬁnancial beneﬁts from the government for senior citizens with state
merits (such as war veterans and those awarded Hero of Mongolia, Labor Hero, and other honors). The
beneﬁt types include:
      Monthly ﬁnancial assistance to a veteran of war or surviving spouse of a citizen who died
      fulﬁlling his duties in the war, and
      o Monthly ﬁnancial assistance to a winner of the Mongolian State Prize, State Honor, State
        Udarnik, and senior veteran of the revolutionary struggle, including:
      o Reimbursement of a two-way transportation fee for those residing over 1,000 kilometers
        from the capital and traveling for medical examination in the capital city once a year;
      o Reimbursement once a year of the voucher and two-way transportation for domestic
        sanatoriums and nursing homes; and
      o Financial assistance once a year for payment of an apartment fee or for fuel for senior
        citizens living in a gher or an apartment without centralized heating.
   The cash assistance for war veterans is MNT 200,000 (approximately USD 108) a month. Cash
assistance for the winner of the Mongolian State Prize, state nominee, and State Udarnik and

     senior veteran of the revolutionary struggle is MNT 150,000 (approximately USD 81) a month. The
     reimbursements for voucher and two-way transportation for sanatoriums and nursing homes are
     assigned a cash value of MNT 140,000 (approximately USD 76). The annual assistance for apartment
     and fuel costs is also MNT 140,000.

        Expenditures on Beneﬁts for the Elderly with State Merits
        Perhaps due to the decreasing number of those eligible for these beneﬁts (particularly war
     veterans), total expenditures for Beneﬁts for the Elderly with State Merits have been declining in real
     terms since 2010. According to the 2013 budget, these total expenditures were expected to decline
     further. However, the expenditures on reimbursements for transport and housing for the Elderly with
     State Merits have remained constant over the years (Figure 27).

        Characteristics of Beneﬁciaries of Beneﬁts for the Elderly with State Merits
        Perhaps not surprisingly, only 1,864 individuals were recorded in the administrative data as being
     recipients of the Beneﬁts for the Elderly with State Merits. This was less than 0.1 percent of the
     population. The highest concentration of beneﬁciaries was in Ulaanbaatar. On average, the beneﬁciaries
     received three services/beneﬁts, of which two services/beneﬁts were speciﬁc to the elderly with state
     merits. The average age of beneﬁciaries of the state merits program was high at 76 years. Around 82
     percent of the beneﬁciaries were male, compared to only 18 percent female.

     School attainment
   School attainment of those receiving Beneﬁts for the Elderly with State Merits was extremely high.
Over 60 percent of the beneﬁciaries had higher than vocational/technical training. Given the high
average age of the beneﬁciaries, the high levels of education may reﬂect the fact that the beneﬁciaries
belonged to a privileged sector of the population (Table 27).

        Disability
         Around 4 percent of beneﬁciaries reported having disabilities, similar to the general population
     in the database. Physical disabilities (32 percent) and blindness (26 percent) were among the most
     common disabilities, with one in ﬁve beneﬁciaries with disabilities suffering from multiple disabilities
     (Table 28).

        PMT score quintiles
        The PMT score reveals the regressive nature of Beneﬁts for the Elderly with State Merits and the
     good social standing of the beneﬁciaries. Around 74 percent of the beneﬁciaries fell within the highest
     40 percent of PMT scores (Table 29 and Figure 28).

   Assistance and Concessions for the Disabled
    According to the Law on Social Security and a Person with Disability (2005), a person with disability
is deﬁned as an individual with no capacity or limited capacity to participate in social relations like
other persons for more than 12 months due to body defect or mental, psychological, and perceptional
disorders.
                                                                                                                  63
   Article 5 of the Law describes the allowances and assistance to the disabled as:
   • Annual ﬁnancial assistance to pay apartment fees for fully blind, fully dumb-deaf persons, dwarf
       individuals, and persons with disabilities who have fully lost their labor capacity and are in need

       100 percent of purchased or made special care instruments like orthopedic tools, wheelchairs, and

   •   Annual assistance for two-way transport to/from school and kindergarten for a minor with disability
       and his/her guardian or caregiver, or provision of a bus for them;
   •   Reimbursement of one-way transportation fee and 50 percent of rest and treatment fee once a
       year in the domestic sanatorium and nursing centers for a minor with disability, his/her guardian or

            clinic;
         • Free postal delivery of documents written by a blind person such as Braille letters, postcards, and
            parcels up to 10 kilograms and equipment, devices, or facilities for blind persons in the country;
         • Reimbursement once a year for 75 percent of a two-way transportation fee if a blind person needs
            to travel from the aimag to the capital city and from the capital city to the aimag to receive medical

         • Priority services for persons with disability by trade, transportation, communication, health and
            public service organizations.
         Most of the allowances above are reimbursements of fees and are not assigned a monetary value,

     allowances; MNT 200,000 (approximately USD 108) annually for transportation costs for school for
     children with disability and their guardians; and MNT 20,000 (approximately USD 11) monthly for the
     communication allowance for the blind.

64      Expenditures on Allowances and Assistance for the Disabled
        Although expenditures on housing assistance and reimbursements for orthopedic facilities for the
     disabled appear to have dipped in 2012, total expenditures for these programs for the disabled have
     been constant in real terms over the years (Figure 29).

          School attainment
        Probably due to disabilities, the level of educational achievement for beneﬁciaries of the Allowances
     and Concessions for the Disabled was low. The percentage of those with no education was about
     four times higher (19.8 percent) than the general population in the SW Admin/PMT database (4.8
     percent). However, there were more beneﬁciaries of this program who completed technical/vocational
     education (10.4 percent) compared to the general population in the SW Admin/PMT database (8.9
     percent), although not for higher education (Table 31).

          Disability
        Interestingly, only 76 percent of beneﬁciaries of Allowances and Concessions for the Disabled
     reported having disabilities in the PMT Survey. Mental disability (22.7 percent), physical disability (20.5
     percent), and blindness (10.4 percent) were the most common disabilities reported (Table 32).

   PMT score quintiles
    Allowances and Concessions for the Disabled are progressive, with a large proportion of beneﬁciaries
in the poorest wealth quintiles (Table 33 and Figure 30). However, it is important to note that disability
was given considerable weight in the PMT formula, so the fact that there is a higher proportion of
disabled beneﬁciaries in poorer quintiles may be driven by the design of the formula.

   Allowances for Mothers and Children
    Two types of programs are in this category: allowances for the “Mother’s Glory” (also known as
Mother Heroes) and the Allowance for Pregnant and Lactating Mothers. The Mother Heroes program,
described in Article 13 of the Law on Social Welfare (2012), recognizes mothers who have given birth
to four or more children. The 1st rank medal of Mother Heroes is for mothers who have given birth to
more than six children, and the 2nd rank medal is for mothers who have given birth to four children.
The Allowance for Pregnant and Lactating Mothers, also in the Article of the same law, is provided
monthly for 12 months starting from the ﬁfth month of pregnancy.
   Under the Mother Heroes program, 1st medal recipients receive an annual beneﬁt of MNT 200,000
     REVIEW OF PROGRAM DESIGN AND BENEFICIARY PROFILES OF SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAMS IN MONGOLIA




     (approximately USD 108), while 2nd medal recipients receive an annual beneﬁt of MNT 100,000
     (approximately USD 54). The Allowance for Pregnant and Lactating Mothers is a monthly allowance
     of MNT 40,000 (approximately USD 22). Although the Allowance for Pregnant and Lactating Mothers
     is provided only when the mothers are pregnant or lactating, the Mother Heroes beneﬁts are provided
     for a lifetime once the mother becomes an honoree. This lifetime beneﬁt puts immense ﬁscal pressure
     on the government.
        These two programs—particularly the Mother Heroes beneﬁts—should be considered programs to
     promote population growth rather than to provide social welfare assistance for beneﬁciaries to meet
     minimum needs.

          Expenditures on Allowances for Mothers
        Total expenditures on Allowances for Mothers have increased slightly since 2010 in real terms.
     Although expenditures for Mother Heroes have declined, the Allowance for Pregnant and Lactating
     Mothers has increased (Figure 31). The numbers of beneﬁciaries in both programs have remained
     stable over the years.

          Characteristics of Beneﬁciaries of Allowances for Mothers
        A total of 235,059 women received either the Allowance for Pregnant and Lactating Mothers or
     Mother Heroes beneﬁts. The proportion of beneﬁciaries seems proportionally distributed across
     aimags relative to the population in the SW Admin/PMT database (Table 34). The average age of
     beneﬁciaries was 48.7 years old. Around 2 percent of beneﬁciaries were 15 years old or younger, and
     over half of Mother Heroes beneﬁt recipients were 50 years old or older.

     Disability
  Around 4.6 percent of beneﬁciaries of the Allowance for Pregnant and Lactating Mothers and

Admin/PMT database (4.5 percent). Among those with disabilities, around 23.6 percent suffer from

         Work
        Among working-age beneﬁciaries of the Allowance for Pregnant and Lactating Mothers and the
     Mother Heroes program, 46.1 percent reported to have worked during the previous week. Among
     those who did not, 8.13 percent worked during the previous year. These rates of labor participation
     were lower than that of working-age women overall in the SW Admin/PMT database.
        Broken down by program, 45 percent of the working-age mothers receiving the Allowance for
     Pregnant and Lactating Mothers reported to have worked during the previous week, and among those
70   who did not, 15.0 percent worked during the previous year. Among the working-age mothers who were
     receiving Mother Heroes beneﬁts, 46.7 percent worked during the previous week, while among those
     who did not, only 5 percent worked during the previous year. This suggests that although the short-
     term unemployed mothers receiving these programs were similar, working-age women receiving the
     Mother Heroes beneﬁts were more likely not to be working in the long term.

         PMT score quintiles
        The Allowance for Mothers and Children is slightly pro-poor. Around 28 percent of the beneﬁciaries
     were categorized as belonging to the lowest quintile according to PMT scores, with the proportions
     declining among the better-off. Among those categorized as belonging to the highest quintile, only 12
     percent were identiﬁed as beneﬁting from this program (Table 37 and Figure 32).

   The Food Stamp Program
   The legal basis of the Food Stamp Program is Article 22 on Food and Nutrition Support Services in    71
the Law on Social Welfare (2012). It states that Food and Nutrition Support Services will be provided
to households and citizens requiring social welfare assistance, selected from households living lower
than the current poverty line, and to homeless and wandering citizens.
  The program provides food stamps to purchase food, equivalent to MNT 10,000 (approximately
USD 5.40) per adult per month and MNT 5,000 (approximately USD 2.70) per child per month.

   Characteristics of Beneﬁciaries of the Food Stamp Program
   According to the SW Admin/PMT database, 15,119 households beneﬁted from the Food Stamp
Program, comprising 2.3 percent of households in the database. Coverage of the Food Stamp Program
was high in Khuvsgul, Arkhungai, and Dornod aimags (Table 38). In relative terms, the number of Food
Stamp Program beneﬁciaries was low in Ulaanbaatar, considering its share of the population. The
average age of Food Stamp Program beneﬁciary household heads was 44.9 years old (ranging from
15 to 98 years old), and 74 percent of them were male.

        The average estimated amount received by households from the program was MNT 529,141
     (approximately USD 286) per year. Considering that this program is targeted to the very poor (the
     bottom 5 percent of the wealth distribution), the amount is not very generous, particularly given the
     large family sizes (5.8 members on average) of these beneﬁciary households. This means that on
     average, the estimated beneﬁt size was MNT 91,231 (approximately USD 49) per person per year.

        School Attainment by Household Head
          Since education level of the household head is among the variables included in the PMT formula,
     it is not surprising that 94 percent of Food Stamp Program recipient household heads had completed
     secondary schooling or less. Compared to the fact that two-thirds of the general population had
     completed secondary schooling or less, household heads of the Food Stamp Program had considerably
     lower school attainment levels (Table 39).

        Disability
        Among the beneﬁciaries of the Food Stamp Program, the proportion of households with household
     heads with disabilities was 20.9 percent. This is considerably higher than the rate of disability of
     household heads in the general population in the database (7.2 percent). The most common disabilities
     reported were physical impairment (25.9 percent) followed by mental impairment (17.9 percent).

    Work
   Among the 15,119 households receiving the Food Stamp Program, 10.8 percent of the household
heads were not of working age (either younger than 18 years old or older than retirement age). One
male beneﬁciary household head reported being 15 years old and one female household head reported
being 16 years old, while the rest were above retirement age.36
  Among working-age household heads, around 36.7 percent reported to have worked the previous
week. Among those who did not work during the previous week, only 16.7 percent reported having
worked during the previous year. Labor participation of the working-age household heads receiving the
Food Stamp Program was considerably lower than that of the general population.

  Except for one beneﬁciary household with a PMT score in the third quintile, all other households
were in the poorest quintile of all households in the PMT database.

    Child Money Program
   The Child Money Program (CMP), funded from the Human Development Fund, provides MNT
20,000 (approximately USD 11) per month to all children from 0 to 18 years old.
   On average, beneﬁciary households had an average of two children between 0 to 18 years old. On
average, these beneﬁciary households received MNT 480,000 (approximately USD 260) annually. The
maximum number of children was 9 (in 29 households).

    Characteristics of Beneﬁciaries of the Child Money Program
   A total of 785,819 children (0 to 18 years of age) in the database were beneﬁciaries of the CMP, and
the program had good coverage throughout all the aimags, proportionally distributed relative to the
population in each aimag. The average age of CMP beneﬁciaries was 8 years old, with 50.9 percent of
beneﬁciaries being male.




36 . The average age of Food Stamp Program beneficiary household heads who were not in the working-age group was 68.5 years old for male
and 65.2 years old for female.

        Education
        Of the 785,081 CMP beneﬁciaries, 74 percent reported attending kindergarten, school, or university.
     Broken down by age group, about 65.2 percent of the children between 3-5 years old were attending
     kindergarten. The vast majority (95 percent) of the children between 6-11 years old were attending
     school. The vast majority (97 percent) of 12-15 year olds were attending school, with 95 percent of
     those attending school. Around 90 percent of the 16-18 year olds were attending school, with 68
     percent of them still attending school, 6 percent attending technical or vocational school, and 4.3
     percent attending university.

        Disability
        The prevalence of disability among CMP beneﬁciaries was low at only 1.2 percent. Similar to the
     general population in the PMT database, the most common disability was physical impairment (22
     percent) followed by mental impairment (20 percent).

    Work
   Among CMP beneﬁciaries who were 16 years old and above, 8 percent reported to have worked
during the previous week. Among those who did not work during the previous week, only 2.3 percent
reported to have worked the previous year.

    PMT score quintiles
   When CMP beneﬁciaries are broken down by PMT score quintile, it is clear that more children from
poorer households received the CMP. Of the CMP beneﬁciaries, 30.4 percent belonged to households
with the lowest PMT scores. The proportion of CMP beneﬁciaries was lower among households with
higher PMT scores, and only 14 percent of children beneﬁting from the program were from the highest
PMT score quintile (Table 43 and Figure 33). This is probably due to the fact that poorer households had
more children between 0-18 years old compared to households that were better-off economically.             75
