percent of GDP in FY2016 to a deficit of -0.4 percent of GDP in
FY2017. Migrant worker outflow stagnated to a five-year low.
Annual revenue growth has been robust. Public spending, par-
ticularly capital spending, picked up. It reached a record high of
almost 8 percent of GDP despite significant under-spending of
the planned budget. The era of positive fiscal balance ended with
the fiscal deficit reaching 3.3 percent of GDP. The poverty rate at
the $1.90 a day line was 15 percent in 2010 and is projected to be
10.8 percent by end 2017.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    In mid-2011, a financial sector crisis nearly unfolded in Nepal. Withdrawals of deposits from smaller financial institutions (FIs) and severe liquidity constraints across the banking
    sector exposed the vulnerabilities of the financial system and required urgent intervention by Nepal’s central bank and bank regulator, the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB). Some of the
    liquidity was over-invested in the stock market and in speculative real estate investments, creating asset bubbles in each case. Once both bubbles burst, the sector was on the verge
    of a financial crisis, from which it emerged with great difficulty. The World Bank, together with the IMF, was asked to support efforts to contain the unfolding crisis and to provide
    longer-term support for institutional and regulatory changes that would contribute over time to a more robust system. Owing to quick and effective intervention by the NRB and a
    favorable environment (notably, continuing large flows of remittances, which provided liquidity to the system), a full-blown financial crisis was averted. In this process, substantive
    dialogue between the authorities and the World Bank developed, leading to the articulation of a medium-term program to address the underlying vulnerabilities of the financial
    sector. As a result of this dialogue, and to support the Government of Nepal’s medium-term program, the World Bank Board approved a stand-alone, single-tranche Financial
    Sector Stability Credit of US$30 million in 2013, followed by a second credit of US$100 million in 2015 and the third Financial Sector Stability Credit of US$100 million in 2017.

    The objective of the DPC3 was to support the continuation and expansion of the Government of Nepal’s efforts to address financial sector vulnerabilities and increase its
    transparency. The actions supported and completed under the DPC3 are part of a broader, medium-term, government-led program aimed at reinforcing banking-sector stability
    and paving the way for the development of a robust and more inclusive financial sector. The DPC3 had four pillars- (i) enhancing financial sector development, (ii) restructuring and
    consolidating the financial system, (iii) strengthening the legal and regulatory framework, and (iv) enhancing the governance and transparency of the banking system.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
    ■■     The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of Nepal Bank Ltd. (one of the state-owned banks) is above the minimum requirement of 10% and divestiture strategy approved.
    ■■     All banks met the minimum CAR. Corrective measures as part of Special Inspection Program were undertaken by individual banks and prompt corrective action was applied
           to four banks. Insurance sector diagnostic continued.
    ■■     Consolidation of banking sector observed and number of financial institutions decreased to 135 in 2016 from 199 in 2012.
    ■■     Nepal Rastra Bank Act, Banks and Financial Institutions Act and Deposit and Credit Guarantee Fund (DCGF) Act approved by the Parliament.
    ■■     Signing of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between DCGF and NRB governing the cooperation and exchange of information completed.
    ■■     Settlement risk eliminated in the system with the operationalization of transfer of funds between NRB branches on real-time basis.
    ■■     With the approval and implementation of Asset (Money) Laundering and Prevention Regulations, Nepal remains off the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The relatively new and small, albeit fast expanding, higher education sector has not been able to adequately meet the human resource needs of the economy. This is attributed
    to weak relevance, low quality, internal inefficiency, inequity and inadequate financing. This project supports the Government of Nepal’s National Program for Higher Education
    Reform and Development.

    The project aims to support reforms in selected institutions for improving quality, relevance and efficiency of higher education; and to assist under-privileged students for
    equitable access. It is expected to support reforms at Tribhuvan University and other public universities including their 150 constituent and affiliated campuses using results-based
    financing (Disbursement Linked Indicators). The intervention will benefit over 500,000 students, including scholarships for 9,500 students from poor households with preferential
    treatment to female students, and support more than 500 students and faculty members for research, development and innovation.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
    Progress is being monitored through achievement of yearly targets for seven Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) corresponding to systemic reforms, five key performance
    indicators (KPIs) measuring outcomes, and eight intermediate indicators. The year-one and year-two progress towards achieving the DLIs and KPIs is modest owing to the impacts
    of the April and May 2015 earthquakes, trade disruptions, as well as on-going transition to the federal structure of the government. The progress below is based on the partial DLI
    achievement report for year-two:
    ■■     DLI 1: Year-one and year-two targets have been partially achieved. Five new Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) have been accredited against the year-one target of eight
           and year-two target of eighteen.
    ■■     DLI 2: 100 percent of year-one, year-two and 38 percent of year-three targets have been achieved. 107 HEIs have been selected and performance grants released against
           year-one, year-two and year-three targets of 45 for each year.
    ■■     DLI 3: 100 percent of year-one and 50 percent of year-two targets (first sub-DLI) have been achieved. Autonomy granted to three TU constituent campuses against the year-two
           targets of four (cumulative).
    ■■     DLI 4: First sub-DLI targets for year-one to year-five, and second sub-DLI targets for year-one and year-two have been achieved.
    ■■     DLI 5: 100 percent of year-one target has been achieved, and year two target is lagging behind. 22 new academic programs at Bachelor/Masters level introduced against the
           year-one target of 20.
    ■■     DLI 6: 96 percent of year one and more than 50 percent of year-two targets completed. 2,887 financially poor students from bottom two poorest quintiles were supported in
           year-one against the target of 3,000, and around 2,200 students from the same category are being supported in year-two against the target of 3,000.
    ■■     DLI 7: Progress of first sub-DLI for year-one and year-two has been over achieved. First batch of 270 research projects selected and funds released to 172 projects against the
           year-one target of 100, and second batch of 399 research projects selected and submission of final report in progress.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Building on the progress made under the country’s Education for All Program 2004–2009 and School Sector Reform Program 2010–2016, the Government of Nepal (GON) has
    prepared a seven-year School Sector Development Plan (SSDP, 2017–2023) in close consultation with stakeholders, including Development Partners. The SSDP is expected to
    contribute directly to the country’s aim to attain middle-income country status and to meet the Sustainable Development Goal targets for education by the year 2030. The Program
    will annually benefit over 7 million students and over 180,000 teachers in over 30,000 community schools across the country. The World Bank supports the SSDP using Program
    for Results instrument, first education sector PforR in Nepal.

    The Program Development Objective (PDO) is to improve the quality, equitable access, and efficiency of basic and secondary education in Nepal by supporting the Government’s
    School Sector Development Program.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
    The program is expected to be effective by September 20, 2017. GON has submitted year-one (FY2016/17) DLI achievement report. GON is in the process of hiring an independent

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Nepal has achieved significant improvements in health indicators but challenges remain. Between 1996 and 2013, the maternal mortality ratio and under-five child mortality
    decreased by about 75%. Although there have been improvements, Nepal remains a high burden country for chronic malnutrition (stunting rate of 37.5%). Similarly, health service
    utilization indicators have improved but gaps remain. Only 55.2% of births are in a health facility and this proportion is only 27.9% among the poorest quintile.

    Weaknesses in management of the government health system undermine access and quality of services. Health services suffer from stock-outs and expiry of medicines
    resulting from an inefficient supply chain management and distribution system. Low public procurement capacity contributes to drug supply problems. Weaknesses in financial
    management undermine effective resource allocation. Fiduciary integrity remains a major challenge. Over the last five years, there has been an increasing trend in the number
    of audit irregularities as well as ineffective follow-up of audit findings. There is a deficit of qualified health workers, particularly in remote areas, because of difficult living and
    working conditions and inefficiencies in human resource management. Citizen engagement mechanisms need to be implemented to contribute to improved accountability of
    policy makers and service providers.
    The Program Development Objective is to improve efficiency in public resource management systems of the health sector in Nepal. The Program for Results (PforR) operation will
    support the Program through a series of Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs), which form the basis for disbursement. There are 11 DLIs that focus on critical aspects of health
    sector management including priority areas in procurement and financial management and reporting and information management for better evidence-based planning.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
    The Program became effective in April 2017 and the first set of results were completed by the Government by July 2017. The results are currently in the process of being verified
    by the National Health Research Council.

    The expected first year results include: (1) strengthening procurement systems by the Ministry of Health endorsing guidelines for establishing a grievance redressal mechanism
    as well as standardizing and making public a set of technical specifications for the essential drugs list; (2) increasing financial management discipline of the Ministry of Health and
    its agencies through the use of electronic annual work plans, capturing expenditures in the financial management system, and establishing a system for monitoring responses to
    audit queries; and (3) improving information through the planned rollout of the District Health Information System.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The Social Security Allowance (SSA) under the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (MOFALD) is the largest of the social assistance program in Nepal. Currently, 2.26
    million individuals benefit from the SSA, of whom roughly 1.5 million are female. MOFALD has relied on manual and decentralized record keeping of beneficiary information
    and payments by local officials at each Village Development Committees (VDCs) and municipalities. This has been a major hurdle for addressing issues of duplication, under-
    coverage and weak oversight facing the administration of SSA program. With the assistance from the World Bank’ Social Safety Nets Project and the Additional Financing, MOFALD
    developed a Management Information System (MIS) to use as a database on specific information about the actual beneficiaries and program implementation (e.g., details on
    payment transactions) and piloted use of commercial banks as SSA payment service providers. With the establishment of Department of Civil Registration (DCOR), improved
    delivery of civil registration (CR) and SSA is seen as a priority to strengthen the impact of Nepal’s social programs in protecting the vulnerable from adverse risks and shocks. As the
    country transits to federalism, ensuring the improved service delivery is a priority.
    The objective of the project is to improve the coverage of social security allowances and civil registration, and the delivery of social security allowances. The project supports
    the DOCR’s Civil Registration and Social Security Strengthening Program and consists of four components. Over a five-year period, the project is expected to support (a) the
    establishment of a comprehensive National Population Register and expanded coverage of CR and SSA and (b) improved delivery of SSA via transition to e-payments in selected
    districts and improvements in related processes. These will be supplemented with institutional strengthening at both central and local levels.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
    The project became effective in July 2017. Its conditions include establishment of an Inter ministerial Steering Committee, Inter ministerial Technical Committee and Project
    Management Unit as well as the approval of the Project Operations Manual.
    Expected results include: (1) Establishment of a comprehensive National Population Register where each member has a unique ID; (2) Increase in the coverage of births registered,
    especially for the 0-1 age group; (3) Increased outreach for CR and SSA among the target population; (4) E-payments transition strategy for SSA and functioning e-payment system
    with deployment of e-payments in 25 districts; (5) Improvements in SSA benefit delivery, monitoring, and grievance redress mechanisms; and (6) Fully equipped and functional
    DOCR with proper organizational structure and capacity, including enhanced MIS platform.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Two-thirds of Nepal’s population is engaged in the agriculture sector, which contributes 36 percent towards the nation’s total GDP. At present the irrigated area stands at 1.39
    million hectares out of the potential 18 million hectares and of this only 42% has year-round irrigation. Thus there is scope for both increasing agricutltural productivity and
    production through the provision of year-round irrigation and expanding the area under irrigation. The Agriculture Development Strategy (2015 – 2035) has recognized irrigated
    agriculture as an engine of economic growth to alleviate poverty through judicious use of water, increased income through adoption of high value agriculture and a value chain
    approach to agriculture development.

    The Irrigation and Water Resources Management Project (IWRMP) aims to improve agriculture productivity and the management of selected irrigation schemes and to enhance
    institutional capacity for integrated water resources management. It aims to ensure efficient integration of water resources and crop production to derive full benefits from
    investments in irrigation. The project has four main components:
    ■■     Irrigation infrastructure development and improvement;
    ■■     Irrigation management transfer to water user associations in the Tarai (plains);
    ■■     Institutional and policy support for integrated water resources management; and
    ■■     Integrated crop and water management.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
    IWRMP is currently in the second Additional Financing phase. The original scope (2008 – 2016) ended in June 2016 with the rehabilitation of 134 farmer- managed irrigation
    schemes (FMIS); handing over of management functions of four Agency Managed Irrigaiton Schemes covering an area of 23,100 ha, installation of telemetry systems in 32 sub-
    stations in Babai, West Rapti and Karnali Basins and increase in productivity of key crops (rice, wheat, maize and potato) in a range of 44 to 73 percent. The original phase and the
    first additional financing registered 100 percent disbursement.

    Under the second Additional Financing, the project has already rehabilitated 59 FMIS out of planned 106 schemes. Of the remaining 47 schemes, 18 are above 80 percent
    complete and the remaining are between 50 to 80 percent complete. Three management transfer agreements have been signed to hand over 16,345 ha of the command area
    to the respective users in three Agency Management Irrigation System (AMIS), namely Ramgunj at Sunsari Morang Irrigation System, Block 2 of Narayani Irrigation Scheme and
    Phase II of Mahakali Irrigation System. Through the Water and Energy Commissions Secretariat (WECS), the project is supporting the development of four river basin management
    plans for West Rapti, Babai, Karnali and Gandaki River Basins. The basin plans will guide the development of master plans for the hydropower, irrigation and drinking water sectors
    in Nepal. With the availability of year-round irrigation and promotion of improved farming practices the productivity of rice, wheat, maize, and potato have respectively increased
    by 47, 44, 73 and 61 percent over the baseline with the corresponding increase in cropping intenstity from 149 to 213 percent. To make the best use of irrigation water, the focus
    is now placed on crop diversification to include high value crops, vegetables in particular which fetch higher income and enjoy a year-round market. With all the funds committed
    and work in progress, the Project is expected to meet end of the project target, both financially and physically.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF) commenced in 2007 and is now operating its regular program in 55 districts and has made agreements with 32,000 Community Organizations
    (COs). Out of the 31 districts impacted by the 2015 April and May earthquakes, PAF covers 14 districts, out of which seven were severely impacted. PAF is providing support to these
    districts through infrastructure rehabilitation, income generation and skills development. The Project aims to improve living conditions, livelihoods, and empowerment among
    the rural poor, with particular attention to groups that have traditionally been excluded by reasons of gender, ethnicity, caste, and location. The Project has four main components:
    ■■     Small-scale community infrastructure to provide capacity-building support and sub-grants to community organizations for local infrastructure projects;
    ■■     Sustainable income generation to provide capacity-building support and sub-grants to community organizations for income-generation activities;
    ■■     Product development, market linkages, and pilots to support those community organizations that are more advanced; and
    ■■     Capacity-building and institutional strengthening to support the formation and development of community organizations and the creation of cooperatives and market
           alliances.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:	
    The Project has so far directly benefitted 825,000 households and has indirectly benefitted an additional 48,000 households (through PAF financed infrastructure sub-projects),
    out of which 64 percent fall under the category of ultra-poor (food sufficiency less than three months). Other results include:
    ■■     CO member households constitute 25 percent Dalit, 27 percent Janajati, 3 percent Muslim, 29 percent Brahmin/Chhetri and 16 percent other ethnicity.
    ■■     About 74 percent of CO members are female. According to the independent evaluation, PAF intervention resulted in a 22 percent increase in real per capita consumption
           net impact in the short-run (within the first three years).
    ■■     Around 250 community infrastructures will be rehabilitated through the earthquake support.
    ■■     Around 14,000 CO members receive additional block grants to recover their livelihoods through the earthquake support.
    ■■     The net per capita consumption growth is maintained at 7 percent even over a medium-term (seven years).

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Nepal’s mountainous landscape and infrastructure gaps have weakened linkages in the food value chain, exacerbating the challenges in agricultural growth and food security. The
    country’s entry into the World Trade Organization presents new opportunities for market integration, provided the competitiveness of the agriculture sector can be significantly
    enhanced. Nepal is strengthening emerging commodity value chains, and providing local and international access to markets by creating backward and forward linkages in
    selected value chains
    The project aims to improve the competitiveness of project-supported smallholder farmers and agribusiness within selected commodity value chains. This is to be achieved by:
    ■■     Agriculture and rural business development through provision of matching grants to commodity value-chain actors mainly for technology support and agribusiness devel-
           opment;
    ■■     Support for sanitary and phyto-sanitary facilities to regulate and maintain food quality;
    ■■     Project management.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
    PACT has so far supported over 387 cooperatives, 391 farmer groups, 472 private firms and 9 producer associations, reaching out to over 95,000 direct beneficiaries, of which 45.7
    percent are women, across Nepal. Project support for these stakeholders is based on a value chain approach and the project activities have helped strengthen the linkages among
    those taking part in a given commodity value chain, Project value chain activities are further supported through the establishment of the National Agribusiness Innovation Center
    for the promotion of agribusiness SME growth, the construction and rehabilitation of central and regional markets, the construction of a fumigation chamber and quarantine
    facilities, the laboratory equipment, and training support to the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control, Department of Livestock Services and Department of
    Agriculture (DoA). Additionally, more than 1,250 sub projects are being implemented across the country by PACT stakeholders under the project’s matching grant scheme; this
    program includes support to farmers and SMEs and contributes to smallholders’ enhanced access to markets, improving MOAD’s IPM agenda, the competiveness of export-
    promoting as well as import-substituting value chains.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The Kabeli A Hydroelectric Project (KAHEP), 37.6 MW, jointly financed by IDA and IFC including IFC–Canada Climate Change Program (CCCP) with a local sponsor group, would
    demonstrate development of hydropower through public private partnership (PPP). The KAHEP is consistent with the joint IDA/IFC Country Partnership Strategy for Nepal (FY14-
    16), which stresses the importance of increased supply of electricity and improved access to reliable and affordable electricity to increasing economic growth and competitiveness.
    It is also consistent with the government’s strategy to deal with the current energy crisis and to attract private investments in hydropower in Nepal. If successful, the project will
    demonstrate the viability of future hydro power projects through proper PPP arrangements and attract investors and financiers to the country and the sector.

    The project development objective is to add hydropower generation capacity to supply the NEA grid through public private investments. KAHEP has three components:
    ■■     The KAHEP component ($102.6) with IDA, IFC and CCCP funding in credit terms to construct the hydropower project including a diversion dam, intake, settling basins, a
           headrace tunnel, a semi-underground powerhouse and a tailrace canal;
    ■■     The Ministry of Energy (MOE) component ($2 million), with IDA funding in grant terms to support implementation and compliance;
    ■■     The Investment Board Nepal (IBN) component ($4 million), with IDA funding in grant terms.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
    Signing of financing agreements involving Hydroelectricity Investment and Development Company (HIDCL), Kabeli Energy Limited (KEL), NIC Asia, and International Finance

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Nepal has rich hydropower resources that could potentially make revenue through export of hydropower to other countries in the region. However, at present it is facing an
    energy crisis due to generation shortages and transmission bottlenecks. While the government is seeking both public and private investments in hydropower generation and
    transmission facilities in Nepal, this Project complements the government strategy for addressing the electricity shortages through import of electricity from India. It will also
    enable the export of surplus hydropower energy to India in the long term.

    The development objectives are to establish cross-border transmission capacity between India and Nepal of about 1,000 MW to facilitate electricity trade between the two
    countries; and increase the supply of electricity in Nepal by the sustainable import of at least 100 MW.

    The Project has three components: (i) Component A1 and A2: the design, construction and operation of an approximately 130 km of 400 kV double circuit north-south cross border
    transmission line between Muzaffarpur in India and Dhalkebar in Nepal (DM); (ii) Component B1, B2 and B3: the design, construction and operation of approximately 285 km
    of 400 kV double circuit east-west transmission line for the Hetauda-Dhalkebar- Inaruwa (HDI) segment with concomitant substations in Nepal, Synchronization of operation of
    the Nepal and Indian grids together and Transmission Lines and Integrated Financial Management Information System of Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA); and (iii) Component
    C: technical advisory for preparation of a transmission system master plan for future transmission system development in Nepal, for strengthening the institutional capacity of
    the NEA’s transmission business, including to increase cross-border transmission links, and for the Ministry of Energy and the NEA to develop understanding of the concepts of
    benefit-sharing in export-oriented hydroelectric projects.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
    Construction of the cross-border 400 kV DM transmission line financed by the government and others as stated above is completed and operating at 132 kV as an alternate
    arrangement. The transmission line is being used to import 160 MW from India at present. The construction of a substation for the 400-kV line is underway and is expected to be
    completed by December 2017. Completion of the substation would enable the import of 500 MW of electricity. This could be a big achievement because it will help reduce the
    load shedding in Nepal.
    Progress to date includes: Hetauda Dhalkebar Inaruwa (HDI) transmission line- 65% foundation and 53% erection of towers completed; Hetauda Bharatpur (HB) line- 65%
    foundation and 41% erection completed and; Bharatpur-Bardaghat line-29% foundation and 29% tower erection has been completed.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The Grid Solar and Energy Efficiency project supports the government strategy to expand energy generation capacity and reduce system loss. The system loss of the Nepal Electricity
    Authority (NEA) was estimated at 26.3 percent in 2014, incorporating both technical and commercial (non-technical) losses. Many activities have been carried out to reduce the
    system losses. However, the distribution system needs to be rehabilitated to further reduce the technical losses. The non-technical losses, such as leakages, are also deemed high.
    NEA is trying to engage an ambitious program of expanding access to and improving the quality of electricity service. A key aspect of this program is to curtail power system losses
    to acceptable levels.

    The project development objectives are to increase solar photovoltaic generated electricity to supply to the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) grid; and reduce NEA’s distribution
    losses in selected distribution centers. The Project has two components: (1) Grid-connected Solar PV Farms Development); and (2)Distribution System Planning and Loss Reduction.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
    The Project had completed major procurement under this project. As of August 2017, contracts worth $ 64.9 million are awarded. This includes awarding the Engineering,
    Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract for design, supply, installation and initial operation of a 25 MW grid connected solar farm, hiring of Owner’s engineer and few
    distribution system expansion and reinforcement. The contractors are expected to be mobilized soon.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Nepal SREP-Supported Extended Biogas Project (NSEBP) is supported by the Scaling-up Renewable Energy Program in Low Income Countries (SREP) of the Strategic Climate Fund
    (SCF). The National Rural and Renewable Energy Program Document (June 2012) notes that about 85 percent of the total final energy consumption in Nepal is met by biomass in
    terms of firewood (75 percent), agricultural residues (4 percent) and animal waste (6 percent). The rest is met by commercial sources, i.e. petroleum products, coal and electricity
    (around 2 percent). The low level of commercial energy consumption in the country reflects the very low level of industrial activities. Nepal has very good potential for expanded
    biogas production. Biogas can be used on-site for cooking, for industrial thermal heating processes (e.g. steam production), and also to produce electricity in retro-fitted generators
    that can use both diesel and biogas. Frequently identified potential opportunities for commercial biogas production on a larger scale include cow farms, poultry farms, pig farms,
    slaughter houses, beverage industry, fruit processing, sugar mills, distilleries, hotel and restaurant kitchen scraps and food waste, and food processing establishments such as
    noodle factories, among others. At present, firewood or coal is mostly used to produce steam during agro-processing, where steam is mechanically injected through pipes to boil
    and pasteurize food or heat other items, as required. By contrast, on-site availability of biogas (if generated from organic waste byproducts of the same production process) could
    be used instead, to meet thermal energy requirements for steam generation.

    Based on government’s request received on March 14, 2016, the Project was restructured to expand the expenses eligibility criteria for Project funds. The project development
    objective is to promote large off-grid biogas energy generation in Nepal. After restructuring, the project has following three components: (1) technical assistance ($ 500,000) (2)
    financing of investments ($ 6.9 million) and (3) project management support ($ 500,000). By installing 350 large-scale biogas plants (consist of 340 commercial and 10 municipal
    biogas plants), the Project is targeting to generate 1,445,000 m3 off-grid biogas for thermal application and 5.73GWh electricity.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
    ■■     As of July 2017, 334 bio gas sub-project applications, including for 18 municipal solid waste sub-projects, have been submitted to the Alternative Energy Promotion Centre
           (AEPC).
    ■■     Feasibility study for 166 sub-projects, including for eight municipal solid waste sub-projects have been approved.
    ■■     Detailed feasibility study has been completed for 112 sub projects including for two projects with more than 100m3 capacity.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    On April 25, 2015, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck central Nepal and, together with the aftershocks, resulted in 8,700 deaths and around 25,000 injuries. A Post-Disaster Needs
    Assessment (PDNA), completed on June 15, 2015 estimated damages to be around $7 billion with reconstruction needs of about $6.7 billion. Of the 490,000 houses destroyed,
    most were traditional brick or stone structures built with mud mortar, inhabited by the rural poor. A further 265,000 houses were severely damaged. The largest single need
    identified in the PDNA was housing and human settlements, estimated to be around $3.27 billion or almost half of the total needs.

    The objective of the project is to restore affected houses with multi-hazard resistant core housing units in targeted areas and to enhance the government’s ability to improve long-
    term disaster resilience. The Project, financed from the IDA Crisis Response Window (CRW), finances the reconstruction of about 55,000 houses destroyed in the three worst-affected
    districts namely Dolakha, Dhading and Nuwakot under the GoN’s Rural Housing Reconstruction Program. An accompanying Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) was established to
    facilitate development partners interested in contributing to housing reconstruction program. So far, the MDTF has commitments from USAID, UKAid, Switzerland, and Canada
    totaling $ 34.5 million, out of which $ 29.17 million has been received that has a $10 million Recipient Executed Trust Fund component towards housing reconstruction. JICA is
    providing parallel financing of around $100 million for housing reconstruction. Government of Nepal has established the National Reconstruction Authority (NRA) as the apex
    institution to develop reconstruction policies and oversee its implementation. The governance structure of the Authority is headed by the Prime Minister, whereas a Chief Executive
    Officer leads the management. Implementation modality is owner-driven reconstruction. As of August, 2017, the Government has idenfied a total of 651,606 beneficiaries,
    whose houses were severely damaged or destroyed during the earthquakes and who are eligible to receive a housing reconstruction subsidy. The initial subsidy announced
    was approximately $2,000 each to be disbursed in three installments of approximately $500, $800 and $700, contingent upon completion of their houses, in compliance with
    approved construction standards. However, the GoN increased the subsidy amount to $3,000 in FY17.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
    ■■     The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) completed a census of the rural areas affected by the earthquake that covered over 700,000 households and led to collection of damage
           and socio-economic data to determine eligibility for subsidy. The survey was funded by WB managed Trust Fund.
    ■■     The NRA has issued guidelines for distribution of housing subsidies, hazard-resistant construction designs, quality inspection mobilization of international NGOs, grievance
           redressal, environmental impact, land acquisition, procurement, etc. and has put in place a regime for home quality inspections.
    ■■     As of August 2017, out of 197,235 eligible beneficiaries in three project districts, 177,195 have enrolled and 175,173 have received the first installment into their individual
           bank accounts, and 21,889 have completed construction of their homes.
    ■■     To meet the funding gap for the housing reconstruction program, GoN has requested $300 million additional financing from IDA for the Project. This AF is under preparation
           and is expected to be approved in FY18.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Nepal is highly exposed to a range of hydro-meteorological hazards such as floods and droughts, the frequency and intensity of which are expected to increase with climate
    change. The poorer sections of the population particularly, women and rural populations – are typically the worst-affected and have the least capacity to deal with such risks. A
    well-functioning hydromet network, forecasting and early warning system is crucial for strengthening resilience to such risks. The existing observation network is mainly manual
    and the capacity to forecast weather, extreme events and long term climate changes is limited. There is also limited capacity to provide weather-based services to users such as
    farmers and flood/hazard vulnerable communities. The Building Resilience to Climate-Related Hazards Project is one of the four projects financed through the Nepal Pilot Program
    for Climate Resilience (PPCR) under the Strategic Climate Fund. Implementation of this project is supported by the World Bank. Other development partners participating in the
    Nepal PPCR program include the Asian Development Bank and the International Finance Corporation.

    The project’s main objective is to enhance the government’s capacity to mitigate climate-related hazards by improving the accuracy and timeliness of weather and flood forecasts
    and warnings for climate-vulnerable communities, and to support the development of agricultural management information system services to help farmers mitigate climate-
    related production risks. The project has four components: (1) Institutional capacity strengthening of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM); (2) Modernization
    of hydro-meteorological observation networks and forecasting; (3) Enhancement of DHM’s service delivery system; and (4) Creation of an agriculture management information
    system anchored at the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MOAD).

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
    ■■     Installation of hydromet observation systems and improvements in forecasting has commenced.
    ■■     DHM’s new building is under construction and is expected to be completed by the end of next year. Additionally, DHM is undertaking several initiatives to strengthen its
           institutional capacity including drafting of a hydromet law, developing a new organizational structure and strengthening its technical staff capacity to support the modern-
           ization process.
    ■■     MOAD, in collaboration with the National Agricultural Research Council (NARC), has started issuing agro-advisory bulletins to 18 districts. An Agricultural Management Infor-
           mation System (AMIS) is also in the process of being developed and will be operational by next year.
    ■■     A mobile application (Hamro Krishi) is already being used by farmers and a SMS alert system has been established in coordination with Nepal Telecom which is being used
           by over 14,000 farmers in 19 districts
    ■■     An important achievement is the strong collaboration between DHM, MOAD and NARC through a technical working group. The agencies are actively collaborating in the
           development and delivery of agro-weather advisories through exchange of agricultural information, weather data and forecasts.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    SNRTP covers 36 of Nepal’s districts. The overall project size is approximately US$ 174 million including a contribution of US$ 100 million from IDA. The primary technical
    counterpart is the Department of Local Infrastructure Development and Agricultural Roads (DoLIDAR) within the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (MoFALD) The
    project became effective in 2014. There are approximately 15.3 million people living in districts covered by SNRTP. Approximately 3.8 million of these people are considered poor.
    SNRTP districts are home to an estimated 62% of all poor people living in Nepal.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
    ■■     1,400 km of rural roads to be upgraded or rehabilitated to provide all weather access. 138 kms completed to date.
    ■■     1,500 km of rural roads to undergo periodic maintenance. 232 km completed to date

    IMPLEMENTING AGENCY:
    Development and Agricultural Roads (DoLIDAR) within the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (MoFALD)

    KEY PARTNERS:
    International Labor Organization - SNTP has mobilized a routine maintenance system for road and bridge works in project districts. This is coordinated by the International Labor
    Organization (ILO) which directly employs approximately 80 engineers to supervise multiple routine maintenance groups of 5-7 workers. ILO has helped all workers open bank
    accounts which they use to receive payments directly from the project (i.e. no physical transfer of cash). ILO engineers supervise the execution of routine maintenance works on
    a day-to-day basis. As of August 2017 SNRTP’s routine maintenance program covered 5,119 kms of rural roads and 8,059 meters of bridges along those roads. SNRTP employs
    2,474 routine maintenance workers. Approximately 70% of those workers are women.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Nepal has the second lowest road network density in the Region. Only two-fifths of the population has access to paved roads within a 20-minute walking distance. The substantial
    lack of accessibility to economic centers and social services in the remote areas is seen as one of the main impediments to poverty reduction and economic development. By 2016,
    the Government of Nepal aimed for 86 percent of the population to live within two hours (in the plain districts) or four hours (in hilly districts) walking distance to a paved road.
    Connection of all district headquarters with all-weather roads has been one of the key elements of the Road Sector Priority Investment Plan of 2007. The Road Sector Development
    Project has been designed against this backdrop to support the Strategic Roads Network.

    The original project outlay was approximately $43 million. The Project received an additional financing of $75m in end-2010. However, in June 2015 an amount of SDR4.5m
    ($6.75m) was cancelled as requested by the Government. In the aftermath of the devastating 2015 earthquake, the project closing date was extended by a year to end-June 2016.
    Further, to complete the project’s incomplete activities, which were hampered by the unofficial trade blockades, the closing date was extended for another one year: June 30,
    2017. The Project’s Second Additional Financing of 55 million has been approved by the Board on August 25, 2016. The Second Additional Financing will be implemented until
    mid-July, 2019.

    The Project seeks to provide all season road access to the residents of beneficiary districts, reducing travel time and improving access to economic centers and social services.
    The Project aims to connect eight remote district headquarters in the mid-western and far-western regions of Nepal. The project components are road development (utilizing 83
    percent of the funding) and institutional strengthening and policy reform.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
    ■■     All eight-district headquarters of Mid and Far-Western regions are now connected.
    ■■     A 2012 survey showed that the number of paved roads in poor condition had been reduced to 11.3 percent, well below the target of 15 percent.
    ■■     About 50 percent decrease in journey times to key economic centers in the project area and 52 percent decrease in journey times to key social services in the project area.
    ■■     An analysis using the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) shows that the target of increasing the population’s access to all-weather roads (6 percent) has been achieved.
    ■■     The Project has overachieved the periodic maintenance target (target – 2,550 km; achievement – 2,595km).
    ■■     All upgrading contracts under the project are now complete -- 690 km of roads have been upgraded against a target of 700 km and 30 km of road sections are left incomplete
           due to the slope instability. This operation is being undertaken under the second additional financing of the project.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Transport costs in Nepal are high and the country depends almost entirely on India for transit routes. Sharing an approximately 1,800-km-long border and 26 border points,
    India is often considered Nepal’s “natural” trading partner. The port complex of Kolkata-Haldia in India has been serving as Nepal’s access to the sea and is a major transit point
    for Nepal’s third-country trade. India also provides a large market for Nepali goods and services, and is Nepal’s largest trading partner, with about 60 percent of Nepal’s trade
    going to or coming from India. Despite its proximity and deep economic relations with India as well as China, Nepal’s trade outcomes have been poor. Since 2007, exports have
    been stagnant while imports have increased by more than 50 percent. That suggests an urgent need for an action plan to improve export competitiveness particularly by focusing
    on reducing inefficiencies and bottlenecks that increase the cost of exports on regional and international markets. The main development objective of the Regional Project is to
    decrease transport time and logistics costs for bilateral trade between Nepal and India and transit trade along the Kathmandu-Kolkata corridor for the benefit of traders by reducing
    key infrastructure bottlenecks in Nepal and by supporting the adoption of modern approaches to border management. The strategy includes:
    ■■     Reducing the time and cost of trade-related transactions through efforts at simplification, harmonization, and automation;
    ■■     Building the capacity of domestic trade-related institutions, including for sanitary and phyto-sanitary inspections, trade negotiations, logistics, and monitoring and regulating
           trade-related sectors;
    ■■     Enhancing the government’s ability to coordinate trade-related institutions and development partners.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
    ■■     Pavement works at Bhairhawa Inland Clearance Depot have been completed.
    ■■     Three contracts for Narayanghat Mugling road improvement works with about 50% works progress.
    ■■     The contract for Birgunj shed works with about 50% work progress.
    ■■     The detail design for Kathmandu-Naubise-Mugling road improvement works is in progress.
    ■■     The detail design of Inland Clearance/Container Depot (ICD)/ Container Freight Station (CFS) at Kathmandu (Chovar) is in final stage.
    ■■     National Trade Portal development under Trade and Export Promotion Center (TEPC) has been launched, and under further improvement process.
    ■■     Development of National Single Window is in Second stage bidding process.
    ■■     Study on the Axle Load Control and Road Transport Safety has been completed.
    ■■     The detail design for the Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary (SPS) lab building is in final stage.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The Rani Jamara Kulariya Scheme is one of the most prominent farmer-managed irrigation schemes in Nepal, with a cultivable command area of 14,300 hectares (the project area),
    of which about 11,000 hectares are currently being irrigated. The project focuses on modernization of the higher-order irrigation infrastructure (especially intakes and feeder and
    branch canals), as well as the preparation and initiation of an agricultural development program. The project has four components:
    ■■     Scheme modernization;
    ■■     Strengthening Water Users Associations;
    ■■     Agricultural production support;
    ■■     Project management.
    The project development objective of phase 1 is to improve irrigation water delivery and management in the project area. This is being achieved by improving performance of the
    irrigation systems and strengthening community-based irrigation management. These activities seek to build resilience through more efficient water delivery and management
    against water-induced hazards such as droughts, floods, and changes in water availability during the agricultural seasons. The project also supports the agricultural development
    that will result in a modest increase in yields, especially in the upper part of the command area.
    Currently a proposed second phase is being prepared, focusing on the modernization of the lower-order irrigation infrastructure (sub-branch and tertiary canals and water courses)
    and implementation of a comprehensive agricultural improvement program.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
    ■■     Projected disbursmenet by the closing date is around $39 million.
    ■■     Irrigation infrastructure is completed and is starting to have an impact on agricultural production.
    ■■     Road improvement to ease access to the scheme and river training to reduce the chance of flooding in the project area are substantially completed.
    ■■     Training of Water Users Associations (WUAs) continues and four WUA offices are completed.
    ■■     Agricultural demonstrations and farmers field schools are completed.
    ■■     Based on crop cutting samples, average yields (ton/ha) of main crops are showing increases (baseline in brackets): paddy (winter) 3.0 (2.8); paddy (monsoon) 3.1 (2.6); wheat
           2.2 (1.7); and maize 2.1 (1.6).

    IMPLEMENTING AGENCY:
