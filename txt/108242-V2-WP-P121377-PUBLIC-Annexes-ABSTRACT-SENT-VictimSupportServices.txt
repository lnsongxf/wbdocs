ANNEX 1: BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE SERBIAN JUDICIARY

This Annex provides some background on recent judicial reforms in Serbia, the current structure and
governance arrangements, as well as some background on the relevant stakeholders in the judicial
system.

       i. Recent History of Judicial Reforms


1. A series of reforms adopted over the last decade reflect different views of how the judicial system,
and particularly the courts, should be managed.
2. In 2000, democratic changes were followed by judicial reform initiatives, set as one of the priorities
of the Government at that time. In 2001 package of laws1, which according to the ABA Judicial Reform
Index, “gave the judiciary unprecedented authority to regulate its own affairs,” including the
establishment of the first High Judicial Council. However many of its functions were limited in 2002 and
2003. In April 2003, the HJC role in the appointment of prosecutors, for example, was curtailed
completely.2 In April 2004 another set of laws was adopted, in which the judiciary regained some of its
institutional independence and a greater role in the appointment of judges and court presidents. Those
laws also created the Commission on Judicial Reform. The purpose of the Commission was to contribute
to legislative reform, to initiate judicial education programs, and to cooperate with international efforts
aimed at improving the independence of the Serbian judiciary in accordance with European legal
standards.3 The Commission’s work resulted in the development of the National Judicial Reform
Strategy for 2006-2011, announced by the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) in July 2005.
3. In May 2006, the National Assembly adopted the first National Judicial Reform Strategy 2006-2011,
which was described by many as an affirmation of faith in Serbia’s future. The strategy’s framework
focused on improving the independence, transparency, accountability, and efficiency of the judiciary
through a series of short-, medium-, and long-term reforms. The 2006 Constitution incorporated many
of the strategy’s recommendations, including changes to the role and powers of the High Judicial
Council (HJC), and the creation of the State Prosecutorial Council (SPC). However, few civil society,
professional and business groups showed active interest in the strategy or its implementation.

4. In 2009, a reappointment procedure was announced for all judges (by the HJC) and prosecutors (by
the SPC). Under the procedure, the overall number of judges and prosecutors was reduced by 30%, and

more than 800 of 3,000 siting judges were not reappointed.4 Around 170 prosecutors and deputy public
prosecutors were not reappointed. Many judges and prosecutors who were not reappointed appealed
to the Constitutional Court (1,500 such appeals were lodged). The legislative amendments were adopted
in December 2010 that transferred the cases back from the Constitutional Court to the Councils for
further proceedings. A second round of decisions by Councils followed, and 109 judges and 29
prosecutors were reappointed. Unappointed judges and prosecutors filed another appeal with the
Constitutional Court, which ruled that review of the reappointment decisions had not corrected the
shortcomings of the reappointment process. The Constitutional Court ruled that the HJC and SPC had
not applied objective criteria for reappointment; that judges and prosecutors had not been adequately
heard during the procedure; and that Councils had not provided adequate explanations for
reappointment decisions. The Constitutional Court ordered the reinstatement of all judges and
prosecutors who had appealed for their non-reappointment. This 2012 Constitutional Court decision led
to the reintegration of some 800 judges and 120 public prosecutors and deputies, representing one third
of the total number. The Councils met the 60-day deadline set by the Constitutional Court for the
reappointment of judges and prosecutors.

5. In May 2012 Serbia’s parliamentary elections brought a new set of parties to power, and changes
to government coalitions led to successive changes in MOJ leadership.5 In July 2013, the National
Assembly adopted the National Judicial Reform Strategy for 2013-20186 and the corresponding Action
Plan.7 This Strategy represents a continuation of the basic reform process contained in the 2006
Strategy. The 2013 Strategy is based on five key principles: independence, impartiality and quality of
justice, competence, accountability and efficiency. It also calls for changes in the Serbian Constitution to
address what European Union (EU) experts have described as a lack of judicial independence in some
features of the 2006 Constitution.8 The related Action Plan details concrete measures to meet the
Strategy’s objectives. A ‘Strategy Implementation Commission’, composed of representatives of major
stakeholders, is responsible for monitoring and measuring progress in the implementation of the
Strategy and Action Plan.


      ii. Serbia’s Court System


6. There are two categories of courts, established by Constitution and established by law. The only
courts established by Serbia’s 2006 Constitution are the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court of
Cassation. All the other courts are established by the Law on Organization of Courts; they are collectively

  The 3,000 figure includes misdemeanor judges: until 2010, misdemeanor judges were not part of the judicial
system, so the reappointment process considered whether these judges should become part of the judiciary. See,

  As well as organizational changes this changed the MOJ to the Ministry of Justice and Public Administration
(MOJPA).

referred to here as Serbia’s courts. Republic level courts are: Supreme Court of Cassation, Administrative
Court, Misdemeanor Appellate Court and Commercial Appellate Court.9

7. The Constitutional Court was established in 2008, following the adoption of the 2006 Constitution.
It has 15 judges with a renewable nine-year term of office; five of them are appointed by parliament,
five by the President of the Republic and five by the general session of the Supreme Court of Cassation.
The court rules on the constitutionality of legislation and on constitutional appeals for violation of
human rights by individual acts or actions of state authorities. The Court also decides on the compliance
of laws, other general acts and the ratified international treaties with Serbia’s Constitution and on
jurisdictional conflicts.

8. Serbia’s court system includes both courts of general jurisdiction and specialized courts. General
jurisdiction courts include the Supreme Court of Cassation, the courts of appeal, the higher courts, and
the basic courts. The specialized courts include the Administrative Court, the commercial courts, the
Commercial Appellate Court, the misdemeanor courts and the Misdemeanor Appellate Court (known
from 2010 to 2013 as the Higher Misdemeanor Court).10

      (a) General jurisdiction courts

9. The highest court in Serbia is the Supreme Court of Cassation (SCC) which was established by
Serbia’s Constitution of 200611 and its jurisdiction is set by legislation.12 The president of the court is
elected by the National Assembly from the judges of that court, following the recommendation of the
HJC, and after the Assembly has received the opinion of the General Session of the SCC and the
competent committee of the National Assembly.13

10.      The Supreme Court of Cassation has a two-fold role, as the highest court in the country and as
court of cassation. In its jurisdiction as the supreme court, it has jurisdiction over extraordinary legal
remedies requested against decisions of Serbia’s other courts; determines conflicts of jurisdiction
between courts, and the transfer of jurisdiction of courts “to facilitate proceedings or for other
important reasons”.14 In its role as a court of cassation, the SCC ensures uniform application of law and
equality of the parties in court proceedings; discusses the application of laws and regulations and the
work of courts; . It also appoints five of the 15 judges of Serbia’s Constitutional Court.15 The SCC has 35
judges is the immediately higher instance court to the Commercial Appellate Court, the
Misdemeanor Appellate Court, the Administrative Court, and the four courts of appeal. 16

11. Appellate courts were established and started operations on January 1, 2010 in line with the
reform and new court organization. The four courts of appeal sit in Belgrade, Kragujevac, Nis, and Novi
Sad. They were created by legislation rather than Serbia’s Constitution.17 These courts, which have a
total of 228 judges, hear appeals from decisions of the basic and higher courts. The courts of appeal
also have immediate jurisdiction over appeals on civil judgments. and criminal cases.18

12.Higher courts were introduced in Serbian judicial system in 2010 and took over part of jurisdiction
of prior district courts. 19 As of January 1, 2014, there were 25 higher courts with a total of 377 judges.20
For criminal offenses, higher courts have jurisdiction over cases with minimum possible imprisonment of

   As of January 1, 2010, there were 26 higher courts with a total of 276 judges - Decision of the HJC, December

10 years; all cases involving hate crimes, money laundering, and disclosures of state secrets; and
petitions for extradition. As a court of second instance, the higher court decides on imposing measures
to secure presence of defendants, and for criminal offences with the maximum possible
imprisonment of 5 years and fines. There are also special departments in all of the higher courts for
juvenile justice and the Higher Court in Belgrade has special departments for war crimes and organized
crime.21 For civil cases, the higher courts primary jurisdiction also includes civil cases in which review as
extraordinary legal remedy is permitted; 22 they also have first-instance jurisdiction over a wide variety
of labor and intellectual property disputes. As courts of secondary jurisdiction, they hear appeals of civil
cases from the basic courts, judgments in cases of small value, and contentious proceedings.23

13.      Basic courts were established with the new organization of courts in 2010 as first instance
courts for the majority of cases. The basic courts generally have the same jurisdiction as the 138
municipal courts which existed before 2010. Among the ordinary courts, the number and seats of
Serbia’s basic courts changed the most between 2009 and 2014: they were reduced to 34 basic courts in
2010, with many courts having several locations.24As of January 1, 2014, Serbia again increased number
of basic courts from 34 to 66 basic courts; some continue to have more than one location. The basic
courts currently have a total of 1,430 judge positions (1423 filled).25 The basic courts are first-instance
courts, with criminal jurisdiction over cases in which the possible imprisonment can be a fine or
imprisonment of less than 10 years. They also have primary jurisdiction over a wide range of civil cases,
including housing disputes; disputes on commencement, existence and termination of employment;
rights, obligations and responsibilities pursuant to employment; compensation for the damage suffered
by an employee during work or related to work; disputes relating to satisfying housing needs on the
basis of work .26 Both the higher courts and the courts of appeal hear appeals from decisions of the
basic courts.
14.Basic courts together with the misdemeanor courts that are discussed below receive the highest
bulk of cases (in 2012 basic and misdemeanor courts received 84% of total number of cases in Serbia).



      (b) Special Jurisdiction Courts

15.      The Misdemeanor Courts, which had been sui generis administrative bodies, became part of
the judiciary in 2010. With the changes in the court network that took effect January 1, 2014, there are
now 44 Misdemeanor Courts, several with more than one location, so the total number of
misdemeanor court locations is 143. Misdemeanor courts have a broad range of responsibilities. They
are the first instance courts for minor offences, unless those offences are under the competence of an

administrative authority and have jurisdiction over traffic violations and provisions adopted by local
governments.. Misdemeanor Courts have jurisdiction over offences with maximum possible
imprisonment of up to 60 days. However, misdemeanor offences also include those relating to taxation;
customs; foreign trade; foreign currency; the Law on Financing of Political Parties; the Law on Personal
Data Protection, and the Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance (Serbia’s freedom of
information law).27 The Misdemeanor Appellate Court (from 2010 till 2013 known as the Higher
Misdemeanor Court),28 which is located in Belgrade and has units in Kragujevac, Nis and Novi Sad, 29
decides on appeals against decisions of misdemeanor courts, appeals against decisions in
misdemeanor proceedings brought by administrative authorities, on conflicts of jurisdiction between
misdemeanor courts and transfer of territorial jurisdiction of misdemeanor courts. 30

16.Serbia’s Administrative Court is another court newly established in 2010 and adjudicates in
administrative disputes.31 The Administrative Court decides on an administrative procedures about
legality of final administrative acts and about legality of individual final acts deciding on rights,
obligations or statutory interests, in terms of which in a specific case a law does not stipulate any other
court protection. The Supreme Court of Cassation decides appeals from the the Administrative Court. It
has a total of 37 judges, and is also located in Belgrade, with units in Kragujevac, Nis and Novi Sad32.

17. Commercial courts and the Commercial Appellate Court have jurisdiction in disputes between
domestic and foreign companies, enterprises, co-operatives and entrepreneurs. There are 16
commercial courts with original jurisdiction over a wide range of commercial disputes and the status of
commercial entities, including privatization, 33 and varied range of intellectual property issues. 34

            (c) Judges

18.Judges are guaranteed independence in their work as judges both by Serbia’s Constitution35 and
the Law on Judges.36 According to systematization total number of judges is 2931 and 2831 positions
are filled. For their initial appointments, judges currently are nominated by the High Judicial Council and

to permanent office, after the judge has completed an initial three-year term38. However, Serbia is
planning to amend its Constitution,39 to eliminate the role of the National Assembly in the
appointment of judges and court presidents. As a transitional measure, the Law on Judges was
amended in December 2013 so the HJC proposes only one candidate for each judicial vacancy to the
Assembly, to promote judicial independence.40 Court presidents are nominated for their positions by the
HJC from among judges of courts of the same or higher instance41, and elected as presidents by the
National Assembly42, although as discussed above the Action plan of the National Judicial Strategy
envisage that the Assembly will have no role in their election at some point in the future. As a
transitional measure before amending Constitution the Parliament based on the Action plan of the
Judicial Reform Strategy adopted in December 2013 amendments to the Law on judges in the direction
that High Judicial Council proposes to the Parliament only one candidate for vacant court president
position. After amendments of the Law on judges in December 2013 court president serve five year
single terms (previously presidents served four year term and may be re-elected).43

19.The president of a directly superior court has the right to oversee the administration of a lower
court and to review work of the lower court’s president. The president of the superior court also may
assume the duties of a president of a lower court if that president has failed to act.44

        (d) Judicial Assistants

20.Judicial assistant is the common term for the judge's assoc iates, senior associates and judge’s
adviser.45 Their job consists of providing assistance to the judge, drafting court decisions, assessing of
legal issues, case law and legal literature, drafting legal opinions, as well as performing other affairs. The
Judge associates is a person who has passed the bar exam, and the senior associate after passing the bar
exam need to have a minimum of two years of work experience in the legal profession. The judge
adviser is a person who meets the requirements for a higher court judge. The Judge adviser performs
professional tasks relevant to the judicial department, or the entire court. The Position of judge adviser
exists in state level courts.

        (e) Lay judges

21.According to of the Constitution46 lay judges should participate in trials of many cases as panel
members, with the rights and duties of a judge. They do so as a type of internal control of professional
judges. The Criminal Procedure Code, Civil Procedure Code,47 and the Law on Juveniles48 determine in
which cases a lay judges will sit on panels.

22.Lay judges are appointed by the HJC, upon nomination by the MOJPA. They are appointed for five-
year terms and may be reappointed.49 Any citizen of Serbia between 18 and 70 at the time of
appointment, and “who is worthy of the function,” but is not an advocate (see page 18 for a discussion
of advocates and Bar Association), may be appointed as a lay judge.50 There are 3,026 lay judges in
Serbia. Lay judges receive reimbursement of their trial-related expenses and compensation determine
by the HJC.51

     (e) Prosecutors

23. The Public Prosecution is an independent state body established by Serbia’s Constitution, with
specific duties set by legislation.52 The Law on Public Prosecution states that all prosecutors are to be
independent in their work, and that legislative or executive branch influence is prohibited.53 The
organization of the other prosecutors in Serbia corresponds to the organization of the courts (basic,
higher, appellate level). There is a total of 393 in the Basic Public Prosecutor’s Offices (442 positions by
systematization), 162 deputy public prosecutors in the Higher Public Prosecutor’s Offices (179 positions
by systematization), 62 in the Appellate Prosecutor’s Offices (72 positions by systematization), and 11 in
Republic Prosecutor’s Office (15 position by systematization), as well as 16 deputy public prosecutors for
organized crimes (25 positions by systematization) and 8 for war crime. It is ongoing procedure for
election of four Appellate Public Prosecutor, 2 Deputies for the Prosecutor’s office for organized crime,
15 deputies for Higher Prosecutor’s office and 47 Deputies for Basic Prosecutor’s office in total of 64
Deputies and 4 Appellate Public Prosecutors.

positions by systematization), and 65 in the Appellate Prosecutor’s Offices (72 positions by
systematization), as well as 16 deputy public prosecutors for war crimes (25 positions by
systematization) and 8 for organized crime

25.As of October 1, 2013 when new Criminal Procedure Code took effect, prosecutors, rather than
investigative judges, became responsible for supervising the investigations of criminal cases56. One
objective of the new Code is to shorten the investigative phase of a case. The Public Prosecutor is
authorized57 to manage pre-investigation proceedings; to decide whether to undertake or defer criminal
prosecution; to conduct investigations; to conclude plea agreements, agree on alternative sentences
(the concept of “opportunity”) and agreements on giving testimony; to file and represent an indictment
before a competent court; to drop charges; to file appeals against court decisions which are not final,
and to submit extraordinary legal remedies against final court decisions.

26. On October 1, 2014 around 38,000 investigation cases (summary proceedings and regular cases in
which decision to conduct investigation is not issued) were transferred from courts to prosecution
offices. This will require that prosecutors work in new areas such as case management; cross-
examination; ; and protecting victims’ rights.

27. The Republic Public Prosecutor (RPP) is the highest prosecutor in the country and has a separate
office.58 The RPP is nominated by the Government from a list of candidates prepared by the SPC,
elected by the National Assembly for a six-year term, and may be reappointed59. All public prosecutors
are subordinate to the RPP, and all public prosecutor offices are subordinate to the Office of the RPP60.
The RPP accounts for the work of prosecutors, as well as the work of the RPP’s Office, to the National
Assembly.61

28. Public prosecutors are proposed by the SPC to the Government, nominated by the Government,
and then elected by the National Assembly62. The SPC nominates and the National Assembly elects




56
   Article 603 of the CPC specifies that all investigations started under the prior law should be finished by the courts.
For older cases in which no formal court investigation had begun, any investigation will be handled primarily by
prosecutors, although judges may still be involved in some preliminary proceedings.

deputy public prosecutors for their first three-year appointments63. The NJRS 2013 includes planned
amendments of the Constitution, which would exclude the Assembly from any role in appointment of
public prosecutors and deputy public prosecutors. As a transitional means of strengthening of
independence of prosecutors, in December 2013 the Assembly adopted amendments to the Law on
Public Prosecution, so the SPC now proposes only one candidate for each vacancy for deputy public
prosecutor to the Assembly.64 However, the amendment did not include a similar provision for the
election of public prosecutors, so for them the SPC proposes a list with one or more candidates to the
Government, and Government in turn proposes one or more candidates for each vacant position to the
Assembly.65 The SPC also determines whether deputy public prosecutor should be appointed to a
permanent position after his or her first three years.66

      iii. Governing Serbia’s courts

29. Responsibility for Serbia’s court system is now shared by the HJC and the MOJPA. Serbia’s
Constitution of 2006 established the present form of the HJC, although many of its responsibilities are
created by law rather than the Constitution.

30. The HJC has mixed composition that consists of judges, representatives of attorneys, academia
and ex officio members as representatives of executive and legislative branch. The 11 members of the
HJC include the President of the Supreme Court of Cassation (who also chairs the HJC), the Minister of
Justice of Public Administration, and the President of the National Assembly Committee for Judicial
Affairs. There are also eight other members, who include six judges elected by the National Assembly
for five-year terms, one attorney at law and one law professor.

31. The HJC is responsible for managing many aspects of Serbia’s judiciary. It has responsibility in the
selection, promotion, discipline and ethics of judges. It proposes new judges for election by the National
Assembly, and has sole authority for determining if those new judges should receive permanent
appointments after their initial three-year terms.67 In addition, the HJC determines general guidelines
on the internal court organization; maintains personal records of judges, lay judges and court staff;
determines the number of judges and lay judges for each court; defines the curricula for the initial
training of judges by the Judicial Academy, approves the curriculum for continuous training of judges
and court staff, and monitors the implementation of that training; evaluates the performance of all
judges, including court presidents; the HJC proposes the budget for “overhead expenses” of the
courts and disburses them; controls the spending of authorized funds; oversees the financial and

material operations of courts, and implements of many aspects of the National Strategy for
Reform of the Judiciary. 68

32.      The MOJPA, however, retains significant responsibility for running of the courts and there is
not always a clear delineation between the duties of the HJC and those of the MOJPA. The MOJPA is
responsible by law for “monitoring” of the work of courts and supervising the courts’
implementation of the courts’ rules of procedure; collecting statistics and other data; approving
the rules for the internal organization and job classifications of staff within courts; supervising the
courts to see that statutory time limits are met; acting on complaints and petitions, and proposing
part of the budget intended for investments, projects and other programs for the judiciary. The
MOJPA also is responsible for providing court premises and the equipment, supplies and security of
courts, and oversight of the financial and material operations of courts and the HJC. Other Ministry
duties including organization and development of the IT for the courts; developing and implementing
capital projects and “other programs” for the courts, and appointing and dismissing expert witnesses
and court interpreters69. The Ministry also determines the rules for court costs to be paid by parties.70
MOJPA has competence for adoption of Court Rules of Procedure with the parameters of article 74 of
the Law on organization of courts (see box). The HJC’s and MOJ’s responsibilities for court
management lie alongside of the Supreme Court of Cassation as discussed above.

The Court Rule of Procedure prescribe the court internal organization and operation, in particular: organization
and work of departments and other internal court units; work of the joint session of the departments and the
session of all judges; informing the public about the work of courts; the conducting of proceedings and the

33. Amendments to the Law on court organization from December 2013 envisaged transfer of
competences from the MOJPA to HJC as of June 1, 2016. The following competences shall be assumed
by the HJC: criteria for determination of the number of court staff and a wide array of judicial
administration tasks71 Capital expenditures will also be disbursed by the HJC.

34.     The Ministry of Finance (MoF) oversees the financial operations of the HJC and MOJPA. MoF
also shares with the HJC and MOJPA oversight of budget funds earmarked for court operations. The
Ministry of Finance also shares oversight of the “financial and material business” of the HJC with
MOJPA.72



      iv. Governing Serbia’s Prosecutors

35. Responsibility for administration over prosecutors’ system is within the SPC. The SPC is another
body created by the 2006 Constitution, but with the details of its duties and operations enacted by law.
Its 11 members include the Republic Public Prosecutor (who serves as president of the SPC), the
Minister of Justice of Public Administration, and the President of the National Assembly Committee for
Judicial Affairs. The other eight members are elected by the National Assembly: six public prosecutors
or deputy public prosecutors are chosen by their peers (at least one of whom must be from Vojvodina)
for nomination to the Assembly by the SPC, one attorney chosen by the Serbian Bar Association and one
law professor chosen by a joint session of the deans of Serbia’s law faculties73. The six elected members
are directly elected by deputy and public prosecutors. As is true for the HJC, the elected members of
the SPC serve five-year terms.74

36.The SPC has key role in election of Republic Prosecutor, public prosecutors and deputy public
prosecutors. The SPC develops a list of candidates, which it forwards to the Government for nomination
to the National Assembly.75 Once chosen, the Republic Prosecutor and pubic prosecutors may serve six-
year terms.76 As it is mentioned above the SPC also is responsible for nominating deputy public

   Monitoring of the work of courts; collecting statistics and other data; approval of court rules on internal
organization and job classification; supervision of proceeding in cases within statutory time limits and proceeding
on complaints and petitions; the proposing of the part of the budget intended for investments, projects and other
programs for operation of judicial authorities; ensuring spatial requirements, equipment supply and security of
courts; oversight of financial and material operations of courts and the High Judicial Council; organization and
development of the judicial IT system; organization, development and maintenance of the database of legal
enactments; development and implementation of capital projects and other programs for judicial authorities;
appointment and dismissal of expert witnesses and court interpreters.

prosecutors to the National Assembly. After these deputies have served three years, the SPC determines
if they should be elected to permanent jobs as deputy prosecutors.77

37. Many of the other duties of the SPC are similar to those of the HJC. The SPC can terminate or
promote deputy prosecutors; plays a significant role in discipline and evaluation of public prosecutors
and deputy public prosecutors; determines the curricula for the initial training of deputy public
prosecutors and prosecutors’ assistants; propos es the curriculum for continuous training of public
prosecutors and deputy public prosecutors; passes the code of ethics; proposes the budget for
“overhead expenses” by prosecutor’s offices and disburses them; and implements of many
aspects of the National Strategy for Reform of the Judiciary. The SPC also appoints the Acting
Republic Prosecutors and rules on the suspension of the Republic Prosecutor. 78

38. Public prosecutors in Higher Public Prosecutor’s Offices oversee and direct the work of Basic
Public Prosecutors in their territory79. The Republic Public Prosecutor also proposing advanced training
programs for public prosecutors and their deputies.80 The MOJPA, however, retains significant
responsibility for running of the prosecutors’ offices, including adoption of Rules of Procedure in
prosecution service and oversee application of the Rules.


      v. Related Institutions and Stakeholders

      (a) Judicial Academy

39. The Judicial Academy began operating in 2010, and provides initial training for judicial and
prosecutor candidates, and continuing training for judges, prosecutors and court staff.81 The JA is the
legal successor of the Judicial Training Center. Participants in the 30-month initial training program have
coursework and have practical internships relating to civil law, criminal law, minor offences law, and the
prosecution of cases. The HJC and the SPC determine the number of trainees to be admitted to the
Academy each year, and trainees are selected based on the results of a publicly advertised examination.
The entrance exam consists of practical test, theoretical test and personality test.82 Candidates are
admitted based on the ranking of their exam scores.

40. Initial training students have training organized in courts, prosecution offices and training with
the supervision of mentors. Participants take a final exam at the end of the initial training, which
includes a practical simulation of three days of trial, including a day of a civil trial, a day of a criminal
trial, and a day of acting as a prosecutor.

41. Candidates who successfully complete the initial training program have been given preference for
appointments as judges or prosecutors.83 However, a February 6, 2014 decision of the Constitutional
Court may mean the statutory preference for appointment of trainees from the JA may no longer be
valid.84 The Association of Judicial and Prosecutorial Assistants,85 established in reaction to the
preference given to JA graduates for judicial and prosecutorial appointments, over judicial and
prosecutorial assistants who met the requirements for judges and prosecutors before the establishment
of the JA. The Association of Judicial and Prosecutorial Assistants challenged constitutionality of the Law
on the JA.


      (b) Bailiffs



42. Private Bailiffs were introduced in 2011, to improve the enforcement of court decisions relating to
the collection of debts.86 The Law on Enforcement and Security defines a private bailiff as an individual
appointed by the MOJPA to conduct enforcement in accordance with the enforcement ruling, and to
exercise other authorities invested in him/her under the Law. 87 For the collection of bills from public
utilities, bailiffs can act on the basis of “authenticated documents” (e.g. invoices or bills) rather than a
court decision. Private Bailiffs and court bailiffs have the same authority to enforce matter, however
they deal in different case type. Court bailiffs have jurisdiction for family relations and reinstatement of
employees to work, which can be done only by court bailiffs.88                Private Bailiffs can deal only with
                                                                    89
enforcement cases that have commenced since 1 May 2012.

43.Private Bailiffs must have a law degree, a minimum of two years of experience in enforcement, or
three years of legal experience and passed the examination for enforcement. The first group of bailiffs
who passed the qualifying exam were sworn in during May 2012. While the MOJPA determines the
number of private Bailiffs to be appointed, Law call for the appointment of 1 Bailiff per 25.000
inhabitants and currently there are 130 of them. The geographic district for each private bailiff
corresponds to the boundaries of certain court. Private Bailiffs are automatically members of their own
chamber, which is largely self-governing. The examination for bailiffs must take place at least once a

   The first generation of students who successfully completed the initial training program and passed their final
exams were elected as judges and prosecutors in 2013.

   In February 2014 the Association of Judicial and Prosecutorial Assistance split in two Associations since they have
different views on posible solutions after decision of the Constitutional Court.

   The Law also provides detailed procedures and conditions for appointment as private bailiffs, their authorities
and duties, and their liability for any damage caused in the course of enforcement proceedings.

year90. The MOJPA determines the date and place of the exam and the panel comprises of
representatives from MOJPA, courts and Chamber of Bailiffs.



        (c) Notaries

44. The Law on the Public Notaries91 was adopted in May 2011 and its application has been delayed
for September 2014. Amendments to the law adopted in February 2013 considerably extended the
powers of notaries and now notaries have authority relating to real property transactions, proceedings
pertaining to co-owners of property, the division of common property and non-contentious and
administrative proceedings, including inheritance proceedings. 92

45. Public notaries will assume the authority for legal authentication services, which have been
handled by the courts. Plans call for Serbia to have approximately 360 notaries.93

     (d.) Mediators and Other Forms of Alternative Dispute Resolution

46. In the 2005 the Law on Broking and Mediation94 was enacted, providing for the use of mediation in
all disputes other than those whose resolution was in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or other
authority and allowing for the mediation to be initiated either after or before the legal action has
been taken, i.e. independently from the initiation of any formal proceeding.
47.The National Mediation Centre (NMC) was established in Belgrade, in 2006 by Ministry of Justice,
National Bank of Serbia, the Belgrade Bar Association and the Child Rights Center, based on the 2005
Law on Brokering and Mediation. The law provides for the use of mediation in all disputes other than
those whose resolution is in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or other authority. It allows for
mediation to be initiated with or without a corresponding formal proceeding. The NMC was set up with
the primary tasks of providing mediation services, organizing trainings and expert meetings, promoting
mediation and publishing materials about mediation. However, by 2012 there were only 729 cases
brought to the NMC, of which 313 were resolved through mediation. The 2010 Law on Consumer
Protection has generated an increase in the number of mediation cases: the ratio of consumer
protection cases rose from 57% in 2011 to 73% in 2012.
48.The MOJPA set up a task force in 2012 to draft a new Mediation law, in an attempt to meet
international standards and EU accession criteria. The resulting draft law would introduce a system for
the licensing of mediators. Initial licenses would be issued for three years, with possible renewals for
five years. The draft law also provides for MOJPA to keep a registry of mediators; issue, renew and

revoke licenses; define training program for mediators and issue accreditation for implementation of
training.
49.Beside mediation, other forms of Alternative Dispute Resolutions exist within the National Bank
(Center for protection and education of financial service users), and the Serbian Chamber of
Commerce (Mediation in Financial Restructuring of Companies95 and the Foreign Trade Arbitration96).
In 2006 Law on Arbitration97 was adopted and it is obligatory for domestic arbitrations.


     (e) Ombudsman

50.      Citizens can file complaints with Serbia’s Ombudsmen if they feel their rights to a fair trial or
to trial within a reasonable time have been violated; there is non-enforcement of court judgments, or
they consider the manner in which the MOJPA has acted upon citizen complaints inappropriate or
inadequate.98 1 According to the Ombudsperson Annual Report for 2012 the Ombudsman office receives
289 complaints that alleged violation of the right to trial within a reasonable time.

51.     Ombudsperson institutions are independent. There are ombudsmen at the local, provincial and
republic levels. In many of these cases, citizens have indicated they would also be filing cases in the
European Court of Human Rights for the same violations of their rights. Ombudsmen also have seen
increasing numbers of requests for legal assistance to drafting petitions, represent parties before courts
and other state authorities, and to interpret or explain legal provisions.

     (f) Anti-corruption Agency

52.The Anti-corruption Agency (ACA) is an independent public body established to eliminate the
causes of corruption and thus create conditions for increasing the integrity of public authorities, and
the personal integrity of the Serbian citizens, particularly public officials. The ACA was established by
the Law on the Anti-Corruption Agency, in October 2008, and began operations in January 2010.

95
   Mediation in financial restructuring of companies is an agreement on restructuring of company’s debt, that is
redefining the debtor-creditor relationship between the company in financial difficulties and its creditors, primarily
banks.
96
   When its jurisdiction is agreed upon by the parties, the Foreign Trade Arbitration is competent to settle disputes
arising out of international business relations, i.e. the business relations where: the parties have their places of
business in different States, or the place where a substantial part of the obligations of the business relationship is
to be performed or the place with which the subject matter of the dispute is most closely connected is located
abroad, or the parties have explicitly agreed that the subject matter of the arbitration agreement relates to more
than one country.

   Article 17 Law on Ombudsperson: „The Protector of Citizens shall have the power to control the respect of the
rights of citizens, establish violations resulting from acts, actions or failure to act by administrative authorities, if
they are violations of the laws, regulations and other general acts of the republic.
The Protector of Citizens shall have the power to control the legality and regularity of the work of administrative
authorities.
The Protector of Citizens shall not have the power to control the work of the National Assembly, President of
Republic, Government of Serbia, Constitutional Court, courts and public prosecution's offices.“

                                                                                                                      18
53.ACA has competence to act on complaints by natural or legal persons. From 2010 through 2012, the
majority of complaints to the ACA were against public bodies, particularly in alleged irregularities in the
work of public administration and judicial bodies. According to the ACA Annual Report for 2012 there
were 208 complaints against Public Prosecutor’s Office, 72 complaints against Courts and 230 against
Public Administration in the period 2010-2012. In response to received complaints the ACA can initiate
inquiry (administrative procedure) and if the complaint is founded the ACA will inform competent
institutions (e.g. prosecutor, misdemeanor court).



     (f) Professional associations

     (i.) Judge’s Association of Serbia

54.Judges’ Association of Serbia (JAS) is voluntary professional association of judges, established in
1997. JAS is affiliated with the MEDEL and International Association of Judges and has been outspoken
in protecting judicial independence.

55. JAS protects interests of judges and offers its views on reform of judiciary and introduction of
systems of education of judges, regular evaluation of their performances and disciplinary liability.
Those systems now are introduced in current laws. Establishing the Judicial Council in 2001 Law as well
as further development of HJC status and its regulation by the Constitution was done with the efforts of
JAS and prominent professors who shared the same point of view. Judicial training center (JTC) was
established in 2001, on the initiative of JAS which, jointly with Serbian Government, was 50%-50%
cofounder of JTC.

     (ii.) Prosecutor’s Association of Serbia

56.The Prosecutors` Association of Serbia (PAS) is a voluntary association of Public Prosecutors and
Deputy Public Prosecutors formed in 2001. Its activities include working with the Serbian government
to draft model for the Law on Public Prosecution, the Law on the State Prosecutorial Council, and by-
laws for the SPC.

57. PAS created strategic partnership with the Judges` Association of Serbia based on mutual goals to
contribute to the judicial reform process. PAS protects interest of prosecutors and offers its proposals
for the reform of judiciary. The membership perceives the PAS as the organization that has reliably and
consistently been providing best possible service, adapting actions to the clients’ needs (especially in
times of re-appointment process in 2009 and beginning of 2010) and external factors coming from fast
pace judicial system reform. That collaboration, with strong assistance from international networks
(MEDEL and International Association of Prosecutors - IAP) was utilized strategically by the PAS.

     (iii.) Association of Misdemeanor Judges

58.    The Association of Misdemeanor Judges (MAS) is voluntary association of Misdemeanor
judges established in 2002. MAS activities are focused on the support to the Government in drafting

                                                                                                        19
legislative framework relevant for the Misdemeanor Judges (Law on misdemeanor) and providing
trainings on new laws.
59.      MAS protects interest of the Misdemeanor Judges. All Misdemeanor Judges are members of

       (iv) Bar Association of Serbia

60.Membership in the Bar Association of Serbia is obligatory for lawyers practicing before Serbia’s
ordinary courts.99 The Association includes nine regional bar chambers100 and it regulates all aspects of
attorneys appearing in the ordinary courts: their admission to and departure from practice; how they
organize their practices (as individual attorneys, partnerships or joint law offices); and the type and
applicability of disciplinary measures101. It is also responsible for drafting the code of ethics for
attorneys appearing before the courts, setting the fees and expenses to be charged by attorneys.102 The
Association also is responsible for an Attorney Academy to provide continuing training for lawyers.103 In
addition to paying membership fees to the Association, attorneys also must obtain professional liability
insurance, through a group policy obtained by the Association, or directly from an insurance company.104

      (g) Civil Society Organizations

61. While Serbia has many CSOs, including many human rights organizations, few of them focus on
issues relating to the general development of Serbia’s judicial institutions.105 To date, human rights
organizations have focused on the effect measures might have on individuals or groups, rather than
their effects on judicial operations as a whole. There are also some national CSOs active in informing the
public and generating debate about European integration. Some CSOs are involved in drafting laws
relevant for judicial reform, surveys, trainings, public awareness activities.

     The attorney tariff is set by the Bar Association of Serbia as an autonomous, independent and mandatory
professional organisation (association) of attorneys. The amount of the reward for attorneys in criminal
proceedings in the attorney tariff is set based on the potential punishment for the criminal offence that the
defendant is charged with. The amount of the reward for the work of attorney – ex officio defence counsel is set in
accordance with the Rulebook adopted by Ministry of Justice and in these cases it amounts to 50% of the
applicable attorney tariff. The reward for the work of attorneys – ex officio defence counsels in pre-criminal
proceedings (police investigation) is set in the same way and based on the same regulations as in the criminal
proceedings.

62. Although the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia guarantees the right to legal aid, the provision
of legal aid, including free legal aid (FLA), integrally regulated system of legal aid does not exist . In
order to regulate FLA systemically the MOJPA prepared draft Law on FLA in December 2013. Draft Law
defines the providers and users of free legal aid, register and obligations of providers, the procedure for
exercising the right to free legal aid, financing, control and supervision of the implementation of the
Law, and tort liability for violations of the legal provisions.

63. While the new Law is not adopted several different laws contains provisions related to legal aid
and enable legal aid services in municipalities, direct legal representation, reimbursement for costs of
representation, support for access provided through NGO’s, university law clinics and/or pro bono
service by members of the Serbian bar association. The Law on Local Self-Government106 stipulates
that municipalities organize legal aid services to be used by citizens. Municipal legal centers exist in
approximately 1/3 of all municipalities (from 150 municipalities in Serbia 42 municipalities established
FLA, 9 that have not established FLA services, but nevertheless provide free legal aid). 107 In 2011 there
were 62,242 services provided by municipal FLA service and in 2012 there were 71,741 services.
