                     Side by Side with People:
                     Korea’s Experiences on Participatory Auditing


                     The Board of Audit and Inspection of Korea (hereinafter referred to as BAI) has gradually
                                                                                                                                              1
                     expanded the dimensions of its cooperative relationship with the citizenry since its
                     establishment. The BAI has gone through the information and consultation stages and
                     has now reached the stage of partnership for decision-making with citizens.1 The BAI
                     takes advice on its audit direction and formally receives audit requests from the citizens. In
                     addition it takes tips on fraud, waste, or mismanagement of public funds along with civil
                     petitions and complaints from the citizens. The BAI also makes all audit reports available to
                     the citizenry through its website. The fact that the BAI annually receives over ten thousand
                     petitions or complaints from the citizenry and the business community well reflects the
                     significance of this cooperative relationship. The BAI also receives about 200 audit requests
                     per year from Korea’s citizens.

                     This paper addresses three key issues associated with the Supreme Audit Institution (SAI)’s
                     engagement with citizens based on the BAI’s varied cooperation experiences with citizens:
                     i) the values and benefits of SAI’s engagement with citizens; ii) the potential risks; and iii)
                     practical approaches to ensure the identified values and benefits while controlling the risks.

                       UNDESA (2013) categorizes the types of interaction between SAIs and citizens as follows: (1) a one-way SAI-citizen
                     relationship where SAIs inform citizens; (2) a two-way relationship where SAIs consult citizens; and (3) a partnership
                     for decision-making between SAIs and citizens.

2   Historical Perspective

    The Korean society has a long tradition of hearing people’s voice as a way of protecting
    people’s basic rights and preventing public officials’ corruptive acts. For instance,
    Sinmungo—a big drum—was hung outside of the royal palace in early 15th century
    during the Chosun Dynasty in an effort to resolve people’s complaints directly and
    help stabilize their lives. By beating the drum, people suffering from injustice could
    voice their complaints. For a long time, Sinmungo had served as a channel for the
    government to listen to the people’s complaints and solve them.3 Its tradition has been
    kept in many aspects of public administration.

    Establishment of Civil Petition & Complaint Reception Center
    The BAI has developed close ties with the citizenry since its establishment in
    1963. Citizens’ involvement in the beginning, however, was confined to gathering
    information on fraud, misconduct, or abuse of power through citizens’ complaints and
    petition. As the number of citizens’ complaints increased rapidly, the BAI decided to
    set up the Civil Petition & Complaint Reception Center in 1971 in order to handle them

    The Korean government follows this tradition and ACRC Korea operates online Sinmungo or e-People
    (www.epeople.go.kr/) as a communication channel between the government and the citizens.

3   BAI’s Participatory Audit System

    In order to support increasing demand for audit requests, the BAI gradually expanded
    its investigative capacity. In 1980, the BAI established, for the first time, an audit unit
    designated to investigate those petitions and complaints that were submitted to the
    BAI Reception Center. In 2006, the Audit Requests Investigation Group was established
    with two audit divisions, one for petitions and complaints and the other for audit
    requests, which later expanded into the Audit Requests Investigation Bureau with three
    divisions,5 one regional office, and five regional centers in 2009.

    The BAI plans and conducts over 150 audits on the BAI’s own initiative every year. In
    addition to these planned audits, the BAI carries out 20 to 30 audits out of 150 to 180
    audit requests submitted by the citizens, CSOs, local councils or the heads of public
    entities that are subject to the BAI audit. The National Assembly, upon the approval at
    its plenary session, may also ask the BAI to conduct an audit on specific issues under
    the BAI’s audit mandates. The BAI reports 5 to 13 mandated audits to the National
    Assembly annually. The BAI opened three regional Civil Petition & Complaint Centers in
    Busan, Daejeon, and Gwangju in 2009 and two more centers in Daegu and Suwon in
    2013, to make services more accessible to everyone.

      As audit requests increased steadily, the audit requests investigation unit was expanded to two divisions by
    setting up an audit division in charge of investigating construction related audit requests.

4   Values and Benefits of Participatory
    Auditing7

    Active citizen participation in auditing and enhanced
    participatory democracy
    The graph below shows a rapidly increasing trend of audit requests over the 1996–2013
    period.8 From the introduction of the Audit Request for Public Interests (ARPI) in 1996,
    the average number of annual audit requests remained around 20 until 2001, but it has
    increased eight-fold since then, and for the last three years, it jumped to about 180 cases
    per year, which can be explained by the long-awaited enactment of Anti-Corruption
    Act of 2002. The CSOs and citizen activists had put great effort into the enactment, such
    as conducting a campaign to collect a million signatures. Thus, the enactment itself
    brought great attention to the citizen engagement in public auditing, though it was
    not a critical element of the Anti-Corruption Act. The increase in the number of audit
    requests reflects that the citizens and the CSOs consider the participatory audit as an
    important vehicle to improve the transparency and accountability in the public sector,
    which in turn contributes to maturing participatory democracy.

    Telephone users requested an audit against a telephone company when they found that they had been subscribed
    to expensive phone plans without their consent. The BAI found that there were more than 2 million cases of the
    same unauthorized subscriptions and Korea Communications Commission (KCC), the supervisory body, failed to
    take appropriate actions over telephone users’ repeated complaints against the illegal practices of the telephone
    company. The BAI notified the head of KCC of its negligent supervision and recommended to take corrective actions.
    The telephone company was fined and the telephone users including the requesters were fully refunded as a result
    of the audit.

5   Risks and Control Mechanisms

    Many SAIs are still hesitant about expanding their collaboration with citizens to the
    stage of partnership for decision-making, citing potential risks associated with the
    practices of participatory auditing, such as hampering independence and/or political
    neutrality and use of limited audit resources in private interest areas. The question
    is whether there exist any effective control mechanisms so that these risks can be
    managed within a reasonable cost.

    Distorted purpose of audit requests
    Although participatory auditing is gaining momentum as more citizens are eager to
    express their interests in government affairs, some of audit requests are tilted toward
    pursing private interests, which may divert the very purpose of participatory auditing,
    protecting the public interest of citizens.

    In order to preclude distorted audit requests, the BAI has established various control
    measures such as strengthening qualifications of requesters, defining ‘public interest’
    in a rigorous way, and setting up an audit request review committee to screen the
    requests, etc. First, to become an eligible requester, citizens as a group should be
    composed of over 300 people. Second, since it is one of the key selection criteria, the
    BAI has also refined the concept of public interest as “welfare of the general public and
    the whole society, not confined to certain groups or persons.” The CSOs as a requester

6   Lessons Learned and Future Challenges

    The experiences of the BAI’s participatory auditing show that the risks associated with
    the participatory auditing are manageable within a reasonable cost, though it does
    not necessarily imply that the BAI model works in all circumstances. The BAI was able
    to seize substantial benefits from the participatory auditing thanks to several factors as
    follows:

      ❱❱ Legal framework should be in place to ensure continued operation and resource
         inflows and to draw more attention from citizens;

      ❱❱ Continuous attention and support from the top management is necessary in order
         to help their auditors get motivated;

      ❱❱ Synergy effects or economies of scope can be obtained by offering various but
         related participatory activities. This integrated “one-stop” system can increase
         citizens’ satisfaction by helping an SAI better respond to the citizens’ demands;

      ❱❱ Enhanced access to the redress system through various online and off-line media,
         such as an internet based fraud net, toll-free hot line, and civil petitions and
         complaints reception center may encourage more active participation from the
         citizens;

The World Bank Group’s Open and Collaborative Governance (OCG) Practice within the
Governance Global Practice (GGP) works to make governments more effective, inclusive,
and trustworthy by opening up national and local governance processes and systems to
demand-side actors such as media, parliaments, and civil society organizations (CSOs) and
citizens.

The OAG’s program on Public Participation in the Budget and Audit Process (PPBA) supports
Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) and Ministries of Finance (MoF) to effectively engage with
CSOs, media, and relevant parliamentary committees in order to enhance public oversight
across the budget and audit cycles. The program does that by facilitating space for multi-
stakeholder dialogue, raising awareness on the challenges, opportunities, and entry points
for collaboration, and by supporting effective implementation of agreed-upon actions with
capacity building and technical assistance. Public Participation in the Budget and Audit Process
responds to the global trend of increasing collaboration between SAIs and CSOs which, if
done well, promises to strengthen the quality, reliability and credibility of audit processes
through public outreach and citizen engagement. The program also builds on long
experience in expanding citizen engagement across the budget cycle.

Critical to sustaining momentum on this agenda is the systematic capture of good practices,
and lessons learned about what works or does not work with respect to citizen engagement
in budget and audit processes. This paper on the experience of the Korea Board of Audit
and Inspection (BAI) is the first in a new series of PPBA learning notes that codifies good
practice examples from around the world to share it among Bank’s client countries, Policy
Research Organizations, Academia, Civil Society Organizations and donors. For additional
