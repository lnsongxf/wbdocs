Introduction
As a key input to the World Bank lead Ganges Strategic Basin Assessment (SBA) and subsequent
work on the Gangs River Basin Management Plan, hydrologic modelling of the Ganges Basin has
been undertaken using the SWAT model. The modelling performed for SBA incorporated a baseline
(current conditions) scenario and multiple scenarios of potential water resources development
focused on hydro-power development in Nepal. Reporting from the modelling has been focused on
the development scenarios and the costs and benefits stemming from these.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to construct and visualize water balance for the Ganga basin at
different temporal and spatial scales.

Scope of Work
The main job of the consultant is to use data and outputs from the SWAT model to construct water
balance for the Ganga basin at different spatial and temporal scales. The major tasks include:

    1. On Spatial Scale: Construct water balance for:
           a. the entire Ganges Basin upstream of Farakka
           b. the Indian portion of the basin upstream of Farakka
           c. the Nepalese portion of the basin
           d. the Chinese portion of the basin
           e. each of the Indian states of the basin
           f. each of the districts (as per 2011 census) of Indian states of the basin (analysis at
                this spatial scale is restricted to water balance components expressed in terms of
                total depth of water in mm over the total district area).
    2. On Temporal Scale: Water balance to be constructed at annual and calendar month level, for
           a. an average year
           b. a flood year (10th percentile)
           c. a drought year (90th percentile)
    3. Water Balance Components: Water balance to be constructed including:
           a. Inflows to rivers of major tributaries
           b. Outflows from rivers of major tributaries
           c. Losses in river systems (Evapotranspiration, ground water recharge and conveyance
                loss), however quantifying loss due to water distribution efficiency and water use
                efficiency at different scales may not be possible
           d. Water Use:
                      i. sectoral disaggregation (domestic, Industrial and agriculture)
                     ii. major crop wise disaggregation.
    4. Water Quality (model outputs for water quality parameters) of
                      i. Sediment transport
                     ii. BOD.
    5. Indications of relative level of uncertainty
           a. wherever possible quantitatively (or qualitatively)
           b. list of additional data that would be required to reduce the uncertainty.

Analysis shall include monthly and daily flow duration curves, and descriptive statistics of monthly
and annual flows (mean, 3 quartiles, temporal coefficient of variation).


Methodology
The information and the analysis provided here is the outcome of a detailed modeling exercise
carried out using the SWAT hydrological model under the World Bank-led Ganges Strategic Basin
Assessment (SBA) and some of the subsequent works on the hydrologic modelling of the Ganges
Basin undertaken using the SWAT model. This report utilizes the following outputs:

   â€¢       River water balance
               o Components: Stream Flow - FLOW_IN and FLOW_OUT
               o Units: cumecs (m3/sec)
               o Description: Outflow = Inflow (upstream inflow+ generated in the catchment) - Use
                   (irrigation +Domestic + Industrial) - Losses - change in storage
               o Spatial scale: At Country, State and major subbasins
               o Temporal scale: Long term average annual and monthly.
   â€¢       Catchment Water balance
               o Components: Water yield - WYLD, Actual evapotranspiration - ET
               o Units: mm
               o Description: WYLD = Rainfall - ET - change in storage.
   â€¢       Water Quality constituent balances
               o Components: Sediment yield, Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
               o Units: tons/ha, kg O2
               o Description: Load out = Load in (upstream Load in + generated in the catchment) -
                   deposition/sinks.

Definitions of some of the key entities
   â€¢       Water yield (mm) - WYLD: The net amount of water that leaves the subbasin and contributes
           to stream flow in the reach during the time step. (WYLD = SURQ + LATQ + GWQ â€“ TLOSS â€“
           pond abstractions)
   â€¢       Direct Surface runoff (mm - SURQ): Surface runoff contribution to stream flow during time
           step
   â€¢       Lateral flow (mm) - LATQ: Lateral flow contribution to stream flow during the time step
   â€¢       Base flow (mm) - GWQ: Groundwater contribution to stream flow (mm). Water from the
           shallow aquifer that returns to the reach during the time step
   â€¢       Actual evapotranspiration (mm) - ET: Actual evapotranspiration from the subbasin during
           the time step
   â€¢       Percolation (mm) - PERC: Water that percolates past the root zone during the time step
           (mm). There is potentially a lag between the time the water leaves the bottom of the root
           zone and reaches the shallow aquifer. Over a long period of time, this variable will be equal
           groundwater percolation. (Ground water Recharge = PERC-GWQ)
   â€¢       Sediment yield (tons/ha) - SYLD: Sediment from the subbasin that is transported into the
           reach during the time step

            outlets) during the time step

    â€¢       the Indian portion of the basin upstream of Farakka
    â€¢       the Nepalese portion of the basin

                o long term annual average (long term basin average)
                o a high flow year (basin 10th percentile, single year)
                o a low flow year (basin 90th percentile, single year).

Identification of High flow and Low flow year
Specific years are identified as year of high flow and year of low flow based on stream flow from
1975-2004. Average annual flow of 20 locations (major basins and on main Ganga at Farakka) was
analysed for high flow (10th percentile) and low flow (90th percentile). High and Low flow years were
identified as those years which had maximum number of subbasins experiencing high and low flow.
Table 1 and Figure 1 show the year wise basins falling in high and low flow year category.
Accordingly 1985 and 1989 were identified as basin high flow year and basin low flow year
respectively.

Scenarios for flow regime change analysis
The following two scenarios have been constructed to represent two distinct flow regimes,
representing i) pre-water resources development and ii) present flow regimes.

Scenario A: Pre-development flow in the absence of water resources infrastructure and water
diversions but reflecting catchment hydrology corresponding to the current landuse.

Scenario B: Current conditions:, Existing major water resources infrastructure, current
management/operation practices, existing crop water demand through irrigation. Note: Current
crop management practices (irrigation from Surface and Ground water) + Point source (average BOD

+ Scenario A: Pre-development flow in the absence of water resources infrastructure and water
diversionsbut reflecting catchment hydrology corresponding to the current landuse
++ Scenario B: Current conditions: Existing major water resources infrastructures, current
management/operation practices, existing crop water demand with irrigation wherever applicable.


Change in flow in Scenario B with respect to Scenario A along with percentage reduction in flow is
shown in Figure 4. Figure 5 and Figure 6 show the graphical representation.

Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 9 depict annual, monsoon and non monsoon flows in BCM at state level
for Scenario B and the ratio of Scenario B to Scenario A.
