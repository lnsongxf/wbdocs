Foreword

At the beginning of the 16th Congress, the country was faced with an estimated 5.5 million
housing backlog. An earthquake struck Bohol, damaging major infrastructures; and Super Typhoon
Haiyan (Yolanda) struck the Visayas, claiming more than 6,300 lives with losses and damage to
property estimated at PHP571.1 billion. Moreover, Metro Manila’s homeless and informal settlers
ballooned to 584,524 families.

The massive displacement of families from these calamities left many of our homeless, typhoon
victims, and informal settler families devastated and at the point of hopelessness, without a clear
government housing strategy on hand.

Finding remedies to respond to this overwhelming challenge became our mission and compelled
us to launch the National Summit on Housing and Urban Development where government agencies
together with the private sector and civil society organizations embarked on a tedious journey in
search of lasting solutions.

The Housing Summit became the platform for cooperation, where learning and sharing of
experiences and an in-depth study of the nuances and complexities of our housing policies and
programs resulted in the elaboration of policy recommendations that are deemed to effectively
solve the housing crises and improve the participation, efficiency, and collaboration of our well-
meaning key shelter agencies, local government units, and the private sector.

We give our heartfelt thanks to everyone involved in all the consultations and the various
thematic working groups, most especially to the members and staff of the Congressional Committee
on Housing and Urban Development led by Rep. Albert ‘Albee’ Benitez, Chairman Chito Cruz of
HUDCC, the World Bank and its former Country Director Motoo Konishi, for being with us through
the whole process and for providing us with the much needed technical support.

We salute the dedicated officials and representatives from all the key shelter agencies, civil
society organizations, nongovernmental organizations, local chief executives of Metro Manila,
and the different peoples’ organizations for contributing their time, data, policies, and program
experiences that led us to arrive at these credible solutions for the country’s housing crises.

Together, we are able to present a policy framework for an inclusive, sustainable, and resilient in-
city housing development and resettlement program. This will lead us in the right track of planning,
strategizing, and building not only easily available, resilient, and affordable homes for all in this time

fulfills its obligation and accountability to the people by protecting their dignity, promoting their
interests, and respecting their right to safe and adequate shelter.

The National Housing and Urban Development Summit was the response of the Philippine
Congress, through the Joint Committee on Housing and Urban Development, to the need for
urgent policy reforms to solve the pervasive problems that are impeding the delivery of affordable
and decent shelter to the Filipinos.

Recognizing that the Summit cannot eliminate the housing challenges in the country overnight,
the Committee focused on gathering all of the stakeholders, including government agencies,
housing developers, key shelter agencies, academe, development organizations, and people’s
organizations, to identify critical issues on shelter delivery and housing affordability. More
importantly, the most significant output of the housing summit is the consensus among all
stakeholders on the policy directions to improve housing indicators.

This policy paper encapsulates the urgent issues that need to be addressed in terms of unlocking
lands for socialized housing, housing production for the lower to middle income sector, housing
financing, and resettlement issues. In addition, the paper also provides a set of policy proposals
that will be pushed by the housing sector in the 17th Congress.

In behalf of the Committee on Housing and Urban Development of the 16th Congress, I wish to
express my gratitude to all the government agencies, local government units, private sector
groups, civil society organizations, and the World Bank for their tireless support to the Housing
Summit initiative. This paper is a product of our consolidated hard work and effort of all
participants and a concrete proof of our strong commitment to translate the right of the people
to decent and affordable housing into a reality.

Maraming Salamat po.

Urbanization is one of the most significant drivers of development. It can provide a pathway out
of poverty and act as an engine of growth. Today, half of the Philippines’ population lives in cities,
and the proportion will continue to increase to reach over 80 percent by 2050. Philippine cities
altogether generate 70 percent of the Gross Domestic Product, half of which is generated in
Metro Manila alone. Urbanization has often helped reduce poverty by providing new job
opportunities and raising incomes of the poor.

Yet, the speed and scale of urbanization bring challenges. Demands for housing, basic services,
functional transport systems, and jobs continue to rise. And as cities fail to keep pace with the
rapid urbanization, informal settlements grow. Metro Manila is a case in point. While it is difficult
to capture the accurate number of informal settler families (ISFs), estimates range from more
than 250,000 to 600,000 in Metro Manila alone. This translates to three million individuals, which
means that about one in four people in Metro Manila resides in an informal settlement and has
no security of tenure.

The Government has taken commendable steps to tackle the ISF issue. Some local governments
and civil society organizations have also made impressive progress in addressing the ISF housing
issue. But we need to do more, better, and faster.

The National Summit on Housing and Urban Development, initiated by the House of Representatives’
Committee on Housing and Urban Development and the Senate Committee on Urban Planning,
Housing, and Resettlement, was a formidable endeavor to tackle the affordable housing challenge
head on. The World Bank is pleased to have provided substantive technical inputs to this important
effort, supported by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Over the course of the year, the Summit involved 125 organizations from all corners of the society
and generated consensus on some concrete policy reform agenda that will help close the gap in
affordable housing. This policy paper puts forward key policy reforms covering four critical areas
of land, housing finance, participatory governance, and inclusive urbanization. The challenge now
is to translate these recommendations into action. I hope we can jointly continue this endeavor to
make a real difference.

        CLOSING THE GAP IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE PHILIPPINES:
          POLICY PAPER FOR THE NATIONAL SUMMIT ON HOUSING AND
                           URBAN DEVELOPMENT




I.          Introduction
1.      The Philippines is one of the fastest urbanizing countries in the Southeast Asian Region.
Since the 1950s, millions have migrated from rural areas to the cities in search of better job
opportunities. The country is now 50 percent urban, and by 2025 this proportion is expected to be
80 percent. From 2000 to 2010, Metro Manila absorbed an additional two million people.1 The
Philippines has more than 200 urban areas but Metro Manila, a region comprising 16 cities and
one municipality, is expected to remain dominant (with 50 percent of gross domestic product
being generated by the Greater Metro Manila area alone2) and absorb more people into it and its
periphery.

2.       With the unprecedented rate of in-migration have come surges in demand for jobs,
housing, and basic services in major cities. With the government unable to address the increased
demand, there are enormous gaps in infrastructure and basic services, affordable housing, and
jobs, and severe traffic congestion. As cities fail to keep pace with rapid urbanization, the number
of informal settlements and informal settler families (ISFs)3 have grown especially in Metro
Manila, widening and deepening urban poverty. While it is difficult to capture the accurate
number of ISFs, estimates range from more than 250,0004 to 600,0005 in Metro Manila alone. The
latter estimate translates to three million individuals, which means about one in four people in
Metro Manila resides in an informal settlement and has no security of tenure. The increase in ISFs
raises the total number of poor families, giving rise to “urbanization of poverty.”

3.       The issue of ISFs represents a grave challenge the Philippines faces in trying to achieve
inclusive growth. ISFs suffer from lack of security of tenure, access to basic services, and access to

  Informal settlers are defined more broadly by the National Housing Authority (NHA) as households occupying (i) lots
without the consent of the owners, (ii) danger areas along river banks, along railways, under bridges and other such
structures, (iii) areas designated for government infrastructure projects, (iv) protected/forest areas except for indigenous
people, (v) areas for priority development, and (vi) other government/public lands or facilities not intended for human
habitation.

productive formal jobs. They struggle with chronic poverty, difficult living conditions, and high
exposure to natural disasters, especially flooding. They are seldom integrated into the broader
communities and face higher than average incidence of crime and violence. The Philippines
cannot achieve inclusive growth without addressing the precarious situation of ISFs and providing
solutions to lift them out of poverty.

4.      The Philippine government has made efforts to address the ISF issue but has been unable
to come up with institutional reforms and interventions that can adequately resolve it. It has
developed and implemented a number of housing programs to respond to the challenge, ranging
from highly centralized government-led approaches to more market-oriented and participatory
strategies, but these have not curbed the increasing informality in urban centers.

5.       President Benigno S. Aquino III at the start of his term in 2010 signed what he called a
“Social Contract with the Filipino People,” promising, among others, “inclusive urban develop-
ment where people of varying income levels are integrated in productive, healthy, and safe
communities.” Among other efforts, his administration accelerated the provision of shelter,
particularly for low-income groups and the urban poor. It launched Oplan LIKAS: Lumikas para
Iwas Kalamidad at Sakit (Operation Plan: Evacuate to Avoid Calamity and Sickness), a program to
relocate more than 104,000 ISFs from danger areas. It allocated PHP 50 billion (approximately
US$1.15 billion) over five years, from 2011 to 2016, to finance land acquisition and housing
construction.6 Taking global and national best practices into account, Oplan LIKAS advocated in-
city relocation, to within the vicinity of ISFs’ livelihoods, leaving off-city relocation as a last resort.7
Yet, due to lack of affordability, land constraints, and institutional challenges, among other
factors, about 67 percent of the resettlements by the National Housing Authority (NHA) under
Oplan LIKAS as of April 2015 were off-city.8

6.     To help address the constraints in providing affordable housing, with priority for in-city
sites where people can have ready access to livelihood and basic services, the House of
Representatives’ Committee on Housing and Urban Development and the Senate Committee on
Urban Planning, Housing and Resettlement (hereafter referred to as the Joint Committee) decided

  Oplan LIKAS is a relocation program that began in 2012 and is being implemented by DILG, in conjunction with LGUs,
NHA, PCUP (Presidential Commission on the Urban Poor), and DSWD (Department of Social Welfare and Development),
involving ISFs residing along identified waterways for priority cleanup in Metro Manila. The national government
allocated PHP50 billion for in-city and off-city relocation of the affected ISFs. Some 25,000 ISF had been relocated in
2015-16 to 20 in-city and off-city resettlement sites, mostly administered by NHA. A small number of ISFs are relocating
to in-city and near-city sites adopting a “people’s plan” approach, with housing finance provided by SHFC.
7
  Draft Joint Memorandum Circular on “Policy Guidelines on the Operationalization and Utilization of the P50 Billion
Housing Fund for ISFs in Danger Areas of the NCR” (Republic of the Philippines 2013). Part I, Policy Guidelines Article 1
states that “relocation of the affected ISFs shall be onsite, near-city, and in-city” and that “off-sites shall only be
resorted to in accordance with the People’s Plans after adequate and genuine consultation, or when directly requested
by the affected ISFs themselves.”
8
 As of April 2015, NHA had completed 46,077 housing units, of which 25,049 were occupied. About 96 percent of the
occupied units are in off-city sites. By end of May 2015, Social Housing Finance Corporation (SHFC) had approved
construction of about 11,000 units under its High Density Housing (HDH) program, all of which are in-city.

requested assistance from the World Bank to provide technical inputs for the summit.9


II.      The National Housing Summit

A.       Objectives, Activities, and Processes

7.       The housing summit sought to bring together all stakeholders in the housing sector —
government, private sector, academia, and civil society — to collaborate toward identifying key
policy reforms needed to close the gap in affordable housing and effect immediate interventions
to address the shelter needs, focusing particularly on Metro Manila. The summit was purposefully
designed as a consultative process in which all the stakeholders would be engaged. Such a process
was deemed essential in fostering political consensus and ownership of the policy recommend-
ations and proposed reforms.

8.       Discussions were structured around four interrelated themes essential in making affordable
housing provision more effective: (i) land and housing, (ii) housing finance, (iii) participatory
governance, and (iv) inclusive urbanization. A working group was constituted for each theme, with
leads and co-leads from government, civil society, private sector, and academia. These included
the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), Land Registration Authority (LRA)
of the Department of Justice (DOJ), and a 10-person team representing civil society groups, for
land and housing; the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) and the
Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) for housing finance; the Department of
Interior and Local Government (DILG), the League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP), and a repre-
sentative (Chamber of Real Estate and Builders Associations, Inc., or CREBA) of private sector
groups, for participatory governance; and the National Economic and Development Authority
(NEDA) and the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB), for urban development.
Thematic working groups (TWGs) were supported by technical experts and an event management
team engaged by the World Bank. (Figure 1 shows how the national summit was organized.)

9.      From its launch in May 2015 until its conclusion in May 2016, the summit conducted nearly
40 consultations involving 125 organizations and some 500 participants. (See Appendix B for a list
of the topics presented at various major sessions and Appendix D for a list of the participants).
The Joint Committee conducted four meetings and hearings.

10.   In addition to their regular plenary meetings, the TWGs conducted small group sessions.
TWG Land and Housing convened the most number of small meetings, focusing on land inventory

   With funding support from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the World Bank provided the
following key contributions to the National Housing Summit: (i) mapping of ISFs and available land in Metro Manila,
(ii) a glossary of housing terminologies, and (iii) policy paper and policy briefs that offer recommendations for
immediate and longer-term policy and program reforms in closing the gap in affordable housing in the Philippines.
Discussions during the summit also benefited from the results of studies and projects supported by the World Bank
(see Appendix C).

and identification of lands for in-city housing for ISFs; housing design, standards, and planning
regulations; 20 percent balanced housing and other innovative mechanisms to mobilize land
for in-city housing; and policies and laws. TWG Land and Housing also initiated a pilot activity on
mapping locations of informal settlements and idle lands. This was done for Quezon City and
was attended by more than 70 city and barangay (delineated neighborhood localities) officials
and representatives of people’s organizations (POs), nongovernment organization (NGOs), and
national government agencies (NGAs).10

11.      Members of the technical team noted the problems that surfaced at different sessions and
in their own review of the literature, and prepared draft policy briefs articulating long-term and
immediate actions to address them. These papers were first presented to the Joint Committee
and subsequently discussed in sectoral meetings with civil society, private sector groups, NGAs,
and local government units (LGUs). These sectoral gatherings formally closed the housing summit
deliberations though small group meetings with specific groups and sectors continued as the
policy and other recommendations were being refined. On 4 April 2016, the Joint Committee
gathered the summit participants for a culminating activity in which a Unity Statement was
presented and signed. (The Unity Statement is in Appendix A.)

12.     As part of inputs for the summit, the European Space Agency provided the Joint Committee
with satellite maps showing built-up areas, among others, to help identify ISFs in Metro Manila.
Subsequently, a memorandum circular signed by the Executive Secretary formalized the inventory
of government lands through the creation of an interagency task force chaired by DILG (see
section on “Unlocking Land for Informal Settlers” below).

13.      HUDCC spearheaded the preparation of the Glossary of Housing Terminologies to give all
stakeholders of the housing and urban development sector, particularly key shelter agencies (KSAs),
a common understanding and usage of housing terminologies. This was regarded as among many
steps “toward addressing their collective housing and urban development problems and challenges”
(from a HUDCC presentation to the Joint Committee). In a series of meetings, selected summit
participants and international experts mobilized by Cities Alliance helped finalize the glossary.11 The
glossary was presented and deliberated on by the Joint Committee at a meeting on 7 December
2016 and subsequently submitted as House Joint Resolution 38.


B.          Civil Society Participation and the People’s Summit

sessions, providing distinct faces and voices to housing issues and concerns.12 Several common

     The World Bank facilitated a peer review by the Cities Alliance of the definition of terms used globally.
12
  The presentations of POs and NGOs on community experiences and cases at TWG meetings were reiterated and
supplemented by additional cases at what was called People’s Summit II.

themes ran through their presentations: the lengthy, cumbersome, and expensive process of land
acquisition even for ISF communities desiring to purchase private lands; the tenure uncertainties
of ISFs even in proclaimed lands; the constant threats of eviction; and the dire situations in which
former ISFs (particularly women and children) found themselves in the predominantly off-city
resettlement sites, many of which lack basic facilities and services.

15.      To many ISF communities, a disappointing experience concerned the implementation of
the DILG-led Oplan LIKAS. Many believed that the use of the program’s PHP 50 billion one-time
fund could have become a template for addressing the housing needs of the urban poor. With
help from their NGO partners, several POs undertook community planning and submitted their
outputs (the “People’s Plans”) to DILG and housing agencies concerned. Some of the plans were
eventually implemented through SHFC Community Mortgage Program (CMP) and high density
housing (HDH) program and NHA in-city projects using medium-rise buildings. However, because
of in-city land constraints and the need to accelerate the implementation of Oplan LIKAS, many
resettlements became off-city resettlements, some of which were very distant from the original
communities and characterized by incomplete facilities and services.13

16.     At some civil society presentations, the government agency concerned gave immediate
attention to specific problems raised by community participants such as by setting up dialogues,
meetings, or site visits so that solutions could be found. Such interactions, along with the
opportunity to engage in multi-sectoral dialogues and network building, became a valuable aspect
of the housing summit.

17.     POs and their partner NGOs also organized what they called “People’s Summit” to enable
POs to participate effectively in the national summit discussions and present their positions on
the different proposals.14 They convened three gatherings: in July 2015, as the housing summit
was starting, so they could prepare a list of issues they wanted to be discussed; in October 2015 for
a presentation of community and other cases they deemed in need of immediate resolution as well
as for further TWG discussions and policy formulation;15 and in February 2016 to discuss policy
proposals and other recommendations being put forward at the housing summit. As an output
of the People’s Summit, Urban Poor Associates (the member-head of the TWG Land and Housing
co-lead team) made a list of requests/demands of the urban poor and presented it to the House
Committee on Housing and Urban Development (see Box 1).

  The problems and issues concerning resettlement sites were discussed at length at consultative forums in September
and October 2015, which were organized by the Joint Committee and PCUP and attended by representatives of 20
Oplan LIKAS resettlement sites and their partner NGOs.
14
  Considered as a parallel activity of the housing summit, the People’s Summit also received support from the Joint
Committee and the World Bank.
15
   Also invited to the second People’s Summit were representatives of KSAs and LGUs . Efforts were made at the
gathering to address or answer some of the POs’ concerns. In some cases, follow-up meetings were organized between the
POs and the NGAs or LGUs concerned.

 1.   Poor People’s Right to Live in the City
       The poor have a right to live in the city, where they have access to jobs, services, and social
        networks.
       All evictions out of the cities should be made illegal.

 2.   People’s Planning and People’s Planning Bureau (PPB)
       People’s Planning: All government agencies involved in socialized housing programs should take
        genuine consultation and people’s participation seriously and put mechanisms that will ensure
        these are undertaken properly.
       PPB: Establish a separate agency that will cater to the poorest of the poor who do not qualify or
        cannot afford the amortization required in the regular social housing programs.

 3.   Subsidies
       The poorest ISFs cannot afford to pay the existing in-city socialized housing programs. Revisit the
        existing market-driven approach, and discuss appropriate levels of subsidies/grant vis-a-vis ISFs’
        affordability.
       Housing is a basic human right.

 4.   Upgrading of Existing Resettlement Areas
       Government has obligation to improve the lives of the poor who were transferred to distant off-
        city resettlement sites, especially in access to basic services and jobs.

 5.   Proclamations
       There should be no revocation of presidential proclamations for socialized housing (e.g.,
        Manggahan Floodway [PP 1160], Lupang Arenda [PP 704]). Proclamations must be made
        permanent in nature. If they can be easily altered, the purpose of the proclamation is defeated.
       Implement Proclamations in BASECO (PP 145), Manggahan Floodway (PP 458), and in West
        Rembo, Makati (PP 518).
       Proclaim Isla Putting Bato and Slip Zero.

 6.   Eviction
       Outlaw evictions [relocation?] outside the city.
       Reexamine the evictions along waterways.
       Prepare in-city relocation sites.

 7.    Land Acquisition/Land Banking
       Open all government lands for socialized housing.
         o    Insist that all LGUs identify land in their cities for the poor.

          o   NGAs and LGUs should exercise their police power by expropriating privately owned land for
              socialized housing.
          o   All land owned by government without improvements for 10 years or more shall be given
              freely to poor people’s housing (possibly on a usufruct arrangement).
          o   Give 10 percent of the reclaimed land from Laguna Lake C-6 dike project to the poor.
        Think outside the box.
          o   Government should hand over its five golf courses occupying 50 hectares in Metro Manila
              for socialized housing.

 8.    UDHA Amendments
        House Bill 5144 is a welcome development, but requires further revisions to guarantee the
         benefit of the poor and the marginalized. Proposed amendments include:
          o   Clarify the definition of “danger zone/high risk areas”
          o   Remove hierarchy on the modes of land acquisition for socialized housing
          o   A court order should be a requisite prior to carrying out evictions or demolitions
          o   Establishment of a quasi-judicial body that will hear housing issues
          o   Imposition of the 20% Balanced Housing requirement for all land developments
          o   Clarify the definition of “consultation” and “resettlement sites”
        Pass amendments stated above for HB 5144 in the Senate and ratify into law
        Deliberate in both Houses and ratify into law the other proposed amendments to RA 7279.

 9.    Jobs
        Land and housing must be accompanied by jobs for all poor families, e.g., public-private projects
         to construct manufacturing plants that employ the poor.

III.      The National Shelter Program: Context, Challenges, and Considerations

18.      The past decades saw various attempts to address the problems of the country’s growing
localities, particularly primate cities.16 Among these were measures to remedy overcrowding and
improve building sanitation, establishment of public housing corporations with different mandates,
such as shelter production, financing, provision of guaranties, and regulation. In 1978 an urban
land reform program was enacted (through Presidential Decree 1517) with the aim of regulating
“the existing pattern of land use and ownership in urban and urbanizable areas.”
________________________________________________________________________________________
16
   The creation of the Metropolitan Manila Commission in 1975 through Presidential Decree 824 established Metro
Manila as a formal region. A subsequent decree (PD 1396 of 1978) declared Metro Manila as the National Capital
Region. At that time, it was composed of four cities (Manila, Quezon City, Caloocan, Pasay) and 13 municipalities (Las
Piñas, Makati, Malabon, Mandaluyong, Marikina, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Parañaque, Pasig, San Juan, Taguig, Valenzuela,
and Pateros. Except for Pateros, the municipalities have since become independent cities.

A.          Context

19.       Since the 1980s, housing policy has been embodied in a national shelter program that
features a “total systems approach to housing finance, production and regulation,” characterized
by a network of interacting implementing agencies.17 Led by HUDCC, the key shelter agencies are
NHA, the sole government agency engaged in direct shelter production, focusing on housing
assistance to the lowest 30 percent of urban income earners; National Home Mortgage Finance
Corporation (NHMFC), envisioned to operate a viable home mortgage market and attract private
institutional funds into long-term housing mortgages; Home Guaranty Corporation, which provides
guaranties and other incentives; HLURB, which regulates land use planning and housing develop-
ment; and SHFC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NHMFC that develops and administers social
housing finance programs for low-income formal and informal households. Three contractual
savings institutions — the Home Development Mutual Fund, also known as the Pag-IBIG Fund, the
Social Security System (SSS), and the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) — are also
mandated by Executive Order 90 to help ensure the availability of funds for long-term housing
loans.

20.     The overall goal of the national shelter program has been to increase the access of target
households to decent, affordable, and secure shelter. “Target households” pertain to the first
three income deciles living in urban areas, while “secure shelter” is a house, a lot, or both.

21.      In the 1990s came two landmark legislations on housing: the Urban Development and
Housing Act of 1992 (Republic Act 7279, known as UDHA) and the Comprehensive and Integrated
Shelter Financing Act of 1994 (RA 7835, known as CISFA). UDHA declares that it “shall be the
policy of the State to undertake, in cooperation with the private sector, a comprehensive and
continuing Urban Development and Housing Program ... which shall (a) Uplift the conditions of the
underprivileged and homeless citizens in urban areas and in resettlement areas by making
available to them decent housing at affordable cost, basic services, and employment
opportunities; (b) Provide for the rational use and development of urban land in order to bring
about the following: (1) Equitable utilization of residential lands in urban and urbanizable areas
with particular attention to the needs and requirements of the underprivileged and homeless
citizens and not merely on the basis of market forces; (2) Optimization of the use and productivity
of land and urban resources ....” (Art. 1, Sec 2).

22.       Through UDHA, the government articulated its focus on socialized housing as a primary
concern and thus included a system of balanced housing development, mandated identification of
lands for socialized housing, and prescribed the conditions for decent socialized housing and
resettlement areas, taking into consideration their degree of availability of basic services and
facilities, their accessibility, and proximity to jobs and other economic opportunities. CISFA
increased and regularized yearly appropriation of the major components of the national shelter
program, augmented the authorized capital stock and paid-up capital of NHMFC and HIGC, and
identified other means of mobilizing funds for housing.

17
     Executive Order 90 essentially reiterated the National Shelter Program first formulated in 1978.
10                                                        Closing the Gap in Affordable Housing in the Philippines


23.     The Local Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160) provides the statutory framework for the
devolution of local public administration and service delivery responsibilities as well as revenue
mobilization powers to LGUs. It also provides the framework for the roles of LGUs in the national
shelter program.

24.     In the next decade and a half, the national shelter program continued the pattern set in
the past. In 2001, Executive Order (EO) 20 reaffirmed mass housing as a centerpiece program for
poverty alleviation. In 2004, EO 272 created Social Housing Finance Corporation. In 2006, RA 9397
amended Section 12 of UDHA.18

25.      These attempts, however, have had little impact in resolving the housing problem and
improving the situation of urban poor communities and ISFs. Given the magnitude of the
problem, the housing program remains inadequate and unable to provide the scale and quality
needed. Toby C. Monsod of the University of the Philippines School of Economics, citing the 2010
Census of Population and Housing, notes in her policy brief (2016) “there is an accumulated
‘backlog’ of 1.225 million units as of 1 January 2011…. 787,731 units are households in ‘unacceptable
housing’ ... and another 437,612 are households doubling up in acceptable structures. There is
also a ‘future need’ of 2.25 million for new household formation and 1.93 million for inventory
losses over the period 2011-2016, although ‘future need’ does not constitute a housing shortfall
per se.”19

26.      Those numbers will inevitably rise as the country’s good macroeconomic performance
increases demand for land and housing in urban and urbanizing areas. Since the supply of urban
land is finite and has intensifying competing demands, its allocation and use becomes a critical
focus of public policy. The dysfunctions of land and property markets and the gravely inadequate
transportation system are not strategically addressed. This suggests a formulation bereft of an
urbanization framework that should have informed the national and local development planning
and investment decision making. HUDCC, the agency in charge of coordinating such functions, has
limited powers to influence the urbanization process. The government’s development planning
and budgeting are done more on a sectoral manner, with the priorities of cabinet-level agencies
taking precedence over coordinative and intersectoral initiatives and mechanisms. As Monsod
(2016) points out, provincial governments are limited in their powers and capacities for planning
and integration. “Provinces are themselves crippled by their lack of effective planning integration
authority over component cities/municipalities (i.e., central government funding can bypass

   The UDHA amendment reads: “Disposition of Lands for Socialized Housing — The National Housing Authority, with
respect to lands belonging to the National Government, and the local government units with respect to the other lands
within their respective localities, shall coordinate with each other to formulate and make available various alternative
schemes for the disposition of lands to the beneficiaries of the Program. These schemes shall not be limited to those
involving transfer of ownership in fee simple but shall include lease, with option to purchase, usufruct or such other
variations as the local government units or National Housing Authority may deem most expedient in carrying out the
purposes of this Act.” Section 12 of RA 9397 further states: "Consistent with this provision, a scheme for public rental
housing may be adopted.”
19
   Occupants of “unacceptable housing” are “on lots without consent of owner, in predominantly makeshift housing, in
living quarters not meant for human habitation, in dilapidated or condemned structures” (Monsod 2016).

provinces and go directly to component cities and municipalities) and, perversely, have no
administrative or fiscal authority over highly urbanized cities within their geographical boundaries.”

27.      Figure 2 gives a summary of the factors that resulted in and further aggravated the
housing problem. Derived from presentations and deliberations at housing summit meetings, it
synthesizes the many issues and concerns raised about affordable housing. It uses the four major
discussion themes (land and housing, finance, participatory governance, and inclusive urbanization)
and has affordable housing and its desired characteristics at its core: accessible, adequate, safe and
secure, and sustainable.

                                Figure 2: Major Issues and Concerns




B.      Challenges

28.     There are major blocks in four strategic areas that prevent effective solutions to the
housing problem. These are land, financing, governance, and the urbanization processes.
Urbanization is the context in which the housing problem has to be appreciated. In many cities
and localities, urban development is not properly planned and managed. Near-city and off-city
relocation and displacement of ISFs become doubly problematic or complicated because of lack of
12                                                       Closing the Gap in Affordable Housing in the Philippines


connective infrastructure. Transportation systems are absent or badly planned. Poor investmentsin
the improvement, expansion, and management of transportation infrastructure prevent lagging
localities from participating in the development of urban centers. Relocation is still the dominant
approach despite a high attrition rate in resettlement projects. As informal dwellings proliferate,
there is no organized densification, and instead more spaces are used without following a
coherent land use plan. Planning coordination among LGUs is lacking or weak, compromising land
use compatibility or integration across localities and resulting in inefficiency of basic services for
transportation and traffic management.

29.     Land is another key area that requires serious attention. There is limited land and tenurial
options for shelter provisioning. Poor land management is manifested in institutional and
regulatory failures in land markets. For instance, while land use planning and land use regulations
are powers originally vested in cities and municipalities, important land management and
administration functions are also lodged in at least seven national government agencies and in
the courts. No clear integrated framework guides their functioning and coordination. An integrated
information system, inventory of, and policy on government lands, and appropriate and improved
planning guidelines and standards are, at best, written up as issuances but not operationalized.
Unavailable or inconsistent records and data as well as conflicts in land classification and other
regulatory issues push up transaction costs. The cost of securing, registering, and transferring
property rights becomes a difficult hurdle, hindering infrastructure investments and increasing
costs of servicing land. Adding to the complexity is the practice of land hoarding, absence of a
national standard for real property valuation, and weak enforcement of real property taxes.

30.      In the housing summit sessions, housing developers and community associations alike
cited existing construction codes and subdivision restrictions as constraints to improving housing
supply. These regulations are too complex and not easily understood, and make transaction costs
prohibitive. Batas Pambansa (BP) 22020 is not supportive of existing housing sites or self-help
incremental housing. In its policy brief, Land and Governance Innovations, Inc. (2016) says
standards in the Revised Fire Code of the Philippines (RA 9514) are unnecessarily stringent for
socialized housing, significantly adding to the cost. Moreover, securing all requirements for new
development can take 18 months for private developers. Community associations, particularly
ISFs with limited resources, cannot afford such delays.

31.      Signals of dysfunction in the area of housing finance include underpricing of loans and
guarantees in an underdeveloped mortgage market. The existing housing finance approach is
prone to leakages in government subsidies, since it is expected to solve a problem better framed
in a social policy, i.e., the affordability issue of people in the lowest income deciles. It is also a
highly regressive system whereby the poor, in effect, are displaced by middle-income households.
The approach also has a crowding-out effect on private finance, aside from the high transaction
cost that is a deterrent to the private sector’s entry into housing finance market.

32.      In a number of housing summit discussions, the different stakeholders recognized that
addressing the housing requirements of the lower-income households would require assistance
for middle- and lower-middle income households in accessing formal finance. At present, the
housing market fails to do this, as shown by the fact that many of these households also reside
in informal settlements or urban poor communities. As Monsod points out (2016), not all dwellers in
informal settlements are income poor. Nationwide, it is estimated that only 21.8 percent of
households living on lots without consent are income poor while 78.2 percent of households are
not poor. In the National Capital Region (NCR), only 6.5 percent of households in informal housing
without consent are income poor while 93.5 percent of households are not poor.

33.      Regarding governance, at the national and local levels — regional, provincial, city, and
municipality — there is lack or absence of coherent assignment of institutional roles and functions
in managing urbanization. Current institutional arrangement for planning and implementing off-
city resettlement is extremely inadequate, with no government agency taking responsibility for
providing basic services in NHA resettlement sites.21 The mixed outcome of government resettle-
ment sites under Oplan LIKAS is a testament to the dysfunctional institutional setup. Relocated
ISFs have encountered a myriad of problems, with those in off-city sites experiencing the most
serious ones. Poor coordination between DILG and NHA, on the one hand, and between host
LGUs, on the other, at the planning stage of the resettlement results in negative impacts on the
quality of life of resettled ISFs, such as lack of adequate and timely access to basic services.
Mechanisms for establishing inter-LGU urban development and planning systems are created on a
case-by-case basis, rendering uneven the effectiveness and efficiency of resource allocation and
causing heavy dependence on these resources, the availability of which is beyond the control of
the participating and affected entities.

34.      The Local Government Code and UDHA say local governments have the primary
responsibility for providing housing assistance and are specifically mandated to inventory lands
and identify sites for socialized housing. These are but a few of several local government
mandates that have not been implemented by many LGUs. Most LGUs are overburdened by
multiple responsibilities coupled with limited land and institutional capacity, which are made
more pronounced by their dependence on national government for logistics and finances. Hence,
LGU constituents, most of all the ISFs wanting to be engaged in their development process, find
difficulty accessing technical and logistical support from government. They too encounter
limitations in mobilizing their own resources and those of their partners, thus affecting their
efforts for effective claim-making.

35.     Nonetheless, when given technical support, LGUs can effectively carry out their planning
roles. This is demonstrated by initiatives such as the Citywide Community Upgrading Strategy
________________________________________________________________________________________
21
   NHA explains that the provision of services is not its mandate and that the subdivision developers that construct the
housing units are not compelled and do not have the resources to put up the infrastructure for basic services (e.g.,
water or power lines to connect the resettlement sites to the main lines of the water and power companies). The host
LGUs are not prepared and financially able to put up the needed infrastructure. This begs the question of how the
location of resettlement sites is determined in the first place, and why the cost of the installation of this needed
infrastructure is not included in the budget of site development. This cost can in fact be subsidized by the national
government, as this is a public good necessary for poverty alleviation.
14                                                           Closing the Gap in Affordable Housing in the Philippines


(Citywide) piloted in three LGUs in Metro Manila.22 Participation of civil society organizations and
organized communities in the Citywide process has also engendered increased social capital at
the local level that LGUs can harness to advance their development and housing initiatives.

36.      To make inroads in providing affordable housing, government would need to reframe its
understanding of the housing problem. There is need to rethink its role in housing finance, delink
housing social assistance from finance markets, and turn government’s attention to fundamental
supply-side and urban governance issues. Barriers that make land inaccessible for many for
housing need to be removed. If not systematically eliminated, these will continuously drive up the
price of land and housing and worsen the situation in poor communities. Government would need
to determine clearly its role in housing finance and regard housing for the very poor as part of its
social program. It would also need to improve its governance so all stakeholders could effectively
and efficiently perform their roles in delivering a shelter program. Government’s preferred
approach of prioritizing housing production and highly subsidizing its cost simply addresses the
symptoms and not the root causes of why the housing system fails. Monsod (2016) explains how
this inability is manifested by repeated episodes of insolvency experienced by government’s
housing finance corporations, high attrition rates at resettlement sites, and handling of public
subsidies. She further suggests that the manner by which these subsidies are used present a
challenge to the entry of private finance in the mortgage market.23


C.          Considerations

37.     A number of principles and considerations inform the recommendations contained in the
following sections. The first concerns the role of government in its avowed goal of increasing
“access to decent, affordable, and secure shelter.” This stems from the principle that housing is a
basic human right, and the state, being the main institution entrusted with the responsibility of
promoting the common good and rights of its people, has to make housing as broadly accessible
as possible.

38.     Housing or shelter provision needs to be embedded in the higher goal of inclusive and
sustainable urbanization. Housing as used here is not only about the physical structure but also
the development of thriving neighborhoods and communities where capital (social, physical, and
other forms) are created, making them conducive venues for people to be fully human and alive.
The unit of measure in an effective and efficient shelter program therefore should not be the
number of houses produced or the loans taken out but should be the number of communities
that have improved.

39.    The mandate of inclusive urbanization has to take numerous factors into consideration.
As Karaos (2016) explains: “The housing market in turn responds to spatial, demographic,
________________________________________________________________________________________
22
   A program spearheaded by the World Bank, the Citywide provides technical assistance to LGUs and builds multi-
stakeholder partnerships at the city level toward addressing the housing needs of poor communities. The pilot LGUs are
Muntinlupa City, Barangay 177 of Caloocan City, and District 6 of Quezon City.
23
     In her policy brief, Monsod (2016) discusses in depth the issue of government subsidies.
Policy Paper for the National Housing Summit                                                                  15


economic, and other signals. Urbanization policy and management, including zoning ordinances,
local development use plans and the placement (or absence) of mass transportation systems,
infrastructure and social services is one source of signals. Government creates incentives and
disincentives to encourage actions or behavior on the part of certain actors to achieve desired
development outcomes, such as making urbanization as inclusive as possible and increasing private
sector production of housing for low income sectors.”

40.     Through a package of interventions, the state needs to set the stage in order to attract
market players to engage actively and productively. Achieving inclusive urbanization requires it to
perform its role of ensuring that no social group is systematically excluded from the advantages
that result from progress, including access to secure shelter and employment. It cannot
singlehandedly provide for the shelter needs of the lowest-income households. Other sectors,
notably the communities, civic groups and NGOs, and the private sector, have important roles to
play in making affordable housing in adequate and safe neighborhoods.



IV. Key Directions for Policy Reforms in Closing the Gap in
    Affordable Housing in the Philippines

41.     The following recommendations are grouped according to the housing summit’s three
thematic areas: land and housing, housing finance, and participatory governance. As explained
above, inclusive urbanization and making shelter affordable for the disadvantaged provide an
overarching framework in these recommendations.


A.       Unlocking Land for Informal Settlers24

42.     Based on the analysis of satellite imagery provided by the European Space Agency, ISF
communities occupy about 3,000 hectares of land in Metro Manila. The estimates on the number
of ISFs in Metro Manila range from 163,094, based on the 2010 Census (Magtulis and Ramos
2013), to 250,895, based on the Family Income and Expenditure Survey of 2012 (Monsod 2016),
to 584,524, compiled from Metro Manila city reports (Gaurano 2011).

43.     While not having an accurate figure of ISFs is a problem altogether, the magnitude of the
ISF population poses significant challenges to LGUs and KSAs in their efforts to provide secure
land and housing for ISFs in Metro Manila, where land values are very high and where there are
competing demands for land, e.g., for vital public infrastructure, settlements, open spaces, and
support services to a continuously growing population. The challenges from climate change
likewise call for urgent solutions to improve substandard housing and/or resettle ISFs occupying
“danger zones.”

(LGI 2016).

44.     Identifying pathways to land mobilization

          So that options for the possible mobilization of land can be identified, it is important
to unpack the issues that constrain its availability. This would require distinguishing constraints
according to the type of land currently occupied by ISFs, recognizing that a different approach to
mobilization may apply to each. The first step is fundamental to assuring tenure security while
giving significance to the safety of the settlement to residents, i.e., whether these are on danger
(at-risk) or non-danger areas (see LGI 2016). Those which put people’s lives at risk may further be
classified into those for which technical solutions may be considered and those which require
preventive resettlement of the occupants. Certainly, finding technical solutions, and thus allowing
onsite upgrading, has to be tempered by the costs involved in development readjustments (see
Figure 3).

        For non-danger zones, the key questions pertain to whether the land is privately
owned or government property and, in either case, whether or not it is available for disposition.
For non-danger zones, the key questions pertain to whether the land is privately owned or
government property and, in either case, whether or not it is available for disposition. Those that

are not available for onsite development will entail in-city or near-city resettlement for the
occupants. Two paths are possible for lands that are offered for disposition: for commercially
viable areas (i.e., large tracks of land), the recommendation is to adopt mixed use development to
optimize use of prime land), recognize private sector efficiency in land development and
management and, at the same time, integrate informal settlers in the overall development of the
area through onsite redevelopment. Onsite redevelopment is also possible for small and non-
commercially viable areas through direct purchase, community mortgage, or other programs.

45.     Establishing a program on integrated land and ISF information system for Metro Manila

         The absence of an updated and complete inventory of ISFs in Metro Manila, their
locations, and the status of the lands they occupy — with the available information kept in
different formats and different information systems — hinder LGUs and KSAs in identifying lands
that could potentially be used for socialized housing and other public purposes. It also affects
their ability to identify ownership, remove uncertainties related to spurious counterclaims, land
syndicates, and fake titles, and facilitate the discharge of administrative remedies to acquire
lands through forfeiture of delinquent properties and expropriation of idle lands. Compounding
this issue is the lack of information-sharing mechanism among land-related agencies, which has
slowed down the land acquisition process and has substantially increased transaction costs. At the
root of this issue is the complex land administration and management system, which breed
overlaps in the discharge of land administration and management functions by national
government agencies.

         It is recommended that the Office of the President issue an Executive Order to
establish a program on integrated land and ISF information system for Metro Manila be issued.
The intent is to establish a program management office with dedicated funding, resources, and
timetable to:

        o   Conduct an inventory of existing tenure status of ISFs and prepare citywide land
            tenure improvement plans;
        o   Identify available land for ISF in-city resettlement or onsite development;
        o   Establish information system link between government agencies and LGUs;
        o   Make land information more accessible to all users; and
        o   Institutionalize land data sharing between and among LGUs and NGAs, including the
            implementing rules and regulations (IRR) of Section 209 of LGC.

          In essence, the program will be dedicated to addressing problems of tenure
formalization of Metro Manila’s urban poor, consistent with the intent of UDHA. It will help
dissect the issues and needs, for example, of the following: (1) those who have acquired land but
need support to complete onsite development; (2) those who are still seeking the owners of the
private property they occupy; (3) those whose owners have agreed to sell but where land records
have issues that prevent the purchase from taking place; and (4) those who are residing in
government proclaimed lands but are having problems with the disposition of these properties. It
18                                                  Closing the Gap in Affordable Housing in the Philippines


is fundamental for proper planning and management of response to understand and take stock of
the needed information so that a well-coordinated and appropriate shelter program can be
developed, and corresponding budgets and resources can be programmed. Without these, the
current response has been to treat all ISFs as having the same issues, thus running the risk of
“one-size-fits-all” solutions. National land agencies and LGUs would have to progressively share
their records for this program to be successful.

         HUDCC shall be the lead agency for the implementation of this program, through a
supplemental budget coupled with institutional strengthening to carry out this program over the
long term.

46.      Completing an inventory of idle government lands that could be made available for ISF
in-city resettlement

          UDHA identifies idle government lands as priority for land acquisition for resettlement
of ISFs, but, as noted above, information is not updated and incomplete. It is therefore important
to come up with a complete inventory of idle government land to fully exhaust land mobilization
for ISFs. The recommendation is for the Office of the President to issue a Memorandum Circular
(MC) mandating an inventory of idle government lands.25 The Circular will have provisions that will:

        o    Mandate government agencies to submit an inventory of their idle lands and provide
             information as to the purpose for which it has been reserved and its status;
        o    Instruct LGUs through DILG to conduct an inventory of government-owned and
             private idle lands appropriate for use as settlement in their respective territories;
        o    Require DENR to make available, at no cost, its land records, including approved
             subdivision plans and cadastral maps to DILG and LGUs; and
        o    Instruct LRA to make available, at no cost, maps, approved subdivision surveys, title
             information, and abstracts of registry to DILG and LGUs.

47.    Resolving issues in the implementation of a large number of problematic proclamations,
which cannot proceed with disposition to bona fide ISFs

         Proclamations of government lands have remained problematic for a long time,
owing to the mandated bureaucratic process and weak due diligence in land investigation work
before issuance. This constrains the availability of government lands for ISFs. There seems to be
no easy resolution in sight, in the absence of a concerted effort to exhaust all means possible in
addressing the problems through the joint action of all agencies concerned.

         The recommendation is for the Office of the President to issue an Executive Order
establishing a Presidential Interagency Task Force (including the Metro Manila Development

  This Memorandum Circular was signed by the Executive Secretary on 1 December 2015, but has yet to be fully
implemented.

Authority and cities concerned) to resolve issues in the implementation of proclaimed lands. The
Task Force shall:

        o   Review proclamations that have implementation issues, were revoked, amended, or
            held in abeyance;
        o   Resolve and decide on all issues affecting implementation of proclamations that
            cannot be resolved at the operational level;
        o   Call on other government agencies and institutions to support the implementation of
            proclamations;
        o   Serve as oversight body in the implementation of proclamations/projects;
        o   Review, assess, and recommend options to improve the systems and procedures in
            the pre- and post-proclamation processes of affected agencies;
        o   Investigate and recommend to the President the filing of appropriate cases pertaining
            to causes of delay or non-implementation of proclamations/projects; and
        o   Identify and recommend areas for the issuance of Presidential Proclamations.

48.      Establishing clear guidelines on administration and disposition of lands proclaimed
for ISFs.

          There are no clear guidelines on the administration and disposition of lands proclaimed
for ISF. This has resulted in wide variability in the instruments for disposition, absence of
timetable to dispose of the property, and reluctance of the affected agency to release the land to
NHA or any designated agency identified to administer the land. The impact is that many
proclamations cannot be implemented or are left incomplete.
        It is recommended that an Executive Order be issued to standardize guidelines for
administration and disposition of proclaimed lands for ISFs that shall:

        o   Clarify the basis for valuation;
        o   Address proclaimed lands without titles;
        o   Ensure smooth conveyance of titles to designated administrator of property;
        o   Address concerns about inclusion (or exclusion) of ISFs not currently occupying the
            land which is the subject of a new proclamation; and
        o   Make provisions for budget from the Department of Budget Management for every
            proclamation.

49.     Streamlining the process for issuance of special patents. The very long process of
proclamations of government lands and the eventual issuance of Special Patents over them have
affected the pace of housing and tenure provision. Before the enactment of the Residential Free
Patent Law (RA 10023), it could take 20 years or more to have a proclamation signed by the
President, and almost as much time to issue the Special Patent. The specific provision of RA 10023
20                                              Closing the Gap in Affordable Housing in the Philippines


could be used to streamline the process for titling government lands if the IRR can be issued. A
draft IRR for Special Patent was prepared during the housing summit. The recommendation is for
DENR to review and issue the IRR.

50.      Improving access by ISFs to compliance housing projects and mechanisms in accordance
with Section 18 of UDHA. LGUs and ISF do not have full access to information on the nature,
location, and type of compliance project by subdivision developers. There is no mechanism that
matches ISF housing and financial needs that could be responded to by the compliance projects.
The proposed solution is to develop a Joint DILG-HLURB Memorandum Circular specifying
procedures that will ensure sharing of information on compliance projects with ISFs and LGUs.
This could be done in the process of securing development permits from LGUs and in the
evaluation of compliance projects by HLURB. Considering that there are very few subdivision
projects in Metro Manila and other highly urbanized cities, the recommendation is to support the
legislative bill or draft EO that will expand application of balanced housing to condominiums.

51.     Studying the feasibility of exempting foreclosed properties used for socialized housing
from capital gains tax payment. Many LGUs are already undertaking administrative recourse in
case of default in payment of real property taxes. Most private property owners in default own
properties that have been occupied by ISFs for many years, and may no longer have the incentives
to keep the land. LGUs are unable to mobilize these lands because of the amounts of capital gains
tax (CGT) that need to be paid to the Bureau of Internal Revenue before the properties can be
transferred. LGUs are thus unable to use the lands for public purposes, including award to ISFs. It
is recommended that DILG and the Department of Finance study the feasibility of exempting
these properties from the CGT if the purpose is for ISF housing.

52.     Addressing issues relating to Batas Pambansa 220

            The standards embodied in BP 220 are more applicable to private sector-initiated
housing projects that target the middle- to low-middle income formal market rather than the
specific circumstances of ISF. In particular, BP 220 and its IRR are limited mainly to development
of new sites (off-site) and regulatory process designed for private sector developers and
government. Moreover, they do not easily accommodate other emergent housing solutions and
approaches, and do not encompass planning guidelines to encourage development of flexible and
affordable solutions for and by ISFs. They are also not appropriate to community-initiated/self-
help projects. This explains why ISF communities are having difficulties complying with the
standards, and why LGUs are also having a hard time enforcing these planning requirements.

          It is recommended that planning and building guidelines and standards be prepared
through an addendum to or a separate IRR for BP 220 that will:

        o   Strengthen and provide a more holistic approach to planning and implementation of
            shelter and settlements development for ISF communities;
        o   Encourage involvement of a broader range of stakeholders, especially ISF communities, in
            settlement and shelter planning and implementation;
Policy Paper for the National Housing Summit                                                           21


            o   Make guidelines and standards more flexible and appropriate, in order to encourage
                generation of affordable housing solutions and technologies adaptive to current
                housing situation and existing programs;
            o   Specifically, (a) guide the planning and implementation of onsite development projects,
                (b) allow for incremental development of sites and housing construction, (c) promote
                and encourage alternative technologies, (d) allow for conditional non-spatial compensatory
                measures in site/subdivision planning especially for onsite development, (e) consider
                disaster resilience and adaptation in planning and design, and (f) provide parameters
                that would aid ISF communities and other implementers in selecting appropriate and
                affordable housing solutions; and
            o   Establish coverage and timeframe of the guidelines, especially for onsite
                development, so as not to encourage further illegal occupancy; hence, the need for a
                database and mapping of all existing ISF-occupied areas.

         Relatedly, it is also recommended that a regulatory audit of BP 220 and other existing
building and subdivision codes and planning guidelines be undertaken. This audit should focus on
the impact of these laws and other legal framework on transaction costs for ISFs and private
developers, and thus the unit cost of land and housing and the implication on owning or rental
and access to formal markets.

53.      Providing clarity and consensus on the definition of danger zones and coming up with
corresponding policies and guidelines. There has been clamor, particularly from ISFs and civil
society, for government to clarify the definition of danger zones and to issue corresponding
policies and guidelines. The Joint DENR-DILG-DOST-DPWH Memorandum Circular 2004-01, titled
“Adoption of Hazard Zone Classification in Areas Affected by Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), and
Providing Guidelines for Activities Therein,” could be used as a starting point for discussion on an
area’s acceptability from social, technical, and economic perspectives. It could also serve as a
guide, should it be immediately necessary to relocate ISFs in identified danger zones.


B.          Addressing Housing Finance Challenges26

54.     A functioning housing market is one in which a household’s need for quality housing can
be made a reality. This requires the following: financing, property market information, improved
mortgage systems, and mechanisms for dealing with credit risks and transaction costs. In the
absence of these, on the one hand, lenders will hesitate to offer their services to the market,
more so to the riskier or poorer segments. Investors, on the other hand, will confront the risks of
tying their funds for long periods and of inherent uncertainties. If the markets do not offer
reasonable protections against these risks, e.g., insurance, investors will not go into new
developments, maintenance, or upgrading, leading to fewer supply, excess demand, and higher
market rates. To correct market failures, government has the option to introduce regulations,

     This section draws heavily from Monsod 2016.
22                                               Closing the Gap in Affordable Housing in the Philippines


taxes and subsidies, and the direct provision of goods and services. Aside from economic reasons,
government’s intervention can also be motivated by social considerations such as redistribution
and ensuring that minimum housing standards are followed.

55.     In the case of the Philippines, redistribution and efficiency or the expansion of formal
market are not significantly achieved. Housing acquisition in the country is largely self-financed
either through savings or incremental construction or directly financed, i.e., borrowings from
family, friends, and associations. The required conditions for an efficient primary mortgage
market such as credit bureau information and professional appraisal services are inadequate if
not lacking. “Dependence on direct finance results in cities that are built as they are financed, with
a considerable and visible proportion of self-construction and slum proliferation” (Lea 2009,
quoted in Monsod 2016).

56.      As cited in Monsod’s paper (2016) “The first priority, and a prerequisite to the creation of
a more competitive and effective housing finance system, is the elimination of the (often hidden)
subsidies to state housing finance institutions or, alternatively, to provide access to these
subsidies by all qualified actors in the sector or reorient these subsidies to leverage private sector
participation (Hoek-Smit 2009:433).” It is with this lens that the government’s housing finance
institutions have to be assessed. How have HGC, NHMFC, and Pag-IBIG Fund enabled the mortgage
market to perform better?

57.      As earlier stated, addressing the housing requirements of the lower-income households
would require that middle and lower-middle income households be assisted in accessing formal
finance. This should not be limited to economic or financial interventions, such as reducing
interest rates, but could include programs to encourage savings as well as improve employment
and safeguards against loss of earnings. Interventions in making communities safe and disaster
resilient lessen the risks to households.

58.     Households that will not be served by the mortgage market have to be provided with a
different program that falls under the welfare policy of the government. The best option is to
support ways to secure property rights and for public investments to improve the provision of
services and infrastructures. International experiences have shown that regulatory reforms
generate better results than increased budget for housing production. Including the budget for
housing social assistance in government’s welfare program and making it transparent constitutes
a twin approach to reforming housing finance.

59.      Moreover, house ownership is a major investment decision and not all households are
ready to invest and will opt for rental housing. The complexity of rental housing requires more
information to design context-specific programs and policies, particularly for those in the low-
income segments. What may be the better option is the general improvement of urban
infrastructures and community services to improve housing quality and the quality of life of low-
income renters. These may include complying with basic sanitation and safety codes and access to
microfinance to enable landlords to comply.
Policy Paper for the National Housing Summit                                                      23


60.     A transformed policy on housing begins from a rethinking of the government’s role in
housing finance. This necessarily starts from an appropriate diagnosis and change of mindset from
simply engaging in housing production and providing subsidies.

61.     Three major groups of long-term and immediate actions are being recommended:
(1) enabling the down-market expansion of formal housing finance to middle-income and lower-
middle income groups, (2) reaching the lowest income groups, and (3) increasing investment in
and supply of rental housing (Monsod 2016, Ballesteros 2016).

B.1.    Expanding the reach of mortgage and non-mortgage finance (to and within middle-
        income and lower-middle income households)

62.      Many households in the 4th to 8th deciles have incomes that could be enough to access
modest formal markets (rental or otherwise). Yet they remain in substandard or informal housing
in large part because of the unavailability of appropriate finance products and services. Expanding
housing finance systems down-market will require system subsidies, or interventions to make the
housing finance system more efficient. It will likewise entail subsidies that address specific
constraints of households at the margin in accessing credit to become formal homeowners.

63.      Priority system subsidies would focus on (1) removing barriers to entry, innovation, and
price competition; (2) reducing credit risk or collateral risk for mortgage lending, (3) reducing the
high transaction costs for loan origination and servicing, and (4) supporting efforts to expand the
take-up and reach of market-based housing microfinance. Priority subsidies for households at the
margin would depend on the specific binding constraint (i.e., saving, employment and earnings
volatility, housing or neighborhood risk). The immediate first steps are the following:

          Issuance of an Executive Order mandating an independent review of the operations
and privileges of subsidized state-sponsored housing finance institutions — Pag-IBIG Fund, HGC,
NHMFC, SHFC — as well as NHA, measuring both benefits and explicit and implicit costs of govern-
ment’s objectives and involvement in housing finance markets and housing production. The last
such review was in 1997. The review should take into account links with the financial sector
including contractual saving sector, and will require the leadership of the Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas (BSP), Department of Finance (DOF), and Governance Commission for Government-
Owned or Controlled Corporations. This is particularly opportune in the case of NHA, whose
charter ends in 10 years.

          In tandem with the above, parallel executive action to assess options for an
alternative use of public funds, in particular to the array of possible system subsidies that may
mitigate the various risks attendant to lending down-market. Among the options are providing
short-term support for alternative types of lenders (housing microfinance institutions) through
liquidity funding or capacity building; and subsidies to borrower education and to “public good”
data and research on property and credit markets (e.g., comprehensive property information),
research in standardization of mortgage procedures, new credit instruments, and house price
trends. Another option is support for the development of improved/standardized underwriting
24                                                     Closing the Gap in Affordable Housing in the Philippines


and user friendly servicing systems. Alternative use could also be complementary household
subsidies to those at the margin of finance markets such as direct and transparent grants to alleviate
down payment, title and closing costs, mortgage insurance, home-maintenance education, or
matching grants from central government agencies to local government units to incentivize the
installation and/or upgrading of infrastructure and services. If private lending to marginal
neighborhoods is to be expanded government action on neighborhood investment planning/plans
is critical.

         As such a review is being undertaken, it is recommended that new subsidy invest-
ments (such as in high density housing and relocation projects of NHA) as well as equity
investments (in NHMFC, HGC, and NHA) are carefully disbursed to avoid further lock-in to the
status quo. Legislation is needed to rationalize budget allocation for housing, taking into
consideration the recommendations on expanding the mortgage system and providing for
transparent and on-budget allocation for an improved shelter program.27

B.2.     Reaching the lowest income groups and household social assistance

64.     It is likely that government has to play a more direct role in increasing general housing
consumption for the segment since incomes are too low to access formal sector housing or
financing, even for incremental improvements. This is best served by support for securing
property rights and public investments to improve access to urban services and infrastructure
(Hoek-Smit 2009 cited in Monsod 2016).

65.     In the immediate term therefore, addressing real side constraints is the necessary first
step and priority action by local and national government. Correcting real side distortions would
also encourage private construction and development into the segment.

66.      Additionally, household social assistance is almost always necessary. For purposes of GAA
(Government Appropriations Act) sourcing, the components below can be considered and costed
in lieu of the current non-market finance/production programs (and vis-à-vis other non-housing
social assistance programs), with the exception of CMP. These are:

         o    Grants in the form of serviced land with or without a core house, which households
              can then complete incrementally. If already onsite, active support in securing property
              rights and upgrading, both within and around the community, e.g., matching grants
              from central government agencies to local government units for upgrading.
         o    Home improvement grants, including for rental extensions of the house. These grants
              can reach households that do not qualify for loans or microcredit.
         o    Support for the establishment of community-based support systems to acquire
              building materials in bulk and provide quality control.

  Any new comprehensive shelter financing, similar to RA 7885 or CISFA, has to be in harmony with the requirements
of the present policy reform recommendations.
Policy Paper for the National Housing Summit                                                       25


            o    Support for community savings and counseling programs that would complement
                 efforts to expand the reach of housing microfinance.

B.3.        Growing the rental housing market

67.       Attracting more investors and increasing the supply of formal rental units requires in the
first instance a removal of rent control and any unduly restrictive and non-tenure neutral regulation,
taxes, or subsidies which discourage rental investment in favor of ownership investment (Hoek-
Smit 2009 cited in Monsod 2016).

68.     More information may be needed to design context-specific interventions to incentivize
investments into different segments, particularly investment into the low-income rental segment,
and to improve the tenure security and quality of housing of low-income renters. Encouraging
local governments to design and test approaches would be key.

69.     In the meantime a rental policy for the low income sector may be “best focused on the
general improvement of urban infrastructure and neighborhood services, which would improve
the quality of life of low-income renters more than almost any other government measures”
(Hoek-Smit 2009:442 quoted in Monsod 2016). Housing quality and the quality of life would also
be improved by better compliance with basic sanitation and safety codes. Access to microfinance
could assist landlords improve sanitation and other low-income rental housing services.


C.          Institutionalizing Participatory Governance 28

70.     Responding effectively to the challenges of inclusive urbanization and providing affordable
housing to the disadvantaged demands a twofold major shift in the governance of the housing
sector. One focuses on refining the mandates of key shelter agencies and LGUs, with the latter
exercising fully its roles and responsibilities as prescribed in UDHA and the Local Government
Code. The other concerns the need for an authoritative body that will monitor, support, and serve
as enabler in local development planning and inclusive urbanization.

71.      The specific recommendations concerning the transformation of the key shelter agencies
are discussed in the section on housing finance, above, and more fully in Monsod (2016). With
regard to LGUs and the need for boosting institutional support, the long-term recommendations
are, as follows (Karaos 2016):

         Through executive directives (EOs and Department Orders), institutionalize and
strengthen the urban development role of DILG so that its enabling role vis-à-vis city and
municipal governments is made effective. A concrete step could be the creation of a bureau
within DILG for assisting and monitoring LGUs in the performance of their urban development
functions and mandates.

________________________________________________________________________________________
28
     This section is mostly from Karaos 2016.
26                                                      Closing the Gap in Affordable Housing in the Philippines


          The 16th Congress attempted to legislate the creation of a Department of Housing and
Urban Development (DHUD). There is now an opportunity to determine the most appropriate
institutional setup for overseeing and guiding urbanization processes, of which housing is only
one element, and enabling LGUs, especially provinces, to perform their mandated roles. The four
options presented by Karaos (2016: 4) could provide a starting point for studying and deciding on
the most suitable institutional setup.

         In her policy brief, Monsod (2016) offers another option, emphasizing that “monitoring
and supporting inclusive urbanization is by nature a coordinative task [and thus] it is not, and
should not be, the work of any one department. Rather than a department of housing and urban
development (which has long been proposed), a more feasible and, perhaps, efficient strategy to
redirect policy and reenergize the sector would be to reconfigure HUDCC to include DILG and
NEDA as co-chairs, as well as make HUDCC a co-chair of the RDCom [Regional Development
Committee], expanding focus of the latter to explicitly include urbanization (i.e., Regional
Development and Urbanization).”29

         Through a legislative act, create or designate a state agency that will provide
community development assistance to the most needy in urban poor communities and capacity
building assistance to community organizations to enable them to engage effectively with LGUs in
local shelter and development planning and budgeting and to access housing subsidies and other
resources from both public and private institutions to meet their shelter needs. This can be done
by creating a CODI (Thailand’s Community Organizations Development Institute)-like institution or
creating a special unit and program within the Department of Social Welfare and Development
(DSWD) focused on community development for accessing shelter and basic services.

72.     LGUs’ roles and responsibilities in shelter provision are expansive – involving land
inventory, mobilization, and disposition; land use and investment planning; issuance of permits
and regulations; mobilization of resources and financing; provision of basic services; enforcement
and monitoring; and registration of beneficiaries and mobilization of community participation. For
the immediate or short-term, and so that pressing issues and problems are resolved, the following
are being recommended:

         Provide technical assistance to DILG to study the best way to provide the logistical
and other support to LGUs to enable them to carry out their mandated task of land inventory,
registration of social housing beneficiaries, and identification of social housing sites.

         Promote and expand a citywide community upgrading strategy among LGUs,
including to those that serve as host LGUs of resettled ISFs, to enable these LGUs to make shelter
plans through a participatory process, and to systematically program their shelter interventions,
tapping onto the shelter programs of the key shelter agencies.

________________________________________________________________________________________
29
   A reconfiguration would also involve assigning to HUDCC control over the design and allocation of state subsidies
for housing production, finance, and urban development, including how these subsidies could be channeled, i.e., by
different providers — private, NGO, NGAs, and LGU — of which the housing corporations would only be one option.
Policy Paper for the National Housing Summit                                                   27


          Issue an EO to expand the pilot project for undertaking the ground validation of the
inventory of land and ISF undertaken in Quezon City to the remaining 16 LGUs of Metro Manila.
This expansion of the pilot can also be coordinated by DILG and the resulting database will be
kept by DILG and shared with HUDCC. A mechanism for updating the database must be provided
as well as the needed resources which can come from budgetary appropriations.

         DILG to develop and implement a pilot program to test different ways of incentivizing
LGUs to institutionalize participatory local shelter planning in the context of development and
physical plans of the regions/provinces where they are located. This pilot program must include
LGUs outside Metro Manila. One type of incentive could be funds for local development projects
shown to be part of or consistent with provincial/regional development and physical plans. There
needs to be a mechanism for checking the coherence of the components of the plan and LGUs will
be rewarded for outcomes.

          Develop the capacity within DILG to guide and assist LGUs in developing urban
development plans that would deal with the challenges of urbanization, including the provision of
infrastructure and transport, basic, and social services including shelter.

          Review the roles, functions, and mandates of state-owned shelter institutions vis-à-vis
the evolution of the banking sector and microfinance institutions with a view to fine-tuning their
housing finance programs and interventions so that they complement and not displace the private
sector in providing needed financing for housing.

         Provide technical assistance to HUDCC toward strengthening its role in monitoring
urbanization trends and impacts and developing an urbanization framework that would guide
local and regional development plans so that these will be proactive and responsive to people’s
needs in housing, transport, infrastructure, and services.

         Create a mechanism for providing capacity building and technical assistance to ISF
community organizations for shelter planning, savings, financial management, and accessing
government housing programs. The mechanism can be agency-based (e.g., integrated into agency
programs like CMP and HDH programs of SHFC). Study how best to institutionalize such a
mechanism (e.g., unbundle the housing finance and capacity building functions of SHFC and
strengthen its community development and capacity building roles or create a unit within DSWD
to engage in community development specifically for shelter provision).

              UPHOLDING THE RIGHT TO ADEQUATE, DECENT
                     AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING

We, leaders and representatives of various agencies and institutions from the government, civil
society, people’s organizations, business groups and international development organizations, call
for the adoption of a viable housing policy agenda to address the country’s problems on housing
and urban development.

We are bound by our conviction that government should continue to uphold the people’s right to
adequate, decent and affordable shelter. We call on the government to ensure that in-city
housing and people’s planning process is the preferred option on shelter delivery and to recognize
that enabling a wide range of options for decent and affordable housing should be a priority
agenda in the State’s goal to achieve inclusive growth.

We are united by the participatory process of the National Housing and Urban Development
Summit which provided a venue for all stakeholders to extensively discuss present issues on
housing and to come up with solutions agreed upon by all stakeholders.

We therefore call on the government and other stakeholders to address the issues affecting
housing and urban development and adopt the policy proposals of the National Housing and
Urban Development Summit.

SHFC-TA                Phase 1 of the TA provided just-in-time technical advice in the review
                        of SHFC’s existing portfolio, procedures, and processes with the aim of
                        addressing current bottlenecks in implementing and scaling up the
SHFC/WB                 delivery of quality housing programs under affordable and sustainable
                        housing finance schemes for the underprivileged sectors. Phase 1 of the
                        TA also reviewed the CMP (Community Mortgage Program) Portfolio
                        particularly on how different factors have affected the performance of
                        the community repayments (collection efficiency ratio), project type
                        (onsite or off-site), community size, type of CMP mobilizer, equity
                        contribution, substitution and individualization, and economic cycle of
                        the Philippines. Key recommendations of Phase 1 analytical work was
                        the development of the High Density Housing (HDH) Program for in-
                        city/near-city housing; and demonstrating the citywide development
                        approach to shelter provision in LGUs in Metro Manila.
                       Phase 2 of the TA supported SHFC in the establishment of the HDH
                        program and building the capacity of the agency and its stakeholders to
                        operationalize this new program. It also supported SHFC in championing
                        and piloting the citywide development approach to shelter provision
                        through learning exchange events with SHFC program partners that
                        included LGUs, civil society organizations, and relevant national
                        government agencies.

 Citywide Community        This TA aimed to pilot a citywide planning process to help reduce
 Upgrading Strategy         informality in Metro Manila in three flood-prone cities in Metro Manila:
                            Caloocan City (Barangay 177), Muntinlupa City, and Quezon City
                            (Congressional District 6).
 World Bank, SHFC          Key Outputs: (1) spatial mapping and socioeconomic profiling of all
 and the LGUs of            informal communities in the city (or district/village) overlaid with hazard
 Barangay 177               maps; (2) citywide shelter development plan for each LGU based on
 (Caloocan City),           supply (land, subsidy, other financing) and demand-side (shelter needs,
 District 6 of              affordability, etc.) analyses and prioritization of communities based on
 Quezon City, and           a clear set of criteria; (3) prioritization of community-driven slum
 Muntinlupa City            upgrading projects in each pilot city; (4) establishment or revitalization
                            of a platform for government-civil society-private sector collaboration;
                            and (5) capacity-building activities for key stakeholders.
                           Key Output: Citywide Community Upgrading Strategy Stock-taking Report
 NHA-TA                    Phase 1 of this TA was to provide advisory assistance to NHA in reviewing
                            its resettlement program cycle with an end view of introducing good
                            practices and enhancements to make the program aligned with
 NHA/World Bank             international standards. It also reviewed estate management processes,
                            practices, and arrangements directed toward NHA experiences as well as
                            private and other public initiatives. Phase 1 involved a learning-by-doing
                            cycle to assist NHA in enhancing its organizational capability to sustain
                            the innovations and changes introduced as a result of the analytical
                            work. The TA outputs paved the way for NHA to review and improve its
                            standards and manuals for site selection, site suitability analysis, and site
                            planning; and develop an Estate Management Manual.
                           Phase 2 of the TA sought to inform the design of the Metro Manila Flood
                            Management Project - Phase 1 by providing input to the preparation of
                            its social safeguards instruments; help NHA strengthen its capacity to
                            plan and implement resettlement programs; and determine its
                            appropriate role in livelihood interventions vis-à-vis other players. The
                            TA reviewed the Oplan Likas program (also known as PHP 50 billion ISF
                            program) to determine the level of compliance and consistency with
                            the World Bank’s Operational Policy on Involuntary Resettlement; and
                            recommend improvements for government’s future resettlement
                            programs as well as possible corrective actions for past resettlement
                            activities. The TA also conducted a livelihood study to look into optimal
                            livelihood interventions for ISFs who were resettled off-city and in-city
                            considering their differing constraints. Finally, it carried out capacity-
                            building activities for NHA managers and personnel in resettlement
                            planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation; and estate
                            management to help improve the performance and outcome of its large-
                            scale resettlement programs.
                           Key Outputs: Final NHA-TA Report, Estate Management Manual, Revised
                            Manuals for Site Selection, Site Suitability Analysis and Site Planning;

                         Options for Implementation Arrangements for Livelihood Interventions)
Land Constraints       This analytical work sought to generate a better understanding of land-
Study                   related constraints that hamper the implementation of viable and
                        sustainable housing solutions. The study looked into three key areas:
                        (1) land administration and management, (2) land mobilization, land
World Bank              tenure, and housing rights, and (3) land use and planning regulations.
                       The study identified and provided recommendations on the following
                        constraints: (1) limited access to up-to-date and reliable information on
                        land and ISFs, (2) planning rules and regulations issues particularly relating
                        to Batas Pambansa 220; (3) presence of a large number of problematic
                        proclamations; (4) absence of clear guidelines on administration and
                        disposition of lands proclaimed for ISFs; (5) incomplete inventory of idle
                        government lands that could be made available for ISF in-city resettle-
                        ment; (6) lengthy process for issuance of special patents; (7) limited
                        access by ISFs to compliance housing projects and mechanisms per
                        Section 18 of UDHA; (8) high capital gains tax imposed on foreclosed
                        properties prevent LGUs from using these lands for ISFs. These issues and
                        resulting recommendations were unraveled and confirmed during the
                        conduct of the National Summit on Housing and Urban Development.
                       Key Output: “Understanding Land and Related Constraints in the
                        Provision of Affordable Housing in Metro Manila”
Rental Housing         Rapid assessment of the supply of and demand for low cost rental housing
Voucher Scheme          to better understand the rental arrangements, potential supply in the
                        market as well as the behavior and needs of households in informal
                        settlements. A parallel study and development of an Operational Manual
World Bank              on the implementation of a rental housing voucher scheme for Typhoon
                        Yolanda-affected areas was helpful in the design of a transitional rental
                        support program under the Metro Manila Flood Control Project.
                       Key Output: Survey of Low Cost Rental Housing Supply and Rental
                        Demand of Low Income Households
Metro Manila Urban     Primary data collection from 3,000 ISFs in Quezon City, Muntinlupa City,
Slum Study              and Caloocan City, to better understand their socioeconomic welfare.

Challenge
         In the face of growing urbanization in the Philippines, there has been, in the last decade,
corresponding surge in the population of informal settler families (ISFs) in key cities, particularly
those in Metro Manila. The attraction of primary urban centers, driven by excess and highly
skilled workforce and coupled with lack of employment and opportunities in the rural areas, has
contributed to the changing demographics. The growth of ISFs in the period 2007-2011 reached
7.3 percent, estimated to reach about 584,425 households, representing a quarter of the Metro
Manila population. Based on analysis of satellite maps from the European Space Agency, ISF
communities occupy 3,000 hectares of land in Metro Manila.

        This situation poses significant challenges for local governments units (LGUs) and key shelter
agencies (KSAs) in efforts to provide secure land and housing tenure for ISFs in cities where land
values are very high and demand for land is at a critical level to support vital public infrastructure,
settlements, open spaces, and social services for a continuously growing population. The challenges
posed by climate change likewise call for urgent solutions to house and/or resettle ISFs occupying
danger zones, while at the same time narrowing the gap between supply and demand for land
and housing for the urban poor or disadvantaged segments of the Metro Manila population.

        In the context of other issues affecting homelessness and poor servicing of ISF communities
in major urban areas, limited availability of affordable land and housing units is one of the key
factors alongside other equally important concerns (see Figure 1):

             Inadequate housing delivery mechanisms;
             Weak, uncontrolled, and lack of serious planning; and
             Unmanaged rural to urban migration.

Issues
       There have been combined efforts by government, community associations, nongovern-
ment organization (NGOs), and development partners to formalize the ISF population. However,
the common bottleneck has been finding suitable land for onsite development, or near-city
development. The identified constraints are as follows (see Figure 2):

       Inadequate access to land information. This impinges on the ability of LGUs and KSAs to
undertake proper land inventory; identify ownership; remove the uncertainties related to spurious
counter claims, syndicates and fake titles; and discharge administrative remedies to acquire lands
through forfeiture of delinquent properties and expropriation of idle lands. At the root of this
Addressing Constraints to Mobilization of Land and Housing                                                                              89

issue is the complex land administration system which breeds overlaps in the discharge of land
administration and management functions by national government agencies.  

          Limited land availability, limited land tenure options and housing rights. There is an
artificial scarcity of lands in Metro Manila as manifested by plenty of idle lands and high incidence
of land speculation, thereby jacking up land prices to exorbitant levels. More aggressive property
development has also pushed up land values, thereby making it difficult for ISFs occupying
privately owned properties to negotiate. LGUs are not engaged in land banking, thereby making it
more expensive to acquire land for public purposes. Finally, land disposition has focused too
much on provision of freehold – alternative tenure options have not been explored to provide
secure land tenure to ISFs. Proclamations of government lands under the current procedure is
taking decades, due to the mandated bureaucratic process and weak due diligence in land
investigation work before issuance. This constrains the availability of government lands for ISFs.

         Absence/weak implementation of planning guidelines and standards. Existing standards
for building design and settlements planning, as contained in Batas Pambansa (BP) 220, are seen

as not very relevant to onsite development and restrict the production of housing units. Standards
have made it expensive to comply, thus further increasing the unaffordability of socialized housing
units. Many LGUs have not updated their comprehensive land use plans (CLUPs), thus rendering
their zoning ordinances and land use regulations not attuned to the current situation of the city,
particularly the need for better allocation of land for ISFs. In cases where CLUPs exist, the
mandatory provision to incorporate city shelter plans for ISFs have not been complied with, thus
development of ISF settlements remain isolated from the rest of the urban landscape. In some
instances, communities complain that even when successful in buying the property from the
private owner, they face difficulty in securing clearances from the City Planning and Development
Office (CPDO) due to rigid interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance.

         The above factors combined create situations where ISFs, comprising one-fourth of Metro
Manila’s population, are continuously not secure against eviction and exposed to risks and
flooding events. The inability to catch up with providing secure land and housing tenure brings
about increasing informality in urban areas, urban blight, and low property values in the surround-
ing areas. These result in unsustainable cities in the country’s metropolis, with about 3 million
people denied of their right to own property and access to basic urban services. These produce
dualistic cities, which characterize of many Asian countries.


Analytical Framework
        In compartmentalizing the above issues, it became important to distinguish the constraints
according to the type of land occupied by ISFs, recognizing that each offers a different pathway to
mobilize land.

         Essentially, there will be different approaches to formalization of ISFs in danger zones
compared to those occupying non-danger zones. Constraint to onsite development would be
availability of affordable technical solutions to adapt the existing structures so that the physical
challenges (flood prone, located in geohazard areas, soil compaction, subsidence, etc.) could be
addressed. In the absence of these, there is no option but to find land that is near-site. For ISFs
living in areas that are considered as outside danger areas, the key limitation would be the
availability of the land currently occupied. This is a function of the willingness of the owner to sell
the property in the case of private lands; the availability of land through Proclamation in the case
of government lands; and the eligibility of land under Free Patent residential, in the case of
untitled alienable and disposable public lands. In the absence of these possibilities, the option is
to resettle near-site (Figure 3).

        Government lands can be made available to ISFs once proclaimed by the President for the
purpose, and then eventual disposition of these lands by the National Housing Authority (NHA)
through Special Patents. Another option would be for the government agency to secure a Special
Patent over the lands that it administers, and then eventual transfer to NHA for subsequent
disposition through any of its housing programs (Figure 4). LGUs can also dispose their lands
through various modes.
Addressing Constraints to Mobilization of Land and Housing                                                  91

         There are various ways for privately owned properties to be made available for ISFs. The
first option is to check with the Assessor’s Office if the owner is in default in real property tax
(RPT) payments and whether the property is due for auction. The community association can
participate in the auction proceedings and have the property transferred in its name once
successful. If the property is not delinquent, nor is it a candidate for auction, the other option is
to explore whether the owner is willing to sell the property. This depends too much on the
availability of information on the owner, the status of the property, and success of negotiations.
Once this process is completed, the community association can access loans from the Social
Housing Finance Corporation (SHFC) through its Community Mortgage Program (CMP) or High
Density Housing (HDH) program; or mobilize its own savings to directly purchase the property and
undertake onsite development following BP 220.

         In case the owner is not willing to sell, long term leases and land sharing can be explored
to keep the community residents where they are. They can then apply for onsite development.
Only when these two options fail would it become necessary to look for alternative land for near-
site resettlement. As a last recourse, the government can expropriate the property to make this
available for public housing programs (Figure 5).

Issues and Recommendations
         Over the course of Thematic Working Group (TWG) discussions in the National Housing
Summit, it became clear that the options above are not easy to take as they seem. Community
associations shared their actual experiences and predicaments in achieving the much desired
tenure security and housing, many of which had persisted for many years without clear resolution
in sight. At the same time, it became clear that government needs to better harmonize its actions,
be innovative, and shape better policies in such a way that it becomes more responsive to the
plight of ISFs.

        In identifying possible solutions, the Housing Summit gave priority to more actionable items
that can feasibly be achieved. Most of the recommendations, however, would require strong
commitment over the long term for the objective to be realized.

        The following specific issues and recommended actions were identified, and are currently
being pursued to accelerate the pace of land and housing reforms for ISFs:

1.       Limited access to up-to-date and reliable information on land and ISF

        There is no updated and complete inventory of ISFs in Metro Manila, their locations, and
the status of land they currently occupy. Whatever information that are available on land and ISFs
are kept in different formats and different information systems, making it difficult to undertake
more in depth analysis and be more useful for planning.

        On ISFs, it is essential to dissect the issues and needs, for example, of the following:
(1) those who have acquired land but need support to complete onsite development; (2) those
who are still seeking the owners of the private property they currently occupy; (3) those whose
owners have agreed to sell but where land records have issues that prevent the purchase from
taking place; (4) those who are residing in government proclaimed lands but are having problems
with the disposition of these properties, etc. It is fundamental for proper planning and manage-
ment of response to understand and take stock of available and needed information so that a
well-coordinated and proper program can be developed, and corresponding budgets and resources
can be programmed. Without these, the current response has been to treat all ISFs as having the
same issues, thus running the risk of boxed type of solutions.

       In order to more fully understand the types of lands occupied by ISFs and their status, the
LGI team developed a methodology for rapid mapping of ISFs and their locations. The identified
areas were then tagged and submitted to the Land Registration Authority (LRA) to secure infor-
mation on the lands they currently occupy.2 It is suggested that LGUs and key shelter agencies
undertake this procedure through a citywide approach in order to have an updated ISF and land

           Details of the methodology and the results – Procedures for Rapid Mapping of ISF and Inventory of Lands –
are included in LGI’s full report.

database, and use this for more comprehensive land tenure improvement and shelter planning
for ISF.

        In relation to land, agencies have to progressively share their records, to be led by local
governments, through the establishment of a unified land information system. These should
include information on ownership and titles from the Registry of Deeds (RoD), cadastral and
subdivision surveys from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), and tax
maps from the LGU Assessor’s Office. Over time, these could be expanded to include the ISF
database from the LGU Urban Poor Affairs Office, land use and zoning from the City Planning and
Development Office, as well as information on progress in housing provision and land distribution
from key shelter agencies such as NHA, HUDCC (Housing and Urban Development Coordinating
Council), and HLURB (Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board).

        The proposed response here is an Executive Order to establish a program on integrated
land and ISF information system for NCR (for ISF- and other related programs). The intent is to
establish a Program Management Office (PMO) with dedicated funding, resources, and timetable
for undertaking the following:

     •   Inventory existing tenure status of ISFs and prepare citywide land tenure improvement
         plans;
     •   Identify available land for ISFs for in-city resettlement and onsite development;
     •   Establish infosystem link between government agencies and LGUs;
     •   Make land information more accessible to all users; and
     •   Institutionalize land data-sharing between and among LGUs and NGAs including the
         Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Sec. 209 of LGC.

        The program would be similar to the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP),
this time focusing on the problems of formalization of the country’s urban poor and strengthening
implementation of the Urban Development and Housing Act (UDHA). HUDCC shall be considered
as the lead agency for implementation of this program through a supplemental budget, coupled
with strengthening of the agency to carry out this program over the long term.3


2.       Issues on BP 220

        Based on analysis, BP 220 is not very relevant to the needs of ISFs as the law applies more
to private sector-initiated housing projects that target the middle-to-low income formal market
more than the ISFs. This explains why ISFs are having difficulties complying with these standards,

          A draft Executive Order entitled “Creation of the Unified Land Information System (ULIS) at the National
Capital Region, Creating the NCR Land Information Council and Project Management Office” is included in LGI’s full
report.
Addressing Constraints to Mobilization of Land and Housing                                                   95

and why local governments are also having a hard time enforcing these. A new law, or IRR of this
law, is necessary. More specifically, the issues are:
     •   Current framework is limited mainly to development of new sites (off-site) and regulatory
         process designed for private sector developers and government;
     •   Other emergent housing solutions and approaches do not fit within this framework;
     •   IRR does not encompass planning guidelines to encourage development of flexible and
         affordable solutions for and by ISFs; and
     •   IRR guidelines are not very appropriate to community-initiated or self-help projects.

Proposal:
     •   Formulate planning and building guidelines and standards that will:
         o   Strengthen a more holistic approach to planning and implementation of shelter and
             settlements development for ISF communities;
         o   Encourage involvement of broader range of stakeholders, especially including ISF
             communities, in settlements and shelter planning and implementation;
         o   Make guidelines and standards more flexible and appropriate, in order to encourage
             generation of affordable housing solutions and technologies adaptive to current
             housing situation and existing programs;
         o   Specifically, (a) guide the planning and implementation of onsite development projects;
             (b) allow for incremental development of sites and housing construction; (c) promote
             and encourage alternative technologies; (d) allow for conditional non-spatial compen-
             satory measures in site/subdivision planning especially for onsite development;
             (e) consider disaster resilience and adaptation in planning and design; and (f) provide
             parameters that would aid ISFs and other implementers in selecting appropriate and
             affordable housing solutions.

     •   Establish coverage and timeframe of the guidelines, especially for onsite development, so
         as not to encourage further illegal occupancy; hence, the need for a database and
         mapping of all existing ISF occupied areas.4


3.       Issues with Proclamations

        Presidential Proclamation is the mechanism whereby the government designates govern-
ment lands for disposition for various purposes. In the case of socialized housing, Proclamations
are issued in favor of NHA or other government agencies to dispose the property to actual

          A more detailed discussion of the issues surrounding the applicability of BP 220 and recommendations to
address the gaps in planning standards for ISFs is presented in LGI’s full report.
96                                                                                           LGI


occupants, or to develop a property as a resettlement site for socialized housing, housing for
government employees and/or ISFs.

        Based on the data from NHA and other government agencies, there are a number of
these Proclamations that have been issued but have not been appropriately disposed due to a
number of reasons. In addition to lack of inventory of government lands, there are a number of
issues with respect to mobilization of government lands for ISFs. These are discussed below.

3.1     Large number of problematic Proclamations, hence, cannot proceed with disposition to
bona fide ISFs. Many of these proclamations have persisted for a long time, and there seem to be
no easy resolutions in sight, in the absence of concerted effort to exhaust all means possible to
address the problems, through the joint efforts of all agencies concerned.

        The proposal is to issue an Executive Order to establish a Presidential Interagency Task
Force to resolve issues in implementation of proclaimed lands. The Task Force shall have the
following responsibilities:
     •   Review proclamations that have implementation issues, or have been revoked, amended,
         and held in abeyance;
     •   Resolve and decide on all issues affecting implementation of proclamations that cannot
         be resolved at the operational level;
     •   Call on other government agencies and institutions to support the implementation of
         proclamations;
     •   Serve as oversight body in the implementation of proclamations/projects;
     •   Review, assess, and recommend options to improve the systems and procedures in the
         pre- and post-proclamation processes of affected agencies;
     •   Investigate and recommend to the President the filing of appropriate cases against those
         causing the delay or non-implementation of proclamations/projects; and
     •   Identify and recommend areas for the issuance of Presidential Proclamations.


3.2     Absence of clear guidelines on administration and disposition of lands proclaimed for
ISFs. This has resulted in wide variability in the instruments for disposition, the absence of
timetable to dispose of the property, and reluctance of the affected agency to release the land
to NHA or any designated agency identified to administer the land. The impact is that many
Proclamations cannot be implemented or are left incomplete.

The proposal is to standardize guidelines for administration and disposition of proclaimed lands
for ISFs, through an Executive Order. The EO shall:
     •   Clarify the basis for valuation;
     •   Address proclaimed lands without titles;
Addressing Constraints to Mobilization of Land and Housing                                        97

     •   Ensure there is smooth conveyance of titles to designated administrator of property;
     •   Address concerns about inclusion (or exclusion) of ISFs not currently occupying land subject
         of the new Proclamation; and
     •   Make provisions for budget from Department of Budget and Management (DBM) for every
         Proclamation.

3.3     There is no complete inventory of idle government lands that could be made available
for ISF in-city resettlement. This is important to fully exhaust the mobilization of government
lands for ISFs, which have been identified in the UDHA as priority.

        The LGI team prepared a Memorandum Circular (MC) mandating inventory of idle
government lands. (Note: This was signed by the Executive Secretary as MC 87 on 1 December
2015). The MC has provisions that:
     •   Mandate government agencies to submit an inventory of their idle lands and provide
         information as to the purpose for which it has been reserved, and its status;
     •   Instruct the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) through LGUs to
         conduct an inventory of government-owned and private idle lands appropriate for use as
         settlement in their respective territories; and
     •   Instruct LRA to make available, maps, approved subdivision surveys, title information and
         abstracts of registry to the DILG and LGUs.
The MC also instructed the Task Force to submit the inventory by February 2016.

        In preparation for Housing Summit activities, the Task Force met a number of times to
discuss the work to be done and to secure from LRA the information needed on government lands
in Metro Manila.

3.4     Lengthy process for issuance of Special Patents. The recommended action here is to
require DENR to review and issue the Draft IRR of Special Patent. The IRR has been extensively
discussed at the TWG on Land and Housing, wherein it was recommended for approval. The Unity
Statement likewise recommended that DENR to review and issue the Draft IRR of Special Patent
as mentioned in the Residential Free Patent Law (RA 10023) to address the lengthy issuance
process.5


4.       Limited access by ISF to compliance housing projects and mechanisms per
         Section 18 of UDHA.

        ISFs and LGUs do not have full access to information on the nature, location, and types of
compliance project by subdivision developers. Moreover, there is no mechanism that matches the
ISF housing and financial needs that could be possibly responded by the compliance projects.

         The draft IRR is included in LGI’s full report.
98                                                                                                                 LGI


        The proposed solution is to develop a Joint DILG-HLURB Memorandum Circular that
specifies procedures to ensure sharing of information on compliance projects with ISFs and
LGUs. This could be done in the process of securing development permits from LGUs, and in the
evaluation of compliance projects by HLURB.

        Moreover, considering that there are very few subdivision projects in Metro Manila and
other highly urbanized cities, the recommendation is to support the draft Bill or the draft EO which
expands application of balanced housing to condominium.6


5.      Lack of acceptable definition of danger zones and policies or guidelines for
        activities allowed thereat

         Communities lament that government uses criteria for identification of danger zones that
differs very much from their perspective and experiences. This has resulted in a standoff between
the two parties or reluctance of ISFs to relocate.

         The LGI team’s research showed that there is an existing Joint DENR-DILG-DOST-DPWH
Memorandum Circular 2004-01 entitled “Adoption of Hazard Zone Classification in Areas Affected
by Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), and Providing Guidelines for Activities Therein.” This was discussed
at the Task Group on Land and Housing wherein the group recommended for adoption of said
guidelines for nationwide implementation. This could be used as a starting point for seeking
clarity and consensus on what are deemed acceptable from social, technical and economic
perspectives to guide the current relocation programs of ISFs in identified danger zones.


6.    The high capital gains tax imposed on foreclosed properties, together with
      outdated parcel information, prevent LGUs from utilizing foreclosed private
      lands for ISFs

       Many local governments are already undertaking administrative recourse in case of default
in payment of real property taxes. Most of the private property owners in default own properties
that have been occupied by ISFs for many years, and owners do not have incentives to keep the
land. LGUs are not able to mobilize these lands because of the huge capital gains tax that needs to
be paid to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) before transfers of these properties can be
effected so that LGUs can use these lands for public purposes, including award to ISFs. In addition,
the tax maps and records of local governments are also outdated due to the lack of information
sharing between agencies – thus preventing LGUs to properly identify the properties in default of
payments and the current owners from whom delinquencies are due.

It is recommended that: 7
        LGUs establish unified land information system that links the records of DENR, LRA/RoD,
         LGUs, and relevant agencies in order to maintain an accurate database of ownership and
         properly track delinquencies; and
        DILG and DoF (Department of Finance) study the feasibility of exempting these properties
         from the CGT if the purpose is for ISFs.


Actions by the Housing Summit

         Most of the above recommendations were adopted in the Unity Statement which was
presented and endorsed during a summing-up program of the National Housing Summit held on
4 April 2016 in San Juan City.

More specifically, the recommendations that were included in the Unity Statement are as follows:

Executive

    a. Establish an integrated land and ISF information system and institutional arrangement for
       information sharing.

    b. Develop new regulations making settlement planning and building guidelines and
       standards more flexible and appropriate, to encourage affordable, disaster-resilient
       housing solutions and technologies for settlements upgrading/on-site incremental
       housing.

    c. Prioritize the resolution of outstanding issues affecting lands proclaimed as housing sites
       and standardize the guidelines for administration and disposition of proclaimed lands to
       intended ISFs.

    d. Issue a Joint DILG-HLURB Memorandum Circular specifying procedures to ensure sharing
       of information on compliance projects under Sec. 18 of Republic Act 7279 or the Urban
       Development and Housing Act (UDHA) with ISFs and LGUs.

    e. DENR to review and issue revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the Special
       Patent Law (RA 10023) to address the lengthy special patents issuance process.

    f.   Issue an Executive Order providing for a private sector-led vertical socialized housing
         program as one of the priority options in urban centers.

I.       Context and Challenge
         There is a significant unmet need for improved and additional housing in the Philippines.
Based on the 2010 Census on Population and Housing, there is an accumulated “backlog” of
1.225 million units as of 1 January 2011 (Table 1). Of this, 787,731 units are households in
“unacceptable housing” – on lots without consent of owner, in predominantly makeshift housing,
in living quarters not meant for human habitation, and in dilapidated or condemned structures –
and another 437,612 are households doubling up in acceptable structures. There is also a “future
need” of 2.25 million for new household formation and 1.93 million for inventory losses over the
period 2011-2016 (Table 2), although “future need” does not constitute a housing shortfall per se.

       Supply shortfalls in affordable and quality housing are not uncommon in low-middle
income countries like the Philippines. Housing conditions are a reflection of the level of economic
development; higher incomes associated with economic development permit greater spending on
housing, which is reflected in better housing (World Bank 1993). However, poor housing is likely to
be as much the result of housing policy – the combination of policies and regulations that
determine the efficiency and responsiveness of housing supply – as it is of low income levels per
se (World Bank 1993). Bottlenecks in urban land markets that result from institutional failures in
land administration and management are, for instance, key in explaining the relatively high costs
and poor quality of housing in Metro Manila (Strassman and Blunt 1993, Ballesteros 2000).

         The point that informal and substandard housing conditions are not due to low incomes
alone is illustrated in Table 3 which presents housing by tenure type and the share of income poor
households in those types. 2 Across the country, only 21.8 percent of households living on lots
without consent (“informal, without consent”) are income poor while 78.2 percent of households

            By Toby C. Monsod, University of the Philippines School of Economics. This paper draws heavily from
earlier work, i.e., “Is Government Really Solving the Housing Problem?” published in The Philippine Review of Economics,
Vol. XLVIII, No. 1, June 2011, updating figures where possible. It also benefits from participation in select meetings of
the National Housing Summit, from policy briefs by other World Bank technical experts involved in the summit
(Floradema Eleazar and the LGI team, Marife Ballesteros, and Anna Marie A. Karaos) and from comments from Maria
Anna de Rosas Ignacio and Cynthia C. Veneracion of the World Bank Task Team. Errors in fact and in analysis are the
author’s responsibility alone.

           Households are identified as income poor by region using 2012 regional poverty thresholds produced by the
Philippine Statistical Authority.

are not poor. In NCR, only 6.5 percent of households in informal housing without consent are
income poor while 93.5 percent of households are not poor.3 Table 4 presents tenure against
income class and likewise shows how lower-middle and middle income households swell the
numbers in informal housing. Table 5, on the quality of housing, shows that 50 percent of house-
holds in substandard housing are non-poor; in NCR, 80 percent are non-poor.4

         The focus of this paper is on housing policy and how it can be modified to better address
observed supply shortfalls. The fact is, decades of well-meaning government housing policies may
have impeded rather than promoted the downward expansion of formal housing markets and the
delivery of cost-effective housing solutions for lowest income households. Suffice it to say that
government’s (default) strategy of choice – to maximize the output of new houses and sites for
sale at below market prices – has been fundamentally flawed, dealing with symptoms rather than
fundamental causes of housing system failures. Problems with this strategy have long been
observed – i.e., World Bank 1997, Llanto and others 1998, Llanto and Orbeta 2001, Monsod 2011,
to name a few – prompting calls for a fundamental shift in approach. The same call was made in
the recent Comprehensive Assessment Report of the NISUS (National Informal Settler Upgrading
Strategy) completed in July 2014:

         “. . . the government’s housing program is not working for the poor . . . despite the
         considerable resources put into it, the program has accomplished too little for informal
         settlers. The focus on relocation and resettlement has often proved disastrous for
         communities and people, and housing subsidies have been an expensive folly. A
         redirection of current policy is urgently required” (page 84).

         What would comprise a more effective approach? This paper begins by laying out how
housing markets operate quite differently from other markets and implications for state inter-
vention. It then describes how housing policy over the years, while well-meaning, has dealt with
symptoms rather than causes, providing publicly-subsidized housing and housing finance at great
cost. The fourth section discusses where policy should instead be focused – on important supply
side rigidities and housing finance system failures – and how housing social assistance may be
optimized.

           Another estimate of informal settlers in Metro Manila puts the number of informal settler families (ISFs) at
584,524 as of 2011 which is based on city reports (Gaurano 2011) and cited in the NISUS (National Informal Settlements
Upgrading Strategy) final report (2014). However, Gaurano (2011) remarks: “it is worthwhile to note that the
parameters and methods used in gathering city data are unclear” and that these numb ers have not been validated. The
comparable 2010 Census-based estimate for the National Capital Region (NCR) is 173,583 as of January 2011 (see first
three columns of Table 1 for NCR), which would include households and structures in areas at risk, although it would
not include structures on land intended for government infrastructure projects or areas for priority development.
The comparable Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) 2012-based estimate for NCR is 250,895 (see column
4 of Table 3). This paper adopts the Census- and FIES-based estimates which are methodologically robust.

          Households prioritize the quality of roofing over the quality of walls. Using the latter as an indicator would
therefore provide a more conservative estimate of substandard housing.

II.      Housing Markets and the State
        A functioning housing market is one where households can translate their notional
demand for quality housing into effective demand at market prices and where the supply of
housing is responsive to that demand. The housing market operates markedly different from other
markets however and is prone to significant market failures, especially at the bottom end.5

         In particular, the housing market is “really not a single . . . exchange market, but is rather
a set of overlapping submarkets differentiated by tenure, location, size and quality” (Quigley
2003: 57, citing D. Maclennan). Location derives from the spatial fixity of housing: characteristics
associated with a location (e.g., accessibility, physical condition of the neighborhood, hazard) are
inherent in the bundle of attributes associated with a dwelling at that location. Size and quality
are due to the heterogeneity of housing and the limited substitutability across housing types,
sizes, age, materials, design elements, and the like. Tenure choice derives from the durability of
housing, which in turn implies an investment aspect of owning a home and the distinction
between housing as a consumption good (and the demand for housing services) and housing as
an investment good (demand for housing, the asset which emits those services). When
households make their housing choice therefore, they face interdependent decisions involving
how much to consume, assumed to have both physical and locational characteristics, and
whether to only consume or to consume and invest in housing, which is the tenure decision (Yates
and Mackay 2006).

         Housing markets are also slow to adjust and market adjustment involves significant
search, moving, legal, administrative, and financing costs.6 Housing supply is, at the same time,
relatively inelastic. Housing supply is determined by the existing stock, the rate of deterioration or
renovation of that stock, and the flow of new development, but there is a large stock of used
housing in the market at any one time. Housing markets are, in a sense, “suppliers’ markets,”
characterized by excess demand or excessively high market prices (Hoek-Smit 2004). In times of a
sudden reduction in supply, increase in demand, or rapid migration, the slow adjustment in the
housing system can generate adverse distributional outcomes (Whitehead 2003).

        The slow adjustment in the housing system is further complicated by market failures
which, if left alone, can lead to outcomes such as neighborhood decline, slums, and segregation.7
In the presence of externalities for instance, such as when private markets fail to take into
account how poor housing can impact health or foster social instability or how the upkeep or use

         5
           These characteristics are not unique to housing but “only in housing are they so pronounced.” (Tu 2003,
citing D. Maclennan). Unless otherwise indicated, the discussion of these characteristics draws heavily from Tu 2003.
         6
           The immobility of housing means that market adjustment occurs by people moving, rather than the
movement of goods. Search costs are high and pricing is difficult because market adjustment operates at multiple
levels. Legal and administrative costs are incurred whether renting or owning. Time delays in design, financing,
construction, and slow rate of change in demand (due to high moving, search, financing costs, etc.) contribute to the
slow adjustment. Supply and price/rent adjustments are slow due to time delays in design, financing and construction,
tedious search processes, information problems, and other market inefficiencies.
         7
          This section draws heavily from Whitehead 2003, Hoek-Smit 2004, and Stahl 1985.
104                                                                                                           Monsod


of a particular property can impact the value of another, private markets tend to under-invest in
improvements, new development, or neighborhood management. These inefficiencies are
exacerbated by information problems and uncertainties, e.g., the irreversibility of housing capital
combined with the long gestation periods involved in production and inherent uncertainties
related to the evolution of housing demand and neighborhood conditions, which increase the risk
of new construction or improvement investment. Risk needs to be mediated by an adequate set
of insurance markets if private markets are to provide sufficient quantities of new housing,
including of types that are not in mainstream demand. However, housing finance markets are
themselves imperfect and will tend to favor relatively riskless development finance and mortgages
for upper-income households (Hoek-Smit 2004). Failures in the housing finance market frequently
compound or are at the core of problems of delivering standard quality housing to moderate and
low-income households (ibid).

        Whether to increase efficiency or to promote equity, policies designed to improve
housing supply efficiency and responsiveness clearly offer the greatest scope for reform (World
Bank 1993). Increasing efficiency would be served by addressing rigidities in key input markets
that push the unit cost of housing up and mitigating risks and barriers to entry which hamper
markets from expanding downward.8 Such policies would also serve redistribution and merit good
concerns, however, since enabling market solutions for a wider array of moderate income groups
can free up scarce public resources for innovative social assistance to the poorest households
(Hoek-Smit 2015).9 The strongest political case for intervention and social provision in housing
has typically been in terms of a direct and effective means of ensuring minimum housing
standards and redistribution rather than efficiency (Whitehead 2003).



III.     Current Housing Policy: Dealing with Symptoms Rather than
         Causes of Housing System Failures

        The principal intention of state-sponsored housing programs in the Philippines has always
been to ensure better housing for low-income households. This was implicit in housing
interventions during the early 1900s, which included slum clearing programs, relocation, and the
enforcement of new sanitation and building codes to “clean-up” Manila, as well as later in the
1940s when housing and subdivision development for low-income/worker households was
undertaken.10 In 1941, the first national housing law (Commonwealth Act 648) created an agency
________________________________________________________________________________________
         8
           While market failures and inequities provide a priori economic reasons for government intervention, they do
not by themselves justify it. A practical case for intervention should be made depending on whether the market failure
is large enough to matter and the chances of government to actually overcome it (Whitehead 2003). Regulations, taxes
and subsidies, and the direct provision of goods and services are among the policy options of the State if and when that
practical case is made.
         9
          The merit good argument is based on a political value judgment about what minimum standards of housing
the population should have, reflected in the concept of “housing need” as distinguished from “housing supply” and
“housing demand” (Todt 1985).
         10
           Discussion of policies from 1900 to 1959 draw heavily from Ocampo 1976 and 1978. Policies from 1970 to the
early 1980s draw from Ramos 1973.
Rethinking Urban Housing Policy                                                                                       105


with distinct pro-poor objectives to undertake urban housing, subdivision, and slum clearance
programs. In 1947, the Philippine Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC) was established with
the explicit corporate objective to establish public housing for low-income families.11

        In the 1950s to the 1970s, housing was also recognized as a strategic economic activity and
a number of public housing corporations were established to catalyze housing development and
finance, demonstrating enterprises for private capital, and phasing out once private capital was
ready to step up. A formal housing program came to be articulated which included (1) social
housing (e.g., slum clearance, rental tenement construction, and resettlement projects) built
and funded by government; (2) economic housing, built and financed by government, and
(3) government financing of privately-owned housing. The objective of the program was – “as far
as national capacity permitted” – to promote, finance, and establish a supply of dwellings suitable
to the economic and social situation of households, maintaining a “judicious balance between
subsidized and non-subsidized sectors.” Still, shelter was held as a basic need and “an integral
aspect of the human settlements program of government” and the primary function of the lead
corporation (PHHC) was the production of housing for low-income families.

         Then as now, well-meaning housing programs were marked by inefficiencies and leakages.
Early tenement projects (e.g., in Vitas or Punta) were beset by poor design, poor construction,
poor collections (despite below-cost rents), and poor sanitation. Although meant for the poor and
homeless, workers without stable jobs could be disqualified from these projects. Resettlement
(e.g., in Quezon City, Sapang Palay, Carmona, Montalban), the cheaper alternative to tenement
housing, was also problematic. Sites were selected not on suitability criteria but on where parcels
were voluntarily offered to the government for purchase.12 Despite lot prices at 25 to 40 percent
below acquisition cost, sites were far from the working districts and the lack of urban jobs and
lack of basic services led to attrition rates that went over 50 percent. Economic housing had
similar location and pricing problems: the pressure on housing corporations to recover
investments led to policies (such as liberal eligibility requirements and higher ceilings on loan
amounts) that naturally crowded out lower-income applicants even though they were eligible.
Higher income groups therefore enjoyed the large implicit subsidies involved in economic housing
loans (e.g., loans were at or below market prices with no down-payment requirement).

        In 1978, the housing agenda was embodied in a national shelter program (NSP) envisioned
as a “total systems approach to housing finance, production and regulation” delivered by an
interacting network of implementing housing agencies. These core programs and implementing
mechanisms were later enacted into law through Executive Order 90 issued in December 1986.
EO 90 created the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC), charged with
“coordinating the activities of government housing agencies to ensure the accomplishment of the

            The PHHC’s corporate objectives included (1) establishment of public housing for low-income families; (2) slum
clearance; (3) establishment of housing for destitute, and (4) acquisition, subdivision, and resale of landed estates.

             Ocampo 1978, footnote 72, which cites Abrams and Koenigsberger 1959. Ultimately, PHHC found itself with
a high inventory of land that it would not be able to develop for years, yet too costly for resale. It went into heavy debt
in the late 1950s and resumed house-building activities only in the mid-1960s.

National Shelter Program,” and identified “key agencies” to accomplish NSP as well as “support
agencies” to fund it:

         The National Housing Authority (NHA), established in 1975 (consolidating PHHC and
          seven other corporations and authorities) with a 50-year charter, the sole government
          agency engaged in direct shelter production, to focus on housing assistance to the lowest
          30 percent of urban income earners;

         The Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB), established in 1976 (as the Human
          Settlements Regulatory Board), the sole regulatory body for housing and land develop-
          ment, charged with “encouraging greater private sector participation in low-cost housing
          through liberalization of development standards, simplification of regulations and decen-
          tralization of approvals for permits and licenses”;

         The National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation (NHMFC), charted in 1979 as a
          secondary mortgage market institution and recapitalized by EO 90 to operate a viable
          home mortgage market utilizing long-term funds principally provided by the support
          agencies.13 In 2004, the Social Housing Finance Corporation (SHFC), a wholly-owned
          subsidiary of NHMFC, was established to develop and administer social housing finance
          programs for low-income formal and informal households;

         The Home Guaranty Corporation (HGC), originally chartered as the Home Financing
          Corporation in 1950 to “mobilize investible funds for housing purposes”; renamed (Home
          Insurance and Guaranty Corporation) in 1986 and recapitalized to provide a viable system
          of guarantees, loan insurance, and other incentives to encourage private development
          and financing of low-income housing. In its new 2000 charter, mortgage insurance was
          dropped; and

         The Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF), also known as Pag-IBIG Fund, directed to
          utilize funds not required for provident benefits for housing loans to members; the Social
          Security System (SSS), directed to be the primary provider of funds for long-term
          mortgages for low and middle-income private sector employees; and the Government
          Service Insurance System (GSIS), directed to be the primary provider of funds for long-
          term mortgages for low and middle-income government employees. These three agencies
          were support agencies mandated to ensure that “funds for long-term housing loans are
          available on a continuous and self-sustaining basis.” EO 90 prescribed the amount of
          funds each would contribute along with other parameters for an “integrated home
          mortgage financing system” anchored by NHMFC.

       For the last 30 years, the goal of NSP has been to increase the access of target households
to decent, affordable, and secure shelter, where target households are the first three income

           NHMFC needed to be recapitalized after it became insolvent in 1985 due to a regime of long-term, below-
market fixed rate mortgages financed with higher-priced, short-term debt.
Rethinking Urban Housing Policy                                                                                       107


deciles living in urban areas, and “secure shelter” is a house, a lot, or both.14 “Increasing access”
has been interpreted as social provision per se, where a set number of houses, sites, or loans,
derived from an estimated “housing need” or backlog, is targeted every plan period.

        Between 1987 and 2015, around 2.79 million households were assisted with housing units
that were built, financed, or insured with public support (Table 6). Households were assisted
through housing production, including resettlement, upgrading, sites and services, and other
special projects, accounting for 35 percent; housing finance, primarily end-user mortgage loans,
44 percent; community-driven shelter assistance, such as the community mortgage program and
the new high density housing program, 11 percent; and land proclamations, 10 percent.

        The total number of households assisted represent a little less than 30 percent of the
estimated backlog for each period, on numbers alone, arguably a respectable showing. Whether
these results have been achieved at lowest cost, whether they represent additional investment
(not displacing private investment), or whether the social housing assistance provided have met
target household’s requirements, however, is less clear.15

         On the housing finance side, the approach has primarily involved simple debt finance-
related household subsidies, that is, interest rate reductions on mortgage loans, which basically
help beneficiaries “take on a larger loan than they would otherwise be able to” (Hoek-Smit 2009).
Combined with underpriced guaranty products and policies for funding and underwriting
undisciplined by the market, this approach has ultimately been counterproductive, resulting in
large arrears, at least three system crises – in 1985, 1992, and 199616 – and, more recently, a
liquidity squeeze involving HGC and a PHP12 billion advance from the National Treasury.17
Household subsidies have also been regressive: it was estimated that between 1993 and 1995,
higher-income borrowers captured nearly 75 percent of interest subsidy flows, 90 percent of
subsidies associated with arrears under the major lending programs, and 80 percent of cash and

            The Urban Development and Housing Act (RA 7279) refers to “underprivileged and homeless citizens" as
beneficiaries of the law and defines them as individuals or families residing in urban and urbanizable areas whose
income or combined household income falls within the poverty threshold as defined by the National Economic and
Development Authority (NEDA) and who do not own housing facilities, including those who live in makeshift dwelling
units and do not enjoy security of tenure.
          15
           Whitehead 2003 asks these questions in relation to social investment in housing and its role in urban
regeneration.
          16
           These crises were related to the finance component anchored by NHMFC’s operations. Monsod (2011)
provides more detail, summarizing World Bank 1997, Llanto and others 1998, and Llanto and Orbeta 2001. In relation to
the 1996 crisis, total fiscal and quasi-fiscal costs was estimated at PHP55.4 billion, including PHP30 billion in potential
stock losses (nonperforming loan portfolio) and a large number of unoccupied housing units, e.g., 27,000 as of end-
2001 (World Bank 1997).
          17
            HGC was granted a PHP12 billion advance by the National Treasury in 2013 to settle PHP12 billion worth of
7-year zero coupon bonds issued by HGC in 2006. The 2006 bonds had been issued to redeem a prior PHP7 billion worth
of bonds, issued in 2002, also to settle guaranty obligations (COA 2008: HGC Report, Part IIA, 4.2]. To cover the

bond guaranties (Llanto and Orbeta 2001).18 While no incidence analysis has been undertaken
since, interest rate and other subsidies have continued under the Pag-IBIG Fund – until at least
2012 – as well as under HGC, NHA, and now SHFC.

         In all, whether better access to housing has indeed been significantly and sustainably
achieved is not clear. But decades of state-sponsored housing finance notwithstanding, Figure 1
shows that the country’s mortgage system remains “tiny” relative to countries at the same or
lower levels of urbanization (Hoek-Smit 2015). Indeed, homeownership in the country is still largely
self-financed (by saving or incremental construction) or directly-financed (from family, friends,
and others; Lea 2009). The 2009 Consumer Finance Survey indicates that of the 68.8 percent of
households who own or co-own their house/house and lot, of which only 6.7 percent acquired
property using loans.19 In this context, the proliferation of informal settlements becomes clearer.
“Dependence on direct finance results in cities that are built as they are financed, with a
considerable and visible proportion of self-construction and slum proliferation” (Lea 2009: 30).

           Total subsidy flows were estimated at PHP25.4 billion from 1993 to 1995 alone, of which 90 percent were
off-budget implicit subsidies related to home mortgage programs and development loan programs, including CMP
(community mortgage program).

           Of those who used loans, only 9.3 percent borrowed from commercial, rural/cooperative, and thrift banks.
In NCR, 7.9 percent acquired property using loans, of which only 5.1 percent borrowed from banks. The survey may be

        A rough best-case picture of the market penetration of mortgage finance, both market-
sourced and state-subsidized, is presented in Tables 7 and 8.20 It is an optimistic picture because it
is based only on average monthly family income and estimated amortization payments by type of
mortgage. It does not take into account other prerequisites for accessing home mortgages, such as
savings or wealth, the regularity of income flows, or the availability of collateral.21 These
prerequisites will further constrain access. Ultimately only some of the households in the
indicated deciles will actually qualify for a home mortgage.

         The tables indicate that commercial home mortgages potentially reach the 8th decile
across the country, and the 5th decile in NCR; Pag-IBIG subsidized loans may reach up to the
6th decile overall and the 3rd decile in NCR. Even if qualified based on average monthly income
however, both commercial lenders and Pag-IBIG Fund will select individuals with regular income
flows, that is, the wage/salary-employed. This means that less than one-third of households per
decile in the lower-middle and middle income categories (4th to 8th decile) may qualify, if ever.22

         In other words, even middle and low-middle income households do not seem to have
adequate access to formal, market-sourced finance and housing solutions. By way of comparison,
CMP, a community-driven shelter assistance program, extends to the 1st decile in NCR. CMP
assists groups of informal settlers acquire the property they are occupying (whether public or
private) or purchase private property for off-site resettlement through nonmarket group financing,
called “community mortgages.”23 Apart from down-market penetration, CMP outperforms other
financing programs (e.g., NHA in-house financing for resettlement) in terms of outlay per house-
hold (see Table 6) and collection efficiency rates (e.g., 75-80 percent for CMP, 20-35 percent for
resettlement).24 However, CMP is dependent on budgetary appropriations and cannot keep up
with demand: at the end-April 2015, it had 370 projects pending, requiring roughly PHP2.98 billion
in loans involving 41,834 informal settler families.25

         The tables also indicate that Pag-IBIG Fund and commercial lenders share the same
market. This begs the question of whether social investments over the years have added to or
displaced private investments and to what extent. The verdict in the 1990s was that public
engagement in finance had a perverse effect on the primary mortgage market: the volume of
public lending (by NHMFC), the formulaic lending approach, and the subsidized operations of the
public housing corporations (NHMFC, HGC) made it impossible for private banks to lend profitably
to the same market and unnecessary for ancillary services (private mortgage insurance, credit
bureaus and rating agencies) to evolve. Whether Pag-IBIG Fund – which has just moved to full

risk-based pricing but which nonetheless enjoys significant legal and regulatory privileges under the
law (mandatory contributions, privilege to deduct loan payments from salaries, tax exemptions, a
general government guarantee) – currently helps or hinders entry, innovation, and price competition
in relevant segments of the market or, how it can better help, is not known. The latter question relates
to a bigger question of Pag-IBIG Fund’s role in the housing finance system: whether it should
continue to assume all functions – provident fund and institutional investor, housing lender, and
subsidy distributor – or be more strategic. The same questions can and should be asked of other
corporations, including SHFC and NHA, both of which also provide financing and subsidies.26

         To be sure, in its pursuit of greater access to affordable housing solutions for low-income
households, government has never made expanding the reach of market-sourced housing finance
an explicit strategy. But that is precisely where policy has been shortsighted. When middle and
lower-middle income decile groups cannot access formal, market-based housing solutions, they are
likely to be self-financing and/or spilling over to, and availing themselves of, government funded
programs and services (Hoek-Smit 2015). If the latter, it can only mean that poorest households
are displaced from the government programs and services intended for them. The large unfunded
pipeline of CMP projects may be evidence of such a “crowding out,” if not of lowest-income
households from current projects, then perhaps of CMP itself from the broader housing portfolio.27

        A key implication is that interventions to pursue improved efficiency in market-sourced
housing finance will not only benefit middle- and low-middle income households but will also
serve lowest income household interests. When private capital is better leveraged for the middle
income sectors, scarce public subsidy resources can be better optimized for the lowest income
sector.

        This is not to say however that optimal housing solutions for lowest income households
should involve end-user mortgage finance, even if subsidized. Unlike middle and lower-middle
income households, the incomes of households in the first three deciles may simply be too low to
even contemplate investment spending; consumption spending itself is more often than not
inadequate. It is not clear then if pushing formal sector housing is optimal for the lowest income
households at this time. What is clearer is that government can play a more direct role in
increasing general housing consumption to ensure minimum standards. Support for securing
property rights or public investments to improve access to urban services and infrastructure are
obvious approaches. Support for housing microfinance that can improve existing (informal,
unauthorized) housing is another.

       Neither is this to say that housing finance reforms can alone improve housing conditions
of the poor. Lowering the costs of housing finance per se matters less to the unaffordability
problem than addressing issues that drive the unit cost of housing up. Action on the latter must

            The Consumer Finance Survey indicates that of the 7.9 percent of homeowners in NCR who acquired their
residence using loans, 52.6 percent sourced loans from NHA. The next common sources were cooperatives and asso-
ciations (10.2 percent), Pag-IBIG Fund (9.9 percent), moneylenders (6.8 percent), and commercial banks (5.1 percent).

             An SHFC comment on an earlier version of this paper explains the pipeline as having to do with compliance
issues arising from regulations that are not suited to housing interventions for informal settler communities.
Rethinking Urban Housing Policy                                                                                    111


accompany if not precede actions on the former. “Without elastic land and housing supply,
improvements in housing finance merely generate price effects” (World Bank 1993).

         Similar observations can be made about the government’s housing production component.
That is, in its pursuit of affordable housing solutions for the poor, government has paid no real
attention to addressing fundamental factors which impede the efficiency and responsiveness of
supply or which drive the unit cost of housing up. Instead, resources have been devoted to the
physical production of housing units and sites for sale at below market prices.

         Direct production of social housing is assigned to NHA and 75 percent of NHA outputs are
generated under its resettlement program. The resettlement program handles off-city and in-city
relocation of informal settler families (ISFs) in danger zones, relocation related to government
infrastructure projects, resettlement due to calamities, and LGU-led resettlement. The resettle-
ment program is cost-recoverable, e.g., out of a unit cost of PHP290,000, PHP85,000 is a capital
grant and PHP205,000 is payable over 25 years at 6 percent; target households are ISFs belonging
to the first three income deciles. Housing finance is provided in-house, that is, apart from
production, NHA also delivers housing finance and subsidies. Other production programs include
settlements upgrading, sites and services, special projects, and other housing assistance programs.

         Between 2011 and 2015, social housing production by NHA accounted for 65.8 percent of
total social housing production (private and public), up from a 25.3 percent share between 1993
and 1998 and more than double its average share in the previous 10 years from 2001 to 2010
(Table 9). However, just like the resettlement projects managed by its predecessors, NHA projects
have been associated with poor pricing, weak disposition rates, and weak collection. In 2000,
disposition rates at resettlement sites were at 14 percent and collection efficiency, below
40 percent; collection efficiency continues to be a low 20-30 percent “even with subsidies on
materials, interest rates and land” (NISUS 2014: 35). Resettlement projects are also observed to be
plagued by delays and shortfalls (e.g., deficient basic services, lack of livelihood opportunities),
beneficiary selection concerns, and attrition (families returning to the city to squat).28 And
production and administrative efficiency of NHA continues to be a concern: between 2004 and
2010, NHA completed about 15.3 housing units per employee, only slightly better than its rate in
1994 (12 units) when it was one-third the rate for the private sector.29 In the overall: “NHA’s
resettlement program has been implemented with doubtful performance” (NISUS 2014:36).

       The “when,” “where,” and “how” questions surrounding resettlement per se are supposed
to be examined elsewhere.30 What is relevant here is that fact that indications of allocative,
production, and administrative waste have been demonstrated by the government’s resettlement
________________________________________________________________________________________
         28
          Resettlement programs are sometimes unable to discriminate beneficiaries by income. Of the roughly
11,700 families within the 3-meter easement along the eight waterways of Metro Manila, about 33 percent (or 1 in 3)
were from middle income groups (UP Planades 2014, Table 8).

program for decades, yet resources continue to flow into the same types of programs. Despite
knowing where strategic interventions may lie – inter-local planning, social preparation, more
intensive post-resettlement, unlocking public lands in-city have long been identified – modalities
have hardly changed. A new high density housing program of the SHFC (discussed below) represents
a significant innovation but it is too early to tell whether this will represent a more effective
approach.

         Productive and administrative inefficiencies also raise the necessary question about the
real impact of NHA operations on innovation, efficiency, and responsiveness of housing supply for
the lower income groups and its continued value-added as developer. 31 Just like Pag-IBIG Fund,
NHA enjoys market power derived through, among others, its preferential tax treatment for mass
housing developments and privileged access to land by the Urban Development and Housing Act
(which automatically assigns all suitable, unused public lands for socialized housing to NHA at no
cost). While market/industry conditions in the mid-1900s may have justified direct public residential
construction and development to attract private capital into the space, it is far less clear that this
same degree of government engagement is necessary or optimal today. The NHA charter is in fact
time-bound. However rather than manage of smooth “phase out” in 2025, the share of NHA in
total social housing production has been sharply increasing.

         It also raises a fundamental question about the corporate form as a vehicle for delivering
state subsidies. There is an inherent contradiction between a principal function to produce housing
for low-income families – clearly not a profitable proposition – and the expectation of the
corporation to recover housing investments and be self-sustaining. This contradiction, by nature,
invites inefficiencies.

        In short, to what degree does NHA currently crowd-in or crowd-out private supply of
shelter for lower income groups? Are there alternative, more efficient ways to use government
resources to enable “direct shelter production” for lower income groups? Should the vehicle for
delivering subsidies or incentives to improve low-income housing conditions be a corporation like
NHA? These questions need to be addressed objectively and urgently so that the 10 years left on
NHAs charter can be leveraged as an opportunity for broader institutional reform in the sector.

Other programs

        The High Density Housing (HDH) program of SHFC is a new resettlement program for ISFs
in danger areas. It involves both development and mortgage financing for ISFs, including financing
of land acquisition, construction of low/medium rise buildings and site development, and
community mortgage financing for organized ISF communities, as well as capital grants, interest
rate subsidies and technical assistance grants. Subsidies are explicit but embedded in the
financing scheme: among others, SHFC pays itself for the technical assistance it provides to
communities.

________________________________________________________________________________________
         31
            In the U.S., Murray 1983 shows that for every additional 100 publicly constructed units as many as 85
private units have been crowded out.
Rethinking Urban Housing Policy                                                                                   113


         It is too early to gauge whether the scheme will be more cost-efficient or cost-effective
than other resettlement schemes. Suffice to say that while its design is an innovation worth
testing, it is not all that clear if the “CMP model” can apply in condominium settings. Can the
effort and mechanisms that make for the successful management of a community mortgage to
purchase land easily apply to condominium estate management, a highly technical affair? Nor is it
clear how HDH works as a business model for the corporation as it seems to be mixing various
functions – direct production, finance, and subsidy delivery – in the same way that bred (and still
breeds) production, allocative, and administrative inefficiencies in sister corporations.

        Actually the business model of SHFC was never clear to begin with . It was largely
established as a reaction to the program failures in the 1990s; it was thought that a new corpo-
ration was needed to protect the CMP funds and funds of other social housing programs managed
by NHMFC. Whether or how a separate corporation for programs like CMP could operate in a
sustainable way, or what other type of “agency” or agency arrangements could better administer
such programs, was never examined.

        With favorable incentives and subsidies directed at homeownership, rental housing has
received little if any attention in housing policy. However rental housing is a key feature of a
“vibrant” housing market and an essential component of affordable housing. “ An inhospitable
environment facing the rental sector is directly reflected in the large portion of the housing stock
that is outside the bounds of formality” (Le Blanc 2009). Rental housing plays a part in the
“housing career” of most individuals, being the optimal form of shelter for many segments of the
population, such as the young or single households as well as the poorest segments who would
ordinarily not be ready to buy property even if mortgage markets were better developed. Rental
housing is a straightforward business venture however and the challenge for policy will be how to
enable the supply of affordable rental housing while not discouraging private investment in rental
housing.

        Finally, the Land Proclamation program – an urban asset reform program in the spirit of De
Soto’s unlocking of dead capital. The program has covered about 800 hectares in Metro Manila and
another 6,000 hectares across the rest of the country, with the potential to regularize the land
tenure of 81,000 and 142,500 occupant households (as of 2010), respectively. 32 However many
proclamations have remained unimplemented or incomplete due to the continued absence of clear
guidelines, among other administrative factors (LGI 2015). Operationalizing these proclamations is
an important first step in loosening up land for urban housing.


IV.      Redirecting Housing Policy
       The previous section has argued that current housing policy has been costly, ineffective
and shortsighted. It has dealt with symptoms rather than causes of housing system failures,
________________________________________________________________________________________
         32
            HUDCC data (October 2010). The program seeks to regularize the tenure of informal settler families through
the issuance of Presidential Proclamations declaring occupied parcels of public lands open for disposition to qualified
beneficiaries. Not all occupants may qualify, however (e.g., capacity to pay, not a previous beneficiary).
114                                                                                                         Monsod


leaving significant portions of the low, low-middle, and middle-income households without
adequate access to housing solutions. A more strategic approach would be for housing policy to
shift away from an emphasis on direct provision of housing and loans per se to enabling markets
and removing distortions that impede market supply responsiveness. Such a shift would involve
(1) actions to unlock land markets and reduce institutional and regulatory costs on the supply
side, (2) incentives to address risks and promote competition in finance markets, moving mortgage
and non-mortgage finance down market and expanding their scale, (3) a reconfiguration social
assistance to households which cannot be reached by market forces, and (4) tenure neural
policies and other steps to grow the rental housing market. Reorganizing government
instrumentalities to more efficiently monitor and manage urbanization and housing is a fifth
action. These are discussed in turn.

Addressing real-side distortions

         Among the most important distortions on the supply side are institutional and regulatory
failures – dysfunctional land markets, incoherent transportation infrastructure, outdated building
and planning standards, and administrative failure in the provision of social housing.

         “The housing dilemma is primarily a land problem” (Roxas 1969). The land problem is one
of disjoint and inconsistent land management and administration policies and processes. Land
management has to do with the formulation and implementation of land use policies, including
access and distribution, while land administration has to do with the accounting and inventory of
land including location, value, and tenurial interests.33 Since the devolution in 1991, land use
planning and the power to regulate land use have been the exclusive mandate of cities and
municipalities. However, major land administration and management functions are also vested in
at least seven national agencies, plus the courts, and there is no explicit and integrated frame-
work (e.g., cadastral survey) underpinning these functions so that efficient coordination can take
place (FEF and LMB-CLAMP 2012). Inconsistent records and data, land use conflicts, and other
regulatory problems raise the transaction costs of securing, registering, and transferring property
rights, hamper infrastructure investments, and push up costs of servicing land for urban
development. Land values are pushed up even further by land hoarding, enabled by the absence
of a national standard and method for real property valuation and the poor enforcement of real
property taxes at local levels (Ballesteros 2000).

         The reform of both central and local land management institutions is a long-term project
(which has been ongoing for some time) requiring macro-policy reforms. However there are a
number of institutional interventions and micro-policy reforms that have the potential of
unlocking both public and privately-owned land in key urban centers and providing quick wins
(LGI 2016).34 The most important involve resolving issues relating to lands already proclaimed
(i.e., but were revoked, amended, or held in abeyance) and completing their disposition through

           This section draws heavily from LGI 2016 (included in this volume), which represents agreements arrived at
by the Land and Housing Thematic Working Group of the National Housing Summit.
Rethinking Urban Housing Policy                                                                                     115


the issuance of uniform guidelines (on valuation, titling issues, issues of inclusion for this purpose;
undertaking an inventory of government lands in-city and establishing an integrated land
information system that can make information on land for in-city resettlement and onsite
development publicly available; and institutionalizing land data sharing between and among local
government units (LGUs) and relevant national government agencies (NGAs). Clarifying and
achieving consensus on the preconditions for off-site resettlement, such as the definition of
“danger zones,” versus onsite upgrading is also critical. This is because onsite upgrading, including
support for incremental housing, is one of the least costly and disruptive of interventions, clearly
more aligned with low income household capacities and preferences.

         The role of connective infrastructure in making housing supply more responsive has also
been overlooked. Transportation infrastructure connects different parts of a city and guides land
use and urban expansion; at the national scale, it allows lagging regions to participate in the
growth process of leading urban centers (World Bank 2009). Efficient transport systems widen
residential location options and, thus, the housing choices of the urban poor. Yet there has been
an acute underinvestment in the improvement, expansion, and management of transportation
infrastructure as well as a lack of coherence in existing networks, e.g., in Metro Manila and other
metropolitan centers; no new high capacity mass transit facilities have been added to the system
since the 1990s and road construction has been limited (HUDCC and PIDS 2009). This is
compounded (or enabled) by the lack of planning integration among LGUs, especially in metro-
politan areas, a situation which has compromised both land use compatibility across local
boundaries, and the efficiency of basic services like transportation and traffic management
(Corpuz 2012). Underinvestment in connective infrastructure is also apparent at the national
scale, where spatial integration has been hampered by a “missing middle” (i.e., an inadequate
secondary [provincial] road network) as well as by an unintegrated road and maritime transport
system (Llanto 2007).35

         Construction codes and subdivision restrictions also greatly influence cost of supply.36 By
controlling floor-to-area ratios for instance, the State controls the consumption of land, the only
factor in which poor residents can outbid non-poor residents. Subdivision restrictions and construc-
tion codes, which are motivated to ensure public health, safety, and basic infrastructure services in
new developments, can also jack up capital costs (in exchange for less maintenance costs) to
levels beyond affordable thresholds. In short, regulations designed to ensure minimum standards
may in fact have adverse effects on market access to real estate assets by the urban poor.37

        To date, there has been no comprehensive audit of construction codes, design standards,
subdivision restrictions, and other existing regulations and their impact on the unit costs and
supply of housing. Suffice to say however that anecdotal accounts of both developers and urban
________________________________________________________________________________________
         35
            Llanto (2007) also observes that ironically, more attention is paid to integration with global markets (e.g.,
international airports) than domestic integration. As a result there are pockets of internationally-oriented economic
activity weakly integrated to the rest of the country. The link between geography, connective infrastructure, and
inclusive human development is also discussed in HDN 2013.

community groups that attempt to formalize their land and housing describe regulations that are
complex and incoherent and transaction costs that are shockingly high. For instance, Batas
Pambansa (BP) 220, which was intended to regulate greenfield (i.e., off-site) development, is not
appropriate for brownfield projects (self-help, incremental housing) nor enabling of other flexible
affordable housing solutions.38 Standards in the Fire Code are also unnecessarily high for
socialized housing significantly adding to cost (LGI 2016). Private developers estimate that it takes
as long as 18 months to secure all requirements for new developments; how much longer for an
organized ISF group with far less administrative and technical resources at its disposal. Among the
reasons stated for the reluctance of the private sector in pursuing socialized housing projects is
difficulties in government approval of subdivision/housing projects and difficult in financing
approvals (NISUS 2014). Part of the government’s own CMP backlog apparently has to do with
compliance issues, i.e., with “property laws, building laws, agrarian laws on conversion and other
regulations that are not suited to housing interventions for informal settler communities”39 – in
short government-generated transaction costs.

        Clearly, a necessary first step is a regulatory audit of existing building and subdivision
codes, development and land use planning guidelines, and relevant laws, for their impact on the
unit cost of land and housing (for owning or rental) and for improving access to formal markets.
An audit would directly inform the regulations and requirements of HLURB and other relevant
agencies. However, a more general assessment of government’s objectives for and level of
involvement in housing production given the level of involvement of NHA and SHFC in the sector
is needed. Are the public subsidies currently channeled through both NHA and SHFC, and intended
to support sustainable shelter solutions for lower urban income groups, obtaining their best social
returns? Public subsidies include all the public resources NHA and SHFC run on, whether self-
generated or received as a “subsidy” or “equity” from the national government, whether used in
“cost recoverable” programs or not. At bottom, the opportunity costs of NHA and SHFC assets
and income flows need to be transparently confronted.

        At the end of the day, supply side rigidities and other distortions encourage informal land
markets and unauthorized urban housing. As Strassman and Blunt (1993) observed of Metro
Manila in 1993 in the case of land: “If [land] prices were as low in comparable developing
countries . . . as much as 50% more shelter could have been built [a reallocation from the site
price] and fewer than [the current] 28% households would probably live under irregular tenure
arrangements. There would be more mobility and less squatters . . . .”

Housing finance system failures and expanding the reach of mortgage and non-mortgage finance
to middle and lower-middle income households

      Housing finance markets grow with and support efficient and inclusive urbanization.
However, they are subject to market failures especially at the bottom end. The critical questions

are: Where will normal market forces gradually expand housing finance systems to increase access
and where can well-targeted government intervention help accelerate this process? (Hoek-Smit
2009) How can households not reached by market forces even with government incentives be
assisted to obtain minimum standards of housing consumption?

         With respect to the first question, many households in the 4th to 8th deciles have incomes
that could suffice to access modest formal markets (rental or otherwise). Yet many remain in
substandard or informal housing. This is, in large part, because of the unavailability of market
finance products and services that can accommodate the variability of income flows, their lack of
wealth or saving, the uncertain collateral due to poor property rights or neighborhood risk, and
inefficiencies and incompleteness of housing finance markets (Hoek-Smit 2009). Behavioral
constraints as regards saving, undertaking debt, dealing with financial institutions, and the like
may also be a concern (Monsod 2015).

         Expanding the reach of housing finance to middle-and lower-middle income households
will require (1) system subsidies to make the housing finance system more efficient and
(2) subsidies that address specific constraints of target households who may have the purchasing
power but who remain at the margin of credit markets due to, say, saving constraints, employ-
ment, and earning volatility, or housing and neighborhood risk (Hoek-Smit 2009).40 The latter
refers to the risk that the value of the collateral decreases over time, making lenders less likely to
make loans in low and middle income neighborhoods.

         System subsidies are concerned with system imperfections due to market power,
e.g., from state sponsored institutions; lending market failures (in underserved markets) due to
the lack of mechanisms to deal with credit risk, high transaction costs of lending, and the like;
and funding market failures due to liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and prepayment risk (Hoek-
Smit 2009). As a matter of priority, the first two will be the focus here; a more extensive
evaluation of the current mortgage system and infrastructure is needed to better understand the
third.41 Priority system subsidies would therefore address (1) structural problems, i.e., removing
barriers to entry, innovation, and price competition; (2) credit risk or collateral risk for mortgage
lending, (3) high transaction costs for loan origination and servicing, and (4) expanding the take-up
and reach of market-based housing microfinance.42

________________________________________________________________________________________
             40
              This section draws heavily from Hoek-Smit (2009), which provides a detailed account of housing finance
subsidies.
             41
           Without appropriate markets for managing funding risks, interest rates will be higher and more volatile and
loan terms will be shorter (and appetite for fixed rate mortgages lower) than they otherwise would be, even when
primary lending institutions are vibrant (Hoek-Smit 2009: 434). It is not obvious, however, that a capital market-based
housing finance system will be optimal in our context at this time. Or, even if optimal, whether the participation of
government as originally contemplated (i.e., of NHMFC, HGC) should be maintained. The last comprehensive look at the
country’s mortgage system (in tandem with the contractual saving system) was in the late 1990s. A new evaluation is
badly needed.
             42
            Unless otherwise indicated, system subsidies are selected from Table 16.3 of Hoek-Smit (2009), which lists
constraints in the expansion of housing finance systems and corresponding system subsidies that have been employed
by different countries to address them. Those which are most appropriate to the Philippine context are mentioned here.
118                                                                                                        Monsod


         The first relates to the operations and privileges of state-sponsored housing finance
institutions, and an assessment of these operations, in the context of government’s objectives for
housing finance, is a necessary first step. “The first priority, and a prerequisite to the creation of a
more competitive and effective housing finance system, is the elimination of the (often hidden)
subsidies to state housing finance institutions or, alternatively, to provide access to these
subsidies by all qualified actors in the sector or reorient these subsidies to leverage private sector
participation” (Hoek-Smit 2009:433). To what extent does Pag-IBIG Fund currently help or hinder
entry, innovation, and price competition in relevant segments of the market? Can it better
contribute to the efficient expansion of the housing market while maintaining its fiduciary
responsibility to its members, and how (e.g., as an institutional investor? mortgage lender? subsidy
distributor?) Are resources at SHFC’s disposal best spent as mortgage lender and financier, or can
SHFC play a more strategic role, such as in reducing transactions costs in loan origination and
servicing for private providers? Can public corporations like HGC and NHMFC, with legacies of
financial distress, still play a role in enabling primary or secondary mortgage markets to work,
and if so, what role? Are there links to the broader financial sector (such as the contractual saving
sector) that need to be taken into account when assessing the operations of housing corporations?

         The second has to do with mitigating the risks attendant to lending down-market (Hoek-
Smit 2009). In particular, there are high risks in the lending market due to lack of credit and property
market information, poor foreclosure systems, lack of mechanisms to deal effectively with credit
risk, lack of consumer protection, and high transaction costs of lending. In these cases, system
subsidies may be better applied to (1) the provision of “public good” data on property and credit
markets, such as comprehensive property information, research in the standardization of mortgage
procedures, new credit instruments, and house price trends; (2) subsidies to borrower education,
(3) improving credit bureaus, foreclosure methods, and allowing payroll deductions, and (4) neigh-
borhood upgrading, which is critical to mitigating collateral risk and expanding private lending to
marginal neighborhoods. “The single-most-important barrier to lending in low-income markets is
the uncertainty of neighborhood factors that are critical in determining house-value movements”
(Hoek-Smit 2009: 438) Much broader infrastructure and institutional support – e.g., equity/public
investments – is often required before private lenders enter into low-income markets and
neighborhood improvement ventures.

        The high transaction costs of lending and originating may be addressed with improved
and standardized underwriting and servicing methods or with new business models of originating
and lending. System subsidies in support of the development and testing of new methods, products
and business models by banks and microfinance institutions could therefore be important. Housing
microfinance is not a substitute for affordable long-term mortgages but, in the context of a
comprehensive country-level housing finance strategy, can play a vital role in reducing qualitative
shortages (Daphnis 2009). The expansion of housing microfinance may also give rise to product or
process innovations that can spillover to mortgage markets (Monsod 2015).

      Incentives directed at creating avenues for middle income and lower-middle income
households at the margin of formal markets could be used to complement system subsidies.43
________________________________________________________________________________________
         43
             Unless otherwise indicated, these are drawn from Table 16.4 of Hoek-Smit (2009). Those most appropriate
to the Philippine context are mentioned here.
Rethinking Urban Housing Policy                                                                                119


Incentives here are critical since households in the 4th to 8th deciles may have the income to be
qualified for commercial mortgages and microfinance but face constraints on other fronts.44

         Where there is employment and earning volatility for instance, lending to the most
creditworthy households could be enabled by incentivizing private market/lender efforts to better
understand risk profiles of the sector and to price for this risk, incentivizing the development of
flexible mortgage instruments and servicing systems, or supporting borrower education. Where there
may be saving constraints, direct and on-budget grants could be used to alleviate down payment,
title and closing costs although these should be complemented by borrower education and a
savings program to assist households save for some of the equity in the house. Where there is
housing and neighborhood risk, mortgage insurance, home-maintenance education of first-time
homeowners, or, in the case of condominium ownership, support for an initial repair fund or a
condominium support organization, are strategic. Additionally, reducing neighborhood risk and
maintaining neighborhood value requires the active collaboration of local governments – i.e., their
agreement on investment plans for the installation and/or upgrading of infrastructure and
services – which may involve legal or government systems and not individual subsidies per se.
Matching grants from central government agencies to local government units for this purpose is
a potentially productive way to use scarce central government public resources to expand finance
and supply down-market.

        Note that the preceding system and household subsidies depart sharply from the usual
approach of interest-rate discounts on mortgage loans and other related subsidies. For this
reason, a review of the operations of housing corporations and an assessment of options for an
alternative application of public subsidies may need a third-party perspective and the partici-
pation or leadership of the Department of Finance (DOF), Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), and
Governance Commission for Government Owned and Controlled Corporations (GCG). Moreover,
as a review is being undertaken, proposals for new equity and subsidy infusions into the
corporations or their programs may need to be reconsidered or carefully disbursed in order to
avoid further lock-in.

Reaching the lowest income groups and household social assistance

        As earlier mentioned, it is likely that government has to play a more direct role in
increasing general housing consumption for this segment since incomes are likely to be too low to
access formal sector housing or financing. Increasing housing consumption is best served by
support aimed at securing property rights and public investments to improve access to urban
services and infrastructure (Hoek-Smit 2009). Actions to address real side constraints is the
necessary first step and priority action even for lowest income groups in other words. Correcting
real side distortions would also encourage private construction and development for the
segment.


________________________________________________________________________________________
         44
            These incentives are also best applied in the context of reasonably efficient housing market and housing
finance systems, otherwise they would be compensating for system shortcomings and be very costly (Hoek-Smit 2009).
120                                                                                                   Monsod


        Additionally, household social assistance is almost always necessary,45 for instance,
(1) grants in the form of serviced land with or without a core house, which households can then
complete incrementally; if already onsite, active support in securing property rights (e.g., possibly
through usufruct or direct negotiation with private owners) and for upgrading, both within and
around the community (e.g., through matching grants from central government agencies to local
government units for upgrading). Improving urban infrastructure and services is also strategic,
addressing neighborhood risk and allowing households to improve access to micro-credit and
other forms of debt finance.

        Other appropriate household subsidies are (2) home-improvement grants which can com-
plement upgrading schemes, including home-improvement grants for rental extensions of the
house, which can reach households that do not qualify for loans or microcredit; (3) support for
the establishment of community-based support systems to acquire building materials in bulk and
provide quality control; and (4) support for community savings and counseling programs that
would complement efforts to expand the reach of housing microfinance (Monsod 2015).

        There is likely to be room to reallocate budgetary outlays away from subsidized production
programs into services and grants that will advance the above four components (CMP for instance
is one way the above components have been innovatively integrated into one package). More
fundamentally however, reconfiguring housing social assistance and deciding on the level of
assistance that will be provided requires addressing broader questions: where does housing social
assistance rank among the other social priorities of government (say, against conditional cash
transfers)?46 What level of social assistance are central and local governments willing to allocate
to housing? These questions have not yet been confronted in large part because social subsidies
for housing have been predominantly off-budget. Once confronted however, there is a broad
consensus that any subsidies should be transparent and on-budget rather than be implicit and off-
budget. The use of corporations to deliver subsidies may not be consistent with this.

Growing the rental housing market

         Attracting more investors and increasing the supply of formal rental units requires in the
first instance a removal of rent control and any unduly restrictive and non-tenure neutral
regulation, taxes or subsidies which discourage rental investment in favor of ownership
investment (Hoek-Smit 2009). Beyond this however, the rental housing market “is in some ways
more complex than that for home ownership,” involving investors and tenants who are different
entities and different types of investors (e.g., private formal and informal landlords, nonprofit or
public entities; Hoek-Smit 2009:440). In other words, more information may be needed to design
context-specific interventions to incentivize investments into different segments, particularly
investment into the low-income rental segment, and to improve the tenure security and quality of

         46
           Which is not to say that increased budgetary allocations for housing is necessary for better housing
outcomes. International experience demonstrates that regulatory reforms matter more for housing than increased
public spending.
Rethinking Urban Housing Policy                                                                               121


housing of low-income renters. Encouraging local governments to design and test approaches
would be key.

        In the meantime a rental policy for the low income sector may be “best focused on the
general improvement of urban infrastructure and neighborhood services, which would improve
the quality of life of low-income renters more than almost any other government measures”
(Hoek-Smit 2009:442). Housing quality and the quality of life would also be improved by better
compliance with basic sanitation and safety codes. Access to microfinance could assist landlords
improve sanitation and other low-income rental housing services.

Institutional arrangements for inclusive urbanization and housing

         That housing policy has tried to forge ahead without squarely dealing with land and
property market institutions or connective infrastructure speaks to the absence of an urbani-
zation framework that explicitly underlies or informs national and subnational development planning
and investment decision-making.47 Urbanization is about the transformation of rural economies
into urban ones, a process that is never spatially even or balanced but which can be inclusive.48 An
inclusive urbanization strategy is necessarily geographic in orientation, best anchored at the
provincial level and supported regionally, and concerned for the efficiency and inclusiveness of
these processes as they take place across a portfolio of interdependent places (World Bank 2009,
HDN 2013). As it is, however, the national development plan and budget ̶ the Philippine
Development Plan (PDP) 2011-2016 and the plans before it ̶ is heavily sectoral in nature, reflecting
the priorities of cabinet-level agencies. This is hardly congruent with intersectoral prioritization
which is the essence of subnational area-based planning (HDN 2013, HUDCC and PIDS 2009).
Provinces are themselves crippled by their lack of effective planning integration authority over
component cities/municipalities (e.g., central government funding can bypass provinces and go
directly to component cities and municipalities) and, perversely, have no administrative or fiscal
authority over highly urbanized cities within their geographical boundaries.49 Other problems in
the institutional environment of urban development and housing are discussed in the National
Urban Development and Housing Framework (NUDHF) 2009-2011, but the NUDHF itself was
overlooked by PDP.50

        As organized, HUDCC is not able to provide leadership with respect to monitoring urban-
ization trends much less coordinating central government support for inclusive urbanization.
________________________________________________________________________________________
         47
            As discussed, HUDCC has focused on the production of housing outputs rather than on housing markets and
their enabling environment (e.g., coordination issues involved in urbanization).
         48
         Inclusive urbanization, or “concentration without congestion,” was one theme of the 2009 World
Development Report.
         49
           See HDN 2013 for a discussion. “Highly urbanized” and “independent component” cities are autonomous
from the provinces where they are geographically located. Among others, they do not share tax revenues with the
province and their officials are not subject to administrative supervision by provincial officials.
         50
           NUDHF was cited in a discussion on housing in PDP, Chapter 8, Social Development (NEDA 2011). Housing is
also featured in Chapter 5 on Infrastructure Development. Urbanization dynamics, benefits, and challenges are not
discussed or well-integrated into the PDP however.
122                                                                                     Monsod


Although authority in “urban development” is implied by its name, HUDCCs mandate is really the
coordination of and oversight over the national shelter program, as narrowly defined and
designed by the housing corporations. The membership of the council – which includes the key
shelter agencies, the three funders, and NEDA, DOF, DBM, DPWH, DBP, and two private sector
representatives – and the direct authority of the HUDCC chair (which extends only to key shelter
agencies) reflects this. Created before the Local Government Code was enacted in 1991, HUDCC
does not include DILG – which has an indispensable oversight role over subnational governments
– nor DOTC and DENR whose mandates are crucial to the quality of urbanization and housing
market dynamics. The membership of NEDA in HUDCC may compensate for the absence of
important agencies, but NEDA itself is often constrained by the vertical/sectoral framework of
central government. There are also statutory inter-agency committees under NEDA – such as the
Infrastructure Committee, Social Development Committee (SDC), Regional Development
Committee (RDCom), and National Land Use Committee (NLUC) – but the national shelter program,
treated as a social concern, is primarily assigned to SDC rather than RDCom.

        Monitoring and supporting inclusive urbanization is by nature a coordinative task; it is
not, and should not be, the work of any one department. Rather than a department of housing
and urban development (which has long been proposed), a more feasible and, perhaps, efficient
strategy to redirect policy and re-energize the sector would be to reconfigure HUDCC to include
DILG and NEDA as co-chairs, as well as make HUDCC a co-chair of the RDCom, expanding focus of
the latter to explicitly include urbanization (i.e., Regional Development and Urbanization). A
reconfiguration would also involve assigning to HUDCC control over the design and allocation of
state subsidies for housing production, finance, and urban development, including how these
subsidies could be channeled, i.e., by different providers – private, nongovernment, central
government agency, local government unit – of which the housing corporations would only be
one option.

Notes:
         1. NHA production of units under medium-rise buildings and completed housing are counted under the financing program that provides mortgage loans
            to its buyers. “Other housing assistance” (e.g., tenurial assistance, technical assistance, home improvement, among others) is excluded.
         2. With possible double counting.
         3. In 1987-2000, production by HGC. In 2011-2015, PNP/AFP housing.
         4. Technically, this may be considered as indirect housing assistance. The certificate given to beneficiaries is only a preliminary instrument and will be
            converted to a deed of sale only when the beneficiary starts to pay any required monetary consideration.
         5. Prior to 1997, mortgage financing was under NHMFC. From 1997 onwards, it was under HDMF. Other GFI end user accounts (LBP, SSS, DBP, GSIS) are
            not included here but they report about 26,900 units between 2001 and 2010 and 2,423 units between 2011 and 2015.

                        Enabling Local Rental Housing Market1




In-city affordable housing need not be focused on homeownership alone. Creating a hospitable
environment for rental housing investment by the private sector is a strategy that should also be
given attention.


Rationale for Rental Housing

        Rental housing is a key feature of a vibrant housing market and an essential component of
affordable housing. While homeownership is a natural aspiration of all households, the demand
for rental housing is consistent with lifecycle events. Peppercorn and Taffin (2011) note that the
demand for rental housing in most countries arises from the following:
      • Workers and young professionals in urban areas who need safe and decent housing at
        reasonable distance from their place of employment; but either cannot or do not want
        to commit to a particular location for a long period of time;
      • Students who live in dormitories;
      • Those experiencing transitional events in their life (e.g., divorce or separation);
      • Families who cannot afford or qualify for a mortgage, does not have sufficient income or
        have not saved enough to meet down payment requirements; and
      • People sharing space with relatives.

The same study shows that rental housing makes up a significant percentage of housing around
the world, ranging from 11 percent in India to 63 percent in Switzerland. In major cities the
percentage of renters can be even higher (Table 1). The experiences of many countries/cities
show that rental housing is an option for decent affordable shelter and secure tenure.

         It is also observed that homeownership alone can have negative incentives to relocate
closer to jobs. For instance, in the Philippines, those living far from job centers are discouraged
to relocate in cities owing to poor housing conditions and lack of decent affordable housing
especially for those with families. Urban areas are employment centers and avenues for poverty
alleviation. The lack of rental housing in urban areas constrains workers mobility and opportunities
for better employment.

Housing Tenure in the Philippines
        Homeownership is the dominant tenure in the Philippines. As of 2012, only about 7 percent
of total households in the country are renting and this proportion hardly changed over time
(Table 2). However, there is a significant percentage of the population in informal housing tenure.
More than 20 percent of total households in the country are either renting a lot or house and lot
under informal arrangements with landowners that usually have no legal rights over land.

         In Metro Manila, about 23 percent of households rent, which is about three times the
national average. Households living under informal tenure remain significant at 20 percent or
one-fifth of total households in Metro Manila. In the last two decades (1991-2012), renter
households grew by only 35 percent while households in informal tenure increased by 53 percent.
The rental market has not responded as expected to the rapid increase in Metro Manila
population during the period. While homeownership grew by 119 percent during the period, the
proportion of home-owning households declined by 4 percentage points from 2000, which implies
that increases in Metro Manila household population mostly fall in informal tenure arrangements.

        Between 1990 and 2000, about 60 percent of the population increase in Metro Manila
was attributed to net migration (Cabegin 2010). Migrant households do not usually need home-
ownership at the start. Anthropological studies on housing conditions of migrant households in
Metro Manila (which was also mentioned in People’s Summit II)2 indicate that the shelter need of
new migrants is for affordable rental housing. However, the lack of affordable rental housing
forces families to reside in informal settlements, which eventually become their permanent
homes as homeownership in the formal market is also constrained by affordability and access to
mortgage finance. Government housing policies and programs have been bias toward home-
ownership, neglecting the development of the rental housing sector or, worst, discriminating this
sector through policies such as the rent control law.


Policy Recommendation
        Rental housing should be viewed as a significant part of the country’s housing stock
instead of a temporary or alternative solution to housing. Government needs to modify the
negative perceptions on rental housing and adopt policies to support the development of the
rental housing market. Developing the rental market in the country will require actions on the
following areas:

         Legal framework
         There is a need to create a balanced owners’ and tenants’ rights and duties. Rent control
is the legal system that may deter private investment in rental housing. Studies have noted a
reduction of private rental housing stock due to rent control laws (Gandhi and others 2014;
Peppercorn and Taffin 2011). In particular, the legal framework should be clear on the following
items: (1) rent setting and rent increase, (2) duration of contract, (3) procedures for resolving
conflicts, and (4) stability and adaptability of legal dispositions.

         Incentives
       These can be in the form of tax incentives and other supply-side subsidies. While the
development of socialized housing for sale is given tax holidays and incentives, the rental sector
does not have these privileges. Rental business operations can be heavily taxed, thus many rental
business operators remain unregistered and therefore hidden from regulatory building control.
Lack of incentives also discourages landowners from improving their rental properties.
Government may consider as incentives VAT (value-added tax)-reduced rate or exemption,
income or profit tax rebate or exemption, and property tax rebate or exemption. Moreover, small
landowners can be encouraged to invest in affordable rental through microfinance and credit

          A parallel activity of the national housing summit was the holding of a people’s summit, organized and
attended by people’s organizations and their partner nongovernment organizations. Two such summits were convened,
on 22 July and 6 October 2015, each time gathering some 100 members of POs and NGOs as well as selected
representatives of national government agencies and private sector groups. A third people’s summit took place on
11 February 2016 for a discussion of the policies and other recommendations being proposed in the housing summit.

guarantees or public-private partnership. Rental vouchers or rental payment guarantees can be
targeted at poor households and combined with private sector incentives.

        Professional property management for public rental properties
       Local government unit (LGU)-based public rental housing can be supported in the short to
medium term for temporary housing. So that the experience of vertical slums can be avoided,
community and LGU management of public rental housing should be strengthened. The learnings
from the Valenzuela City public rental housing program can provide insights for similar programs.

Economic development inevitably brings a high rate of urbanization as economic activities and
employment opportunities increase in urban areas. In the Philippines, the growth in the urban
population has been accompanied by an increase in the number of people living in informal
settlements. In Metro Manila, the estimated number of informal settler families (ISF) range from
163,094 as of end-2010, based on the 2010 Census on Population and Housing (Magtulis and
Ramos 2013), to 250,895 as of end-2012, based on the 2012 Family Income and Expenditure
Survey (Monsod 2015), to 584,524 as of 2011 based on Metro Manila city reports (Gaurano 2011).
The surveys and methods/parameters used in these general estimates differ. In the overall,
however, informal settlers typically have no secure land and housing tenure and many have poor
access to basic services.

      The Philippines’ improved economic performance during the Aquino administration, while
noteworthy for creating a policy environment conducive to investments, has nevertheless been
assessed to be not inclusive enough in its outcomes. The improved economic performance has yet
to translate into improved incomes, opportunities, and well-being for those belonging to the
lower-income segments of the population. Among them would be the urban low-wage workers in
the formal and informal sectors who reside in informal settlements.

       One good known to have a significant impact on expanding economic opportunities and
increasing well-being for the poor is adequate housing. In urban areas, the most critical factor
currently affecting the supply of and access to urban housing is land. The country’s positive
macroeconomic performance has intensified the demand for land in cities particularly for
infrastructure, commercial, and financial activities and formal housing to support a growing urban
population. Given the fixed supply of urban land and competing demands for it, its allocation and
use becomes a critical focus of public policy.


Guiding Principles

        Housing is a basic human right. As the main institution entrusted with the responsibility of
protecting and promoting the common good and the economic, social, cultural, and political
rights of its citizens, the State is responsible for making the provision of housing as broadly
accessible as possible.

        Housing encompasses not only the physical dwelling structure but also the building of
communities and neighborhoods that actually function as enablers of social, physical, and other
forms of capital that in turn foster people’s sustainable pursuit and attainment of human develop-
ment. Thus the provision of housing must be embedded in the broader mandate of inclusive and
sustainable urbanization.

        At the same time, the provision of housing is dependent on the workings of the market.
Thus the autonomy of the market needs to be recognized. The private sector, which includes
private commercial providers of housing as well as households and communities, has a vital role
to play in the provision of housing. Stakeholders respond to market-based incentives and
disincentives.

         The housing market in turn responds to spatial, demographic, economic, and other
signals. Urbanization policy and management, including zoning ordinances, local development use
plans and the placement (or absence) of mass transportation systems, and infrastructure and
social services, is one source of signals. Government creates incentives and disincentives to
encourage actions or behavior on the part of certain actors to achieve desired development
outcomes, such as making urbanization as inclusive as possible and increasing private sector
production of housing for low income sectors. Making urbanization as inclusive as possible implies
that government must play a role in ensuring that no social group is systematically excluded from
the advantages brought by urbanization, including access to secure shelter and employment.
However, governments by themselves are rarely able to provide for the shelter needs of the
lowest income households. Other sectors, notably the communities, civic groups and NGOs, and
the private sector, have a role in broadening access to and increasing the provision of this vital
good. Thus, a key governance challenge is designing institutional arrangements and policies that
would facilitate multistakeholder ownership of and participation in housing-focused initiatives
targeted at the lowest-income urban households.

         Technically, land is a private good (i.e., it is “rival” and “excludable”), although some
portions are designated for strict public management and use (such as watersheds). But land (as
space) is a necessary input to urban shelter of any type, making its use and allocation of particular
significance to the attainment of the goal of increasing economic opportunities for the poor,
including informal workers. If government considers inclusive development a priority goal, urban
land use policy must be aligned with this goal. This becomes even more compelling in a situation
where a quarter of the population of the country’s premier urban center is without formal
housing tenure. A basic challenge of governance then is making decisions on land use and
allocation as inclusive as possible so that the needs of the various social sectors are seriously
taken into consideration and reasonably addressed.


Scope of the Policy Note
     This policy note seeks to examine the role and functions that various stakeholders would
need to perform in the provision of housing within the context of broader urbanization processes.
Refining Stakeholder Roles and Relations                                                                        143


Specifically, it aims to clarify the role of the State and, within it, national government agencies and
local government units, in managing urban development. It outlines a framework for defining the
roles of different stakeholders, with a particular emphasis on the role of the local government and
the need to strengthen its current capacity to carry out this role. Although government policy
must aim to respond to the housing needs of all income groups, the policy note is mainly focused
on addressing the housing need of the lowest-income urban households.


Principles and Considerations

         In a market economy such as what exists in the Philippines, the private sector acts as the
principal provider of housing. Government’s role is to enable markets to function efficiently so
that resources are allocated to achieve the maximum welfare for the greatest number. However,
market failures may also exist, and could even be more significant in certain segments of the
market as may happen for instance in the lower end of the housing market, where both market-
provided finance and supply are constrained by various factors and could prevent low income
households from accessing housing. Government then intervenes to address market failures,
through regulations, taxes, or subsidies, or, if necessary, the direct provision (via financing or
production, or both), of these goods or services. However, even when markets function perfectly,
the distribution of goods and services may not be aligned with societal preferences, in which case,
government may want to act to achieve specific redistributive or equity objectives. For this
purpose, it may adopt policies and instruments for facilitating access to necessary goods such as
land, urban services, and infrastructure, where access to these goods are seen to unduly restrict
the improvement of income and welfare of disadvantaged social sectors.

         Where the provision of housing is concerned, dysfunctional land markets, poor or badly
planned transportation infrastructure and outdated planning and building standards have driven
the unit price of housing up.2 It is the role of government to correct these dysfunctions through
institutional and regulatory interventions. Institutional interventions would include refining the
mandates of the different instrumentalities of government at the national and local levels to meet
development and efficiency objectives. Under the Urban Development and Housing Act (UDHA),
city governments have the primary responsibility for providing housing assistance and are
specifically mandated to conduct an inventory of lands and identify sites for socialized housing.
Yet these are but a few of several local government mandates that have not been implemented
by many local government units (LGUs). Limited institutional capacity on the part of the LGU and
limited spaces and capacity for effective claim-making on the part of constituents, among other
factors, have contributed to this state of affairs.

       A glaring gap at present is the absence of a coherent assignment of functions as regards
the managing of urbanization processes which are in many ways responsible for the most critical
urban dysfunctions that in turn restrict access to valued goods such as housing and basic services.
________________________________________________________________________________________
         2
         The main policy paper provides an extensive discussion of real and financial side issues in the provision of
housing and makes a case for the need to attend to the real side issues which have been largely neglected by
government housing policy.
144                                                                                          Karaos


At the moment, this role seems to be shared among the different levels of government (central,
provincial, municipal/city) but the specific mandate of each level in relation to managing
urbanization processes is not clearly articulated in institutional terms. Moreover, the inter-
connection across the various levels is also unclear. Municipal and city governments have urban
planning and land use mandates under existing laws, yet efficiency considerations merit planning
and land use decisions and actions on a spatial scale that transcends LGU boundaries. Mechanisms
for establishing inter-LGU urban development and planning systems do not exist.


Institutional Implications
         Reconfiguring the housing sector of the government bureaucracy and refining the
mandates of local governments and key shelter agencies to address the issues cited above will be
a key challenge for improving the current state of housing provision in the country. The legislative
proposal to create a Department of Housing and Urban Development (DHUD) presents an
opportunity for rethinking the configuration of the housing bureaucracy. Vital in this rethinking is
identifying first the crucial elements which the bureaucracy must have before deciding on the
specific organizational form it should take. Hopefully the reconfiguration of the housing sector
would be informed by the ideas and frameworks coming out of the National Housing Summit so
that the fundamental problems constraining government capacity to respond to the housing
shortage are squarely addressed.

        Some lessons from other countries have pointed to the advantages of decentralizing the
provision of housing by empowering local governments to respond more effectively to the
housing need of their constituents (e.g., Brazil or South Africa). Nevertheless, local governments
need substantial political and other forms of support from the central government, among them
financial resources, policy directions, technical assistance, and instruments to facilitate policies
and mandates. Political support from the highest levels of government would be crucial to
implementing large-scale housing programs.

        Another key lesson is that the provision of housing services particularly to low income
households is best done in an integrated manner, focusing on the development of neighbor-
hoods rather than just housing. This is the insight that informed the replacement of the
Department of Housing with the Department of Human Settlements in South Africa. This might
also be the reason why housing provision is under the purview of the Ministry of Cities in Brazil, a
country that has implemented one of the most far-reaching housing programs for low- and
middle-income households.

Delineating central, provincial, and city/municipal government roles
        Given the considerations cited above, in particular the need to anchor interventions in
housing on broader urbanization processes, there is a need for a more explicit integration or
grounding of urbanization policy in development planning, both central and local, as well as a
better articulation of assignments in managing urbanization as between central, provincial,
and city/municipal governments. The province would seem to be the level where inclusive

urbanization – as rural economies transform to urban ones ̶ can be best observed and managed.
The central government will play a supportive, yet also a steering role, by performing functions
like facilitating the collection and sharing of information useful to subnational units, facilitating
coordination across state agencies and between local governments and state agencies, designing
policies and programs, including the design and provision of subsidies for housing, and integrating
urban development plans to be consistent with national policy frameworks and development
goals.

        There are four possible options for filling this need given the existing institutional setup
of the housing sector. The first is to strengthen the present Housing and Urban Development
Coordinating Council (HUDCC) to incorporate the above mandates and functions. The strengthened
HUDCC could take the form of a new department, which could be a second option, or an
interagency council, that includes the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) as a
co-chair, to take care of the oversight function over LGUs.

         A third option, which may also be done in conjunction with the first two options, is to
create a bureau under DILG incorporating those functions that have to do with supporting and
monitoring the housing and urban development roles of LGUs. Since the DILG already has a
supervisory role vis-à-vis provincial, city, and municipal governments, adding the urbanization-
related functions and mandates to its existing set of oversight and guiding functions vis-à-vis LGUs
might be less disruptive to the existing institutional setup Among the functions that the central
government might perform within this setup are (1) providing the urbanization framework
that will inform local development planning and investment decisions of public institutions as
well as the private sector, (2) instituting mechanisms for ensuring the coherence of local develop-
ment plans and their integration into provincial development and physical plans, (3) building the
urban planning capacities of LGUs, and (4) providing grants to LGUs to incentivize local develop-
ment and shelter planning along desired directions. It might also create policies to facilitate and
incentivize practices such as land sharing and land consolidation for the efficient use of land in
urban areas.

        A fourth option would be a cabinet-level interagency committee under the National
Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Board, or alternatively, a Cabinet Cluster for
Urbanization. There are currently seven such interagency committees under NEDA’s purview:
Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC), Infrastructure Committee (InfraCom),
Investment Coordination Committee (ICC), Social Development Committee (SDC), Committee on
Tariff and Related Matters (CTRM), Regional Development Committee (RDCom), and National
Land Use Committee (NLUC). NEDA Board interagency committees figure significantly into
national development and investment planning. DBCC, Infracom, ICC, SDC, and CTRM are well-
known within the bureaucracy – DBCC introduces the budget to Congress; InfraCom, SDC, and ICC
are the ones involved in overseas development assistance and public investment processing and
approval; CTRM is involved in global trade negotiations and the like – RDCom and NLUC less so.
These committees also align themselves to support cabinet clusters as needed. This option would
be easier to set up in the short-term compared with the other options since this type of insti-
tutional arrangement is commonly practiced.

        Local governments are presently saddled with many responsibilities, not the least of
which is making local development, land use, and shelter plans. This is the reason that they need
to be technically assisted and capacitated. Moreover, they need resources for implementing their
plans. Performance-based incentives such as matching grants from the national government can
be given to LGUs for outcomes achieved according to agreed development priorities. For instance,
the reduction in the number of households residing in informal settlements could be a desired
outcome around which local land use and shelter plans could be developed and implemented.

        Under the Local Government Code and UDHA, city and municipal governments are
primarily responsible for addressing the housing needs of the population. UDHA spells out concrete
measures to be undertaken by LGUs in this regard: (1) registration of qualified socialized housing
beneficiaries, (2) inventory of lands suitable for socialized housing, and (3) identification of sites
for socialized housing. During meetings of the Thematic Working Group (TWG) on Participatory
Governance of the Housing Summit, DILG identified as factors inhibiting LGUs’ performance of
their housing-related mandates the LGUs’ dependence on national government for logistics and
finances, implying the LGUs’ lack of capacity and resources to undertake their mandated tasks,
and the absence of perceived immediate benefits of undertaking these mandates. Institutional
reforms would be needed to overcome these hurdles.

       When given technical support, LGUs are able to effectively carry out their planning roles
as demonstrated by initiatives such as the Citywide Development Approach (CDA) piloted in three
LGUs in Metro Manila.3 Participation of civil society organizations and organized communities in
the CDA process has also engendered increased social capital at the local level which can be
harnessed by LGUs toward advancing their development and housing initiatives.

         In principle, CDA as an approach to city shelter planning must also be adopted in cities
and municipalities that serve as host localities of resettled ISFs. The planning of resettlement sites
as currently practiced leaves much to be desired as evidenced by the myriad of problems
encountered by ISFs recently relocated under the government’s Oplan Likas.4 Those relocated to
off-city sites have been experiencing the most serious problems, among them the absence or lack
of basic and social services (e.g., water, electricity, school buildings for high school students,
equipped health centers) and defective housing units. Poor coordination between DILG and NHA,
on the one hand, and host LGUs, on the other, during the planning stage of a resettlement project
has resulted in dire impacts on the quality of life of the resettled ISFs. These have been extensively
documented, reported, and discussed with the concerned government agencies at the two
consultation workshops organized by the House Committee on Housing and Urban Development
________________________________________________________________________________________
         3
           A program spearheaded by the World Bank, the Citywide Development Approach provides technical
assistance to LGUs and builds multistakeholder partnerships at the city level toward addressing the housing needs of
poor communities. The pilot LGUs are Muntinlupa City, Barangay 177 of Caloocan City, and District 6 of Quezon City
         4
           Oplan Likas is a relocation program that began in 2012 and is being implemented by DILG, in conjunction
with LGUs, NHA, PCUP, and DSWD (Department of Social Welfare and Development), involving ISFs residing along
identified waterways for priority cleanup in Metro Manila. The national government has allocated PHP50 billion for in-
city and off-city relocation of the affected ISFs. Some 25,000 ISFs have been relocated to date to 20 in-city and off-city
resettlement sites, mostly administered by NHA. A small number of ISFs are relocating to in-city and near-city sites
adopting a “people’s plan” approach, with housing finance provided by the Social Housing Finance Corporation (SHFC).
Refining Stakeholder Roles and Relations                                                                            147


and the Presidential Commission for the Urban Poor (PCUP) while Housing Summit meetings were
also ongoing.

         The current institutional arrangement for planning and implementing off-city resettlement
is extremely inadequate in that no government agency takes responsibility for the provision of
basic services in NHA resettlement sites.5 The sorry state of government resettlement sites under
Oplan Likas is a testament to the dysfunctionality of the existing institutional setup. One
intervention in the short-term is the provision of additional resources, coursed either through
a national agency such as NHA or the host LGU, to subsidize the installation of essential
infrastructure so that basic services can be provided promptly. In the long-term, planning
processes have to be radically improved so that host LGUs would receive the logistical and
financial resources needed to put up necessary infrastructure to service the needs of resettled
ISFs. A more systemic solution is to limit or abandon the practice of off-city or distant relocation
of ISFs altogether.

Refining the mandates of state agencies
         In pursuit of its objective to “increase access to decent, affordable, and secure shelter,”
government has largely assumed the role of producer of housing units, either by direct production
or by below-market financing. State agencies that have engaged in housing finance include the
National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation (NHMFC), SHFC, and the Home Development
Mutual Fund (also known as Pag-IBIG Fund). NHA, officially considered as a producer of housing,
technically also performs a lending function in that the beneficiaries of its housing projects take
out a loan from NHA and amortize payment of the loan to NHA. Whether there should be three
state agencies extending loans for housing is a question that government must ask itself. A more
fundamental question is whether government should be in the business of lending for housing.
Answering these questions is essential but not simple. A necessary first step would be for
government to conduct a review of its housing finance programs vis-à-vis their stated objectives
and intended results. Government must be clear on its objectives and the comparative advantages
of state agencies lending for housing to various target groups as compared to the private sector
doing it, with the government only enabling markets to work more efficiently. Such an evaluation
should include an assessment of the various forms and uses of subsidies.

         Aside from housing finance, the production of housing is another function that the private
sector also performs. In fact, housing in informal settler communities is usually done in an
incremental fashion and by ISF themselves. NHA, the agency officially designated as responsible for
production, is actually either outsourcing the production of housing or purchasing built housing
units from private developers. The effectiveness and efficiency of this institutional setup should
________________________________________________________________________________________
         5
            NHA reasons that the provision of services is not its mandate and that the subdivision developers that
construct the housing units are not compelled and do not have the resources to put up the infrastructure for basic
services (e.g., water or power lines to connect the resettlement sites to the main lines of the water and power
companies). The host LGUs for their part are not prepared and financially able to put up the needed infrastructure. This
begs the question of how the location of the resettlement sites is determined in the first place, and why the cost of the
installation of this needed infrastructure is not included in the budget of site development. This cost can in fact be
subsidized by the national government as this is a public good necessary for poverty alleviation.
148                                                                                                          Karaos


be assessed vis-à-vis alternative arrangements. The government might be better off providing
technical assistance and housing subsidies to target groups such as ISF to help them with
incremental housing (e.g., in Community Mortgage Program [CMP] sites or slum upgrading) or
help develop low-cost rental housing in their communities. Where incremental housing is not
possible (e.g., in-city relocation where multi-story housing is to be built), competition among
private developers, coupled with regulatory interventions directed at improving the ease of doing
business (e.g., obtaining licenses and permits), would theoretically help bring down the cost of
housing units. Targeted subsidies can be provided directly to low income homebuyers or renters.

        Capacity building for ISFs and their organizations to ensure that they can access govern-
ment housing assistance and subsidies is another necessary function and is discussed in the
following section. This can be undertaken by a specialized national agency (e.g., SHFC, unbundled
from the housing finance function) or by a unit within DSWD focusing on community develop-
ment specifically for shelter provision.

Civil society participation
         Civil society groups (e.g., community associations, NGOs) in the Philippines have always
been quite active in influencing government policies and programs on housing for low-income
communities. As early as the seventies, under martial law conditions, organized communities in
the Tondo Foreshore Area advocated with NHA for onsite upgrading and near-site or in-city
resettlement. UDHA, largely a product of the united advocacy of urban poor organizations and
NGOs in the early nineties, basically upheld the same policy orientation by mandating LGUs to
allocate land and designate socialized housing sites within the cities for urban poor housing. This
policy thrust has been put into practice, albeit to a very limited extent, in various presidential land
proclamations (some of which predated UDHA) and in the creation of CMP. More recently, also in
response to civil society advocacy for in-city housing for urban informal settlers, the Aquino
government allocated PHP50 billion for relocating and rehousing ISFs residing in danger areas in
Metro Manila, principally those inhabiting the banks of waterways. This initiative led to the
preparation of “People’s Plans” by organized ISF communities assisted by support NGOs which
involve the development of multi-story housing designed by ISF themselves to be built on in-city
sites that are selected or approved by them.

        For almost fifty years, civil society actions have consistently pushed for a housing policy
emphasizing onsite upgrading and in-city resettlement in opposition to the predominant govern-
ment policy of off-city resettlement. The contradiction between the two approaches has been a
running theme in civil society-government engagement on housing issues.

        At the Housing Summit TWG sessions on participatory governance, and articulated more
emphatically in the first two People’s Summits,6 POs and NGOs complained of LGUs’ nonrecognition
of and lack of support for People’s Plans; the continuing eviction of ISF communities and their
________________________________________________________________________________________
         6
           These people’s summits, considered as a parallel activity of the national housing summit, were convened on
22 July and 6 October 2015. Each of these gathering were attended by over 100 representative of POs and NGOs as well
as national government agencies and private sector groups. A third people’s summit took place on 11 February 2016 for
a discussion of the policies and other recommendations being proposed in the housing summit.
Refining Stakeholder Roles and Relations                                                         149


relocation to off-city and ill-equipped relocation sites; underrepresentation of urban poor groups
in local special bodies that make decisions on their housing situation; non-implementation of UDHA
mandates to LGUs on land inventory, registration of socialized housing beneficiaries and designation
of socialized housing sites; and poor coordination between LGUs that send and receive relocated
families. These issues persist even as some headway has been achieved in creating spaces for
institutionalized participation of civil society organizations through the newly established High
Density Housing (HDH) program of SHFC and the Citywide Development Approach (CDA) being
piloted in three cities and two barangay in Metro Manila. Community associations participating
in SHFC’s HDH program have been encountering problems with getting government approvals
for various requirements from national government agencies and city government offices.
Communities that have undergone a people’s planning process run into problems with their LGUs
or the Department of Public Works and Highways when the latter agencies are compelled by
higher authorities to clear danger areas of ISF. What this suggests is that participatory initiatives
will not be able to achieve their expected results without the requisite institutional reforms as
outlined above (e.g., refining state agency and LGU mandates) that can create mechanisms for
harmonizing approaches and policies across the various levels of government.

        Another critical factor limiting civil society participation is the low level of technical and
organizational capacity of POs and NGOs. Participatory processes require a massive input of
capacity-building and technical assistance as attested to by both SHFC’s HDH program and CDA.
Some technical know-how is required for accessing information on land and acquiring land and for
preparing people’s plans. The estate management of the multi-story buildings being constructed
under the HDH program, indispensable for the success of the government’s in-city housing
approach, also requires heavy investment in the capacity building of POs and NGOs. When
government programs rely heavily on people’s participation for their success, it may be worth-
while for government to mandate a specialized agency to focus on community development and
capacity building. Thailand’s Community Organizations Development Institute (CODI) is an inde-
pendent public organization under the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security which
supports community processes controlled by poor people through vehicles such as community
savings, community loans, and revolving funds. CODI has successfully supported citywide slum
upgrading programs all over Thailand using this approach.

        Government endorsement of participatory processes must be backed up by bold insti-
tutional interventions and budgetary support. For participatory processes to achieve their
intended results in terms of poverty reduction, government must be prepared to dedicate resources
and the organization for providing poor communities and households the capacities needed for
effective engagement on housing and other welfare concerns.


Recommendations
        Immediate/Short-term
        1. Provide technical assistance to DILG to study the best way to provide the logistical
           and other support to LGUs to enable them to carry out their mandated task of land
150                                                                                        Karaos


          inventory, registration of social housing beneficiaries, and identification of social
          housing sites. An Executive Order (EO) may be issued to create the mechanisms for
          downloading the necessary support to LGUs.

      2. Promote and expand the Citywide Development Approach among LGUs other than
         the pilot cities, including those that serve as host LGUs of resettled ISFs, to enable
         these LGUs to make shelter plans through a participatory process, and to systematically
         program their shelter interventions, tapping onto the shelter programs of the key
         shelter agencies. This will include the designation of lands for social housing projects,
         including but not limited to the disposition of already proclaimed lands, and unlock-
         ing private lands suitable for social housing through a range of policy instruments
         (e.g., incentives, land swaps, expropriation).

      3. Issue an EO to expand the pilot project for undertaking the ground validation of the
         inventory of land and ISF undertaken in Quezon City to the remaining 16 LGUs of
         Metro Manila. This expansion of the pilot can also be coordinated by DILG and the
         resulting database will be kept by DILG and shared with HUDCC. A mechanism for
         updating the database must be provided as well as the needed resources which can
         come from budgetary appropriations.

      4. DILG to develop and implement a pilot program to test different ways of incentivizing
         LGUs to institutionalize participatory local shelter planning in the context of develop-
         ment and physical plans of the regions/provinces where they are located. This pilot
         program must include LGUs outside Metro Manila. One type of incentive could be
         funds for local development projects shown to be part of or consistent with provincial/
         regional development and physical plans. There needs to be a mechanism for
         checking the coherence of the components of the plan and LGUs will be rewarded
         for outcomes. It is also recommended that participatory local shelter planning and
         well-functioning Local Housing Boards with civil society representation be included in
         DILG’s criteria for giving cities and urban LGUs a Seal of Good Local Governance.

      5. Develop the capacity within DILG to guide, assist, and monitor LGUs in developing
         urban development plans that would deal with the challenges of urbanization,
         including the provision of infrastructure and transport, and basic and social services
         including shelter. DILG to provide capacity building and technical assistance to LGUs in
         developing and implementing housing programs including public rental housing and
         estate management schemes. DILG can tap the private sector, the Local Government
         Academy (LGA), and academe for this purpose.

      6. Review the roles, functions, and mandates of state-owned shelter institutions vis-à-vis
         the evolution of the banking sector and microfinance institutions with a view to fine-
         tuning their housing finance programs and interventions so that they complement and
         not displace the private sector in providing needed financing for housing.
Refining Stakeholder Roles and Relations                                                         151


        7. Provide technical assistance to HUDCC toward strengthening its role in monitoring
           urbanization trends and impacts and developing an urbanization framework that
           would guide local and regional development plans so that these will be proactive and
           responsive to people’s needs in housing, transport, infrastructure, and services. The
           assistance will include policy recommendations for providing incentives to the private
           sector as well as necessary policy support and regulations for broadening the access
           of the poor to public housing programs.

        8. Create a mechanism for providing capacity building and technical assistance to ISF
           community organizations for shelter planning, savings, financial management, and
           accessing government housing programs. The mechanism will identify an agency
           (whether an existing or a new one) that would assist ISF community organizations in
           preparing and carrying out people’s plans and other community-initiated housing
           schemes. The mechanism can be integrated into existing agency programs like CMP
           and HDH programs of SHFC and the community-based housing programs of NHA or
           institutionalized in a single agency. Study how best to institutionalize such a mechanism
           (e.g., unbundle the housing finance and capacity building functions of SHFC and
           strengthen its community development and capacity building roles or create a unit
           within DSWD to engage in community development specifically for shelter provision).

        9. Provide the needed resources, coursed either through a national agency such as NHA
           or the host LGU, to subsidize the installation of essential infrastructure so that basic
           services in existing resettlement sites can be provided promptly. A more systemic
           solution is to limit or abandon the practice of off-city or distant relocation of ISFs
           altogether.

        10. DILG or HUDCC to study and conduct consultations with all levels of government
            (barangay, city, province, region) to explore mechanisms and policy instruments
            toward integrating local urban development plans, including local shelter plans, into
            provincial and regional development plans so that there is synergy among component
            plans and investments at the different levels (e.g., infrastructure and transport
            investments at regional or provincial level are harmonized with housing investments
            at local level in terms of location, timing, and targeting). In this way, public resources
            are utilized rationally and efficiently.

        Long-term
        1. Strengthen the capacity of LGUs for undertaking participatory urban planning and
           development and forging multistakeholder partnerships. The principle of embedding
           the provision of housing in the broader mandate of inclusive and sustainable
           urbanization must find institutional expression in strengthened and capacitated LGUs
           that engage various sectors (communities, NGOs, private sector) in urban planning
           and development. If all urban LGUs are thus empowered and capacitated, the
           dichotomy between in-city and off-city resettlement will disappear because all LGUs
152                                                                                       Karaos


          will have the resources and multistakeholder arrangements to address the housing
          needs of their constituents.

      2. Strengthen HUDCC and consider institutionalizing the urban development role of DILG
         by making it a co-chair of HUDCC so that its enabling role vis-à-vis city and municipal
         governments is made effective. Create a bureau within DILG for assisting and
         monitoring LGUs in the performance of their urban development functions and
         mandates.

      3. Reconfigure the public housing sector in accordance with the review of the mandates
         of state-sponsored shelter agencies vis-à-vis the envisioned housing strategies for
         increasing the participation of the private sector to leverage public resources. The
         four options presented in this policy note (page 145) could provide a starting point for
         studying and deciding on the most suitable institutional setup.

      4. Designate or create a state agency that will provide community development assistance
         to ISF communities and capacity building assistance to community organizations to
         enable them to engage effectively with LGUs in local shelter and development
         planning and budgeting and to access housing subsidies and other resources from
         both public and private institutions to meet their shelter needs. This can be done by
         creating a CODI-like institution or creating a special unit and program within DSWD
         focused on community development for accessing shelter and basic services.
