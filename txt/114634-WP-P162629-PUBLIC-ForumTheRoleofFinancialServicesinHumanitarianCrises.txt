Conclusion


L
    ooking forward, close coordination among donors, governments, regu-
    lators, FSPs, and civil society organizations will be critical to improve
development responses to humanitarian crises, which are increasing in
severity, length, and complexity. Financial inclusion can play an important
role in bridging the humanitarian-development divide by providing a plat-
form to bring efficiencies to emergency transfers through digital and mobile
distribution channels, and more broadly by providing financial tools (pay-
ments, savings, insurance, and credit) to promote economic resilience and
improved economic opportunities in periods of crisis. While finding sus-
tainable solutions to humanitarian crises may seem like an intractable pros-
pect, integrating financial services into both emergency and related
development programming can be an important enabler of the process.

        Asylum Seeker	             person who flees into another country and applies for asylum, i.e., the right to international
                                  A
                                  protection under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention (or Geneva Convention). An asylum seeker
                                  may be either a refugee or a migrant, but only refugees obtain asylum when their claim is
                                  validated. Obligations under the 1951 Convention prevent penalizing asylum seekers that have
                                  illegally entered a country.

        	                         There are 3.2 million asylum seekers globally (UNHCR 2015).

        Crises-Affected 	 In this paper, this term refers to group of people affected by a conflict or natural disaster,
        Populations	     including those related to climate change. Such groups may be forcibly displaced or not.
                          They include directly impacted communities and host communities in case of displacement.

        Forcibly Displaced 	 A person who is forced to flee his or her home.
        Person
               	            There are 65 million people forcibly displaced globally by conflict or violence (UNHCR 2015),
                             including refugees, IDPs, and asylum seekers.

        Internally Displaced 	    A person who is forced to flee his or her home but who remains within his or her country’s
        Person (IDP)	             borders.

        	                         There are 40 million IDPs globally (UNHCR 2015).

        Migrant	
                A person who leaves his or her country to seek a better life abroad (e.g., employment, study, or
                family reunification). A migrant continues to have the protections of his or her own government,
                even when abroad.

        	There are close to 250 million migrants globally (Ratha et al. 2016). They remit an estimated
          US$580 billion to their home countries, of which US$432 billion go to developing countries
          (World Bank 2016e).

        	
         “Environmental migrants are persons or groups of persons who, for compelling reasons of
         sudden or progressive changes in the environment that adversely affect their lives or living
         conditions, are obliged to leave their habitual homes, or choose to do so, either temporarily or
         permanently, and who move either within their country or abroad” (IOM 2007) (emphasis
         added).

        Refugee	
                A person who has been forced to leave his or her country to escape conflict or persecution.
                A refugee under the 1951 Convention is defined as a person who “owing to well-founded fear
                of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social
                group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such
                fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.” Refugees cannot be expelled
                or returned to places where their life is in danger. This definition does not include people who
                have not crossed an international border or economic migrants. People displaced by natural
                disasters (~25 million per year) or climate change are not refugees. It is unclear how many have
                crossed borders or returned, or how many have been displaced in total at a specific date.

        	
         There are 21 million refugees globally (UNHCR 2015) of whom 16.1 million are under UNHCR’s
         mandate and 5.2 million Palestinians who are under UNRWA’s mandate. The number of refugees
         decreases when they return, resettle, or get naturalized, except for Palestinians who retain their
         refugee status regardless of citizenship.

        Stateless Person	A person who does not have the nationality of any country. Stateless persons have not
                          necessarily been forcibly displaced, but they fall under UNHCR’s mandate.

        	                         There are at least 10 million stateless persons globally (UNHCR 2015).

Assistance (or Aid)	dignity during and in the aftermath of man-made crises and natural disasters, as well as to
                     prevent and strengthen preparedness for the occurrence of such situations.

	
 According to Development Initiatives (2016), funding for humanitarian assistance reached a
 record US$28 billion in 2015.
