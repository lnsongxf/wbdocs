THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

        and provides taxable supplies of goods that are to be assembled or
        installed in Bulgaria by that person or at his or her expense (if the
        recipient is not registered for VAT in Bulgaria).
        - A person from another EU member state supplies goods to Bulgaria
        exceeding total value of BGN 70,000 under the conditions of distance
        sales of goods within a given calendar year.
        - A person (whether resident or not) performs taxable intra-community
        acquisitions in Bulgaria exceeding BGN 20,000 within a given calendar
        year.
        - A person (whether resident or not) receives supplies of services under
        chargeable supplies having place of performance on Bulgarian territory
        with respect to which the VAT is due by the recipient.
        - A Bulgarian resident performing supplies of services having place of

        To obtain the design permit, BuildCo must submit an application form,
        a title of property or proof of ownership, a sketch of the acting
        regulation plan, and a change proposal with tax receipts. The time limit
        for obtaining the design permit is 14 days, according to the Law of the
        Spatial Planning (Article 140). The design permit fees are set according
        to Decision No 894, Protocol No 93 (dated November 23, 2006) of the
        Sofia Municipal Council, Addendum 4, Article 2, as shown below.

        Sign preliminary contract with the electricity provider

        BuildCo must obtain approval from the electricity provider and sign a
        preliminary contract for connection to the public network. BuildCo must
        submit a request for examining the conditions for connection to the
        network. According to the rate of services published by CEZ Bulgaria,      30 days           BGN 212

      * Sign preliminary contracts with the water authorities

      In principle, BuildCo must obtain approval from the water authorities.
      The approval is valid for a year. Several documents are necessary to
      obtain this approval, including proof of ownership, the plan, the
      application form, the design permit, and the investment design by the
      Municipality's Chief Architect. Because this procedure is carried out
3     simultaneously with Procedure 2, the filing is submitted at the same           5 days       BGN 720
      time. On these grounds, the water company undertakes a preliminary
      survey and subsequently issues a report that contains the necessary
      technical data and the specifications for the network connection.

      * Request and obtain preliminary assessment of the building for its
      compliance with energy efficiency requirements from licensed
      company

      Every investment project for construction, reconstruction and
      modernization, on the basis of which permission for construction is
      granted, has to be assessed for its compliance with the energy
4     efficiency requirements. There is no fixed price for the issuance of a         5 days      BGN 2,601
      certificate for energy effectiveness. The rates are subject to negotiation
      and vary between BGN 1.00 -- BGN 1.50 per sq. m. The assessment is
      done by a privately licensed company.

      Agency: Licensed Company



      * Obtain decision from the Director of the Regional Inspectorate of
      Environment and Water

      The Law on Environment Protection (Appendix 1 and Appendix 2)
      defines the investment projects that are subject to an environmental
      impact assessment (EIA). The warehouse building for storing books and
      stationary does not fall among the investment projects listed in both
      appendices. Thus, the EIA is not obligatory. However, a decision issued       14 days       no charge
5
      by the Director of the Regional Inspectorate of Protection of
      Environment is required to confirm that EIA is not necessary. The
      decision is issued within 30 days of submitting the request. The
      decision is valid for 5 years.

      Agency: Regional Inspectorate of Environment and Water



      * Obtain approval of the investment project design from a hygiene
      epidemiological expert

      Required documents for the issuance of a hygiene certificate are a

      electricity authority, expert opinion from the regional sanitary inspector,
      and other project documents. The hygiene epidemiological expert’s
      fees for consulting services are BGN 4.50 per hour. The overall cost of
      the approval is based on two criteria: the number of experts involved in
      the inspection and billable hours.

      Obtain final construction approval from the Chief Architect of the
      Municipality

      The fees are BGN 8.00 per sq. m., according to Decision No. 894,
      Protocol No. 93 (dated November 23, 2006, and amended in February
      5, 2008) of the Sofia Municipal Council, Addendum 4, Table 1, assuming
      suburban Zone V.

      Once the Chief of Architect of the Municipality has issued the
      permission (or VISA) BuildCo must submit a folder with 12-13 files,
      including all the approvals from different departments (water,
      electricity, environment, etc.). A "project number" or tracking number is
      issued to BuildCo by the Municipality confirming that the complete file
7     has been received. It takes about one month (sometimes more                  35 days      BGN 10,405
      depending on the Municipality) to receive the final construction
      approval. However, even though the construction approval has been
      issued, construction is not allowed to commence yet, as there is a 14-
      day period which allows for an appeal on behalf of the residents in the
      area where the construction will take place (Article 149 (4) of Bulgarian
      Law of Spatial Planning from 2003). Construction work can only start
      on the 15th day.




      Agency: Municipality



      Sign a contract with a surveillance company

      BuildCo must sign a contract with an independent construction
      supervision firm. This supervisor must be licensed by the Ministry of
      Regional Development and Public Works. The supervisor will sign all
      acts and records during construction. The firm’s instructions and orders
      are binding for BuildCo and the technical manager. Within 3 days of
      being issued, objections against the supervisory firm’s instructions can
      be made before the Directorate for National Construction Control.
      Construction will be stopped until a decision is reached, and the
      decision is considered to be a new set of binding rules.

      The supervisor must notify the Regional Directorate for National
      Construction control of any irregularities within 3 days of detection. The
      supervisor will be responsible for damages caused to the assignor and
      to the other participants in the construction, and jointly responsible
      with BuildCo for damages caused by not complying with the technical
      rules and the approved designs. The supervision contract must be valid
      for the entire construction process.

      The rates for a contract are between BGN 6.00 and BGN 10.00 per sq.
      m. of built area. However, the cost for this procedure is subject to
      negotiation between the investor and the surveillance company. There
      is no legally regulated minimum cost, but the Bulgarian Association of

      Architects and Engineers has issued an act containing recommended
      fees. The fees depend on the value of the construction work but may
      not be less than BGN 800.00. After the end of the construction, the
      person exercising construction supervision will prepare a final report to
      the assignor.

        Registration of notarized deed at the Registry

        The notary will register the notarized deed at the registration office with
        the respective district court. This can be done by the parties too, but it is
        most common that the notary will do it (and it is included in the above
        fees). The notary will pay registration and state fees collected previously.
        Registration should take 1 day, but it can take up to 3 days during busy
        periods.



        According to Art.25, para 5 of the Notary Public and Notarial Activity Law
        of 2009 (last amendment of the Notary Public and Notarial Activity Act
        was promulgated in State Gazette, issue 82 of 16 October 2009,
        http://dv.parliament.bg/DVWeb/broeveList.faces), the notary now has to
        submit the notarized deed in the same day it is signed. In practice, this
        generally happens in Sophia.



        The notarized deed will be registered by the Notary Public with the
        respective office of the Registry Agency. The Notary Public and Notarial

        If a notary public does not perform their obligation for entry of a notary
        deed or other notary certified act with the real estate register, the
        interested persons are entitled to claim the suffered damages.
        Furthermore, the interested persons may address the Notary Chamber
        regarding the violations of the notary's obligations. This may entail
        disciplinary proceedings against the respective notary public.



        This amendment also ensures that the notaries public have access to the
        National Database "Population" and to the National Automatic
        Information Fund for personal identity documents. It also introduced an
        obligation for the notaries public to make special checks in the database
        and the fund when performing notary certifications connected to rights
        over real estates.
