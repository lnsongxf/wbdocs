The main rail corridors in India are part of the ‘Golden Quadrilateral’ connecting New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai
and Kolkata. They account for 16 percent of the railway network’s route length but carry more than 60 percent of
its freight load. Recognizing that the rail sector urgently needs to add capacity to these routes, the Government
of India has, approved a long-term plan to build dedicated freight-only lines, parallel to the existing Golden
Quadrilateral passenger and freight mixed traffic routes. The new freight network will allow trains to carry more
freight, faster, with greater reliability and at lower cost. The relief on the existing lines will allow improvements
in passenger services. On completion, the total corridor railway capacity will double, thereby unleashing further
economic activities and job growth.

The first two Dedicated Freight Corridors to be built were the Western and Eastern Corridors. The Western
Corridor (Delhi-Mumbai), which is 1,499 km long and funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency
(JICA), is in the early stages of implementation. The Eastern Corridor is 1,839 km in length and extends
from Ludhiana to Kolkata, traversing the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and
West Bengal. The World Bank support for the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (EDFC)1 was conceived as a
series of projects in which three sections (total length 1,176 km, including the Khurja-Dadri section) would be
delivered sequentially, but with considerable overlap in their construction schedules. The first loan (EDFC1) in
the AKIC Program was approved by the World Bank in May 2011 and is already being implemented. The second
loan (EDFC2) for the line from Kanpur to Mughal Sarai was approved by the World Bank in April 2014 and is also
being implemented. The table below provides information on the three AKIC sections which are supported by
the World Bank. The remaining 663 km of the AKIC is proposed to be funded by the Government of India and
Public Private Partnerships.

1	 The Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (EDFC) was recently renamed as the Amritsar-Kolkata Industrial Corridor (AKIC) by Government of India. As
   official project documents of the World Bank line of credit refer to EDFC, the Project titles have been retained as EDFC. This report otherwise refers to
   the corridor as AKIC.




                                                                                                                              Context           v
The Government of India believes that the large investments being made in developing the AKIC will
lead to large-scale job growth and overall economic development in the six corridor states. Based on an
initial concept note prepared by the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD), Government of India,
the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) of the Ministry of Finance, Government of India requested
the World Bank to provide Non-Lending Technical Assistance (NLTA) to prepare options for developments
along the AKIC.

The initial work by the World Bank on the NLTA was directed and coordinated by the MoUD, Government
of India. Subsequent work by the World Bank is being coordinated by the Department of Industrial Policy
and Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India. The Uttar Pradesh state-
specific work is being conducted in close collaboration with the Department of Infrastructure and Industries,
Government of Uttar Pradesh.

   Location Quotients (LQ) are calculated across two levels namely Macro and Micro level. The Macro level LQ provides a mapping of industries which are
1. 
   significant in the sub region. This Location Quotient has been titled as LQ-S and its formulation is as follows:
   LQ-S = {(Investment or Employment in Kth Industry in Sub Region X/Total Industrial Investment or Employment in Sub Region X)/(Investment/
   Employment in Kth Industry in UP/Total Industrial Investment or Employment in UP)}
   The Micro LQ provides a mapping of industries which are significant in the district. This Location quotient has been titled as LQ-D and its formulation
   is as follows:
   LQ-D = {(Investment or Employment in Kth Industry in District I/Total Industrial Investment or Employment in District I)/(Investment or Employment in
   Kth Industry in UP/Total Industrial Investment or Employment in UP)}
   The denominator of both the metrics has been kept the same in order to facilitate comparison between the two metrics. Industries which demonstrate
   an LQ>1.25 are considered as significant.

 Box 1: Concept of Plug and Play Buildings
 A concept of flatted-type readymade units of built-up area ranging from 50, 100, to 300 m2 is proposed to cater to the dry
 operations of leather goods manufacturing in the Banthar and Unnao industrial areas in the Kanpur-Auraiya sub-region and
 the EPIP in the Agra-Aligarh sub-region. Apart from unit spaces, all required common infrastructure facilities and services
 (e.g. electricity, common lighting, lifts, loading/unloading facilities, water supply and drainage arrangement, security,
 canteen, etc.) are provided in plug and play buildings. Since the facilities are provided for and occupancy certificate has
 also been obtained, the entrepreneur can buy/lease such a unit with a minimum reasonable investment and immediately
 start operations. After units (or required units) are allotted, the entrepreneurs are expected to form a cooperative, which
 will take the responsibility of maintaining common areas by charging proportionate maintenance charges.
 The concept of plug and play buildings is not new in India. It has received overwhelming response in the industrial
 areas Maharashtra, such as the Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone (SEEPZ), the Millennium Business Park in
 Mumbai, Electronics Sadan in Pune, and in other industrial areas in Marol, and Pune, Nasik, among others.

 Methodology: New industrial areas were estimated using the incremental turnover for each cluster (moderately optimistic projected turnover
*
 less the baseline figure for each cluster) taking into account the (i) efficiency and capacity enhancement of the existing units, and (ii) expansion in
 capacity of existing units or establishment of new production units. The new industrial area requirement is then adjusted to reflect available and
 upcoming additional industrial areas and the requirements for common infrastructure utilities and other support infrastructure.
