AFGHANISTAN DEVELOPMENT UPDATE
October 2016
Preface

          The Afghanistan Development Update, which is published twice a year, provides a
          comprehensive report of the state of the Afghan economy. It covers recent economic
          developments and outlines the medium-term outlook for Afghanistan. Each edition
          includes a section that provides in-depth analysis on one or more specific focus topics.
          The lack of high-frequency data in Afghanistan makes it difficult to track economic
          activities on monthly or quarterly basis. Thus, proxy indicators are utilized when their
          quality is deemed satisfactory. Efforts are made to ensure that key analysis and
          forecasts are based primarily on reliable sets of data.

          The Afghanistan Development Update is intended for a wide audience, including
          policy makers, the donor community, the private sector, the community of analysts
          and professionals engaged in monitoring the economy and Afghanistan’s citizens at
          large.

  Executive summary

                  Security and development remain inextricably linked in Afghanistan, with the poor
                  security environment continuing to exert a significant constraint on confidence,
                  investment, and growth. As a result, in 2015, the economy grew at only 0.8 percent.
                  In addition to the security situation, adverse weather conditions also constrained
                  growth, contributing to a decline in agricultural production of 5.7 percent in 2015.
                  Available data for the first half of 2016 indicate ongoing low levels of investment,
                  with agricultural production expected to remain poor due to crop diseases and pests.
                  Thus, in 2016, the growth rate is expected to reach only 1.2 percent, despite progress
                  with a number of important initiatives that are expected to have a positive impact on
                  Afghanistan’s economic development, including Afghanistan’s accession to the
                  World Trade Organization and the opening of the Chabahar port in Iran. With the
                  economic growth rate significantly lower than the population growth rate, it is
                  expected that poverty will have increased in 2015 and that it is likely to continue to
                  increase throughout 2016. In the medium-term future, economic growth is expected
                  to gradually accelerate, increasing from 1.8 percent in 2017 to 3.6 percent in 2019.
                  However, stronger growth in out-years is predicated on improvements in security,
                  political stability, reform progress, and continued high levels of aid.

                  After declining steadily throughout 2015, consumer prices rebounded in the first half
                  of 2016. This rebound was driven by a recovery in global energy and cereal prices and
                  by the depreciation of the Afghani against major trading currencies. Against the US
                  dollar, the Afghani depreciated by 3.8 percent in the first quarter of the year, followed
                  by 0.3 percent in the second quarter, before appreciating by about 2 percent in the
                  third quarter. Foreign exchange reserves declined throughout most of 2015, before
                  increasing in the first half of 2016 to reach US$ 7.4 billion (or around 9 months of
                  imports) by end of June 2016. This increase was largely due to the decline in imports
                  as a result of weakening demand.

                  The fiscal situation remains stable. Revenue collection performed well throughout
                  2015, with domestic revenues reaching a value of 10.2 percent of GDP. Performance
                  has remained strong into 2016, with domestic revenues collected in the first 8 months
                  of 2016 standing at a value 30 percent higher than for the same period last year. This
                  increase is largely due to improvements in tax administration and the implementation
                  of policy measures that were introduced in the second and third quarters of 2015.
                  Public expenditure in the first half of 2016 was 5 percent higher than in the same
                  period in the previous year. While growing security costs and expanding civilian
                  recurrent needs increased the operating budget spending by around 9 percent in the
                  first half of 2016, development budget expenditures have fallen due to a decline in
                  the performance of budget execution across most of Government institutions. A
                  small deficit of 1.3 percent of GDP was recorded in 2015, with a balanced budget
                  expected in 2016.

                  The international community reaffirmed its support to the Government of
                  Afghanistan at two major international conferences during the year. At the NATO
                  Warsaw Summit in July 2016, development partners pledged $4.5 billion per year in
                  security grants for the next four years. At the Brussels Conference on Afghanistan in

                  October 2016, the international community pledged $3.8 billion per year in civilian
                  donor grants for the same period. The sustained high levels of support indicate broad
                  confidence amongst the international community in Afghanistan’s development
                  prospects and in the significant progress the Government has made towards
                  achieving reforms. In particular, the Government has implemented significant
                  positive reforms in the fields of anti-corruption, revenue collection, and private sector
                  development. As discussed in the first focus section of this report, pledged levels of
                  aid are sufficient to support substantial development gains. However, realizing such
                  gains will require major efforts by both the international community and the
                  Government. The international community will need to ensure that aid expenditures
                  are fully aligned with government priorities, including through increasing the share of
                  aid delivered on budget. The Government will need to pursue a range of vital policy
                  reforms, to adopt a careful and strategic approach to all resource allocation decisions,
                  and to pursue all available measures to increase fiscal space.

                  Despite the positive outcomes from the two conferences, civilian casualties remain at
                  elevated levels and the number of Internally Displaced People (IDPs) is increasing,
                  placing strains on the capacities of government agencies at all levels. Thousands of
                  refugees are returning from Pakistan and, in lower numbers, from Iran and elsewhere,
                  adding to the 1.2 million IDPs already located within Afghanistan. With slow growth,
                  poor security, and increasing unemployment, especially in rural areas, communities
                  are often ill-equipped to absorb returnees. This is leading to an increased incidence
                  of displacement among returnees, a growing concentration of IDPs in informal
                  settlements in urban areas, and increasing risks of a humanitarian crisis as winter
                  approaches. The second focus section of this report provides recommendations for
                  managing these risks, with measures including the mobilization of international
                  support, the establishment of a consolidated social transfer program, the protection
                  of IDP access to education and health, and the strengthening of urban infrastructure.

  A. Recent Economic Developments

                   1. Background

The political and           In 2016, the National Unity Government (NUG) continued to pursue its ambitious
security context            reform agenda, despite challenging security conditions. On October 4, 2016, the
continues to affect         Government presented the new Afghanistan National Peace and Development
Afghanistan’s               Framework (ANPDF) at the Brussels Conference on Afghanistan (BCA), which was
economic and social         attended by representatives of around 70 countries and 30 international organizations.
outcomes                    At this conference, development aid of US$ 3.8 billion per year for the next four years
                            was pledged. In addition, at the NATO Warsaw Summit in July 2016, annual security
                            funding of US$ 4.5 billion was pledged for the same time period.

                            These developments occurred in the context of a deteriorating security situation.
                            Civilian casualties in the first half of 2016 remain high (see Figure 1). Also, for the
                            first time since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, insurgents were able to temporarily
                            seize parts of a large city, twice capturing Kunduz in northern Afghanistan, once in
                            September 2015 and again in October 2016. Despite increasing violence, the
                            Government was able to advance its reconciliation and peace agenda through a
                            number of means, including signing a landmark peace agreement with a major armed
                            opposition group, Hizbi Islami.

                            The deteriorating security situation has increased conflict-induced internal
                            displacement to unprecedented levels. A shrinking asylum space within the
                            international community and geopolitical changes at the regional level have recently
                            spurred the return of thousands of Afghan refugees. It is estimated that returnees
                            from Pakistan, Iran and elsewhere will increase the number of internally displaced
                            people to around 1.2 million people by the end of 2016. In addition, an estimated 5
                            million Afghan refugees, including both registered and unregistered, remain in
                            Pakistan and Iran.

                  2. Real Sector Activity

Growth continues to      Afghanistan’s economy continues to experience the most sustained period of slow
be constrained by        growth since it emerged from the conflict in 2002. According to official national
insecurity and weak      accounts data released in May 2016, the economic growth rate slowed from 1.3 percent
consumer and             in 2014 to 0.8 percent in 2015. This is dramatically lower than the average rate of 9.4
business confidence      percent recorded in the period from 2003 to 2012. The significant decline in growth
                         since 2012 reflects the impacts of reduced aid and weak investor confidence in the
                         context of increasing insecurity and continued political uncertainty. While on-budget
                         aid has increased from around US$ 2 billion in 2012 to nearly US$ 3 billion in 2015,
                         the proportion of aid delivered off-budget has declined. The total value of all aid,
                         including both security and civilian aid and both on- and off-budget aid, is estimated
                         to have declined from an annual average of US$ 12.5 billion in the period from 2009
                         to 2012 to around US$ 8.8 billion in 2015.

Agriculture              In 2015, the deceleration in growth was primarily driven by the decline of the
contracted in 2015,      agriculture sector. Over the year, agricultural output fell by 5.7 percent, primarily as a

Years from 2006 to 2012 refer to Solar Hijri years (April to March), while those from 2013 to 2015 are calendar years (January – December).

Industry grew                   The industrial sector expanded over the year, with growth increasing from 2.4 percent
strongly in 2015, led           in 2014 to 4.1 percent in 2015. This increase was driven by the strong growth in
by construction                 construction activities (7.9 percent) in both the public and private sectors. While public
                                infrastructure investments have been sustained throughout the years, private
                                construction growth may have been driven by the ongoing implementation of projects
                                contracted during boom years. Manufacturing, which mostly consists of food
                                processing and carpet production, recovered slightly after contracting last year,
                                growing by a modest 0.7 percent. Without any large mining projects and without a
                                pick-up in small-scale mining activities, the mining sector contracted for the second
                                consecutive year. Afghanistan’s only large mining project so far is in the Amu Darya
                                oil basin which started its operations in 2013. However, this project has suffered a
                                number of interruptions since it was first implemented.

Proxy indicators              In the first half of 2016, the number of new firm registrations dropped by around 30
indicate limited new          percent, with the decline occurring across all sectors.1 This suggests that business
investments and               confidence has not yet recovered, with potential new investments at lower levels than
weak economic                 recorded three years ago. While this indicator cannot provide any information on the
activity in the first         level of investment by existing firms, it may serve as a proxy for the degree of
half of 2016                  confidence of potential investors. The low level of investment suggests that potential
                              investors may be delaying their investment decisions as a result of the overall political
                              uncertainty and market conditions. Other proxy indicators, such as the number of new
                              vehicle registrations, also suggest a decline in economic activity. In the first half of
                              2016, the number of new vehicle registrations, including for both passenger cars and
                              cargo vehicles and for both private and publicly-owned vehicles, declined by about 30
                              percent compared to the same period last year, with the number substantially lower
                              than three years ago.

A number of on-               Afghanistan has now completed all of the World Trade Organization’s (WTO)
going initiatives have        accession protocols, with the Parliament (Wolesi Jerga) ratifying the accession in June
the potential to              2016. Following this, on July 29, 2016, Afghanistan was formally admitted to the
improve investment            WTO. This will have a number of benefits for Afghanistan, including facilitating
prospects                     transit, resolving trade disputes, providing access to global markets, and improving
                              prospects for foreign direct investment. In May 2016, Iran and India signed an
                              agreement to develop the Chabahar seaport, located in southeastern Iran on the
                              Persian Gulf. This port will open a new transit route for Afghanistan, with the port
                              having the potential to become the most important and cost efficient transit port for
                              Afghanistan’s trade. While both the WTO accession and the opening of the Chabahar
                              port could improve Afghanistan’s investment prospects, the security environment will

                   3. External sector

Exports increased in          In the first half of 2016, exports increased by around 6 percent compared to the
the first half of 2016        same period last year, with the total value of official exports standing at around US$
                              250 million. The increase in exports was probably driven by a lagged effect of
                              increased fruit production last year, with the fruit output increasing by more than 7
                              percent, in contrast to the decline in production of cereals. Together with fresh fruits,
                              dried fruits account for almost a third of official exports. The performance of these
                              exports in any given year is heavily influenced by horticultural performance in the
                              previous year, due to the time required to process the fruits (drying). The export of
                              fresh fruits has benefited from a recent increased demand from India, the largest
                              market for Afghan fresh and dried fruits, with the increased demand resulting from
                              preferential access recently offered by the Indian government. In 2015, dried fruits
                              and nuts accounted for around 30 percent of total exports, followed by animal by-
                              products (such as skin and wool), carpets, and medicinal plants (see Figure 8).
                              Pakistan is the largest market for Afghan exports, importing a number of inputs for
                              further processing and re-exporting. Thus, in 2015, around 85 percent of
                              Afghanistan’s exported carpets were sent to Pakistan for cleaning and washing
                              before being re-exported elsewhere. India is the second largest market for
                              Afghanistan’s exports, mainly importing fruits, nuts and dried fruits.

demand                     demand and the currency depreciation, which has increased the costs of imported
                           goods. Iran now surpasses Pakistan as the largest exporter of products to
                           Afghanistan, with nearly one fifth of Afghanistan’s imports originating from Iran in

                           by foreign aid and remittances.

the first half of 2016         7.4 billion, up from the figure of US$ 6.9 billion recorded in December 2015. The
                               increase in the reserves is mostly attributable to the decline in imports. The current
                               level of gross reserves is sufficient to cover around 9 months of imports.

       In Afghanistan, export levels have remained largely Source: World Bank staff estimates and calculations
 unaffected by the recent depreciation in REER. This is
 likely because other factors, such as domestic supply-side constraints (access to finance, access to electricity, access to
 land, etc.), higher fixed costs (due to security challenges) and, more importantly, limited access to international markets,
 are more significant factors than currency competitiveness. This is the reason why economic growth in Afghanistan
 has not particularly benefited from real exchange rate depreciation since 2012.
      A closer look at the REER shows that real exchange rate movements in Afghanistan are largely correlated with
 the level of international aid. Afghanistan experienced an exceptional inflow of foreign aid in the years after 2002. The
 increase of wages and prices in sectors supported by aid flows (such as construction and services) led to higher domestic
 prices relative to international prices, increasing the REER and making it harder for Afghanistan’s emerging exports to
 compete on foreign markets. The aid-induced appreciation, together with other constraints in Afghanistan’s business
 climate, may have well reduced the incentive to invest in export sectors which would exp lain today’s low levels of
 exports – an effect very similar to the ones associated with the Dutch Disease effect. While this term was originally
 coined to describe the possible impacts of large inflows of natural resource revenues into an economy, the case of
 Afghanistan demonstrates that aid can have a similar impact.
      The export sectors in Afghanistan continue to suffer from low capacity and capability – probably too low to
 overcome other investment climate constraints and expand in response to exchange rate movements in the short-term.
 In the long run, however, the depreciation may help to attract investment in export sectors.

Revenue collections          Following three years of poor performance, revenue collections increased
increased                    significantly in 2015, with performance remaining strong throughout 2016. In the
significantly in 2015,       first eight months of the fiscal year, domestic revenues amounted to Af 90.4 billion,2
with performance             nearly 30 percent higher than the figure recorded for the same period last year.
remaining strong             Compared to the same period last year, tax revenues increased by 26 percent, while
throughout 2016              non-tax revenues increased by 70 percent. However, collected customs duties
                             declined by 2.4 percent over the same period, reflecting the decline in imports.




                             2   The figure excludes one-off transfers received by the Ministry of Finance in 2016. The Central Bank
                                 transferred around $150 million (Af 10 bn) of its profits to the Government – as guided by the Law –
                                 while around Af 4 billion were received from the New Kabul Bank and a numbers of SOEs managed
                                 under MAIL and Ministry of Urban Development. Given that these transfers do not constitute
                                 regular/ recurrent revenue streams for the Government, they are thus excluded from the definition of
                                 revenues in this document.

The increase is                 The increase in both tax and non-tax revenues is largely the result of: i) improvements
largely the result of           to tax administration and increased compliance; and ii) the introduction of a set of
improvements to tax             new policy measures in the second and third quarters of 2015.3 While some of the
administration and              increase in non-tax revenues was the result of a temporary surge in government

                                2015 the collection of tax arrears contributed significantly to the overall non-tax
                                revenue performance, this has not been the case in 2016.

                  5. Monetary and financial sector developments

Money demand has        The broad money (M2) growth rate, which includes currency-in-circulation and
increased, likely due   deposits in commercial banks, increased to 7.4 percent in June 2016 (year-on-year),
to higher prices        up from the figure of 3.3 percent recorded in December 2015. The year-on-year
                        currency-in-circulation growth rate also increased, from 4.1 percent to 8.3 percent
                        over the same period. The increase in money demand is probably the result of
                        increasing inflationary pressures. While money demand is growing in nominal terms,
                        it may not necessarily be growing in real terms to suggest an increase in economic
                        activity. In June 2016, deposits in commercial banks grew at an annualized rate of 8.2
                        percent. Although this is higher than the rate of 3.4 percent recorded in December
                        2015, it remains significantly lower than the double digit rates recorded in periods
                        prior to 2013.

Commercial banks’       Commercial bank loans to the private sector increased from around Af 47 billion
performance has         (US$ 685 million) in December 2015 to around Af 51 billion (US$ 740 million) by
been mixed              June 2016. The increase is primarily triggered by loans denominated in the US dollar
                        which increased by an annualized rate of 15 percent, as compared to only 1.4 percent
                        for the Afghani denominated loans. The increase in the US denominated loans is

                               of the year, inflating the value of assets held by commercial banks. In addition, the
                               quality of banks’ assets continued to deteriorate in the first half of 2016. The ratio of
                               non-performing loans (NPLs) increased from 12.6 percent in December 2015 to 17.1
                               percent in June 2016, marking a record high since the Kabul Bank crisis in 2011.
                               However, the ratio of net NPLs-to-capital has declined from 6 percent in 2012 to
                               almost 3 percent in 2016. The net profit of the banking sector has increased
                               dramatically to around Af 3 billion in the first half of the year, compared to the loss
                               of about Af 1 billion recorded in the same period last year. Most of the increase in
                               banking sector profits was derived from non-interest incomes.

The financial sector           Commercial banks dominate the financial sector in the country. Other financial
remains                        services remain underdeveloped, contributing only modestly to financial
underdeveloped and             intermediation. While the assets of the banking sector amounted to 21.6 percent of
is characterized by            GDP in June 2016, the value of credit intermediated from banks to the private sector
low level of financial         stood at only 4 percent of GDP. The banking system remains highly liquid, with the
intermediation                 liquid assets ratio standing at more than 70 percent for the past two years, reflecting
                               the low level of intermediation. The government has been intensifying its efforts to
                               develop and improve the oversight of the banking sector and to adopt prudential
                               measures to assess its soundness.

B. Outlook and Medium-Term Prospects
Growth will increase In 2016, the economic growth rate is expected to increase marginally, to 1.2 percent.
marginally in 2016, to Continued slow growth reflects weak confidence in the context of the deteriorating
1.2 percent            security environment and weak agricultural performance. Weak confidence is
                       demonstrated by the lower number of new firm and vehicle registered in the first half
                       of 2016 (see page 4). The weak confidence is largely the result of the failure to achieve
                       major improvements in the security situation. The decline in imports in the first half
                       of 2016 provides further evidence of weak demand. In 2016, agriculture’s growth is
                       projected to continue to decline, with a projected rate of –0.5 percent.

WTO accession and        Afghanistan’s accession to the WTO, the opening of the Chabahar port in Iran as an
infrastructure           alternative, low-cost transit route, the initiation of the Trans-Hindukush road
projects could           connectivity project, and a number of other national and regional projects could
significantly improve    significantly improve prospects for private investment and business activities. In
prospects for private    addition, a number of important reforms undertaken by the Government in the areas
investment and           of anti-corruption, revenue collection, and private sector development (see Appendix
business activities      II) could help build confidence in the economy in the longer term, although their
                         impact in the short term is likely to be limited. Regardless of these developments and
                         reforms, however, unless security challenges and political uncertainty are addressed,
                         they are likely to continue to constrain overall growth.

Growth is expected       Economic growth is expected to gradually increase to around 3.6 percent by 2019.
to gradually increase    Stronger growth in out-years is predicated on improvements in security, the
over the medium-         achievement of political stability, a successful reform progress, and continued high
term                     levels of aid. The poverty rate is expected to remain high due to weak labor demand
                         and security-related constraints on service delivery, despite some positive offsetting
                         impacts from improvements to the performance of the agriculture sector and lower
                         food prices.

A balanced budget is Revenue collection performance is expected to remain strong during 2016, with
expected in 2016     domestic revenues projected to reach 10.8 percent of GDP. Total budget expenditure
                     is expected to increase by around 2.4 percent of GDP, reaching a new high of 28.9
                     percent, with this increase driven by increases to on-budget security expenditure as
                     the Government assumes an increasing level of responsibility for security functions.
                     Civilian expenditures will also increase slightly, driven by increased development
                     spending. Budget grants will increase commensurately, driven by increases to security
                     aid. This will lead to a smaller deficit, which is projected to stand at 0.1 percent of
                     GDP.

Over the medium          Over the medium term, fiscal outcomes are highly sensitive to the level and modality

to the level and         that security spending previously undertaken directly by international partners is being

commitments.             current service levels to an increasingly large population, as well as expenditure on

                         transferred to the Government. If the Government can sustain recent improvements
                         to compliance and administration, domestic revenues are projected to increase to 12.2

                        economic growth, with the resolution of outstanding issues from the Kabul Bank

                        financial sector corporate governance.

Medium-term             Afghanistan’s macroeconomic framework remains heavily exposed to a range of
prospects are subject   downside risks, including: i) an unanticipated decline in aid, which would undermine
to substantial          fiscal sustainability and force difficult adjustments on the expenditure side; ii) a further
downside risk           deterioration in the security environment, which would undermine confidence and
                        further slow growth; and iii) increased political instability, which would have highly
                        unpredictable impacts on the security situation, business confidence, and external
                        support. Continued progress with efforts to strengthen governance, to improve
                        revenue policies and administration, and to establish a conducive environment for
                        private sector growth underpin longer-term sustainability. The mobilization of the
                        required aid will continue to depend on adequate performance in implementing the
                        required structural reforms under the Afghanistan National Development and Peace
                        Framework.

sustainability          revenues in the context of the expected normalization of aid levels over the longer-
                        term and to generate the foreign exchange required to finance Afghanistan’s large
                        import bill. Even with optimal revenue policies and administrative settings,
                        Afghanistan’s upper-bound revenue potential stands at only around 17 percent of
                        GDP, due to the undiversified economy and the continued heavy dependence on
                        subsistence agriculture. At this level, it is well short of projected expenditure needs.
                        Given low levels of human capital, substantial infrastructure deficits, and weak
                        institutions, opportunities for structural transformation are limited in the short-term.
                        Over the medium-term, increased human capital investment and improved
                        agricultural productivity could drive significant economic growth and increase
                        employment opportunities. The development of the extractives sector offers
                        important opportunities for the generation of government revenues and foreign
                        exchange receipts to replace the expected decline in aid.

C. Focus Section I: Outcomes from Brussels
                        The Brussels Conference on Afghanistan was held on October 4, 2016. This
                        conference was co-hosted by the Government of Afghanistan and the European
                        Union, with 70 countries and 30 international organizations and agencies represented.
                        In addition to affirming ongoing support to the Government of Afghanistan and to
                        the priorities expressed through the new Afghanistan National Peace and
                        Development Framework (ANPDF), the international community pledged around
                        US$ 3.8 billion of civilian aid annually over the next four years to support
                        Afghanistan’s continued development.

                        This level of aid support is adequate to sustain current levels of service delivery and
                        to preserve development gains in Afghanistan. However, achieving higher growth
                        rates with this level of civilian aid will require major efforts by both the international
                        community and the Government. The international community will need to pursue
                        all possible means to increase the proportion of civilian aid delivered on-budget in
                        order to ensure alignment with government priorities, to maximize cost-effectiveness,
                        and to magnify local economic impacts. The Government will need to implement a
                        range of vital policy reforms, to adopt a careful and strategic approach to all resource
                        allocation decisions, and to pursue all available means to increase its fiscal space.

In 2016, grants are     In 2016, grants to Afghanistan are expected to total around US$ 9 billion, or 48
expected to total       percent of GDP. Aid support is allocated for both security and civilian assistance and

                        How much aid is required to maintain existing services?
Afghanistan’s on-       On-budget security expenditures are expected to increase substantially over coming
budget expenditure      years, as the Government assumes a greater share of responsibilities for security. On-
needs are expected      budget security expenditures are expected to increase from US$ 2.7 billion (14.3
to increase over        percent of GDP) in 2016 to US$ 4.4 billion (18.3 percent of GDP) in 2020. On-
coming years.           budget civilian recurrent expenditures are also expected to grow. Even assuming no
                        improvements to service quality or coverage, on-budget costs will increase from
                        around US$ 2.8 to US$ 3.3 billion by 2020 as a result of population growth and
                        increasing operations and maintenance needs resulting from the transfer of donor-
                        built assets to the Government.

An increasing share     Afghanistan has limited scope to finance the increased expenditures through

security sector         domestic revenues are expected to reach only around 12.6 percent of GDP by 2020.

                               As discussed in the previous Afghanistan Development Update, the current
                               structure of the economy imposes binding constraints on total revenue potential,
                               with an upper-bound limit of around 17 percent of GDP, even with ideal policy
                               settings and with full compliance.

                               Based on pledges at the 2016 NATO Conference in Warsaw, security grants are
                               expected to reach US$ 4.5 billion annually for the next four years, with an increasing
                               proportion of aid provided on-budget. However, the Government will also be
                               expected to contribute more to security financing in order to sustain security
                               expenditures that are not covered under the Warsaw financing commitments.
                               Basically, these include all security expenditures other than those executed by the
                               Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Interior. The proportion of domestic
                               revenue dedicated to security is projected to increase from 41 percent in 2016 to 60
                               percent by 2020. As a result, the domestic revenues available to finance civilian
                               expenditure needs will not increase even in nominal terms, remaining at around US$
                               1.2 billion for the next four years.

                     How much aid is needed to support improved development
                     outcomes?
 Meeting existing    A World Bank analysis conducted for the Brussels Conference examined the
 cost pressures is   implications of different public expenditure profiles for future growth and
 not enough to       development outcomes. This analysis shows that if public expenditure is only
 generate any        sufficient to finance existing levels of service delivery, the annual economic growth
 significant         rate is likely to remain at around 4 percent for the next 15 years. With a population
 improvements to     growth rate of around 3 percent, this level of economic growth would be

                     provide sufficient employment opportunities for the 400,000 Afghans entering the
                     workforce each year. Stagnant economic and social outcomes would result in
                     increased fragility and pose high risks to the gains achieved so far.

 could facilitate    improved human capital, the development of extractive industries, increased
 much higher         connective infrastructure investment, and the establishment of a targeted social
 growth.             transfer system. Additional public investment in the following areas would be
                     required to achieve the higher growth scenario:

                            Agriculture: Agriculture remains the foundation of Afghanistan’s economy.
                             Agriculture employs 44 percent of the population, with 61 percent of
                             households deriving income from this sector. Agriculture is highly integrated
                             with the broader economy, with 90 percent of manufacturing dependent on
                             agricultural inputs. Improved agricultural productivity and an expansion of the
                             area of land under cultivation could contribute to 1.6 percentage points of
                             GDP growth annually and create 1.2 million jobs over the next decade. The

                                                                                                             18

                      rehabilitation of land irrigation structures, improved water management, and
                      the provision of the knowledge extension services required to realize
                      agriculture’s potential would require additional public investments of around
                      US$ 300 million per year.

                     Human capital: Since 2001, Afghanistan has dramatically increased its
                      investments in human capital. However, there is still a long way to go. Only
                      around half of children of school age attend secondary school, with literacy
                      rates among the worst in the world, at 32 percent for adults overall and just
                      18 percent for adult women. There are significant concerns regarding the
                      quality of education. There is also room to improve health outcomes, with life
                      expectancies eleven years shorter than the global average. The low literacy
                      rates among women contribute to high fertility rates and to the high
                      population growth rate. The pace of progress in improving access to social
                      services has slowed over recent years, with an increasing gap between the poor
                      and non-poor and between rural and urban populations. Increased investment
                      in human capital, especially through literacy programs for women, could result
                      in increased labor productivity and increased average incomes by reducing the
                      population growth rate. Increasing expenditure on education and health from
                      35 percent of total civilian spending to 50 percent would require additional
                      public investments of around US$ 500 million per year.

                     Extractives: Agriculture’s contribution to government revenues will be
                      limited by the fact that the taxable income in this sector is usually low. While
                      there may be potential for horticultural export growth, growth will occur from
                      a very low base, with the majority of agricultural development being import-
                      substituting. Therefore, in the context of declining aid, it is necessary to
                      develop the extractive sector to increase government revenue and to generate
                      foreign exchange income. While the development of the extractive sector is
                      subject to substantial governance risks, these risks can be managed through a
                      phased, learning-by-doing approach, with a concentration of capacity within
                      agencies responsible for contracting, monitoring, and regulating extractives
                      investments. The full benefits of mining are only likely to be realized if the
                      development of the extractive sector is carefully integrated within a broader
                      development strategy. Extractives can facilitate broader economic
                      development if mining investments are accompanied by infrastructure
                      deployment that supports links to the agriculture and services sectors and
                      improves regional connectivity. Public investments required to mobilize the
                      mining sector would cost around US$ 350 million per year.

                     Trade and connective infrastructure: Afghanistan has substantial potential
                      to develop commodities exports, energy transit trade, and ICT connectivity.
                      This potential is currently constrained by major infrastructure deficits and
                      customs and border inefficiencies, including congestion at border crossings.
                      Infrastructure investment and trade-related institutional reforms are required
                      to support extractive and, to a lesser extent, agricultural exports. Investments
                      in fiber-optic and transmission infrastructure could support energy transit and
                      ICT connectivity. A program of infrastructure investments concentrated on

                             addressing existing trade points and enabling the development of extractives
                             and agricultural exports would cost around US$ 350 million per year.

                            Social transfers and managed labor migration programs: A social transfer
                             system costing only around US$ 20 million annually by 2020 could play a
                             significant role in addressing Afghan households’ unique exposure to negative
                             shocks, eventually halving food poverty once fully implemented. Such a
                             program could reduce the need for households to resort to negative coping
                             strategies, such as reducing their investments in education or selling
                             productive assets, in response to shocks. Thus, programs of this sort could
                             lead to increased investment in human and physical capital, driving increases
                             to productivity. A managed migration program could be introduced at
                             negligible fiscal cost, with such a program having the potential to expand the
                             range of receiving countries for Afghan migrants. If designed appropriately,
                             such a scheme could strengthen incentives for human capital investment and
                             capture benefits from a returning stream of migrants with new skills and
                             international connections. Increased managed migration would also facilitate
                             increased remittances, boosting household incomes and foreign exchange
                             inflows.
 Total on-budget        As Figure 18 shows, the total value of the public investment required to implement
 aid of around US$      a high-growth strategy is substantial, at around US$ 1 billion per year over the next
 2.2 billion per year   four years. Given the gap between government revenues and recurrent

 substantial         However, implementation of a high-growth strategy will require a substantial
 increase in the     increase in the proportion of aid delivered on budget. Currently, only around 35
 proportion of aid   percent of civilian aid is provided on budget. Off-budget aid, which does not
 delivered on        provide resources through government accounts and systems and which cannot
 budget              be used to finance government salaries or operations and maintenance costs, will
                     not enable the Government to address recurrent expenditure pressures while
                     maintaining existing levels of service delivery. Off-budget aid is also unlikely to
                     meet the investment requirements for higher growth for several reasons. Firstly,
                     off-budget aid expenditure is less cost-effective. Off-budget aid typically involves
                     a greater share of imported goods and services and the establishment of parallel
                     management systems. The costs of the required investment may therefore be
                     substantially higher than the estimates in this analysis, exceeding available
                     resources. Secondly, it is often difficult to ensure that off-budget aid is used for
                     projects that fully align with government strategies and priorities, given limited
                     government oversight and its restricted involvement in planning processes. It can

                           What are the implications for development partners and
                           government?

                           could usefully be communicated immediately to the Government, with technical
                           assistance provided to implement required reforms. Discussions regarding the
                           need for increased on-budget aid should reflect the facts that that: i) Afghanistan’s
                           public financial management systems are relatively advanced and strong compared
                           to other fragile or low-income countries; ii) opportunities for corruption also occur
                           with off-budget expenditure; and iii) there is overwhelming evidence from
                           Afghanistan and internationally that allocating aid on budget is both more cost-
                           effective and has a greater positive impact on the local economy (including in
                           terms of the creation of employment and private sector opportunties) than off-

 to expand fiscal   aid resources over the short-term, the Government should pursue all available
 space.             options to increase its fiscal space and to free up resources to implement its
                    investment priorities. These options might include the following:

                       Improved revenue mobilization: While the structure of Afghanistan’s
                        economy constrains the achievement of its full revenue potential, there
                        remains scope to increase collections. Efforts to improve tax compliance,
                        including through the roll-out of the SIGTAS system, should continue. The
                        Government should pursue opportunities to encourage compliance by
                        streamlining procedures for tax payments. More generally, efforts to improve
                        the business environment and to build private sector confidence could
                        encourage higher levels of investment and therefore support increased tax
                        revenues.
                       Managing security costs: The current trajectory of security expenditures is
                        unsustainable, with these expenditures already squeezing the Government’s
                        fiscal space and reducing its ability to meet development needs. Security
                        expenditures should be reviewed and measures implemented to ensure their
                        long-term sustainability.
                       Improving public spending efficiency: Public investment should be guided
                        by consistent and realistic economic planning. Costed and prioritized
                        investment plans that align with an overall economic strategy should be
                        developed. Public investment management capacities should be improved,
                        with these capacities concentrated within ministries and agencies most
                        relevant to the achievement of improved growth.
                       Pension reform: Unless it is reformed, the pension system will begin to
                        impose fiscal costs by 2024. Reforming the pension system now could free up
                        fiscal space equivalent to 0.7 percent of GDP with which to pursue priority
                        development investments.

D. Focus Section II: Fragility and Population
Movement in Afghanistan

                  Afghans have been enduring the adverse consequences of forced displacement for
                  decades, with Afghanistan having the largest number of its people living as refugees
                  in protracted exile of any country in the world. It is estimated that 2.5 million
                  registered Afghan refugees remain in neighboring countries, with possibly an equal
                  number of undocumented migrants with similar protection needs in Iran and
                  Pakistan. Internal displacement is also significant problem, with an estimated 1.2
                  million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in need of humanitarian assistance.

                  The deteriorating security situation has led to a sharp increase in displacement
                  pressures in recent years. A shrinking asylum space at the global level and changes in
                  the geopolitical equilibrium at the regional level have recently spurred the return of
                  thousands of refugees and asylum seekers from Pakistan and, in lower numbers, from
                  Iran and Europe. As of early September, in 2016, returnees from Pakistan alone
                  account for 98,000 registered and 135,000 undocumented Afghans. An additional
                  400,000 are expected to return by the end of the year to join the increasingly large
                  number of IDPs.

                  Many of these returnees are expected to require some form of humanitarian
                  assistance, especially as the cold winter season approaches and many go without
                  appropriate accommodation or shelter. However, the management and protection of
                  the displaced people is being conducted in a challenging context, with the security
                  situation remaining very volatile, the country lacking an effective system of safety nets
                  and suffering from a severe economic slowdown that has triggered a three-fold
                  increase in unemployment and pushed many Afghans below the poverty line.
                  Moreover, a large proportion of the population at large still remains underserved in
                  terms of access to basic public services. What are the possible implications and risks
                  of such a sizeable population shock to Afghanistan? How can Afghanistan best
                  absorb and successfully reintegrate displaced people under the current security and
                  economic circumstances? What actions should the Government and the international
                  community prioritise?

                  Learning from the past
                  Afghanistan has a long history of protracted international displacement. Afghans fled
                  by the millions in the aftermath of the Soviet invasion of 1979, mostly to Iran and
                  Pakistan. While some returned to Afghanistan in the early 1990s following the
                  tightening of asylum conditions in the recipient countries, Afghanistan’s civil war and
                  the rise of the Taliban resulted in a new exodus to neighboring countries. The fall of
                  the Taliban regime in 2001 marked the beginning of a massive wave of returning
                  Afghans. Thus, an estimated 20 percent of the total population currently residing in
                  Afghanistan is made up of returnees.

                                    The return of displaced people has been unevenly spread in terms of time and
                                    location, creating disproportionately large challenges to the absorption capacities of
                                    some districts and provinces (see figures 21 and 22). While the local impact of a

                                    influx of returnees relative to the local population were most likely to suffer higher
                                    levels of insecurity (see Figure 23).

                                    Over time, the intensification of conflict and the saturation of local absorption
                                    capacities have also resulted in a progressive increase in the incidence of secondary
                                    displacement among returnees. The incidence of internal displacement among the
                                    displaced people who returned in 2013 is twice as high as amongst those who returned
                                    in 2002, despite the fact that the number of returnees in 2002 was almost 50 times
                                    larger than in 2013 (see Figure 4). The increase in the incidence of secondary
                                    displacement among returnees indicates that Afghanistan’s capacity to absorb and
                                    reintegrate these returnees is already overstretched. An increase in the number of
                                    returns from abroad is therefore likely to result in a consequent increase in the
                                    incidence of internal displacement. The continued deterioration of the security
                                    situation and the economic slowdown are likely to exacerbate the challenge of
                                    reintegrating more recent returns.

                                                An assessment of the welfare and the degree of integration of displaced households
                                                currently living in Afghanistan provides important insights into the challenges that
                                                future IDPs and returnees might face.

                                                Irrespective of motives or causes, household mobility is associated with urbanization
                                                (see Figure 25). IDP and returnee households predominantly settle in urban centers,
                                                joining a throng of economic migrants leaving the rural areas in search of jobs and
                                                better access to health and education. IDP and returnee households are also more
                                                likely to have a literate household head than are households who did not move or
                                                households that have moved for economic reasons, reflecting the better access to
                                                education returnees might have had in asylum. However, as is the case for non-mobile
                                                households, IDP households have very poor labor market outcomes. In fact, heads
                                                of IDP households are more likely to be either engaged in vulnerable forms of
                                                employment or to be unemployed and/or underemployed. Returnee households are
                                                more likely to have a member working abroad and sending remittances, possibly
                                                taking advantage of networks established while in asylum.

                                                Poverty and vulnerability are widespread in Afghanistan. Irrespective of its causes and
                                                motivations, mobility is associated with a lower incidence of poverty (see Figure 26).
                                                Returnee households have a significantly lower poverty incidence than non-mobile
                                                households, with the poverty rate for returnee households standing at 29.4 percent
                                                compared to 40.5 percent for non-mobile households. However, this lower rate can
                                                be explained entirely in terms of levels of literacy and urbanization, with refugee
                                                households being more likely to have a literate household head and to live in an urban
                                                area than non-mobile households.

                                 The evidence suggests that the relatively high literacy and human capital levels of
                                 mobile households are the main determinants of their socio-economic advantage. In
                                 addition, irrespective of the motives or causes for migration, the risk of poverty for
                                 mobile households depends on the same factors that determine the risk of poverty in
                                 the population as a whole. Nearly 70 percent of Afghanistan’s working age population
                                 is illiterate, with the illiteracy being highest among the poorest segments of the
                                 population.

                                 Continued conflict and displacement could create further challenges to the
                                 accumulation of human capital. Available evidence from studies of former refugees
                                 residing in Afghanistan in 2013-14 shows that mobility during the decades before the
                                 fall of the Taliban was positively correlated with returnee literacy rates. Despite
                                 progress over the past decade, the supply and quality of Afghanistan’s educational
                                 services lags behind that of neighboring countries. As a result, on average, Afghans
                                 who were born abroad had better access to education than Afghans of the same age
                                 who did not move, particularly in the case of older returning Afghans. On the other
                                 hand, internal displacement is negatively correlated with children’s human capital
                                 accumulation. In particular, regression analysis shows that children aged six to 15 in
                                 IDP households are 8.5 percent less likely to be enrolled in school, with this
                                 disadvantage being particularly severe for the first two years of residence in a new
                                 location.


                                 Recommendations
                                 The available evidence suggests that push factors are the primary determinants for
                                 migration both within and outside Afghanistan. While migrants may choose where to
                                 go based on the opportunities and information available to them, departure itself is
                                 more often a necessity than a choice.

                                 The past history of displacement and returns to Afghanistan indicates the potentially
                                 destabilizing effects of increasing population pressure on limited local resources.
                                 Given the increase in the incidence of secondary displacement among more recent
                                 waves of returnees, local absorption capacities appear to already be overtaxed. An
                                 increase in the number of returns from Pakistan, Iran, or Europe is likely to result in

                  a cycle of secondary displacement, unemployment, instability, and further
                  displacement.

                  The situation will require a well-coordinated and multi-faceted operational
                  response to avert a potential humanitarian crisis as winter approaches. The
                  international community should increase its advocacy to ensure voluntary, safe,
                  dignified, and phased returns, as further population shocks have the potential to
                  undermine civilian and military aid efforts and exacerbate conflict and insecurity.
                  Peace and stability in Afghanistan are not only a pre-requisite for its development,
                  they are also a global public good. If no single country or institution alone has the
                  capacity to effectively assist Afghanistan to manage its displacement issues, the
                  international community as a whole could mobilize resources to assist countries such
                  as Pakistan and Iran that have borne the burden for decades. Similarly, the
                  international community as a whole should support the development of legal channels
                  to enable temporary economic migration and the more effective management of
                  asylum requests, which could help Afghanistan overcome its current crisis and ease
                  its structural challenges.

                  Secondly, the evidence suggests that factors determining poverty risks among mobile
                  households are the same as those determining poverty risks among the general
                  population. With Afghanistan experiencing widespread poverty and with the degree
                  of destitution among mobile households being not dissimilar to that experienced by
                  the rest of the population, it is better to target needs than to target population categories.
                  This approach may reduce perceptions of unequal treatment, with these perceptions
                  potentially exacerbating social fragmentation. An approach of this sort might be
                  particularly important in the context of the Government and international community
                  transitioning towards a developmental approach to the management of displacement
                  issues. As the fiscal space for social spending shrinks, a consolidation of interventions
                  could contribute to the development of a nationwide safety net system intended
                  to enable households to cope with risk and possibly to reduce some of the causes of
                  displacement.

                  Thirdly, priority should be given to minimizing any possible negative impact of
                  displacement on human capital investments for future generations. The evidence
                  suggests that low levels of human capital is the main factor determining the risk of
                  poverty and that households are likely to respond to negative shocks by pulling
                  children out of school. While a comprehensive safety net system could help to
                  mitigate such negative consequences, bureaucratic barriers related to residency status
                  and the transferability of school records could have a disproportionately negative
                  impact on displaced and mobile populations. Moreover, given the prevalence of
                  mobility and displacement in Afghanistan, priority should be given to investing in
                  functional literacy and skills-development programs that have greater portability
                  and that provide displaced individuals with greater access to economic opportunities,
                  wherever their final location.

                  Lastly, the evidence suggests that migrants are likely to continue to converge towards
                  Afghanistan’s urban centers in search of better security, jobs, and services. The trend
                  towards increased urbanisation requires immediate interventions by local
                  authorities to increase shelter capacity and access to services. National and provincial
                  authorities should recognize that, in the medium and long term, local integration in
                  urban and semi-urban areas is inevitable. This integration requires adequate planning
                  to maximize the returns from urban agglomeration. This planning should include the

                  appropriate investments to improve connectivity and accessibility while ensuring
                  access to basic services and a minimum standard of living.

APPENDIX I: WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM IN AFGHANISTAN
1. The World Bank Group’s program in Afghanistan is governed by the joint Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for
   FY 2012–FY 2014, which focuses on three themes: (i) building the legitimacy and capacity of institutions;
   (ii) equitable service delivery; and (iii) inclusive growth and jobs. The process for preparing the next country
   strategy, the Country Partnership Framework for Afghanistan (CPF), has been launched, and the
   Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD), which informs the CPF by identifying the development challenges
   and opportunities, has been completed.
2. Since 2002, the International Development Association (IDA) has committed a total of US$ 3.60 billion in
     grants (86 percent) and credits (14 percent) in Afghanistan. Thirty-seven development and emergency-
     reconstruction projects and a budget support operation have been committed as of September 2016. In
     addition, the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) has generated US$ 9.2 billion of funding
     from 34 donors, and committed US$ 4.2 billion for the Government’s recurrent costs and US$ 4.45 billion
     for government investment programs. As of the September 2016, the active IDA portfolio was worth US$
     1.27 billion and the active ARTF investment portfolio was worth US$ 3.1 billion.
3. The Bank also administers the ARTF, the World Bank Group’s largest single-country multi-donor trust fund.
    The ARTF provides grant support to Afghanistan based on a three-year rolling financing strategy.
    Together, the IDA and the ARTF provide close to US$ 1 billion per year in grant resources (about US$
    200 million from IDA and about US$ 800–US$ 900 million from the ARTF). The ARTF is a key vehicle
    for providing the Government with predictable and transparent on-budget financing, providing a platform
    for policy dialogue between the Government and donors.
4. In FY 2016, the World Bank Board approved the Trans-Hindukush Road Connectivity Project to the amount
     of US$ 250 million, as well as additional financing for an existing project, the Second Customs Reform and
     Trade Facilitation Project, to the amount of US$ 21.5 million. Under the ARTF, six new projects were
     approved, including US$ 83 million for the Naghlu Hydropower Rehabilitation Project; US$ 6 million for
     DABS TA; US$ 50 million for the Higher Education Development Project; US$ 4.95 million for Land
     Management Support; US$ 5 million for E-Governance Digital CASA; and US$ 5 million for the Technical
     Assistance Project. Additional financing for existing projects included US$ 41 million for the Second Public
     Financial Management Project; US$ 45 million for the On-farm Water Management Project; US$ 70 million
     for the Irrigation Rehabilitation and Development; US$ 90 million for National Horticulture and Livestock;
     and US$ 57.26 million for the Third National Solidarity Project. Funds to a value of US$ 593 million were
     disbursed under the Recurrent Cost Window for the FY 2016.
5. The World Bank continues to engage in rigorous analytical work and to place a significant emphasis on policy
    dialogue. These non-lending activities have supported the World Bank’s lending program and played a
    crucial role in informing the Government of its strategic choices and in advancing dialogue between the
    Government and its international development partners. In the last fiscal year, the ARTF Steering
    Committee endorsed the Research and Analysis Program (RAP), which aims to support the Government
    policy reform agenda and decision-making processes. The program creates an opportunity to introduce
    innovative ways of working with the Government, universities and local research institutions to introduce
    analysis and generate knowledge. As part of the RAP, the World Bank is currently engaged in a series of
    analytical works to enhance understanding of Afghanistan’s growth and fragility challenges and to inform
    the development response of the Government and international development partners. The initial results
    of this work were presented at the Brussels Conference on Afghanistan in October 2016.
6. IFC’s committed investment portfolio in Afghanistan has more than doubled, from around US$ 58 million
    in FY08 to around US$ 135 million in FY14. Currently, IFC’s portfolio stands at about US$ 54 million and
    includes one investment in the telecommunications sector (Roshan), one investment in the hotel sector
    (TPS), and two operations in financial markets (First Microfinance Bank, Afghanistan International Bank).
    IFC’s investments have had a transformational impact in terms of access to finance and outreach,
    particularly in the microfinance and telecommunication sectors. IFC’s Advisory Services program has been

                                                                                                                30
                                                                  Afghanistan Development Update


   supporting the investment program in the areas of access to finance, small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
   capacity development, horticulture/agribusiness development and investment climate. At present, the
   focus of IFC’s advisory work is on improving the investment climate through reforms to licensing,
   construction permits and other areas where reforms may result in improvements to Doing Business
   Indicators. IFC has also launched the pre-implementation phase of the Lighting Afghanistan Program,
   which aims to expand the off-grid market and to facilitate access by 180,000 households to affordable solar
   lighting solutions. In addition, IFC is increasing the supply of fresh and processed fruits through measures
   to improve compliance with market standards and to facilitate the integration of farmers into the value
   chain of leading agribusinesses, providing them with access to increased market opportunities. IFC will
   continue to seek new investment opportunities and to engage with local players in order to support the
   development of Afghanistan’s private sector, particularly in the areas of infrastructure (energy), finance and
   microfinance, manufacturing, agribusiness and services.
7. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has US$ 154 million of gross exposure in
   Afghanistan, supporting telecommunications and agribusiness projects. In 2013, MIGA launched its
   Conflict Affected and Fragile Economies Facility, which is supports the agency’s exposure in Afghanistan.
   MIGA currently supports three projects in Afghanistan, of which one is a joint effort with IFC in the
   telecommunications sector to support the telecom operator MTN. The other two operations are MIGA-
   only projects related to dairy and cashmere production.

APPENDIX II: GOVERNMENT REFORMS IN 2016
The following text is copied, without modification, from the document titled “Highlights of Achievements” originally submitted by
the National Unity Government at the Senior Officials Meeting on September 5, 2015, and subsequently updated in September
2016.
                                           The National Unity Government
                                            Highlights of Achievements
                                                  September 2016

Introduction:
The National Unity Government (NUG) presented the first “Highlights of Achievements” in the Senior
Officials Meeting (SOM) that was held in Kabul on 5 September 2015. Since then, the Government has
continued to put into practice extensive reforms to enhance service delivery, curb corruption and introduce the
new generation of administration to respond to the nation’s development needs.
Selected highlights of government achievements over the past year include:

Political Stability and Advancement in Regional Cooperation

    1. Turkmenistan – Afghanistan – Pakistan –India Natural Gas Pipeline (TAPI): Construction on
         the project started in Turkmenistan on 13 December 2015 and the pipeline is expected to be
         operational by 2019. TAPI presents an opportunity for regional cooperation on an unprecedented
         scale, linking the economies of the four countries. The pipeline aims to export up to 33 billion cubic
         meters of natural gas per year through a proposed pipeline, approximately 1,800-kilometer long, from
         Turkmenistan to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India.

    2. Afghanistan, India and Iran signed the Chabahar Port agreement on 24 May 2016. The project will
         build a transport-and-trade corridor through Afghanistan that could help halve the time and cost of
         doing business with Central Asia and Europe.

    3. TAP500 will transmit electricity from Turkmenistan to Pakistan through Afghanistan. The MOU for
         the tripartite power project of 500-KV line which was signed on 13 December 2015 in Mary,
         Turkmenistan held its first meeting was held in Islamabad on 12 April 2016. The ADB will establish
         project secretariat and provide technical assistance, including project assessment, feasibility study,
         technical design and other project preparation.

    4. The CASA-1000 project was inaugurated in May 2016 is expected to be completed by the end of 2018.
       CASA-1000 will move electricity between the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan (477 kilometers) and
       from Tajikistan to Afghanistan and Pakistan (750 kilometers).
    5. For the first time in the history of Sino-Afghan relations, special railway transportation of
       commercial goods between the two countries was launched on 25 August 2016. The train left Nantong
       in eastern China’s Jiangsu province on 25 August 2016, carrying 84 containers. It will take 15 days to
       complete the journey, running via the Alataw Pass, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to Hairatan in northern
       Afghanistan. Two trains are scheduled to run each month, as part of China’s “Belt and Road” initiative
       to improve Asian transport connectivity. The railway will take Afghan export items like marble, saffron,
       and dried fruit to China.

Anti-corruption, Governance, Rule of Law and Human Rights

    1. The Anti-Corruption Justice Center opened in June 2016 and is already operational. The Center is
         reviewing more than 20 cases including some involving high Government officials.

                                                                                                                             32
                                                                  Afghanistan Development Update


   2. A one-stop-shop for issuing construction permits has been established at Kabul Municipality. This
        will simplify administrative procedures, standardize services and boost efficiency in delivery.
   3. The National Procurement Committee has approved 1250 contracts, valued at Afs 155 billion or
        (US$ 2,313,432,836). More than Afs 15 billion (US$ 223,880,595) has been saved in the approved
        contracts. 71 companies have been blacklisted, 70 of these companies been introduced to Attorney
        General Office for breaking the law, further 25 Companies are under debarment process. Over 150
        million Afghanis in bid/performance securities forfeited and transferred to government ’s revenue
        account
   4.   Overall, 94.7 % of government officials including the Chief Executive Officer of the National Unity
        Government have declared their assets as per Article 154 of the constitution. The government is
        expanding asset declarations to cover senior officials in tax, customs, and revenue.
   5.   Ministry of education has addressed the problem of “ghost teachers” through the newly established
        Teacher Registration and Payroll System tracks.
   6.   The High Council on Governance, Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption, one of only two Councils
        led by President Ghani, met for the first time on July 28.
   7.   In the Attorney General’s Office, an Elimination of Violence Against Women/EVAW unit has
        been created with a female prosecutor as director.
   8.   The 2016 World Press Freedom Index ranks Afghanistan higher than every neighboring country and
        4th best among the 13 countries of South and Central Asia.

Legal reform for anti-corruption actions is accelerating

   1. The justice sector is being revitalized. More than 600 judges have been changed. Over 100 Kabul
      city officials have had their passports seized on charges of corruption whilst investigations of municipal
      corruption are being prepared.
   2. The Ministry of Interior has introduced a computerized human resource information system using
      biometric ID cards and electronic banking that is able to catch “ghost” workers.
   3. Land and Water Administration (ARAZI) has recovered 30,000 jeribs (6000 hectares) of illegally
      seized land in 2016.

Restoring Fiscal Sustainability and the Integrity of Public Finance and Commercial Banking

   1. On 20 July, the IMF Executive Board approved a three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF). This
        agreement comes after a successful nine-month Staff Monitored Program, which was completed in
        April 2016. The ECF covers reforms to fiscal management, banking, stateowned enterprises, and
        economic statistics.
   2.   Ministry of Finance has collected Afs 81.70 billion (US$ 1,219,402,985) in revenues in the first quarter
        of the current fiscal year (2016-17), exceeding the IMF target by 7 percent, or Afs 5.30 billion (US$
        79,104,478). This is an increase of Afs 26,68 billion (USD398,208,955) or 48 percent compared to the
        same quarter in the previous year.
   3.   A new E-payment system was introduced by the Afghan Customs Department and Da Afghanistan
        Bank allowing traders to pay custom duty electronically. E-pay automates the collection of customs
        duties, speed the release of goods, and is considered to be a best practice for modern customs
        administrations.
   4.   The Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) is now operational in 98 percent of
        customs locations.
   5.   Standard Integrated Government Tax Administration System (SIGTAS) is a computerized Tax
        Administration database system, which is deployed by ARD and it is being used for Tax payers

                                                                                                             33
                                                                 Afghanistan Development Update


      registration, process automation, Tax process simplification, procedures standardization, accurate Tax
      calculation, revenue data analysis, on time and accurate reporting, security and integrity of revenue
      data. With its full implementation, the corruption in tax payment process is highly reduced and it brings
      transparency in tax collection process. SIGTAS is currently implemented in Kabul LTO, MTO, STO.
   6. Under the Presidential Decree (334) dated 26/02/1394, a committee is formed for receiving bad debts
      of the banks. The committee, chaired by Minister of Finance, developed a procedure for receiving bad
      debts in the first meeting. Following approval of the procedure file of each debtor of Afghanistan
      National Bank and Pashtany Bank were reviewed and decision was made for receiving their debts. Bad
      debts in an amount of US$ 1.35 million was received for Pashtany Bank while amounts of US$ 1.92
      million were received for Afghanistan National Bank.

Reforming Development Planning and Management

  1. Donors and government agreed on a standardized rate scale for on and off-budget contractors to level
     the playing field. Implementation is underway.
  2. The government met all or most performance triggers for budget-based support from the
     IMF, World Bank, and USAID, including receiving a performance bonus from the World Bank’s
     “Incentive Program.”
  3. The first annual performance review of the public financial reform roadmap was completed in
     August, 2016.

Social Inclusion and Ensuring Citizens’ Development Rights

   1. One of the ways the government of Afghanistan is showing its commitment to empowering women is
       by appointing qualified female officials to key positions. There are more women in senior
       government positions than at any other time in Afghan history. Three female ministers, nine female
       deputy ministers, one female governor, a female deputy attorney general, the first female deputy head
       of the High Peace Council, and two female peace council members have been appointed. Women will
       also represent Afghanistan as part of the negotiations team at the peace talks. In addition, three female
       ambassadors have been appointed to Indonesia, Norway and Switzerland.

   2. An MOU was signed with the Republic of Azerbaijan to launch Asan Khedmat, a one stop shop
       solution for providing public services quickly, easily and in a transparent way. The Kabul center has
       been established and will soon provide residents access to twenty one services, including Tazkeeras
       (national ID cards), wedding certificates, driver’s licenses, vehicle registrations.

   3. The first phase of the Jobs for Peace program was completed successfully, disbursing over US$ 70
      million and creating at least 2.6 million man-days of labor in poor communities.
   4. The Maintenance Cash Grant (MCG) program was launched on 17 November, 2015 by H.E. the
      President. Under the pilot phase (December-July) US$ 31 million has been disbursed, reaching 3,800
      communities and generating over 4 million labor days. 90 percent of the work on the ground is
      completed. NSP is in the process of implementing Italian funds for US$ 10+ million reaching 1,364
      communities and generating 1.3 million labor days as well as US/ UK funds for US$ 42+ million
      reaching 6,297 communities with 6 million labor days. The MCG is helping with the maintenance of
      village-level infrastructure, including road and irrigation canals.
   5. A nationwide program to survey, register, and provide certificates of land occupancy to irregular
      urban settlements was launched in five major cities. Over 6,000 properties have already been mapped
      by residents and are being registered for certificates in Herat, Jalalabad, Kandahar, Mazar-e-Sharif,
