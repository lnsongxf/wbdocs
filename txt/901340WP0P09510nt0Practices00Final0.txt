Improvement in the Living Standards

A mid-term impact evaluation on implementation of land acquisition, resettlement and community
development activities was undertaken by the project through independent consultants in November 2010
that revealed:

(i)	 the average income of project-affected families has increased by 26% in real terms over baseline
       incomes and is 41% more than the average income of the control set of population;
(ii)	 63% of the affected people have added additional household assets or immovable assets such as
       land or house from the compensation amounts received by them;
(iii)	 the proportion of people working in fixed earning income jobs has increased by 5% from the baseline
       and is 6% above that of control set of population;
(iv)	 the housing conditions of the affected people have substantially improved. For example, average size
       of the house is now 35% bigger than the baseline average size and 18% bigger than the control set
       population’s size of houses; and
(v)	 the project-affected people identified support for technical education, merit scholarships, dispensary
       at Bayal and mobile health van, to be good initiatives by SJVNL in assisting the affected people and
       local people in their efforts towards improving the access to basic amenities and health and education

“…The earlier house had four rooms and a toilet, permanent but smaller. After land acquisition, SJVNL gave
us a plot for our resettlement. Actually, the plot is only 100 meters away from our earlier home. We continue
to get fodder for our cattle from the nearby forest… so no change. …... This is the new house that we have
constructed. It has four rooms but as you can see they are bigger than earlier… with a toilet. Water supply is
available for 24 hours. SJVNL has provided street lighting and recently set up a sewage treatment plant for the

work outside the area. By June 2014, 113 petty
contracts worth Rs. 238.14 million (US$ 4.76 million)
had been awarded to local people, of which Rs.
179.30 million (US$ 3.59 million) worth works (75%)
have been completed. Besides, the major project
contractors have awarded 84 petty contracts worth Rs.
40.4 million (US$ 0.8 million).

Employment of local persons by contractors:
SJVNL engaged local persons on annual contracts
through various contractors, thereby increasing local
employment for clerks, supervisors and data entry
operators on pay scales ranging between Rs. 3,000
and 8,000 (US$ 60-160) per month. In addition, 344
local people including 22 project-affected persons were
employed by contractors on long-term contracts. With
this experience and income, these entrants have been
able to pursue higher studies and other professional
interests. Although a state-of-the-art hydropower
project like the Rampur one has only limited manpower
needs, SJVNL has stipulated that “one member of                    persons, mainly semi-skilled and unskilled, at the

I work with the finance department of RHP and live in Kasholi village of Badi panchayat i.e. within the
project-affected area, but not directly affected. When RHP introduced this scheme of hiring of vehicles for

purchased a Mahindra Bolero vehicle on loan and rented it out to RHP in my wife’s name in 2011. I get Rs.
18,000 (US$ 360) as a fixed rate and with fuel and other expenses it is about Rs. 27,000 (US$ 540) per month.
Part of the earnings goes towards loan repayment and driver’s salary. Money earned has been good and
enabled me to afford more. My son is enrolled in GNIIT – computer course from an accredited institute. Also,
once the loan amount is cleared, I get the vehicle for free. If I sell it, I will get at least Rs. 1,50,000 (US$ 3000).

Mobile health vans and medical camps: Prior to the
project, the nearest medical facility for local communities
was at Khaneri or Rampur, approximately 8-10 km
away. Inadequate transportation rendered access
difficult. Medical camps and mobile health vans became
operational in January 2005, comprising a team of
doctors, nurses and attendants that visits villages thrice
weekly for one hour per village, also providing treatment
and referral services to villages in the neighbourhood.

Mobile health vans and medical camps help
diagnose patients, provide medicines free of cost,

awareness about basic hygiene and balanced diet in
the surrounding villages. By June 2014, more than

“I reside in Nirmand… from a project-affected family. I have a diploma in pharmacy. Earlier I was working in
a government hospital for 1-1/2 years, later ran a drug store. I joined SJVNL under the project employment
provision for skilled project-affected families. Here I support Out Patient Department (OPD) activities, Mobile
Health Van (MHV) services, maintain a stock register, dressings for minor ailments, etc. It’s a pleasure to serve
my own people…they are happy also to receive quality treatment and medicines in their village with MHV. The
job with RHP, Bayal dispensary has given me economic security as my husband has a job that is temporary.
He is teacher in a school at Kumarsein. In the drug store earlier, I was getting about Rs. 15,000 (US$ 300)
per month but now I earn Rs. 26,000 (US$ 520) per month. And as a staff member, the project has given me
accommodation in the Jhakri staff colony. My child is studying in DPS school. Things are definitely better now.”

Provision of toilet kits: To support the total sanitation
campaign, the project distributed toilet kits to 2,200
households in the project-affected area, who reported
using them.

Provision of pressure cookers: To promote forest
conservation, SJVNL provided each project-affected
family (139 families) with a five-liter pressure cooker to
reduce the use of fuel wood from nearby forests. The
response from the communities was very positive.

Camps for agriculture, horticulture and skill awareness:
Farm work is done mainly by women who have
attended SJVNL camps for improving skills, farm
practices and technologies.

Since SJVNL was a single project organization (at                         contribution of the project in improving their overall
