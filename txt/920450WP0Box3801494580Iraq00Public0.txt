THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’ s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

       Commerce and the Federation of Chambers of Commerce

       The company name should be an Arabic name. A special department at
       the Chamber of Commerce, Trade Names, starts by searching the
       suggested name through their system to see if the name is already
       taken or reserved by another company. Once a name is agreed upon
       and available, the name is reserved upon payment of a nominal fee. The
       Federation of the Chambers of Commerce is informed in order to
       ensure that the chosen name is not taken through other Iraqi chambers
       of commerce. This procedure likely requires more than one visit to both       2 days        IQD 500,000

       trade name by virtue of a letter addressed to the Company Registrar
       Office of the Ministry of Trade, issued by the Federation of Chambers of
       Commerce. In order to facilitate the company name reservation process,
       the Chamber of Commerce will open an office at the company
       registration office.

       Pay paving and inspection fees to municipality

       The fees are calculated as follows:
       1. For main streets 15 m wide or greater: [(Paving cost per sq. m x street
       width) / 6] x the dimension of the land parallel to the street (front).
       2. For secondary streets less than 15 m wide: [(Paving cost per sq. m x
       street width) / 6] x dimension of the land parallel to the street (front).

       The paving cost is considered by the municipality to be IQD 2,455 per
       sq. m.

       In addition the cost of paving the pedestrian walkway of the street
       adjacent to the warehouse is calculated as follows: Paving cost per sq.
       m. x assumed width of the walkway x the front dimension.

       The assumed width of the walkway is as follows:
       For street width of 8 - 9.9 m: 0.75 m
   1   For street width of 10 - 14.9 m:1 m                                           1 day         IQD 143,750
       For street width of 15 - 19.9 m: 1.34 m
       For street width of 20 m and above: 2 m and up to a maximum of 5 m.

       The paving cost of the pedestrian walkway is IQD 700 per sq. m.

       The case study warehouse is most likely to be built on a secondary
       street that is 10 m wide and the front dimension of the land would be
       30 m.

       Thus, the total paving fees are: [(2,455*10)/6)*30] + (700*1*30) =
       122,750 + 21,000 = IQD 143,750 which is equivalent to USD 124.

        petition will then be reviewed by the office manager, after which the

        Electricity

        The office manager will request the technical department to inspect the
        site. The inspection is conducted for the following reasons:
        a. To check whether the wiring (the interface to the public network) is
        done properly and ready to be connected to the distribution network.         1 calendar day         IQD 0

        b. To identify the nearest connection point to the 11 kV feeder.
        c. To determine the material required to carry out the connection works.
        The inspection is followed by a report addressed to the manager.

        Agency: Ministry of Electricity



        The client obtains external works and final connection from the
        Ministry of Electricity

        The manager reviews the inspection report and notes from the local
        office on the availability of material, then asks the commercial
        department to determine the cost of material and services.
        The client needs to pay all the fees in advance. The manager checks the
        entire petition (paper copy) has been filled out. If the form is complete
        and according to the regulations in place, the manager will request
        implementation.
        The technical team will take all necessary actions to bring the materials
        to the site and carry out the works: install the poles (distance of 25
        meters between every 2 poles), the overhead wires, a 250-kVA
   4    transformer and its accessories, and connect the warehouse to the           44 calendar days     USD 15,360
        distribution network.
        In theory, both the MV and the LV networks can be overhead or
        underground in Baghdad. In the area assumed however, the most likely
        case is to have overhead connection.
        Because the works are carried out by the utility, the client is not
        requested to obtain any special permit. In the case of an underground
        connection, the Ministry of Electricity will need to obtain an excavation
        permit. In the case of an overhead connection, no such permit is even
        required.

      to occupy the property will be as per the purpose being set by the
      Municipality.

      estimate the amount of taxes to be paid. Transmission of documents to
      the Tax Authority is done by mail.

      will be charged an amount between 10000-15000 Dinars. This is an

The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a

the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes
the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
        economies with a population of more than               The seller requests a pretrial attachment to
