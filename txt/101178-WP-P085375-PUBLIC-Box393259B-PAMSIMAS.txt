     Hygiene and sanitation promotion in PAMSIMAS requires the active involvement of a range of stakeholders, including: teachers who play a pivotal role in
     promoting healthy behavior amongst children at the earliest age possible; small-scale entrepreneurs who play a significant role in enabling communities to achieve
     good outcomes in improved sanitation facilities; and, finally, communities which must collectively take action in changing behavior. All of the efforts resulted in a
     declaration of an open defecation free witnessed by district and sub-district officials.

      PAMSIMAS:
      Responding to the Water
      and Sanitation Challenges
      in Rural Indonesia
112




      Over the last few decades, Indonesia has enjoyed substantial achievements in
      poverty reduction, human development and improvements in service delivery.
      However, enormous challenges remain, especially in water and sanitation
      sectors. Severe consequences of poor sanitation infrastructure on public health,
      the economy, and the environment. Of the four most important causes of
      under-5 mortality in Indonesia, two—diarrhea and typhoid—are fecal-borne
      illnesses directly linked to inadequate water supply, sanitation and improper
      hygiene practice.


      Difficult access to improved water supply also means that poor households,
      particularly women and children, spend too much time fetching water.
      PAMSIMAS strives to improve existing facilities and expand sanitation access
      through a community-based approach.
