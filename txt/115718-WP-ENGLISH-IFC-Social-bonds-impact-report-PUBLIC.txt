IFC Social Bond Introduction
The launch of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the United Nations in 2016 has brought the world
together in a mission to end poverty, fight inequality, and tackle climate change. The SDGs recognize the
immense challenges that must still be overcome and the inter-connectedness of all aspects of sustainable
development. The goals address global challenges that span a broad range of issues. Meanwhile, a bond market
aimed at financing projects with social issues has emerged and deepened, supported by a growing number of
investors who have begun to embed ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) standards into their
investment decisions.

    “We are meeting at a time of immense challenges                    It is in this context that IFC is streamlining its

BACKGROUND
In 2013, IFC enhanced its breadth of thematic bond products with the launch of the BOW Bond Program, the
first bond program focused on creating opportunities for women entrepreneurs in emerging markets. Two
BOW Bonds were issued in 2013 and 2014, which raised USD 268.0 million and have so far supported 16
projects. Subsequently, another program was added to IFC’s thematic bond product mix in October 2014 when
the Inclusive Business Bond Program was launched, the first debt offering to exclusively support businesses
which include low-income communities
into their value chains. Under the Inclusive     Expected Impact under BOW and

STRUCTURE AND PROCESS
The new Social Bond Program aligns with the Social Bond
Guidance published in June 2016 by the International
Capital Markets Association (ICMA) as secretariat for the
Green Bond Principles (GBP). The program incorporates
the four core components of the GBP (use of proceeds,
process for project evaluation and selection, management                                          Use of

Use of Proceeds

The net proceeds of the Social Bond issues will be allocated to support Social Bond Eligible Projects. Eligible
Projects are projects funded, in whole or in part, by IFC that involve:

     1) lending to financial intermediaries with the requirement that the proceeds of IFC’s loan be on -lent to
     women-owned enterprises2 or

     2) lending to companies that incorporate people at the “Base of the Economic Pyramid” or “BOP” (defined
     as people who earn less than the equivalent of $8 per day 3 or who do not have access to basic goods and
     services) into its value chain as suppliers, distributors, or customers as part of such company’s core
     business in a commercially viable and scalable way.

Examples of Eligible Projects include: 4

        Investments in companies that source directly from smallholder farmers
        Investments in utilities (e.g. electricity, gas, water) that provide low-income households with better
         access to services
        Investments in companies that provide health services, education services or housing to low-income
         populations in more affordable ways
        Investments in companies that provide goods and services to low-income populations
        Investments in companies that provide access to telecommunication and payment platforms in
         markets that include the low-income segment




2 For purposes hereof, a women-owned enterprise is (a) a business that is at least 51% owned by a woman or women, or (b) a
business in which a woman or women hold at least 20% of the ownership interests; and has at least 1 woman of the senior
executive roles (e.g. Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operation Officer, President, Vice-President); and women hold at least 30% of
seats on the board of directors where a board exists.
3 The $8/day income threshold is in purchasing power parity terms (PPP). PPP terms adjust the real figure to equate the relative

purchasing powers in different countries.
4 The above examples of Eligible Projects are for illustrative purposes only and no assurance can be provided that disbursements

for projects with these specific characteristic will be made by IFC during the term of the notes.

                                                                4

Project Selection

The Social Bond Eligible Projects described above are selected from a scrutinized loan portfolio of IFC (equity
investments and guarantees are ineligible for funding via Social Bonds). Eligible Projects follow IFC’s
investment process and are implemented in consistency with IFC’s Sustainability Framework, including the
Performance Standards and World Bank Group Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) Guidelines, IFC’s
Corporate Governance Framework and disclosure requirements of the IFC Access to Information Policy (AIP).
All projects have undergone a rigorous ESG due diligence process and are subject to ongoing monitoring and
supervision.

In particular, IFC's Environmental and Social Performance Standards define IFC clients' responsibilities for
managing their environmental and social risks, and establish standards in the following eight aspects that the
clients are to meet throughout the life of investments by IFC:

         Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts
         Labor and Working Conditions
         Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention
         Community Health, Safety, and Security
         Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement
         Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources
         Indigenous Peoples
         Cultural Heritage

Management of Proceeds

The net proceeds of the Social Bonds will be allocated within IFC's Treasury to a special sub-portfolio that will
be linked to IFC’s lending operations for Eligible Projects. The sub -portfolio will be invested by IFC’s Treasury
in accordance with IFC’s liquid asset management investment guidelines. So long as the notes are outstanding,
the balance of the sub-portfolio will be reduced by amounts matching disbursements made in respect of Eligible
Projects.

IFC is rated triple-A by Standard & Poor and Moody’s. The payment of interest and the principal of the Social
Bonds is strictly based on the credit quality of IFC and is not directly affected by the result of the underlying
investments that IFC makes.

Reporting

IFC is committed to transparent reporting on projects included in its Social Bond Program. IFC follows best
reporting practices and the Social Bond Guidance, a voluntary guidance on transparency and disclosure.

For each proposed investment, IFC discloses relevant information pertaining to the project, including the
project’s environmental and social implications, as well as its expected development impact. Information for
all IFC financed projects is available at http://www.ifc.org/projects.

IFC makes available information concerning its activities according to the AIP. The AIP sets out IFC’s policy
regarding the scope of information that it makes available to the public either as a routine matter or upon
request. The full policy can be found at http://www.ifc.org/aip.

On an annual basis, IFC will publish the list of projects which have received funding from Social Bond proceeds
in the previous year. Subject to confidentiality approvals, the list of projects may include: a brief description of
the project, amount committed, and links to relevant public documents about the project.

In addition, IFC publishes a Socially Responsible Bond newsletter on an annual basis which provides investors
highlights of projects, news and updates.

Inclusive Business Bond Overview

INCLUSIVE BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Inclusive Businesses are companies that tackle
poverty and advance development, while at the
same time generating market-rate returns. It is an
approach that has been recognized by the G-20 as
playing a particularly important role in advancing
sustainable development. Inclusive Businesses
incorporate people who live at the Base of the
Pyramid (BOP) into the value chain of their
company, either as suppliers, retailers,
distributors, or customers. These companies do
this through their core business activities in such
a way that is commercially viable and scalable.

The BOP concept takes a multidimensional
approach to poverty—considering not only
income (the equivalent of $8 per day) but also
access to goods, services, and economic
opportunities. It is estimated that there are 4.5 billion people living at the BOP in 92 developing countries. 5
The women and men living at the BOP often experience economic and social exclusion; they represent a range
of vulnerable groups and lack access to products and services at the prices and levels of quality that others rely
on. Whether they are slum dwellers, rural villagers, small-scale farmers, informal laborers or micro-
entrepreneurs, they are often denied clean water, electrical power, good roads, modern communications,
health care, education, financial services, consumer goods, and steady sources of income.
Integrating men and women who live at the BOP into a company's core value chain can be a driving force for
inclusive growth and sustainable development. The 4.5 billion people at the BOP spend small amounts
individually, but on aggregate they spend $5 trillion a year—more than half of all expenditure in developing
countries. Inclusive Business companies serve basic needs, enhance productivity, create income generating
opportunities, and open up choices for women and men at the BOP that can enhance their livelihoods and well-
being.
Companies that take an Inclusive Business approach vary in size, range in scope from local to global, and are
found in many different industries.

INCLUSIVE BUSINESS BONDS ISSUANCE PROGRAM (FY15-FY16)
IFC’s Inclusive Business Bond Program raised funds from institutional and retail investors to support private
sector investments in companies that incorporate the BOP in developing countries. The Program was launched
in October 2014 with an inaugural bond sold to Japanese retail investors, which raised USD 104.4 million
equivalent. Inclusive Business Bonds were issued in four different currencies, where all non-USD borrowings
were swapped into USD, to support lending to IFC's Inclusive Business clients. 6

INCLUSIVE BUSINESS BONDS USE OF PROCEEDS REPORTING
IFC commitments include investments for which IFC and other project sponsors have signed a legally binding
agreement. Only debt commitments to Inclusive Businesses on IFC’s own account are considered eligible. 7
Disbursements are the outflow of funds from IFC’s Inclusive Business Bond proceeds to clients, which occurs
after commitments are finalized.

The tables and charts below show the breakdown of eligible commitments as well as bond proceeds
disbursements by industry and region in FY15-16.



Inclusive Business Eligible Commitments

INCLUSIVE BUSINESS BONDS PROJECT SUMMARY
Companies funded by the Inclusive Business Bonds do business with people living at the BOP in developing
countries. They have a direct impact on the poor, including farmers, patients, students, micro-loan borrowers,
micro-retailers, customers, and others.

To monitor the results of each investment, IFC uses its Development Outcome Tracking System (DOTS). 8 This
system helps to collect standardized data from IFC clients to track their reach and development results.
Examples of industry-specific indicators and aggregate target impacts are provided in the project summary
table below. 9 IFC tracks these indicators throughout the lifecycle of each project until project closure.

Reach targets listed in this report are calculated prior to the project being committed and represent expected
results.10

The project summary table below illustrates the expected development results from projects funded in FY15
and FY16, in whole or in part, with Inclusive Business Bond proceeds. The projects are organized by industry.

Banking on Women Bond Overview

BANKING ON WOMEN PROGRAM OVERVIEW
Women entrepreneurs are changing the face of the global economy, helping to sustain job creation and
economic growth. It is estimated that women-owned entities represent over 30% of registered businesses
worldwide. Yet on average only about 10% of women entrepreneurs have access to the capital needed to grow
their businesses. The fact that many emerging markets financial institutions have yet to develop sustainable
strategy to address this significant market gap represents a missed opportunity and constraints on private
sector development.

IFC’s BOW program plays a catalyzing role for IFC partners and financial institutions to help them profi tably
and sustainably serve women-owned businesses. As of end-June 2016, IFC had built a cumulative committed
portfolio of USD 1.13 billion, specifically carved out for on-lending to women-owned small and medium
enterprises (SMEs) through financial institutions, of which USD 620 million is on IFC’s own account and USD
510 million is mobilized from co-financiers.
