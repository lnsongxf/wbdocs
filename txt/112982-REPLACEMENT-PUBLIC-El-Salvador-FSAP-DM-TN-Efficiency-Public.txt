1.      The Salvadoran financial system lags behind its peers in terms of depth put it
outperforms them in terms of competition and efficiency. Cross country comparisons at the
regional level point to relatively low credit and deposits. Regional comparisons and country
specific data point to moderate levels of concentration in the banking sector, considering El
Salvador’s relatively small market size, but show its favorable position in terms of efficiency and
competition. Declining spreads and low administrative and personnel costs evidence consistent
gains efficiency. Banking sector credit is being allocated more towards consumer credit and less
towards productive activities. Given the country’s relative low financial depth but competitive
environment, there is room for expansion and financial development which can provide greater
funding for the productive activities of the private sector.

2.      This technical note takes four main approaches to examine the extent of competition
and efficiency of the Salvadoran banking sector. First, it examines bank entry and exit
regulations and bank transparency to determine whether the existing framework promotes
contestability and competition. Second, the note evaluates the degree of concentration in the
banking sector and estimates direct measures of competition by calculating the H-statistic for the
Salvadoran banking sector and by comparing it to those obtained for its regional peers. Third, the
note evaluates efficiency by examining the behavior of bank spreads, profitability and financial
intermediation margins and costs. Fourth, the note looks into the different segments of the loan
market to evaluate how efficiently credit is being allocated. Finally the note ends with some policy
recommendations.

                               STRUCTURE OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM

3.      El Salvador’s financial system has been growing more slowly than the regional
average. At 41.9% in 2014 (WB Finstats), private sector credit to GDP is below its expected value,
based on predictions given its income and indicators of its level of development. It also lags
relative to regional averages for Central America (50.3 percent of GDP) and Latin America and
the Caribbean (LAC) (46.1 percent of GDP). Its peers have private sector credit ranging from 55
percent (Honduras) to 86 percent of GDP (Panama), suggesting the potential for expansion of
lending in the domestic financial system (Figure 1). Growth rates for credit to the private sector
are among the lowest in Central America with real credit growth averaging 2.3 percent during
2009-2014, while in other countries like Guatemala (11.7 percent), Costa Rica (8.7 percent) and
Panama (10.3 percent) credit growth has been much higher.

 A World Bank (WB) mission visited San Salvador from March 6 to 16, 2016 to update the developmental aspects
of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) conducted in 2010.The team comprised John Pollner (Mission
Chief), Rekha Reddy (Deputy Mission Chief), Maria Teresa Chimienti, Denise Dias, Tamuna Loladze, Fredesvinda
Montes, Mateo Clavijo Munoz (all World Bank staff); José Rutman (Former Regulation General Deputy Manager,
Central Bank of Argentina), and Monica Caceres (Former Deputy Superintendent, Insurance, Chile).This note was
written by Mateo Clavijo with guidance and inputs from John Pollner and Rekha Reddy.

4.      Bank deposits in El Salvador also lag behind its regional peers and have been growing
slowly. Domestic bank deposits in El Salvador in 2014 were at 39.7 percent of GDP, below the
Central American and LAC regional averages, which were 43.8 and 49.5 percent of GDP,
respectively. Bank deposits in peer countries such as Honduras (49.4 percent of GDP) and Panama
(77.1 percent of GDP) suggest there is also potential for expansion on the liability side of the
financial system (Figure 1). Deposits in El Salvador have grown very slowly during the past years.
The real growth rate average for the 2009-2014 period was negative (-0.2 percent), while in
countries like Costa Rica, Guatemala and Panama deposits grew above 6 percent.

5.      El Salvador’s banking sector continues to be dominated by global and regional
financial groups. During the past decade the system has been characterized by a series of mergers
and acquisitions and at year- end 2015 the banking sector was comprised of 11 private commercial
banks and two public first-tier domestic banks (Table 1). El Salvador has the largest presence of
foreign ownership among the Central American countries. There are three Colombian financial
groups which control 54 percent of the banking sector assets and are among the top largest banks
in the country. The rest of the banking sector is dominated by regional and global conglomerates.
El Salvador continues to have the largest presence of foreign ownership among the Central
American countries with only 8.3 percent of total banking sector assets (5 percent of total financial
system assets) being controlled by domestic banks.

6.       Since the 2010 FSAP, bank assets have been declining as a share of total financial
assets while pension funds have been increasing. At year- end 2015, bank assets totaled US $16
billion (60.6 percent of total financial assets), up from US $13 billion, (65.7 percent of total
financial assets) in 2010. Private pension funds, originally set up in 1998, have continued to expand
rapidly due to mandatory contributions. Assets under their management increased from US $5.7
billion to US $8.7 billion in the same period (from 28.1 to 32.8 percent of financial system assets).

                      ENTRY INTO BANKING AND BANK DISCLOSURE REGULATIONS

7.      Bank entry and disclosure regulations are adequate and in line with practices in the
region. The limited review conducted by the FSAP program did not find evidence of excessive
legal barriers to entry for new banking institutions, and there are no signs that legal procedures
hinder competition. Evidence of this is the entry to the banking system of several Colombian and
other regional banking groups in the last decade, as well as the granting of two new bank licenses
(Banco Industrial in 2011 and Banco Azul in 2015) and three new SAC licenses. Although
regulations affecting the entry and exit requirements is consistent with practices in other countries,
the capital requirement for registry (US$ 17.6 million) is relatively high compared to countries
like Nicaragua (US$ 10.6 million) and Guatemala (US$ 13 million). During the first three years
of operation a newly regulated financial institution is required to have an equity/asset relation of
14.5 percent after which it can be reduced to 12 percent. These legal requirements are in line with
international standards.

8.      While the current banking law contains legal tools for certain asset transfer bank
resolution methods, a working group is in process of developing updated proposals to meet
latest global standards. This topic concerns the efficiency of the exit mechanism and how it
affects financial system and Government costs. The current proposals (not yet in draft law) include
integrating the bank regularization, restructuring and resolution processes, triggers and timelines,
and their links to the deposit guarantee system and the use of the least-cost criteria to select a
resolution outcome. In addition, proposals aim to harmonize resolution regimes for banks and
credit cooperatives. As to methods used, more detail is to be elaborated on the asset/liability
transfers from a failed bank to a new “good bank,” and including the use of the bridge bank tool.
Also, the treatment of systemically important banks will be addressed, and a systemic risk
committee comprising the four relevant authorities is to be constituted. Requirement of resolution
and recovery plans are also proposed.

9.      The SSF has made efforts to improve transparency in the banking sector and enhance
its enforcement role. The SSF has made efforts in enhancing transparency towards the consumer
and publishes monthly effective interest rates for each financial institution’s products to reduce the
cost of comparing financial products and is currently reforming its main transparency regulation
to improve disclosure standards and consumer complaints handling by financial institutions 2. The
SSF is also currently working on a draft legal reform focused on strengthening legal protection for
SSF officials, to improve its enforcement capacity.

                            BANKING CONCENTRATION AND COMPETITION

10.     The degree of concentration in the banking sector is moderate and has been declining
since 2012 (Figure 2). The asset position of the three largest banks has been declining since 2012
and remains well below the LAC average. The five largest banks, three of which are Colombian
owned, control about 76 percent of assets, loans and deposits, which evidences a moderately high
concentration when compared to other countries in the region such as Nicaragua (94 percent of
assets), Dominican Republic (87 percent of assets) and Guatemala (82 percent of assets).

11.     According to the Herfindahl concentration index El Salvador is moderately
concentrated when compared to its regional peers 3. The Herfindahl index (HHI) is a measure
of the size of banks relative to the sector and a popular indicator of competition4. The HHI in El
Salvador is the third lowest among the Central American countries and has been on a declining
path since 2010. Given the small size of the banking sector of El Salvador, compared to Colombia
(US$ 146 billion in assets) and Panama (US$116 billion), it is expected to have a high degree of
concentration (Figure 2). In this regard, El Salvador’s banking sector is not considered excessively
concentrated.

12.     Some studies have proposed alternative ways to measure competition directly,
separately from concentration. While the HHI is an adequate measure of concentration, it only
shows the potential for competitive/collusive behavior. The recent banking literature proposes
more direct measures of competition which seek to measure realized competition. A popular
measure is the Panzar and Rosse (1987) “H-statistic” (Box 1) which measures the degree of
competition by calculating the elasticity of the total interest revenue of banks with respect to input
prices. The H-statistic will equal 1 under perfect competition, less than or equal to 0 under a
monopoly, and under monopolistic competition between 0 and 1.




3
  According to the index parameters El Salvador is considered a non-concentrated market.
4
  It is defined as the sum of squares of the market shares of the financial institutions within banking sector. The
index ranges from 0 to 10,000 and a higher index indicates a greater concentration of market power

                                                           8
                     Box 1. Direct Measures of Competition: the H-statistic
A large number of studies have focused on measuring bank competition via the H-statistic, which
captures the elasticity of bank interest revenues to input prices. Based on the Panzar and Rosse
(1987) methodology and following the empirical strategy pursued by Claessen and Laeven (2004), the
H-statistic is calculated by estimating equation (1):

Ln(Pit)= αi + β1 ln(W1,it) + β2 ln(W2,it) + β3 ln(W3,it) + γ ln(Z,it) + δD + εit (1)

Where i denotes banks and t denotes years. P is the ratio of gross interest revenue to total assets (proxy
for the output price of loans), W1 is the ratio of interest expenses to total deposits and money market
funding (proxy for input price of deposits), W2 is the ratio of personnel expense to total assets (proxy
for input price of labor) and W3 is the ratio of other operating and administrative expense to total assets
(proxy for input price of equipment/fixed capital). Z is a matrix of controls including the ratio of equity
to total assets, the ratio of net loans to total assets, and the logarithm of assets (to control for bank size
effects). D is a vector of year dummies and αi denotes bank-level fixed effects.

The H-statistic equals β1 + β2 + β3. Conceptually, the statistic measures the responsiveness of bank
interest revenues to input prices. Under perfect competition, an increase in input prices raises both
marginal costs and total revenues by the same amount and, hence, the H-statistic will equal 1. Under a
monopoly, an increase in input prices results in a rise in marginal costs, a fall in output and a decline in
revenues leading to an H-statistic less than or equal to 0. Panzar and Rosse (1987) show that when H is
between 0 and 1 the system operates under monopolistic competition. In general, the H-statistic is
interpreted as a measure of the degree of competition in the banking market.

The H-statistic is only valid if the market is in long-run equilibrium (if return on bank assets is not related
to input prices). To verify the condition of long-run equilibrium, the following regression is estimated
(2):

Ln(ROAit)= αi + β1 ln(W1,it) + β2 ln(W2,it) + β3 ln(W3,it) + γ ln(Z,it) + δD + εit         (2)

Where ROA is the pre-tax return on assets. Because ROA can take on negative values, we compute the
dependent variable as ln(1+ROA). We define the equilibrium E-statistic as β1 + β2 + β3 from equation
(2). The test of long-run equilibrium involves testing whether E=0 - the market is in equilibrium if ROA
is not related to input prices.

Equations (1) and (2) are estimated for all six Central American countries, the Dominican Republic and
Colombia using bank-level panel data for the period 2009-2014. The sample consists of 905 bank-year
observations across the eight countries in a balanced panel. For each individual country there are more
than 70 observations, except in Nicaragua for which there are only 30 observations.

13.     A comparison of the calculated H-statistic for the region places El Salvador in the
best position in terms of competition. Table 2 shows the results of the H-statistic estimation.
Nicaragua is excluded as it does not satisfy the long run equilibrium condition – we only accept
the null of long-run equilibrium for p-values larger than 0.05. El Salvador appears to be the most
competitive of the 7 countries considered according to the elasticity of bank interest revenues to
input prices, with all the other countries exhibiting lower degrees of competition. El Salvador
appears to be operating close to or under perfect competition, with an H-statistic slightly greater
than 1 and the p-value null of H=1 not rejected. Guatemala and Colombia have H-statistics slightly
below 1 but, as with El Salvador, the null of H=1 is also not rejected, suggesting these countries
also appear to be operating under perfect competition. In contrast, all other countries appear to
operate under monopolistic competition.

14.     El Salvador appears more favorably when compared to its peer countries in the
region under the H-statistic relative to the HHI and the concentration of assets among the
largest banks 5. This could indeed be the result of the combination of a small market attended by
different regional financial groups and local competitors which target different segments of the
market, hence resulting in a concentrated yet still competitive system compared to the region.

                                   PROFITABILITY AND BANK SPREADS

15.     Banking profitability indicators have decreased since 2011 but remain at adequate
levels. ROA has decreased in the past four years due to increases in tax and interest payments
(Table 3) but it remains at very similar levels to the Central American and LAC averages (Figure
3). ROE has also declined albeit increases in leverage, due to increases in tax and interest
payments, which resulted in lower profit margins (net income/total revenue) (Table 4). However,

5
  The HHI and the H-statistic are competition measures which are essentially uncorrelated with each other and
inferences regarding competition are measure-specific. Results obtained with any measure need not be confirmed by
the other.

                                                       10
ROE for El Salvador is well below its regional peers – in part this is because El Salvador’s banking
system equity base is relatively large. This is consistent with the banking system’s level of
solvency. The capital to asset ratio for El Salvador in 2014 was 17 percent, higher than the LAC
and Central American average which were both 15.5 percent.

 a) Return on assets in the banking sector decreased            b) Return on equity has decreased and remains well below
 slightly in 2014 but remains at a similar level as the rest    the regional averages suggesting El Salvador’s bank
 of Central American and LAC countries.                         equity base is relatively larger than in its regional peers.’

16.     Banking spreads have been on a downward trend since 2010 showing gains in
efficiency and competition. Figure 4 shows lending rates have been on a downward trend since
January 2010 while deposit rates rate have been on an upward trend since 2011. The spread during
the last 6 years decreased from 3.6 percent in January 2010 to 1.7 percent in March 2016. Lower
banking spreads are evidence of a more efficient and competitive banking sector and suggest there
is room for credit expansion in which, as mentioned previously, El Salvador lags compared to its
regional peers.

17.     Intermediation margins of banks are not the lowest in the Central American region
but they have decreased since 2011 evidencing gains in efficiency and competition in the
sector. Salvadoran banks have low administrative costs compared to other countries in Central

America, and its personnel costs are below emerging market averages (Figure 5). Although net
interest income for El Salvador is the third largest in the Central American region, the net
interest margin decomposition shows overhead costs have declined in the last four years as well
as a reduction in loan loss provisions which reflects a sounder loan portfolio. As a result, the net
intermediation margin has declined since 2011 evidencing gains in efficiency (Figure 6). Among
Salvadoran financial institutions, commercial banks have the lowest implicit net interest margin.

18.     Credit is being allocated more towards consumption and less towards productive
activities. Financing of productive activities has shrunk in relative terms as participation of
consumer credit in the overall loan market has increased significantly in the past decade while the
opposite has occurred with enterprise credit (Figure 7). Consumer credit increased from 8.4 percent
in 2005 to 14.1 percent of GDP in 2015 while enterprise credit declined from 23.8 percent to 18.1
percent of GDP during the same period. Over the same period overall bank credit remained
unchanged at around 42 percent of GDP. The 2011 Enterprise Survey showed that the percentage
of firms needing a loan was higher in El Salvador (64 percent) than in the rest of the Central
American countries (average 56 percent) evidencing the importance of stemming the decline in
commercial credit in El Salvador.

19.      There is an important portion of consumer credit associated with productive
activities such as the consumer loans used by self-employed workers or for micro enterprises.
Enterprise informality is substantial in El Salvador and in this sense only formal enterprises can
access commercial credit. Anecdotal evidence suggests one of the reasons consumer credit has
risen vis-à-vis commercial credit is a rise in informality 6.

20.     The decline in commercial credit is not an issue related to excessive collateral
requirements but rather to banks’ perception of project “bankability”. According to data
from the 2011 Enterprise Survey, the value of the collateral needed in El Salvador as a percentage
of the loan amount is lower than the average of the LAC region (166.3 percent vs. 208.8 percent),
while the percentage of loans for formal firms requiring any type of collateral (no data on real
estate collateral) is slightly higher in El Salvador than in the LAC region (79.1 percent vs. 74.2
percent). Given that collateral levels required in El Salvador do not appear to be substantially
higher than in other LAC countries, the issue of declining commercial credit seems to be related
to banks’ perceptions of project “bankability” while having alternatives to invest liquidity more
safely in government securities. This is a phenomenon seen in many emerging economies.

21.     A large share of total enterprise loans is destined to large firms and household credit
is concentrated towards consumption (Tables 5 and 6). Loans to large firms account for 46
percent of total loan value while credit to SMEs account for 38 percent of total loan value. The
greatest number of enterprise credits are given to self-employed individuals (26 percent of total n
umber of loans). Consumption credit accounts for more than 60 percent of total household loans
and a significant fraction of it is used for unregistered productive activities as there are fewer legal
requirements for obtaining a consumption loan relative to an enterprise loan.

 Due to a lack of data in the system, the portion of consumer loans used for productive purposes cannot be properly
quantified.

22.     There are wide variations in the degree to which financial institutions pursue
different segments. The loan market is fragmented by the type of institution providing the credit.
Many private large banks pursue the loan market for large firms, whereas cooperative banks are
more focused on financing SMEs. Smaller banks such as Banco Azteca focus predominantly on
consumer credit with around 90 percent of their outstanding loan balance in consumer credit. There
is a significant but unquantifiable amount of consumer credit being used for productive activities
(given the large informal sector in the Salvadoran economy) but this is mostly the case with self-
employed individuals who are not reported under the enterprise segment of the loan market.

                                        RECOMMENDATIONS

23.      To ensure a well-defined and operable resolution regime, it is recommended to
include the following considerations under the new proposed scheme: (a) the deposit
guarantee fund should be able to fund in cash, asset/liability gaps from transferred funds to a good
bank, provided it meets the least cost criteria (vs. paying out depositors); (b) to allow successful
asset/liability transfer resolutions, the revocation of the license of the failed bank should only be
done after the resolution process is complete (to avoid running into the 30 day limit when insured
depositors, who might have been transferred, have to begin to be paid); (c) if non-insured deposits
can be transferred as well, a selection rule based on the size of such deposits (e.g., as a multiple of
the minimum wage) should be set forth to justify the selection preference following insured
deposits, and (d) the first item in the hierarchy of creditor claims under resolution should be for
the payment of services of the contracted resolution specialists.

24.    To revitalize productive credit and stem the increase in consumer loans at the expense
of enterprise credit the Authorities should develop programs of long maturity loans or
guarantees to banks to offer longer term credit, to incentivize borrowing for capital
investment. The BCR has put forward specific measures to promote and support SME financing
which are intended to reduce the necessary documentation for obtaining productive types of credit
and reformulating the evaluation of credits to SMEs. The Authorities should continue this path and
extend a program of guarantees.
