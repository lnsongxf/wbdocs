This brief expands the scarce literature on the impact of the global financial crisis on labor market outcomes
and welfare in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). The brief focuses on the economy of St.
Lucia, one of the OECS member states. The statistical information assembled here should help decision makers
and the public in the OECS to develop policy options that can sustain job creation and thereby enhance public
welfare. It also can help gauge the effectiveness of policies over time.

The evidence presented in this brief shows how the recent financial crisis had significant and long-lasting neg-
ative impacts on the welfare of St. Lucians. The government of St. Lucia attempted to use fiscal policy to boost
growth and enhance labor market opportunities in the island. Still, unemployed and underemployed St. Lucians
together accounted for over 40 percent of the working-age employable population. They suffered a significant
decline in welfare in the aftermath of the crisis. They lost not only their income but also the collateral benefits
that are often associated with being fully employed in good quality jobs in the “formal” sector of the economy.

These findings are not surprising given the nature of the economies of St. Lucia and other OECS economies.
These island states rely heavily on industries such as tourism, construction, agriculture, and financial services.
Those in turn depend greatly on external demand from wealthier economies that also were damaged by the
financial crisis. Travel and tourism related activities alone are estimated to account for 30 percent of gross do-
mestic product (GDP) and employment in the OECS. Moreover, like most of the OECS economies, St. Lucia has
a high level of national debt. The debt burden limits the ability of the government to invest in social programs
and human capital. Debt also compromises the government’s capacity to aid the poor and vulnerable in times
of crisis.

or to the crisis, the characteristics of the bottom forty
percent and the top sixty percent were relatively sim-
ilar in St Lucia, while since the crisis, there is a grow-
ing rift between the two groups. For example, except
for being more likely to be self-employed and less
likely to work in the professional service sector, the
bottom forty percent was virtually indistinguishable
from the rest in 2008. By 2013, however, the bottom
forty percent was significantly more likely to be un-
employed, significantly less likely to be an employee
or an employer, had significantly lower levels of edu-
cation, higher probability of residing in urban areas,
and higher probability of being headed by a female.
In terms of sector of employment and relative to the
top sixty percent, by 2013 they were twice as likely to
work in the agricultural sector, more likely to work in
the construction and manufacturing sector, and sig-
nificantly less likely to work in the education, health,
social and professional services sectors.

These findings are not surprising given the nature
of the economies of St. Lucia and other OECS econ-
omies. These island states rely heavily on industries
such as tourism, construction, agriculture, and finan-
cial services. Those in turn depend greatly on external
demand from the wealthier economies that also were
damaged by the financial crisis. Travel and tourism re-
lated activities alone are estimated to account for 30
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and employ-
ment in the OECS. Moreover, like most of the OECS
economies, St. Lucia has a high level of national debt.
The debt burden limits the ability of the government
to invest in social programs and human capital. Debt
also compromises the government’s capacity to aid
the poor and vulnerable in times of crisis.

St. Lucia’s resilience to the global crisis relative
to the rest of the OECS may be related to its lev-
el of economic diversification and type of tourism
products. Although tourism is a primary growth driv-
er of the St. Lucian economy — accounting for about
40 percent of GDP9, as mentioned before — other
industries such as agriculture, agribusiness and con-
struction also play key roles in the economy. More-
over, St. Lucia is globally recognized for its high-end
luxury tourism which tends to be less sensitive to
economic shocks and swings compared to mass and
budget tourism. Antigua and Barbuda is also recog-
nized for high-end tourism; however, unlike St. Lucia,
its tourism sector is the largest sector in the economy
representing about 63 percent of GDP.

Box 1: Formal Contracts in the St. Lucian Labor Market (2011–2013)

The rate of insurance coverage of workers has remained high at around 80 percent since 2011 (not reported in the figure). But there has been
an important drop in the proportion of workers with a formal (written) contract through their primary employment (figure below). In late
2011 through the second quarter of 2012, around 55 percent of employees had a written contract through their employer. However, at the
end of 2013 only 49 percent of employees did.

The proportion of males with a contract was slightly lower than of females. Similarly, the proportion of adult workers with a contract went
from 56 percent in 2011 to 49 percent in 2013. At the same time, the proportions of both youth and elderly employees with a contract
increased 4 and 15 percentage points, respectively.

Finally, more salaried public workers had a contract than private sector employees did — the difference was about 20 percent. However, the
decline in contracted workers was somewhat greater in the public sector than in the private sector.

Not surprisingly, employees in the “education, health and social services” and “professional services” sectors are more likely to be covered
by formal contracts. The most substantial drop in the proportion of workers with a contract, however, was for those employed in the social
services sector (where coverage through a contract dropped from approximately 70 percent to 50 percent).

The goal of the amendment to the St. Lucia Labor Code (2006) was to provide protection to workers. However some of its provisions — such
as changes to the definition of continuity of employment that affect workers’ benefits and severance payments in favor of workers — re-
sulted in disincentives for employers to issue contracts. This disincentive is likely to have been exacerbated by the context of the aftermath
of the crisis.

            Box 2: What Are Employers Looking For?

            Data from the Labor Market Needs Assessment Survey of 2012 shows that the national average job gap in St. Lucia was 15.21
            However, the job gap varied significantly by region. Rural areas and Vieux-Fort presented much higher job gaps, 28 and 24 respectively,
            relative to Gros-Islet islet which had a job gap of 5.

            Employers are looking for workers with higher education levels than the unemployed have. Between September and Novem-
            ber of 2012, 44 percent of employers reported wanting workers with tertiary education to fill job openings; 31 percent required at least
            secondary education certificates; and only one of every four employers claimed to need employees with less than secondary education. On
            the supply side, 60 percent of job seekers and the unemployed reported having less than secondary education; 33 percent had attained
            secondary education; and only 7 percent had tertiary education. 22

            To compete in the job market, job seekers not only need higher education — they also must develop “soft” skills that em-
            ployers value. The same survey asked employers to evaluate the importance of various skills to their business as well as the skills of current
            employees. Employers deemed soft skills, such a strong work ethic, customer service, interpersonal skills, and adaptability, as the four most
            important skills. The evaluation of skills of current employees by employers mirrored the importance which employers placed on these skills.

     21  The job gap measures the number of unemployed persons to each vacancy and is computed by dividing the total number of unem-
     ployed by the number of vacancies. This measures the relative difficulty of finding a job at the sector, occupation, administrative district or
     industry level.
     22  Similarly, data from the Enterprise Survey (World Bank 2010) reveals that large firms (more than 100 employees) in St. Lucia perceive
     that an inadequately educated workforce is a major obstacle to business development.

Households with more wealth fared better than
those with less wealth; wealth disparity increased
after the crisis. A study by the United Nations Devel-
opment Programme (2010) found that the diverse im-
pacts of the crisis in St. Lucia included: “Sale of house-
hold assets to make ends meet.”23 Data presented
here show that higher unemployment was associat-
ed with diminished household wealth. Figure 10 (top
panel) shows the trend in unemployment by level of
asset-based household wealth — the 5th quintile is
the richest and the 1st quintile the poorest.24 Through
late 2009, the unemployment rate did not differ sub-
stantially by levels of asset-based household wealth.
However, after 2010 unemployment for the two poor-
est quintiles (1st and 2nd) rose to nearly 30 percent
by mid-2013 while unemployment in the two richest
quintiles remained around 15 percent. The bottom
panel of Figure 10 compares the distribution of as-
set-based household wealth of the unemployed and
the employed in 2008 and 2013. In 2008, 40 percent
of the unemployed belonged to the first and second
wealth quintiles — by 2013 the proportion increased
to 51 percent. In contrast, the distribution of the em-
ployed improved somewhat in 2013 relative to 2008.
By 2013 the proportion of the employed in the two
lowest household wealth quintiles decreased to 35
percent and the proportion in the two highest quin-
tiles increased to 43 percent. The changes in the dis-
tribution of welfare by employment status and the in-
creasingly positive relationship between the welfare
index and both education and reported income (see
Figure T.A.1b) suggest that the sale or non-replace-
ment of assets, reflective of a tightening credit envi-
ronment, were used as a coping mechanism to en-
dure the negative impact of becoming unemployed.

returns to education in St. Lucia remain high. The
latter estimate implies that, on average, employees
with tertiary education earned over XCD 27,000 per

similar (though much smaller in magnitude) pattern
can be observed when considering wealthier house-

those in retirement age are the reference group)
reveals that youth (15-24) make substantially less

terms of district, income from employment is much

Welfare

Disparities in household wealth increased af-
ter 2008. Disparities between the bottom forty
percent and the top sixty percent of households
on the asset-based wealth index grew significant-
ly between 2008 and 2013. 27 The poorest workers
are more likely to be self-employed and less likely
to work in the professional service sector. Still, in
2008 overall employment of workers in the least
wealthy forty percent of households was on a par
with other cohorts (Table 2). By 2013, however, the
poorest forty percent were significantly less edu-
cated; more likely to be unemployed (by 11 points);
and less likely to be an employee or an employer.
The least wealthy also were more likely to reside in
urban areas; in smaller households; and in house-
holds headed by a female. By 2013 the poorest 40
percent were twice as likely to work in the agricul-

                                                            28  To support the tourist industry, the government subsidized

                                                                                                                                  29
     in the bottom forty percent were significantly less ed-
     ucated and more likely to be unemployed, residing in
     urban areas, and in a female-headed household. Sim-
     ilarly, by the end of 2013, individuals in the bottom
     forty percent were twice as likely to work in the agri-
     cultural sector, more likely to work in the construction
     and manufacturing sector, and significantly less likely
     to work in the education, health, social and profes-
     sional services sectors.

     Debt and macroeconomic conditions limit the gov-
     ernment’s ability to invest in social protection or
     in human capital, and generally limit its capacity
     to respond effectively to economic distress. There
     is some evidence that government programs in re-
     sponse to the crisis have been successful at improving
     the job opportunities of the groups that they target.
     Nevertheless, unemployment, poverty, and social dis-
     parities in St. Lucia increased after the 2008 crisis. The
     difficult reality is that St. Lucia, like most of the OECS
     member states, faces a unique combination of micro-
     and macro-economic challenges that compromise
     the ability of the government to reach the poor and
     vulnerable. Among these challenges are high levels
     of national debt, insufficient economic diversification,
     and a lack of monitoring and evaluation systems in
     place to measure the impact and effectiveness of so-
     cial programs and public expenditure.29




     29  Kouame and Reyes (2010) also report that because of the lack
     of fiscal space and the weaknesses of safety net programs in the re-
     gion, income shocks are unlikely to be cushioned by public transfers.

     Individuals are classified as employed if they satisfy
     one of the two conditions above, but report that they
     are looking for work (wanted work in past 7 days). That
     is, when an inconsistency arises, the codifier favors
     employment to unemployment. This coding strategy
     is consistent with the International Labor Organiza-
     tion (ILO) Labor Force Framework.

     An individual is defined as unemployed (standard)
     if he/she satisfies the following:

     •	 Actively seeking work

     However, as was mentioned before, employment al-
     ways takes precedence over unemployment. So if an
     individual reports both looking for work and another
     response consistent with having employment, this in-
     dividual is not considered unemployed.

     An individual is defined as unemployed (broad) if
     he/she satisfies the following:

     •	 Actively seeking work OR

     •	 Not seeking work because of the following:

        •	 Already found work and will start later
        •	 Already made arrangements for self-employ-
           ment activities
        •	 Awaiting recall to former job
        •	 Awaiting replies from employers
        •	 Believes no suitable work available
        •	 Believes no financial resources, land, equip-
           ment, permits, etc. to start own business
        •	 Cannot meet employer’s requirements
        •	 Could not find suitable work
        •	 Does not know how or where to seek work AND
           when asked what would have prevented him/
           her from accepting an offer last week, responds
           “nothing”

     Despite only using select variables, no conflicts arise
     in these definitions (that is, someone will not be de-
     fined as both employed and unemployed).
