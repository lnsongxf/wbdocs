Notes:
Capacity building includes, for example, funding country road safety management capacity reviews, country advisory
services to assist the preparation of road safety investment operations, the Hubei Road Traffic Training Center, and the
development of a global traffic safety police network (RoadPol) to engage and strengthen institutional leadership and
processes for road policing in country police agencies.

Program delivery includes, for example, funding activities of the Global Road Safety Partnership and the World Health
Organization in their focus countries.

Infrastructure safety includes, for example, funding the International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP) for the
development and application of infrastructure safety rating tools and the International Roads Federation for country training
courses in road infrastructure safety.

Research and development includes, for example, funding the Road Traffic Injuries Research Network to support country-
based research, the Harvard Initiative for Global Health to improve Global Burden of Disease estimates of country road
deaths and injuries and associated health losses, and country data support initiatives of the International Road Traffic
Accident Database (the IRTAD Group).

Advocacy includes, for example, funding the development of an association for country collaboration in Latin America and
the Caribbean, the second Global Stakeholders’ Forum in Geneva, and support for regional participation in the UN Global
Road Safety Collaboration.

Training and workshops includes, for example, funding safety management training initiatives with Sub-Saharan Transport
Policy Program (SSATP) member countries and country-based workshops supporting the preparation of road safety
investment programs and projects.

Facility Implementation Unit covers funding staff and administrative activities associated with supporting Facility
operations.

Facility governance covers funding Facility Executive Board and Core Advisory Group meetings and the conduct of an
independent evaluation of Facility operations.
A Global Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) and an Africa Multi-Donor Trust Fund have been created
to receive the donor funding which has been fully distributed to the end of FY10, as depicted in the
following chart.

                       Effective Demand for Facility Services
About 25 countries have received Facility support or funding has been pledged for them until the
end of FY10 (refer Table 2). However, latent demand for Facility grants exceeds available funding,
and more countries could be engaged and the size of grants increased.

Table 3 summarizes a preliminary estimate prepared by the Facility Implementation Unit of effective
demand from countries in World Bank regions for the financial years FY09 and FY10. Conservatively
it reveals a funding gap of around $9 million per year and including the allocation of existing funds
averaging around $3 million per year it suggests a minimal funding of $12 million per year is required
to support Facility initiatives for these two years.

Facility country grants are linked to investment operations and this additional funding would support
the preparation of an estimated 24 new country road safety projects and 12 related infrastructure
safety programs identified by the International Road Assessment Program (refer Table 3). Combining
this with existing Facility disbursements and funding pledges to around 25 countries including five
International Road Assessment Programme initiatives, this indicates that the Facility could currently
engage with around 50 countries and support at least 15 related International Road Assessment
Programme infrastructure safety initiatives by the end of FY10.

                    Effective Demand for Facility Services (continued)
Taking an average of $10 million per road safety project and $10 million per infrastructure safety
program this would generate around $650 million in new country road safety investments, which
would represent a Facility leveraging ratio of around 20:1. This is a conservative estimate as the
trend is towards larger-scale country projects and related infrastructure safety programs. However,
it is indicative of the catalytic role played by the Facility in accelerating the transfer of road safety
knowledge to countries and in scaling up country investment operations.

Effective demand is now being more comprehensively reviewed by the Facility Implementation
Unit and indications are that it is significantly higher than initially estimated. For example, for three
countries alone in the East Asia Pacific region (Cambodia, Laos and China) a strong absorptive
capacity is evident and bids totaling more than $7.5 million for FY09 have been received. For the out-
years FY11 to FY 15 this suggests at least a doubling of activities across World Bank regions which
would require a minimal funding of $20 million per year to support Facility initiatives in accordance
with its Strategic Plan 2006 – 2015.

                                      Progress to date
The Facility has successfully established a program of global, regional and country activities to
accelerate and scale up the efforts of low and middle-income countries to build their scientific,
technological and managerial capacities to prepare and implement cost-effective road safety
programs. Available donor funding has been fully allocated to achieve this mission and estimates
of effective demand for Facility support indicate that additional and sustained donor support is
required to achieve the Facility’s mission and goals. This support will accelerate knowledge transfer,
build country management capacity and leverage considerable investments in road safety.
