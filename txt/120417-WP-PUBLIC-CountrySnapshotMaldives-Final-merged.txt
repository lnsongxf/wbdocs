dian engineering company amounting to $271 million. The cur-
rent account deficit widened sharply from 7.5 percent in 2015
to 20.2 percent of GDP in 2016, driven by the large increase in
investment and the impact of the settlement. FDI inflows were
not sufficient to cover the current account deficit, unlike in previ-
ous years. Gross official reserves fell to $467 million at end-2016,
although usable reserves2 were only $200 million (1.1 months of
imports). The exchange rate to the U.S. dollar remained at 15.4,
the low end of the currency band.

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
Growth is expected to reach 4.6 percent in 2017, driven by the
investment projects and a recovering tourism sector. The fiscal
deficit is expected to reach 8.2 percent of GDP in 2017. The level
of public debt is expected to increase but taper off towards 2020
with the completion of large investment projects. Despite mostly
concessional external debt and domestic debt issued at low, fixed
rates, and relatively high revenue collection, the risk of external
debt distress is high, reflecting the refinancing risk from the Euro-
bond with a low level of reserves and fiscal risks through guaran-

THE WORLD BANK GROUP AND MALDIVES
The World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Framework
(FY2016-2019), endorsed by the institution’s Board of Directors
in May 2016, aims to support Maldives to achieve more inclu-
sive and sustainable growth, making better use of the country’s
assets – human capital, natural assets, and financial resources. It
focuses on enhancing employment and economic opportunities
for Maldivians, strengthening natural resource management and
climate resilience, and improving the efficacy of public financial
management and policy making, Youth, gender, and governance
are considered critical crosscutting development challenges to
be addressed by the World Bank Group. These areas take into
account the development priorities identified in the Systematic
Country Diagnosis of September 2015.

Under IDA17 (FY15-17), Maldives received $33.2 million. During
IDA18 (FY18-20), Maldives may access approximately $73 million
in concessional financing.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The project aims to enhance budget credibility, transparency, and financial reporting of central government finances. It will support three activities: (i) strengthening the public
    financial management environment by enhancing the legislative and institutional framework, the fiscal framework, and debt and cash management; (ii) strengthening the public
    accounting system to improve financial reporting practices and decision-making, as well as internal financial controls, internal auditing, and procurement management practices;
    and (iii) providing support for project management within the MoFT.

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    The expected outcomes of the project are reduced deviation between actual expenditures and the original budget, increased and timely public access to key fiscal information,
    improved quality of debt data recording and reporting and enhanced coverage and quality of the internal audit function.

    To date the project has:
    ■■     Completed an analysis of the legislative framework relevant to PFM, and identified a sequenced plan of revising/amending the laws.
    ■■     Upgraded the debt recording and reporting system, with the data reconciled; prepared a framework to issue sovereign guarantees, reviewed the draft National Debt Strat-
           egy with an aim to improving it; designed monthly and annual debt reports and conducted an assessment of the debt division’s internal organization structure and made
           recommendations to strengthen it.
    ■■     Trained MoFT staff on how to formulate a Medium-Term Macro-Fiscal Framework. Basic training has been delivered on macro-fiscal modeling to officers within and outside
           the MoFT, and a new Macroeconomic Policy Coordinating Committee has been established and an early draft macro-fiscal statement prepared.
    ■■     Prepared a business blue print on budgeting and a new budget calendar. Budget ceilings have been established for the FY 2016 budget based on the initial macro fiscal
           statement.
    ■■     Carried out urgent technical and functional upgrades in the public accounting system to closely monitor budget execution. System-generated budget execution reports
           comparing budgets with actual expenditures are being used, and commitments are gradually being captured in the system.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The project supports the government of Maldives efforts to develop the education sector, with special focus on primary and secondary education. The operation was prepared
    through a process of consultation and collaboration with a broad range of stakeholders: the Ministry of Education (MoE), MoFT, the atoll education agencies, public and private
    employers, public and private education institutions, academics, and school principals, teachers, parents, and students. Prior to this project, the Bank had undertaken rigorous
    policy and technical analysis through a programmatic series of education-sector reports, whose findings and recommendations were incorporated into the project’s design. The
    project includes three components: (i) national-level education development; (ii) school-level education development; and (iii) project management, monitoring and evaluation,
    and program development.
    It is assisting the government in developing a system of national assessments of learning outcomes to inform education policy, and also conducting regular school level quality
    assurance reviews to feed into school improvement activities. In addition, the project supports government efforts to develop a network of good quality secondary and higher
    secondary schools, and strengthen the human resource capabilities of education officials in the country’s atolls and the capital, Male’. The project is also helping the MOE prepare
    a master plan for the development of higher education.

     *$ millions; As of August 23, 2016

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The World Bank financed South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Governance and Shared Growth (SWIOFish) project series aims to address the situation in which 68 percent of regional
    fish stocks are threatened, over-exploited or depleted. The project series promotes: (a) regional coordination to avoid conflicts and suboptimal sectoral investments, and to promote
    equitable distribution of wealth; and (b) national level actions to address the common constraints of weak governance, weak human and institutional capacity, and a fragile
    business environment in all South West Indian Ocean region countries. The first, second and the third projects in the series cover regional, national and local actions in the Indian
    Ocean Commission, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, Comoros, Mozambique, Tanzania, Madagascar and Seychelles. This project in the Maldives is the fourth in the series.

    The fisheries sector is a critical contributor to the national economy. It employs 11 percent of the workforce and provides almost all of Maldives’ physical exports. The Government
    of Maldives aims to achieve: (a) sustenance of capture fishery at about 120,000 tons and an export of about 60 percent of the catch through improved management and
    compliance to regional conservation measures; (b) diversification and consequent partial shift away from capture reef fishery to ensure sustainability of live-bait and reef fishing,
    and to adapt to climate change induced impacts; and (c) inclusive development of the fisheries sector and mariculture to create dependable income and growth opportunities. The
    project supports Maldives in augmenting its own systems, compliance mechanisms, and skills; establishing mariculture as the best diversification and conservation option; and
    sharing the knowledge of its own systems and environmentally sustainable fishing technology to the other countries in the South West Indian Ocean region.

    The development objective of the project is to improve management of fisheries at regional and national levels including support to establish mariculture in targeted atolls in
    the Maldives.

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    The project seeks to achieve the following key results: (a) SWIO countries, and specifically Maldives should improve compliance with IOTC resolutions for management of
    Tuna Fishery by at least 5 percent; (b) at least 90 percent of the fishing vessels in Maldives should comply with IOTC requirements on monitoring and reporting; (c) value of
    production from mariculture supported by the project should be at least $9 million; (d) supporting at least 1,800 direct project beneficiaries (of which 20 percent should be female
    beneficiaries); and, (e) at least 80 of target beneficiaries should be satisfied with the project interventions.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The management of solid waste is one of the most pressing environmental challenges in Maldives. An estimated 365,000 tons of solid waste are generated annually. Solid
    waste is generated at an estimated rate of 1.8 kg per person per day in Male, 0.8 kg per person per day on other inhabited islands, and 3.5 kg per person per day in resort islands.
    Current practices for handling, transporting, and treating waste threaten the country’s prominence as a pristine marine environment and premium tourist destination. Plastics
    and other waste in the sea are destroying the coral reefs that are vital to national fish stocks and livelihoods. The fisheries sector alone provides livelihoods for 26% of all poor
    households and 11% of employment nationally. Coral reefs also play a vital role for tourism and are less able to protect the atolls and islands from the impacts of climate change,
    particularly rising seas, if damaged. Dumping of waste into the sea and open burning of waste across the archipelago also create significant public health risks.

    The proposed project will strengthen the decision-making process and identify technical, financial and institutional solutions to address the SWM challenge. The project is
    consistent with the World Bank Group’s twin goals of achieving poverty reduction and shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. It is also aligned with the Country Partnership
    Framework (CPF) for the Maldives discussed at the Board on April 26, 2016 (report no. 103724-MV), particularly with CPF Objective 2 (Strengthening Natural Resource Management
    and Climate Resilience). The proposed project is listed in the CPF as a deliverable during the current period.

    The development objective of the project is to improve solid waste management in selected zones. The project will have five components: 1: National Solid Waste Management
    Strategy and Policy, strengthening the Government’s efforts to address challenges in solid waste management (SWM) and supporting the preparation of a SWM strategy, feasibility
    studies and investments, and institutional capacity building; 2: Regional Waste Management Systems, supporting the operationalization of regional waste management
    systems in the selected zones; 3: Island Waste Management Systems, supporting the operationalization of island waste management systems in the selected zones; 4: Project
    Management providing support to strengthen the institutional capacities of the implementing agencies to implement the project; and 5: Contingency Emergency Response,
    providing immediate response to an eligible crisis or emergency as needed.

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    Key results expected are: ( i) Operational Regional Waste Management Centers in Zones 2, 4 and 5 (ii) Operational Island Waste Management Centers in Zones 2, 4 and 5, and
    (iii) Adoption of a sustainable Solid Waste Management Strategy, and the capacity of Waste Management Corporation (WAMCO), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Island
    Councils other relevant institutions strengthened and performing their responsibilities satisfactorily.

     *$ millions

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    This project is being implemented under the multi-donor Maldives CCTF that was established in 2009 to support a climate-resilient economy and society in the Maldives through
    adaptation, mitigation, and low-carbon development. The first phase of the CCTF was funded by the European Union (EU) and the Government of Australia, with a total allocation
    of $10.3 million. Three projects have been implemented under the CCTF to date, all completed on November 30, 2014:
    ■■    The Wetlands Conservation and Coral Reef Monitoring for Adaptation to Climate Change Project ($3.8m) supported community-based wetland management including
          ecotourism and drainage management on Hithadhoo island (Addu/Seenu Atoll) and Fuvahmulah island (Gnaviyani Atoll), rainwater harvesting on Ukulhas island (North Ari
          Atoll), coral reef monitoring (North and South Male Atolls), and capacity building for the local government.
    ■■    The Clean Energy for Climate Mitigation Project ($2.53m) supported solar energy generation, energy conservation and efficiency improvements, and technical assistance on
          G.Dh. Thinadhoo island.
    ■■    The Ari Atoll Solid Waste Management Pilot Project ($1.33m) supported the development of an island-level integrated solid waste management system in five pilot islands
          of the Ari Atoll and a residual waste transfer system for off-island disposal.
    With a supplemental EU contribution of €3.85m, a second phase of the CCTF (CCTF-II) is supporting the Climate Change Adaptation Project, aimed at helping the government
    to further implement activities undertaken under the Wetlands Conservation to mainstreaming climate change into resort management; and (iv) set up a system for waste
    management that is locally acceptable and operationally viable. and Ari Atoll projects in the country’s southern-most atolls (Addu and Gnaviyani). The project aims, more specifically,
    to: (i) strengthen community wetland advisory boards in terms of formal recognition and institutional consolidation, and provide a mechanism for their continued involvement
    and improved capacity; (ii) strengthen the web-enabled database system developed under the first phase of the CCTF to ensure continued uptake, sustain confidence of tourist
    resorts in the National Coral Reef Monitoring Framework, and supplement it with a support facility for resorts; (iii) expand the involvement of tourist resorts beyond coral reef
    monitoring

    KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
    Interventions in wetland management and solid waste management in the Addu and Gnaviyani Atolls are expected to benefit more than 4,800 households through enhanced
    tourism, livelihood opportunities, and ecosystem conservation. The coral reef monitoring intervention will directly benefit at least 10 private tourism operators. Through
    interventions in capacity building for mainstreaming of climate adaptation in island level planning, the project is expected to benefit all the 20 atoll councils and 66 island
    councils in the country and the communities serviced by these councils. Scholarship support to students enrolled in the graduate program in Environmental Management has
    been initiated and will continue for 3 years.

    KEY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS:
    The Ministry of Environment and Energy, the Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture, Ministry of Tourism, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Marine Research Center, Maldives

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The ASPIRE program aims to increase solar photovoltaic generation in the Maldives through private-sector investment. The program will use a combination of grant funds from
    SREP and a series of IDA guarantees to attract private-sector investments and build capacity within the country to receive such investments.

    Its components are: (i) technical assistance to the government to enable private investing and strengthen institutional capacity building and knowledge sharing; (ii) a series of IDA
    guarantees to provide confidence to private investors; and (iii) tariff buy-down to ensure that tariffs obtained are within an acceptable range for utility and customer acceptance.

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    About 20 MW of new power generation over the life of the program, beginning with a four MW bid out for rooftop solar energy in the greater Male’ area. Results to be monitored
