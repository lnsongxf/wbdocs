                                                                            (Boyenge 2007), although many of these zones are single companies licensed individually as free zones. World Free Zone Convention has 124 countries listed as participants.
                                                                            This report has therefore used 130 as a general number of countries with an industrial zones framework.

                                                                        4

                           Drivers for EIP Development and Growth


                           The main drivers for eco-industrial parks (EIPs) remain grounded in business competitiveness. They also
                           provide a platform for mitigating climate change through collective actions and innovation. These drivers
                           include a desire for emission reduction on the national level; improved resource management due to increased
                           resource costs and exposure to risks; environmental and social concerns from consumers; and increased
                           demand to improve efficiency and growth.

                                         focus on establishing cleantech clusters; there are dedicated cleantech clusters operating in Austria
                                         (Ecoworld Styria), Denmark (Copenhagen Cleantech), Finland (Lahti Cleantech), Canada (Ecotech Que-
                                         bec), and the United States (Cleantech San Diego). These industrial clusters, while not being traditional
                                         EIPs, have been instrumental in driving the supply of green and environmentally friendly technologies,
                                         products, and services and attracting and mobilizing investments from across the globe in pursuit of

                     The success of clean energy solutions at both EIP and firm levels depends heavily on the choice of technology
                     and the associated cost of installation, operation, and maintenance. The existing price of power also plays
                     a critical role: heavily subsidized conventional power greatly limits the returns from substituting renewable                                                                                                                                                                                                       Source: Sinha and Sethi 2015

                     once a carbon market mechanism is introduced. At the country level, renewable energy projects are a great
                     contribution to country-level emission reduction targets, especially where Kyoto Protocol is ratified.                                                                     In an ordinary public project, capital cost and public profit are the points in question, while in the PPP model,
                                                                                                                                                                                                the capital cost (investment cost and financing expense of private company), public guarantee risk ratio, and

As can be seen, instead of laying the burden on one party, within PPPs the risk is
                     than interventions by individual firms may have. They also enhance the quality of common utility infrastructure                                                            shared among public sector and private sector participants.

                      Through this process, potential for shared waste streams and processes are identified along with the
                      necessary infrastructure requirements. Although private firms initially showed hesitation in sharing
                      data, the extensive negotiation process allowed them to understand the merits of participating in the
                      development of industrial symbiosis and overcome barriers.

                      Circularity creates firm- and zone-level sustainability and decreases dependency on resources. Firms
                      become more resilient to climate change, which increases their market competitiveness in the long run.

                           Identifying and addressing financing needs is crucial for project implementation. During step three, the
                           plan must first identify how much funding is necessary and what funds are available to meet these needs.

                           EIP for national competitiveness: Guatemala. The government of Guatemala has been promoting EIPs
                           as a way of reaching national goals of attracting foreign investment, creating jobs, and supporting local
                           governments. With 17 active Free Economic Zones in place, four townships have become EIP zones.
                           Currently, in the township of Estanzuela, the EIP is expected to provide more than 3,000 formal employment
                           opportunities. As per step one of the EIP approach, the city has identified Pronacom as the implementing
                           agency and has set goals to create a zone with low emissions, energy optimization, eco-friendly
                           practices, economic stability, and social and environmental sustainability. The next steps planned for the
                           implementation of EIP in this zone are to review studies to incorporate the ecological model and efficient
                           industries (diagnostics), update budgetary needs (financial planning), and present an updated model based
                           on the diagnostics (implementation planning).

                           designating a particular group as a rallying point or a private sector focal point for building commitment
                           and engaging the private sector was discussed. In India, the Association for Lady Entrepreneurs of India
                           has taken this role in working with GIZ on eco-friendly industrial parks. In the Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Green
                           Industrial Park in Nandigama Villag, located in the Medak District, the EIP has focused on an important
                           segment of the economic population: women. The association has helped to create a vision statement
                           (discussed in step one), which outlines goals for the park to “design an eco-friendly and self-sustainable
                           industrial development” that provides a conducive environment for female entrepreneurs. Industrial plots
                           have been divided into clusters of different industries based on emissions and waste and common areas with
                           shared resources such as waste management and business incubators. The development aims to provide
                           social benefits to the community, supporting over 100 women from below the poverty line and the middle
                           class in entrepreneurship and creating 8,000 jobs for the community, with an expected indirect benefit to

                           with funding from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) and being implemented
                           jointly by the Technische Universiteit Delft and Chongqing and Tsinghua Universities aims to develop a
                           model of industrial symbiosis for the more than 100 EIPs being designed in China. The project broadens
                           the boundaries of EIPs by connecting the material flow and life-cycle analysis of the industrial park to that
                           of regional and global systems. Based on the premise that the industrial ecosystem is an open system
                           that interacts with its surroundings, it creates a larger loop of material and waste recycling, allowing for
                           consideration of larger impacts of EIPs. Though this project is still in the design phase, it shows the potential
                           for creating numerous benefits for the community and economy outside of the EIP itself, if the industrial
                           ecosystem is designed with this in mind (Tukker 2015).

                           It is important that the specificities of the national and local economies and the characteristics of the local
                           industry are kept at the forefront of decision making when planning an EIP. No two economies are identical
                           and simply trying to copy one successful model may not have the desired results in an economy with vastly
                           different conditions, different areas needing attention, and different stakeholder groups. However, the steps

                                          continue to see an increase in trends for eco-industrial park (EIPs). Global factors will help spur EIP growth to            production concepts when designing the park,                   1. Physically, parks must be developed with infrastructure
                                          a higher level. The factors will include such things as a common price on carbon and national commitments                    constructing infrastructure and buildings, and                    in public utilities and facilities that is environmentally

                                          common understanding of EIPs and their technical requirements. This needs to be complemented by national                  3. Life-cycle principle: Intensify the life-cycle                 2. Economically, the park has to promote local and

                                             help prioritize climate-related measures. More than ever, preparing for broad-scale climate change,
                                             with its many cross-industry implications, requires public-private dialogue to help build trust, close the
                                             knowledge gap, catalyze action, and generate a sense of shared ownership. Among the key objectives
                                             of effective dialogue will be the following:

        5                                         - To promote voluntary actions that the private sector, the public sector, and citizens can                                                                                                                                                                                                                  5

                                                  - To advance legal and regulatory reforms to encourage innovation, to promote the use of new
                                                    technologies and inputs, to incentivize public-private partnerships, and to reward positive
                                                     behavior while penalizing negative behavior
                                                  - To ensure the availability of and access to finance for businesses and citizens who will be
                                                    affected by climate change
                                                  - To pursue strategies to encourage behavioral change—such as the “Principles on Dialogue for
                                                    Climate Action” (World Bank Group 2016).

                                          The approach to climate resilience complements the EIP framework. EIPs help reduce the use of
                                          resources and therefore minimize firm and industrial park exposure to resource disruption or volatility.
                                          The added focus on resilience will ensure that, not only does the industrial park contribute to lowering
                                          emissions, but it is attuned to the new climate reality and provides an extra value or service to its
                                          residents. For example, in Thailand, Rojana Industrial Estate completed a 75-kilometer concrete wall in

This report, based primarily on findings from a global conference “Eco-Industrial Parks 2015,” held in Seoul,
Republic of Korea in October 2015, provides the latest thinking on eco-industrial parks, bringing together
experiences from different countries and providing a vision on how these initiatives can be scaled up or
mainstreamed. It will provide policy makers with insight conceptualizing EIPs and what different factors need
to be considered in putting together an EIP program. The report builds the basis for further development of
global guidelines for EIP development and provides a brief insights into future trends on smart/ integrated
industrial areas and climate resilient industrial parks.
