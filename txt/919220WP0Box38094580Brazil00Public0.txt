THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number

DB year            Reform

                    Brazil made starting a business easier by eliminating the
DB2010              requirement to obtain a fire brigade license and inspection
                    before obtaining an operating permit from the municipality.
                    Brazil eased business start-up by further enhancing the
DB2011              electronic synchronization between federal and state tax
                    authorities.

      * Register the employees in the social integration program
      (Programa de Integração Social, PIS)

      After duly registering the new hire in the employee registry book (livro

      employees in the social integration program (Programa de Integração
      Social, PIS/PASEP). The PIS/PASEP registry is intended to identify the
      worker in order to establish an unemployment guarantee fund (FGTS)
      account, to request unemployment insurance, and to be entered in the
      National Registry of Social Information (Cadastro Nacional de              1 day,

      employer must complete a PIS/PASEP registry form (documento de
      cadastramento do trabalhador, DCT), to be delivered to the federal
      savings bank responsible for the FGTS account. The enrollment is
      completed in about 5 to 10 business days from application if all
      enrollment requirements are met. The employee is enrolled with the
      Social Integration Program (Programa de Integração Social, PIS) upon
      entry, and if the employee has already a PIS/PASEP registry, the
      employer must only inform the Federal Savings Bank of the new
      employment relationship. The employer will obtain the receipt of the
      application to PIS within 15 days.

      must open a FGTS account for each employee (Fundo de Garantia por

      representative or attorney-in-fact must go to any local branch of the
      federal savings bank (Caixa Econômica Federal) with a copy of: the
      company's taxpayer registry number (CNPJ/MF), the adhesion form
      issued by the Federal Saving Bank (Caixa Econômica Federal), the list of
      employees, and the company's articles of association or bylaws. Upon
      opening the employee FGTS accounts, the company will make monthly
      deposits equal to 8% of the total payroll. The employees are entitled to          1 day,
      withdraw those deposits for specific events provided by law                (simultaneous with

      do FGTS e informações à Previdência Social, SEFIP) was developed to
      speed up FGTS payment and information exchange between the
      employer and the federal savings bank. SEFIP can be accessed through
      the Federal Savings Bank’s Web site. This procedure permits the online
      transfer of data, creating a company file with all information required by
      the FGTS and Social Security. After the referred data transmission, the
      program issues a tax payment form (guia de recolhimento do FGTS)
      necessary for employer contribution payment.

      BuildCo must apply for construction approval permit and the
      construction execution permit with the Municipality. If the project

      construction. To apply for these permits, BuildCo must submit the
      architectural drawings and real estate documentation (real estate title
      or real estate tax).

      After examining the project’s architecture and engineering and issuing
      the permit, the Municipality examines the practical and installation
5     aspects and begins the process of issuing an execution permit.              274 days      BRL 4,200

      BuildCo can request both permits simultaneously, but the Municipality
      grants the permits in a specific order.

      Valid for a year, the construction approval permit is a prerequisite for
      subsequent procedures. The construction execution permit is valid for 3
      years. Due to backlog of projects, the time required for this procedure
      is at least 9 to 10 months.

  The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is
defined as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall distribution for all years included in the analysis. It is calculated and adjusted on a
yearly basis. The threshold is not based on any economic theory of an “optimal tax rate” that minimizes distortions or maximizes efficiency in the tax
system of an economy overall. Instead, it is mainly empirical in nature, set at the lower end of the distribution of tax rates levied on medium-size
enterprises in the manufacturing sector as observed through the paying taxes indicators. This reduces the bias in the indicators toward economies
that do not need to levy significant taxes on companies like the Doing Business standardized case study company because they raise public revenue
in other ways—for example, through taxes on foreign companies, through taxes on sectors other than manufacturing or from natural resources (all
of which are outside the scope of the methodology). This year’s threshold is 26.1%.

Social protection schemes and benefits & Labor disputes

Doing Business collects data on the existence of unemployment protection schemes as well as data on whether
employers are legally required to provide health insurance for employees with permanent contracts.


Doing Business also assesses the mechanisms available to resolve labor disputes. More specifically, it collects data
on what courts would be competent to hear labor disputes and whether the competent court is specialized in
resolving labor disputes.
