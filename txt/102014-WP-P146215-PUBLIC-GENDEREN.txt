Gender Earnings Gap in the Formal Labor Market in Turkey

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 CONTEXT AND SUMMARY FINDINGS

1. Gender disparities in Turkey remain considerable despite Turkish government’s recent
public policy initiatives2 aimed at increasing gender equity in Turkey. Overall gender equity
ranking of Turkey in the Gender Gap 2012 Report (Hausmann et al.) is 124 out of 135
countries. Interestingly, Turkey’s performance varies in different dimensions of gender
equity. On the one hand, its gender equity score is higher than 0.9 in health and educational
attainment (score 1 indicates full equity). On the other hand, its score is 0.41 in economic
and 0.09 in political participation. Moreover, its performance in economic participation in
2012 is lower than its 2005 level.

2. Gender equity is identified as a key area in the 2012-2015 Country Partnership Strategy
of the World Bank Group (WBG) in Turkey. One of the projects initiated to move WBG’s
gender agenda in Turkey further is the “Technical Assistance Project on Promoting Gender
Equity in Labor Markets and Entrepreneurship”. Using novel datasets, this study aims to
contribute to the project through providing a better understanding of different dimensions
of the gender gap in employment and particularly earnings.

3. Key findings of this paper are as follows:

     i)    The gap between men and women in participation emerges with the early exit of
           women, particularly those low educated, after marriage. Partly due to that,
           average female employee is more educated than the average male employee. This
           provides a positive premium on female earnings over male earnings.

     ii)   Partly due to exit of low educated women after marriage, female employees, on
           average, have less work experience than male employees. This contributes
           significantly to the earnings gap between male and female employees.

     iii) Compared to men, women work in higher paying sectors, sub-sectors and firms
          within sub-sectors. Yet, women earn less than the men working in the same firm.

     iv) Female employees are more concentrated in larger firms especially in the East and
         the North regions of the country.

     v)    Once all observable characteristics are taken into account, it is hard to argue that
           earnings discrimination against women in the formal labor market of Turkey is
           large. However, very low female labor supply might be the factor preventing a
           sizeable earnings discrimination in the formal labor market.

1.2 LITERATURE

4. Earnings and particularly wage gap between women and men has been a popular topic
at the interplay between labor and gender economics. Although most studies report
significant gender gap in earnings, the literature has been inconclusive in many aspects so
far. Not only the measured magnitude of earnings gap but also the portion of the gap
assigned to gender discrimination differs considerably within the group of studies that
detect earnings gap. Moreover, a diverse set of reasons are cited as the source of the gap
in different studies. Along with the variety of methodologies followed, dissimilarities in the
coverage and the content of datasets used as well as country specific economic and social
characteristics play a role in getting diverse results across studies.

5. Using data for 22 countries over 1985-1994, Blau and Kahn (2001) document that gender
gap in earnings is low in Eastern Europe but very high in industrialized countries. They
specifically report that men earn as low as 14% and as high as 85% more than women in
Slovenia and Japan, respectively. According to International Labor Organization (2001),
gender earnings disparities are lowest in North Korea (54%) and highest in Swaziland
(106%). Besides, OECD countries do not have a significantly lower wage gap than other
countries with similar development levels. Hertz et al. (2008) find a 25% average earnings
gap in favor of men for 14 developing countries from all parts of the world. Hoyos and Nopo
(2010) measure that earnings of women were 16.3% and 8.8% lower than the men of
similar characteristics in Latin America in 1992 and 2007, respectively. In a cross-country
study, Nopo et al. (2011) find that women earn 8% - 48% less than the men with same
characteristics. As for Turkey, using household expenditure surveys, Tansel (2004) detect a
large wage gap in the private sector in favor of men.

6. Regarding the sources of earnings gap, a combination of economic (e.g. level of
informality, occupational/sectoral segregation), personal (e.g. age, education, experience)
and social (e.g. traditional roles assigned to women) factors are referred to be decisive.
Pastore (2010) report that most of the earnings gap in Mongolia is due to different
treatment of same characteristics of men and women by the market. Hoyos and Nopo
(2010) posit that differences in job tenure explain a substantial part of earnings gaps. Using
European Structure of Earnings Survey, Simon (2007) reports for nine industrialized and
transition countries that female segregation into low-wage workplaces is the main
contributor to the earnings gap. Similarly, Tzannatos (1999) cite sectoral segregation of
women to lower wage sectors as a main source of earnings gap. On the other hand, Atal et
al. (2009) discredit the role of occupational segregation by documenting that job related
characteristics (e.g. occupation, size of firm) account for only a little share of earnings gap
in Latin America. Finally, Blau and Kahn (2001) claim that earnings gap is lower if female
net supply is lower in a country.3

1.3 DATA AND METHODOLOGY

7. To measure the existence and magnitude of gender earnings gap in the formal labor
market in Turkey, this paper make use of Earning Surveys (ES) conducted by the Turkish
Statistics Institute (Turkstat) in 2006 and 2010. ES include a rich set of information about
the earnings structure and characteristics of employees working in a sample of around
18,000 establishments in 2006 and 14,000 in 2010, covering all sectors except agriculture.
All employees who work for wage in establishments (local units) of enterprises with at least
10 employees are covered in the ES. Gender, age, educational attainment, occupation,
duration of employment in the firm, type of employment (part vs. full time; permanent vs.
temporary), hours worked by type (regular vs. overtime), type of earnings (basic wage, over
time payments etc.) of employees and sector of establishments are covered by the ES.
Except for those whose source is explicitly stated, all numbers, tables and figures in this
study are based on ES.

8. ES has some significant advantages over surveys based on household data, specifically
Household Labor Force Surveys (LFS): First, ES can be considered more reliable as it is based
on firm records. Second, it allows comparing of men and women working in the same firm
through within-firm analysis. This is important because firms in a sector are usually quite
heterogeneous in many aspects including size, productivity and profitability. Not taking into
account the firm heterogeneity might result in misleading conclusions on the sources of
earnings gap. On the other hand, ES covers only formal employment in formal firms.
Therefore, all findings in this study adhere only to formal labor market.

9. The second set of dataset used in the study is the annual Industry and Services Surveys
(ISS) of the Turkstat. ISS covers all firms with at least 20 employees and a large sample for
those employing less than 20 employees. Number of employees by gender is the only
gender specific variable in the ISS. The third dataset, Demographic and Household Surveys
(DHS) of ICF International, is used to monitor the effect of marriage on female employment
in the Second Section. DHS data for Turkey belongs to 2003-2004 and includes information
of more than 8,000 married women of 15-50 years old. Finally, several figures of this study
make use of LFS conducted by Turkstat.

10. As for the methodology, a pooled regression model is applied with a dummy for being
female. Usually, a specification is re-run to undertake various within-group estimations by
adding a combination of dummies representing different characteristics. This method has
been used by, for example, Neal and Johnson (1996) to measure racial wage gaps and Fryer
and Levitt (2004) to measure racial test score gaps. It is frequent in the literature to
measure gender gap by decomposing earnings gaps into explained and unexplained parts.
Most famous decompositions are those introduced by Oaxaca (1973) and Blinder (1973),
known as O-B decomposition. Although it is straightforward to undertake it, a potential
problem with O-B decomposition is that it is not unique in defining explained and
unexplained components, as also acknowledged by the authors. In fact, Elder et al. (2010)


                                                                                           6
Gender Earnings Gap in the Formal Labor Market in Turkey

document empirically that different alternatives, which are equally preferable from a
theoretical perspective, of O-B decomposition yield very different gap estimations. They
further show that using a female dummy in an OLS regression is an attractive approach for
obtaining a measure of the unexplained earnings gap.

11. Section Two and Three of this paper are dedicated to the investigation of gender gap in
labor market participation. These two sections serve as an introduction to the earnings gap
analysis by documenting employee characteristics in Turkey. In Section Two, female
participation by various employee characteristics (education, age, occupation,
employment type) and sector are studied. Third section addresses the association between
female share in the total employment of firms and firm size and location.

12. Section Four and Section Five analyze the gender gap in earnings. Whilst Section Four
provides a descriptive and preliminary insight on the associations between earnings gap
and employee characteristics, Section Five uses econometric techniques to identify
individual associations between the earnings gap and each employee characteristics.
Section Six recommends policies to decrease gender gap in earnings and participation.

2. GENDER GAP IN EMPLOYMENT BY EMPLOYEE CHARACTERISTICS
2.1 OVERALL GENDER GAP IN EMPLOYMENT

13. Although improved slightly, formal female employment lags far behind male
employment in Turkey. According to ES, 23.1% of 5.98 million and 24.7% of 6.17 million
formally employed in industry and services were women in 2006 and 2010, respectively4.

14. The reason for low female employment is low female LFP rather than high
unemployment rate among women. Female LFP in Turkey is still below 30% in spite of some
improvements after 2005 and in sharp contrast to the above 70% male LFP. On female LFP,
Turkey is separated from economically comparable countries in East Europe and Latin
America and classified in the lowest category together with most Middle Eastern, North
African and South Asian countries (World Bank, 2012).

  According to LFS, share of female in non-agricultural 10+ firms was 21.5% and 23.2% of total formal employment in
these firms in 2006 and 2010, respectively. During the period, observations in the ES represent 45% of non-agricultural
total female and 44% of non-agricultural total male employment measured by the LFS. Exclusion of firms with less than
10 employees and exclusion of informal employment from the ES account for this difference.


                                                                                                                     7

15. Incidence of part-time employment (PTE) in the formal employment is still negligible
compared to PTE in the informal employment5. Share of part-time employed female and
male in total formal employment doubled, respectively, to 2% and 1.1% over 2006-2010.
On the other hand, once formal and informal employment considered together, PTE
accounted for around 7% of total male and 25% of total female employment in 2011 (OECD,
2012). Though overall PTE in Turkey is comparable to OECD-34 average for both genders,
it is overwhelmingly in the form of informal employment especially for women.

16. Temporary employment (TE) is limited in the formal sector6. TE is by far the most
prevalent among men in the construction sector. It is slightly more common in services for
women and less common in manufacturing for both genders than the overall TE.

2.2 GAP BY SECTOR AND OCCUPATION

17. Female employees are more concentrated in the services sector compared to male
counterparts. Over the 2006-2010 period both male and female employment in services
sector increased at the expense of manufacturing industry employment. That is, source of
employment increase in services was mainly shifts from manufacturing. In 2010, 61% of
female and 47% of male employment was in the services.

                       Table 2.2: Employment by Broad Sectors (%)
  Year      Gender       Mining     Manufacturing    Construction   Services      Total
  2006       Male         2.4           50.6             5.9          41.1         100
  2006      Female        0.4           44.8             2.5          52.3         100
  2010       Male         2.0           45.2             5.6          47.2         100
  2010      Female        0.3           36.6             2.4          60.7         100

18. Among disaggregated sectors, health, education and financial services are the ones that
female share is comparable to that of male. These sectors are followed by textile and
apparel manufacturing with 33% of employees being female. Trade and other business
services follow with rates ranging between 25-30%. At the opposite side, female share is
less than 10% in mining, metal manufacturing, transportation vehicles manufacturing and
construction. In spite of the overall increase, female share in machinery manufacturing and
to a lesser extent in accommodation and food services decreased over 2006-2010.

19. In line with the sectoral composition, female health and education professionals
outnumber their male counterparts. Besides, compared to overall female representation,
female are well represented among office staff and other professionals group. Female
share in managers occupation is similar to overall female share. On the other hand, with a
share of 29%, female representation among managers of small firms (i.e. firms with 10-49
employees) is higher than overall female representation in manager’s occupation.

2.3 GAP BY EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT

20. Average female employee is more educated than the average male employee.

                                            While number of male employees with primary
                                            school education was twice as many as male
                                            employees with higher education, number of
                                            higher educated female employees was 50%
                                            more than primary school educated female
                                            employees in 2006. Over the 2006-2010 period,
                                            educational attainment of employees in both
                                            genders improved.

21. Female managers are more educated than male managers, though by a smaller margin
than the overall education gap between female and male employees. 72% of female
managers and 61% of male managers were higher educated in both 2006 and 2010.
Moreover, only 2% of female managers and 5% of male managers were primary school
graduates. For both genders, share of higher educated managers in small firms were 6-7%
lower than the overall share of higher educated managers in all managers of that gender.

22. Average female employee is more educated than the average male employee not
because female working age population is more educated than male working population
but rather female employment is extremely low for low levels of educational attainment,
unlike that of male. While employment ratio of male does not show big differences across
educational attainment categories, female employment ratio significantly decreases from
higher education to high and vocational school. In fact, employment ratio of female with
higher education is around twice as much as employment ratio of female with
vocational/high school education. In parallel to this, higher education is the only
educational group that female employment ratio is close to that of male.

23. Education matters even more when formal employment is considered. Whilst almost
all employed women with higher education is formally employed, only 1/3rd of middle
school and 1/5th of primary school graduated women are formally employed among all
employed women with corresponding educational levels.

24. The higher gap in employment ratio in favor of men for low education levels is likely to
be indicating that traditional gender roles (i.e. women as mothers and housewives) are
more prevalent for lower levels of education. In addition to that, women with low levels of
education may not be earning enough to cover the cost of childcare.

25. Female employee is more educated than the male employee even in the same sector
and of same profession. In order to check whether educational gap between men and
women holds uniformly or it is driven by educational composition in a few selected sector-

occupation bundles, an index measuring the education of female relative to male in the
same sector-occupation is constructed7.

26. In Figure 2.3.3, bars with an Index value of above 1 represent sector-occupation bundles
in which female is more educated than male. The longer a bar, the higher the number of
sector-occupation bundles represented by that bar. Figure clearly shows that female is
more educated in most sector-occupation bundles. This shows that the reason for average
female employee being more educated than average male employee is not the difference
between male and female employees in sectoral or professional concentration (i.e. female
concentrated in professions/sectors requiring more education).

27. Average female employee is younger and has less years of work experience than the
average male employee8. Mean age differential was 3.1 years in 2006 and 2.6 years in 2010.
Employees in both genders were older in 2010. Mean experience gap decreased slightly
from 4.3 to 4.0.

  As not reported in the dataset, work experience for an employee is calculated using the following formula: Experience
= Previous experience + Current firm experience. Previous experience = Age – Educational years – Current Firm
experience. Obviously this formula assumes that there is no gap in the work life of employed, which can not be true for
most employees due to military service for male and maternity leave for female as well as unemployment periods.
However, as the experience differential between male and female employees is too high, the validity of this assumption
is unlikely to affect the analyses considerably.


                                                                                                                   11

28. Age and experience differential holds in all sectors except for accommodation & food
services and highest in the health sector, indicating the occupational difference within this
sector. No age and experience difference exists among unskilled. In addition, the gap is not
due to the differences in the educational attainment of male and female employees. Gap
holds within all educational groups except for primary school graduates, where it is almost
non-existent.

29. Age and experience gap can be explained by the early exit of female to a large extent.
Figure 2.4.2 reveals the steady decline in the female share in employment starting from the
age 22, where female share is equal to male share in employment. Female share gets below
its overall average after age 28 in 2006 and 29 in 2010.

Figure 2.4.2: Female Share (%) in TE by Age
                                                   30. The decline is especially strong
                                                   between ages 22-30. There are two
                                                   candidates as potential reason for this
                                                   decline: marriage and child bearing. This

                                                   that women predominantly participate
                                                   in the labor force at younger ages, prior
                                                   to marriage and childbirth.



2.5 GAP DUE TO MARRIAGE AND CHILD-CARE

31. Marriage is decisive in the early exit of female. Figure 2.5.1 demonstrates that the
difference in the LFP of married men and women accounts for the lion’s share of the overall
LFP difference between men and women. This is both due to the decrease in the female
LFP and increase in the male LFP following marriage, implying the strong influence of
traditional roles assigned to female and male in the family.



                                                                                          12

Source: LFS, Turkstat

32. There had been a striking increase in the LFP of married women (from 21.5% to 29.3%)
after 2007. During the same period LFP of never married women increased only by 5
percentage points (from 34.3% to 35.8%). This surprising increase in the LFP of married
women both in absolute terms and relative to never married women is valid also when
rural is excluded from the analysis. In contrast to a mild increase in the LFP of never married
female in urban from 35.1% to 37.4%, LFP of married women in urban experienced an
astonishing increase from 15.1% to 23.2%.

33. The sharp increase in the LFP of married women is likely to be due to cyclical economic
conditions rather than favorable shifts in social norms. The partial catch-up in Turkey
reminds the growth in the LFP of married women relative to never married in most Latin
American countries starting from 1960s. Chioda (2011) documents that increase in the
education level of women, favorable shift in the social norms related to work of women,
decreasing fertility and shift in the sectoral composition of the economy towards women
labor friendly sectors as potential reasons behind this development in Latin America.
However, the sharp increase in the LFP of married women in Turkey in a very short period
is in a stark contrast with the economic growth observed in the country during the same
period. To be more specific, economic crisis that started in 2008 and deepened in 2009
might have required some married women start to work to compensate for the losses in
the income of their husbands during the crisis. Besides, it is clear in the Figure that LFP of
married women decreased from 2002 to 2004 and was stagnant over 2004-2007, both of
which were periods of strong economic growth. This negative correlation between LFP of
married women and economic growth can be indicative of need based increase in the LFP
of married women after 2007.

35. To further investigate marriage related negative factors on female participation, Figure
2.5.3 is built using the same dataset. It presents by educational attainment specific reasons
of those %10 women (see Figure 2.5.2) who leave the job market after marriage out of total
%42 who were working at the time of marriage. Moreover, same reasons might also apply
to many of those 13% who worked before but not at the time of marriage.

36. Overall, moving to another place and husband’s disapproval are main factors in women
exiting job market after marriage. Pregnancy and child-care have a share of 11% and
housework has 10%. 11% do not need to work or do not prefer to work anymore. Only 2%
report that they could not find a job after marriage. Although not explicitly measured in
the Figure, number of children is also likely to be effective on women’s participation
decision as argued by Dayıoğlu and Kırdar (2010).



                                                                                              14
Gender Earnings Gap in the Formal Labor Market in Turkey

It is noteworthy that husband’s disapproval and housework are less important but
pregnancy/child-care is a more important reason for higher educated women compared to
others. Another important message of the Figure is related with the role of child-care
compared to other marriage related reasons. That is to say, only a moderate share of those
exiting job market do that due to child-care. This finding for Turkey is similar to that is
documented in Chioda and Demombynes (2010) for Latin America: Female LFP reductions
are more strongly associated with marriage than child-bearing in Latin American countries.

37. Negative impact of marriage on female LFP decreases by the increase in the educational
attainment of women9. LFP of married women with primary school education is less than
half of the LFP of never married women with same educational attainment. On the opposite
end, LFP of married women with higher education is as high as 3/4th of the LFP of never
married women with higher education. This situation might be indicating that acceptance
of traditional roles is weakening with the increase in the education level of women. A
contributing factor might be that, unlike the case for women with lower education, higher
educated women earn enough to cover childcare costs. On the other hand, the gap
between LFPs of never married and married women decreased for all educational groups
over 2006-2010.

  Middle school graduates are an exception to this finding as LFP of single and married women with this education are
very close to each other. However, this situation is due to the interestingly low LFP of single women with middle school
education, which needs to be further investigated.


                                                                                                                     15
Gender Earnings Gap in the Formal Labor Market in Turkey

38. Given the positive role of higher education in labor force participation of women and
particularly for securing a formal job, recent increase in the higher education participation
of women might support female LFP in the future. Increase in the marriage age can also
contribute to female LFP as staying single supports higher education participation and
women with higher education are less likely to exit the job market after marriage. Left
Panel in Figure 2.5.5 shows that compared to 2004, ratio of married women are lower for
all 20-44 age categories in 2011. This is particularly important for 20-24 and 25-29 age
groups as they are higher education ages.

     Figure 2.5.5: Evolvement of Civil Status and Higher Education by Age among Women

39. The Right panel of the Figure shows the ratio of higher educated women by civil status
and age groups in 2004 and 2011. From 2004 to 2011, ratio of higher educated women
increased both for married and never married women in all age groups. Ratio of higher
educated among married women doubled for all age groups over 2004-2011. Ratio of
higher educated among never married women increased from 25% to 42% for the 25-29
age group and from 25% to 33% for the 30-34 age group over the period.

3. GENDER GAP IN EMPLOYMENT BY FIRM CHARACTERISTICS10

3.1 GAP BY FIRM SIZE11

40. Female share in the total employment of a firm increases with the size (total
employment) of that firm. Once whole economy is considered, a 1% increase in the size of
a firm is associated with on average a 2.48% increase in the women share in total
employment of that firm. Though, positive relation between firm size and women share
holds only within narrow sectors. Once controlled for sub-sectors (i.e. 2-digit NACE
sectors12), response of female share to a 1% increase in the firm size increases to 3.04%,

10
   All computations and Figures in this section make use of Annual Industry and Services Surveys of Turkstat.
11
   See Appendix 3.1 for the regression analysis that this section builds on.
12
   NACE is the standard classification system of economic activities of the European Community. At 2-digit level, there
are 5 mining, 24 manufacturing and 30 services sectors.


                                                                                                                    16
Gender Earnings Gap in the Formal Labor Market in Turkey

implying that, compared to men, women slightly concentrated in sub-sectors with smaller
average firm size but in larger firms within a sub-sector. This relationship points a serious
disadvantage for female participation in Turkey since small firms have a very large share in
the total employment and total number of firms in Turkey compared to several
industrialized and developing countries of similar per-capita income (World Bank, 2013).

41. Relationship between firm size and female share significantly differs across broad
sectors. Female share in a services firm is, on average, 16.6% higher than that in a mining
firm of similar size. Services are followed by manufacturing and construction sectors, with
a 9.8% and 4.4% average female share premium over mining sector. However, differential
between sectors is not constant as magnitude of the change in the female share in response
to a change in the firm size varies across sectors. On average, a 1% increase in the size of a
firm is associated with around 4% and 3.5% increase in the female share of a services and
manufacturing firm, respectively. On the opposite end, female share in a mining firm
decreases with the increase in the size of that firm. For construction, the relationship is
almost insignificant.

                                                42. Figure 3.1 models the female share
                                                and firm size relationship using
                                                regression coefficients determined by
                                                the specification in the Appendix 3.1.
                                                Female share in a single employee firm
                                                is estimated to be 10%, 8%, 8% and 14%
                                                for mining, construction, manufacturing
                                                and services, respectively13. As firm size
                                                increases until around 200, female share
                                                in services and manufacturing firms
                                                                  Source: ISS, Turkstat

sharply. 25% of all employees of a 200-employee manufacturing firm and 35% of a 200-
employee services firm are expected to be female. This surge in female share with the
increase in firm size continues for after 200-employee threshold, but at a decreasing speed.
Hairdressing and washing services, real estate activities, land transportation, hotels and
restaurants, manufacture of apparel and retail trade are the sub-sectors with the highest
increase in female representation in response to a increase in firm size. On the other hand,
female share in a mining firm decreases with the increase in the size of the firm. Only 15
employees of a 1,000-employee mining firm are estimated to be female. In addition to all
sub-sectors of mining and construction, female share in renting of machinery and
equipment, manufacture of transport equipment, manufacture of basic metals decreases
with the increase in firm size.

   These percentages for a single employee firm obviously describe a hypothetical situation. Percentages can be thought
as the probabilities of that employee being woman.

3.2 GAP BY FIRM LOCATION14

43. Response of female share in a firm to an increase in the employment of that firm varies
across regions. Once similar size firms compared, the ranking of regions of Turkey in terms
of average female share in total employment of a firm is as follows: Istanbul, West
(excluding Istanbul), South, Central, North, East. Specifically, female share in a firm in
Istanbul, the highest ranked region, is on average 11.6% more than the female share in a
firm of equal size in the East, the lowest ranked region. On the other hand, as is the case
with sectoral differences, the magnitude of the relationship between firm location and
female share is not constant. It highly depends on the size of a firm.

                                                                         44. Figure 3.2 shows that for a single
                                                                         employee firm female share is
                                                                         estimated to be 8% in the East, 11% in
                                                                         the North, 12.5% in the Central and
                                                                         South, 16% in the West Turkey and
                                                                         finally 20% in Istanbul. The magnitude
                                                                         of increase in the female share in
                                                                         response to a 1% increase in the firm
                                                                         size is as follows by region: North
                                                                         3.08%, East 2.82%, West 2.37%, South
                                                                         2.24%, Central 2.00%, Istanbul 1.81%.

45. This ranking is within expectations from a social perspective. As the East and the North
are more traditional than other regions, female participation in these two regions are more
repressed for low levels of firm size. Accordingly, female participation gives a stronger
response to the increase in the firm size in these regions.

46. Several interesting results emerge from this observed heterogeneity across regions.
First, as firm size increases, the North closes the gap with Istanbul and the West. Second,
although starts much behind that in Central Turkey, female share in East Turkey surpasses
that in Central Turkey around at 400-employee threshold. Between 100 and 600 firm size
two regional groups form with female share in the West, Istanbul and the North being
roughly 5% more than those in the South, the Central and the East.

47. Regional differences in female share prevail by a large extent even if they are measured
by only using within sub-sector variations. One remaining question is whether disparities
across regions in firm size – female share relationship are driven by differences in sectoral
composition of different regions. That is to say, if services sector has a bigger share in the
economy of Istanbul than those of other regions, we can expect Istanbul to have higher
female share even if there is no regional effect associated with Istanbul. To examine this
question, disparities among regional female share averages are measured only within
sectors and sub-sectors. Once broad sectors are controlled, relative to the female share in
the East, average female share in Istanbul, the Central and the West increase whereas
those in the North and the South decrease slightly. A larger change occurs once sectoral
averages are generated only by within sub-sector variations. In that case, Istanbul premium
(over the East) decreases from 11.64% to 10.69%. Similarly, premium of the Central, the
South and the West decrease. On the other hand, premium of the North increases from
2.80% to 3.22%. These figures imply that unfavorable (i.e. female unfriendly) sectoral
composition of the North and the East have limited role in these two regions’ lagging
behind others in average female share.

4. GENDER GAP IN EARNINGS: PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS
4.1 COMPARISON OF HOURS WORKED

48. Average working hour of female is comparable to that of male. Difference between
male and female regular weekly work is very low in favor of male. Difference in overtime
work was slightly higher and increased from 2006 to 2010 in parallel to the increase of
overtime work for both genders.15

          Table 4.1: Average (Mean) Weekly Work Hours (full time and permanent)
             Work Type         Female-2006         Male-2006        Female-2010        Male-2010
             Regular              44.7               44.9              44.4              44.7
             Overtime              0.7                1.2               0.9               1.6
             Total                45.5               46.1              45.3              46.3

49. Similarity of hours worked holds at finer levels of classifications. In none of the sectors,
occupational or educational groups, the difference between average working time of
female and male is more than 2 hours per-week. Financial services is the sector that has
the least work time with 42 hours for both genders and transportation vehicles
manufacturing is the one that has longest with 48 hours for male and 47 hours for female.




15
   These figures are computed over all employees. Only 19% of male and 15% of female reported to have overtime work
in 2010. Therefore, average over-time work among males that reported overtime work was 8.4 hours (=1.6hrs*100/19)
per week in 2010.


                                                                                                                19

4.2 OVERALL GAP IN EARNINGS

50. Average per-hour earning of women is not less than that of male. Women earned, on
average, 0.5% and 3% more than the men per-hour worked in 2006 and 2010.

                            Table 4.2.1: Gross Earnings (TL) per-hour worked
                     Female-2006             Male-2006             Female-2010              Male-2010

51. Basic wage is the primary source of earnings for both genders.16 Share of basic wage in
total earnings was 85.4% for female and 81.8% for male in 2010. On the contrary, regular
payments other than basic wage had a higher share in total earnings of male.

4.3 GAP BY SECTOR AND OCCUPATION

52. Female earn less in manufacturing but more in services than the male in the same
sector. Gap in earnings per-hour decreased from 23% to 19% in manufacturing and from
10% to 8% in services over 2006-2010. On the other hand, average earning in services was
higher than that in manufacturing even for men.

53. Among sub-sectors, textile manufacturing was the lowest paying sector followed by
construction for both genders in both years. Average earnings in the financial services, the
highest paying sector, were more than 4 times in textile manufacturing.17 As for
occupational differences, female managers earned on overage 10% more than male
managers. Female earnings was 2/3rd of that of male among health professionals,
indicating the different roles within the broad definition of health professional.

   Regular payments: Bonuses, in-cash social contributions, overnight and overtime transfers paid every month. Irregular
payments: Irregular transfers of those classified under regular payments as well as any other non-monthly cash transfers
such as dividend payments and marriage contribution. In-kind transfers: Any contributions that are not in cash such as
free lunch.

17
   Single minimum wage policy affected earnings structure of sectors by varying magnitudes. See Appendix 4.3 for the
comparison of its effects on financial services sector and textile & manufacturing sector. It has almost no effect in financial
services sector, on the opposite hand, has a tremendous effect in the textile and manufacturing sectors.

4.4 GAP BY EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT

54. Female earn significantly less than the male with same educational attainment.
Although, average earnings of female was slightly more than that of male, female earn less
than the male with same education, confirming the vast difference in the educational
composition of female and male employees. Turkish labor market is not an exception in
this behavior. Atal et al. (2009) report that earnings gap in Latin America increases by 12%
if gap is measured within educational groups.

Figure 4.4: Hourly Earnings of Female (as % of male earnings with same education)
                                             55. Earnings gap was highest within
                                             vocational school graduates and lowest
                                             within high school graduates in 2006. Over
                                             the 2006-2010 period, gaps in both groups
                                             decreased. As for within gender
                                             comparison, primary and middle school
                                             graduates of male and female earned
                                             exactly same and around 1/3rd of higher
                                             education graduates in both years.

4.5 GAP BY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE

56. Female earnings relative to male earnings show a heterogeneous trend by years of
experience. 3 zones emerge out of the structure in Figure 4.5:

I- Until 6 years of experience men and women earn almost same. Average ages of men and
women in this group are 23.0 and 22.8, respectively.




                                                                                         21

                                              female earn 10-30% more than the male

                                                                 III- Starting from around 25 years of
                                                                 experience, female earnings relative to male
                                                                 is decreasing persistently by years of
                                                                 experience. At 44 years of experience,
                                                                 female earn around half of male.


5. GENDER GAP IN EARNINGS: REGRESSION ANALYSIS18
57. Descriptive analysis in Section four demonstrated that there are several factors
potentially effective on the gender gap in earnings. Regression analysis in this section
allows us to detect individual magnitudes of those factors.

58. Regression analysis confirms that average female employee does not earn less than the
average male employee. Average per-hour earnings was 5.67 TL and 5.70 TL in 2006; 8.37
TL and 8.63 TL in 2010 for men and women, respectively. That is, earnings gap was in favor
of women. As for managers, there was no gap between men and women in 2006 but it was
55 cents, corresponding to a 6% difference, in favor of women managers in 2010. On the
other hand, direction of gender gap was opposite in manufacturing and services. In 2010,
average female employee earned 1.22 TL (16%) less in manufacturing but 0.74 TL (8%)
more in services than the average male in the same broad sector.

59. If education level is not taken into account, it is found that female employees are
concentrated in higher-paying sectors and sub-sectors compared to male employees. This
result is not surprising given that female representation was above overall female
representation in the highest (financial services), 3rd highest (education) and 5th highest
(health) paying sectors. Once controlled for sub-sector, gender premium for women
decreases by 0.38 TL and becomes negative implying that women earned 0.12 TL less than
men in the same sub-sector. This result is driven by the earning differentials in sub-sectors
of manufacturing rather than those of services. On the other hand, both men and women
earn more in services than in manufacturing. In 2010, per-hour earnings in services were
on average 25% and 60% higher than those in manufacturing for men and women,
respectively.

     See Appendix 5 for the regression analysis that this section builds on.


                                                                                                          22
Gender Earnings Gap in the Formal Labor Market in Turkey

60. Once education level and experience are taken into account, it is found that differences
in sectoral and occupational segregation of male and female employees contribute to the
earnings gap. As explained, the average female employee works in higher-paying sectors
and sub-sectors compared to average male employee. However, as also explained, the
average female employee is more educated but less experienced than the average male
employee. If earnings of men and women of same educational attainment and years of
experience are compared within sub-sectors, there emerges a small segregation in favor of
men. To illustrate, earnings of female was 0.22 TL less than male of same occupation, with
same educational attainment and same current firm and previous experience in 2010.
However, earnings disparity without sub-sector control, (i.e. gap explained by both within
and between occupation differences between male and female with same education,
current firm and previous experience) was 0.32 TL in favor of men. Therefore, it can be
concluded that women were more segregated into lower paying sub-sectors compared to
men with same education but this tendency was very weak. The same is true for
occupational segregation. Female employees are weakly segregated into lower paying
occupations relative to male of similar characteristics.

61. Sectoral and occupational segregation contributes to the earnings gap only within
manufacturing. In 2010, women working in manufacturing earned 0.42 TL less due to
concentrating in lower paying sub-sectors and 0.34 TL less due to concentrating in lower
paying occupations. On the other hand, earnings gap originating from sub-sectoral and
occupational segregation of male and female employees within services is negligible.

62. Compared to men, women work in higher paying firms in a sub-sector. However,
women earn significantly less than the men in the same firm. Once sub-sector controls are
replaced by firm controls, gender premium for women, which was already negative in 2010,
decreases further by a large magnitude for both years. On average, women earned per-
hour 0.91 TL (11%) less than the men working in the same firm, respectively in 2006 and
2010. Within firm gap was 4% in manufacturing and 13% in services in 2010.

63. Although, in general, women earn less than the men with the same educational
attainment, direction and magnitude of the gap differs across educational attainment
groups. On the one hand, in 2010, primary school and higher educated women earned 12%
and 8% less than the men with same educational attainment and equal years of within firm
and previous experience19. On the other hand, middle, high and vocational high school
graduated women earned more than the men with same years of experience by 1%, 6%
and 1%, respectively.




19
  Average earnings of women with a formal job and at most primary school graduated are slightly above the minimum
wage.


                                                                                                              23
Gender Earnings Gap in the Formal Labor Market in Turkey

64. Once comparison is limited to those working in the same sub-sector or in the same firm,
the earnings gap between primary school graduated male and female employees decreases
to 2%. However, earnings gap among university educated male and female employees
increases to 12% if male and female working in the same firm are compared. Gap for other
educational groups do not change considerably by within sub-sector or firm comparison.
On the other hand, earnings variation across different educational attainments is striking
for women. A university educated female earns on average four times as much as a female
with primary school education and twice as much as a female with high school education.

65. Women having less experience contributes significantly to the earnings gap. On
average, in 2010, a man employee earned 0.61 TL and 0.14 TL more than another man
employee with same educational attainment but with 1 year less experience in the current
firm and previous firm, respectively. Contribution of additional year of experience is even
more for a woman. It is 0.72 TL and 0.18 TL, for 1 year of current and previous firm
experience, respectively. Premium of additional year of experience does not change
significantly if employees within same sub-sector are compared. On the other hand, current
firm experience premium decreases to 0.49 TL for men and to 0.50 TL for women if
employees with same education and working in the same firm are compared.

66. Gender gap in earnings that can be attributed to discrimination against women is not
large in the formal labor market in Turkey. Women earn slightly less than the men with
same education and occupation, working in the same firm and having same years of current
firm and previous experience. The gap was 5.5% (0.33 TL) and 6.5% (0.54 TL) for overall
economy, 5.7% and 2.7% for manufacturing and 4.8% and 6.9% for services, in 2006 and
2010, respectively. That is, the gap decreased in manufacturing but increased in services
over 2006-2010. Under the assumption that all characteristics effective on the level of
wages are controlled, figures above give the magnitude of discrimination against women
in the formal labor market.

67. Gender gap earnings in Turkey is highly likely to grow with the increase in female LFP.
The measured discrimination in Turkey is much lower than those measured for many
countries in various studies referred in the Introduction. One coverage related and one
country-specific reason likely to account for this differential. As for coverage, unlike many
other studies, this study measures the earnings gap only in the formal labor market. It is
well established in the literature that earnings discrimination against women in informal
jobs are higher than that in formal ones20. As for the country-specific reason, extremely low
participation rate of female, compared to male in Turkey and also to female in other
countries, gives female employees a higher bargaining power in Turkey. Underlying this
reasoning is the assumption put by Katz and Murphy (1992) that men and women are
“imperfect substitutes” in the labor market. In fact, Blau and Kahn (2001) show for 22
industrialized and transition countries that there is a positive relationship between
earnings gap in favor of men and female labor supply in a country21.

  Instead of relying on the results of other countries, the ideal approach would be to analyze labor supply and earnings
gap relationship in Turkey. However, lack of a long series of panel data for Turkey makes such an analysis impossible.

Gender Earnings Gap in the Formal Labor Market in Turkey

6. CONCLUSION AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS
68. Using novel datasets, this paper has revealed several distinctive features of the gender
dimension of formal labor market in Turkey. In light of these findings, certain areas emerge
as candidates for policy interventions in achieving gender equity in the Turkish economy:

69. First, higher education is a critical factor for the female labor force participation since
female participation is extremely low for low levels of educational attainment, unlike that
of male. It is even more important for women to secure a formal job. Therefore,
encouraging female to continue education after mandatory primary education is likely to
yield positive results. Although increase in the higher education attendance may not help
decrease the existing earnings gap between higher educated men and women, it would still
make women better off since higher educated women earn several times more than those
without higher education. Increase in the education level is likely to also have a positive
effect on female entrepreneurship as higher education is the dominant education type
among female entrepreneurs of all and also small-sized formal firms.

70. A significant drawback of working women is that, compared to men, they have less
experience due to early exit. Marriage and childcare are decisive in the early exit of women
that do not have higher education. These effects work through traditional role assignment
in the family and inability of low educated women to earn enough to cover childcare and
other work related costs. Hence, a second area of intervention might be to introduce cheap
and prevalent childcare facilities for working women.

71. Third area of intervention can be to support formal part-time employment of female as
part-time formal employment is still rare especially for women. Legal reforms in the area
of social security that will make part-time work more attractive for both employees and
employers as well as policies to increase the formalization of part-time employment might
be priority actions. On the other hand, potential adverse effects of such policies need to be
considered. Since most part-time employment is informal, promoting part-time
employment can easily contribute to informal employment or result in already full-time
employed women to become part-time employed.

72. The forth and fifth interventions are related to firm characteristics. Female share in the
total employment of a firm shows a robust increase with the size of that firm in the services
and the manufacturing industry. That is, women work in larger firms compared to men.
Moreover, female share increases the most in the East and the North, which are
comparatively conservative regions, with the increase in the firm size. These findings hint
that social norms related to work of women and insecurity of women in the small-sized
firms might be functional in the low participation of female. Therefore, improving labor
related legislations to better protect women rights in the work environment might help
boost the interest of women to work in small-sized firms.




                                                                                            25
Gender Earnings Gap in the Formal Labor Market in Turkey

73. As a consequence of the positive relationship between firm size and female share in a
firm, policies aiming at developing small and medium sized enterprises (SME) have an
indirect positive effect on the female participation to the labor market. Although SME
development is a subject of a broader development agenda, it may be further supported
due to its positive externality on female participation. Accordingly, improving and
expanding industrial zones can be helpful as they provide a more secure work environment
and better transportation facilities.

74. Shaped by the higher educational level but also less work experience of women,
earnings of women relative to those of men do not indicate a significant earnings
discrimination in the formal labor market in Turkey. However, earnings gap needs to be
considered together with the record low participation rate of women. A higher
participation of women is likely to raise the earnings gap in Turkey to the level of those
existent in countries with high female labor force participation.

where i represents sector, j occupation, f female employee, m male employee. Nf is the
number of female
            
                   in the sector-occupation, Nm is the number of male in the sector-
occupation and Educ is the duration of educational attainment of an employee such that:

                          5 , if educationalattaintment = "primary "
                          8 , if educationalattaintment = "middle "

                          14 , if educationalattaintment = "higher"

Assignment of duration to each educational attainment is a critical step in computing the
Index. 5 years is chosen for “primary” although this group includes employees that have
        5 years of education or no education at all. Given that “primary” is a larger group
less than
for males, this choice is likely to result in a downward bias in the index rather than an
upward bias. For robustness, computations repeated under various scenarios of education
durations and obtained similar results at all attempts.
