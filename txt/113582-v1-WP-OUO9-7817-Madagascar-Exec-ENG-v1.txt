         he series of papers comprising the report “Shifting Fortunes and Enduring Poverty in
         Madagascar” is summarized here, and was produced under the World Bank’s Poverty Global
         Practice, Africa Region. Theresa Osborne and Nadia Belghith led this work under the super-
vision of Pablo Fajnzylber, Practice Manager. The support and guidance of Mark Lundell, Country
Director, and Coralie Gevers, Country Manager, are gratefully acknowledged. The report also
benefited from consultations with various Ministries of the Government of Madagascar as well as
private, donor, and non-governmental stakeholders. The data utilized were collected by the national
statistical institute (INSTAT), with support from the United Nations, the African Development Bank,
and the World Bank.

We also thank Christopher Barrett of Cornell University, who provided technical input on two of
the papers, as well as Francis Vella and peer reviewers Dominique van de Walle, Caterina Ruggeri
Laderchi, and Kathleen Beegle, for their valuable comments. Venkat Ganeshan Gopalakrishnan and
Carolin Geginat provided helpful editorial comments. Chuqiao Bi, Alessia Thiebaud provided superb
research assistance and analytical inputs, and Patrick Leon Randiankolona provided essential data
diagnostics and core elements of the analysis, without which much of the report would not have been
possible.

Executive Summary                                                                           1




Madagascar made very little progress in improving the welfare of the poor in recent years,
as gains achieved after 2001 were reversed between 2005 and 2012.


Since 2001, Madagascar has seen two political crises in
addition to disruptions in access to markets for textiles
and manufacturing exports, severe climatic shocks, and
global food price spikes. Real per capita GDP declined
between 2001 and 2012, and despite post-crisis stabiliza-
tion, has increased only one percent in the ensuing four
years.

Against this backdrop, the headcount poverty rate
declined slightly over the 2001-2012 period, but it
remains exceedingly high at 70.7 percent (2012) (figure
1). Given Madagascar’s persistently high poverty
rates, perhaps a more meaningful indicator of welfare
is the poverty gap index, which measures the severity
of poverty. Based on this measure, the average poor
Malagasy consumed 32.2 percent less than a person
living at the poverty line in 2012. This gap has stayed
relatively flat, falling from 35.9 in 2001 and then increa-
sing just slightly over the period 2005-2012 from 31.3

Climatic shocks have been a major determinant of welfare fluctuations, intensifying poverty and
inequality in some years, such as 2010, when real incomes fell for the poorest households.

Although between 2005 and 2010 the poor accumulated more “endowments” – productive
assets and favorable household and community characteristics – and experienced fewer
adverse shocks. However, the benefits derived from these factors was lower in 2010 than in
2005. At the same time, incomes associated with the economic activities of the poor declined.

First, between 2005 and 2010 the poor became more isolated from markets and services as
transport conditions worsened.



The average real price to transport goods such as a bag
of rice rose 42 percent. Fuel costs rose along with food
prices (with oil prices rising approximately 48 percent).

The average time to reach markets also increased,
particularly for the bottom quintile – from 1.9 to 2.4
hours (figure 6). The time to reach a main urban center
doubled to almost 12 hours as distances to markets,
schools, and health centers became more strongly related
to poverty. The lack of funding for road maintenance
following the 2009 political crisis is an important partial

The second key factor reducing agricultural incomes was a set of policies designed to
insulate the country from rising world rice prices, which diminished the producer price
disproportionately post-2005 and intensified rural poverty.

In response to adverse shocks and changing economic circumstances, households shifted their
efforts between farm and off-farm activities, but doing so in 2010 was only partially successful
in shoring up household consumption.


Just as people had moved into agriculture in 2005 when
employment in urban based sectors fell, they transferred
to non-farm enterprises, particularly secondary employ-
ment in services, as returns in agriculture tumbled in
2010 (figure 9).

However, such strategies could not fully offset the
weak demand for labor. While secondary employment
increased, so did the number of those seeking but unable
to find secondary work. Wages increased just slightly in
2010, but only for male workers, and then returned to
their former (2005) levels by 2012.

Of all household and community-level factors, those that are the most predictive of higher
welfare are higher community-level electrification, proximity to urban areas, and greater
employment by the household off-farm (M&O).


In urban areas, having an education is also predictive of
higher welfare; and in rural zones, greater land areas and
higher paddy prices are important predictors. In particu-
lar, in order of importance, the best predictors (among
the many measured characteristics and events) of higher
consumption nationally are:

1.	 Living in a community with high levels of electri-

The current structure of firms depresses labor income as well.


For the 70 percent of microenterprises that employ only
their owners, the income generated by the entrepreneur’s
own time is only 60 percent of the average wage in the
economy, even when one takes into account individual
differences in skill and ability. Owners of multi-wor-
ker microenterprises, however, earn a 68 percent wage
premium (B&O).

Micro-enterprises are also unable to generate sufficient
employment opportunities. At present, multi-worker
firms employ on average .47 paid workers and 81 paid
hours per month, much less than the 760 hours or 4.4
full-time workers needed to maximize profit levels.

Labor market frictions depress employment levels and wages offered by both agricultural and
off-farm enterprises (J, B&O).



The gap between actual and optimal labor employment
suggests an important barrier to hiring workers, even
informally. This may be due to the costs of identifying
good workers, as well as monitoring and incentivizing
workers once hired.

Investigation into the underlying issues, possibly through
pilot programs to reduce these barriers, could point to
cost-effective measures for stimulating job creation and
wage and productivity growth.

Women in Madagascar earn lower wages than men; they also face greater difficulties in coping
with shocks and finding productive employment.


In 2010, women had more difficulty than men in
securing employment off farm when agricultural
conditions worsened, thus experiencing higher rates of
under-employment (BR&O). Although female-headed
households are not consistently worse off, when taking
into account educational attainment, age, and location
(region and urban versus rural milieu), men earned 37
percent more than women in the labor market in 2012
(B&O). Female entrepreneurs are also less likely to own
and operate a micro-enterprise that employs other work-
ers, and more likely to be self-employed in a smaller
microenterprise than men, with the consequence that
they earn lower profits and labor income. Moreover,
even accounting for size, male-operated firms earn higher
profits, all else equal (B&O). This disparity in access
to opportunities widened substantially in 2010: Male-
headed households were able to offset much of the losses
from climatic shocks and declining returns to agriculture
through off farm work in that year (TO&B).

The poverty of the Malagasy economy, in combination with high transport costs and frictions in
capital and labor markets, may create a low productivity trap.


Poverty itself results in low demand for non-agricultural
goods and services and may, in combination with capital
and labor market frictions, result in a low-income
low-productivity trap. Microenterprise owners rate the
lack of demand for their goods and services as the most
important constraint. Moreover, firms that serve larger
customers that are involved in exports are more profit-
able, even after accounting for scale and characteristics
of the entrepreneur (B&O).

This suggests that demand-side stimulus, if sustainable
and accompanied by productive investments, could be
part of a broader strategy to reduce poverty.
