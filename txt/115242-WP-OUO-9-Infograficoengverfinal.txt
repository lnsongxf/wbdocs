Flood maps can be used in combination with georeferenced
datasets of assets of different types, like road networks,
production plants, public infrastructure, real estate and so on.

As such, State or national institutions can benefit from the
information provided in order to prioritize areas for DRM
interventions and investment across the state or to promote
private developments in safe zones, for example.

Exposure and Vulnerability
Vulnerability in the context of this study is an expression of the tendency of an element or a set of elements to
suffer damage when subjected to a hazard.

   The impact of a hazard will not be equal in all cases. Impact is highly dependent on the characteristics of the asset at
   any given location. Some property construction types are more vulnerable to flooding.

Floods and Financial Loss in SC
A Catastrophe (CAT) model is an automated model that generates a set of simulated events. Each simulation
carries estimations of the magnitude, intensity, and location of an event to determine the amount of damage
and calculate the probable loss as a result of an extreme event. (Lloyd’s Market Association 2013).

                             The AEP results show the probability that the total cost of all events in a given year will exceed a certain threshold.

                             Therefore, based on these results there is a 10% chance that all events within any given year will
                             generate losses of R$1.8 billion or more. Events with a 20 year return period could generate losses of
                             R$2.3 billion or higher.

Policy Implications
In the context of this study, macro and complex State        use types are not developed within areas which may
activities such as planning and investment decisions         experience significant flood hazard;
would benefit from additional strategic information
on disaster risk management that could lead to DRM           Inhabitants within hazard zones can be educated and
informed decision-making, inter alia:                        sensitized on the risks they are exposed to and pre-
                                                             warned of an impending flood;
Recommendations on future structural and non-
structural flood management options aimed at achieving       Flooding hazard maps can be used to coordinate the
a reduction in flood damage;                                 disaster response across its many stakeholders;

Use flood maps and probabilistic loss estimates to direct    Hazard and loss data provided can be used to identify
future activity in flood risk reduction;                     locations which present maximum return on investment
                                                             if flood reduction strategies were to be implemented
The data products can be used to inform decision-            (structural risk reduction decisions); and
making to avoid people settling in flood prone areas as
well as to reduce flood risks at established settlements;    Use the flood map and loss estimate products as an

Hazard maps are useful for land use planning to enable       regarding the management of reservoirs as a way of
