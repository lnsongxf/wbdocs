The World Bank’s Centre for Financial Reporting Reform (CFRR) is pleased to present
this second edition of the Guide to Corporate Sector Accounting and Auditing in the
Acquis Communautaire. The Guide seeks to facilitate understanding of the acquis
communautaire and also to emphasize the importance of reliable accounting and
auditing in achieving sustainable economic growth. The first edition of this Guide
(issued in 2007) was prepared by a World Bank team comprising Frederic Gielen, Erik
van der Plaats, Ana Cristina Hirata Barros and Jennie Tranter, under the supervision of
John Hegarty and with inputs from a number of officials from the European Commis-
sion and other relevant European institutions.

Henri Olivier, Secretary General of the Fédération Européenne des Experts-Comptables
(FEE), reviewed this second issue of the Guide and assisted the staff of the CFRR in
updating it.

Despite the extent and quality of the external assistance received in preparing the
Guide, the CFRR is solely responsible for its contents.

The Centre for Financial Reporting Reform (CFRR) located in Vienna, Austria, is respon-
sible for the World Bank‘s corporate sector financial reporting activities in Europe and
Central Asia (ECA). The Centre provides knowledge services and assistance in develop-
ing the capacity for effective corporate financial reporting. Services offered by the
CFRR include analytical and advisory services, learning and skill development, know-
how and knowledge transfer, and technical assistance and institutional strengthening.
The CFRR manages two regional programs that aim to raise the quality of corporate
financial reporting in Europe: The Road to Europe: Program of Accounting Reform and
Institutional Strengthening (REPARIS) and the Financial Reporting Technical Assistance
Program (FRTAP). REPARIS is a regional program funded by the Austrian government
(through the Ministry of Finance and the Austrian Development Agency), and the gov-
ernments of Luxemburg and Switzerland that aims to help create a transparent policy
environment and effective institutional framework for corporate reporting aligned with
the acquis communautaire in South-Central and South-East Europe. Participating coun-
tries/entities include Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Former Yugo-
slav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, and Serbia. FRTAP, which is funded
by the government of Switzerland through its “enlargement contribution”, supports
new EU member states in implementing sustainable regulatory and institutional frame-
works and in furthering the correct implementation of the acquis communautaire in the
area of financial reporting. Currently, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Poland and Slovenia
are participants in FRTAP.

This Guide is intended to provide a general overview of the relevant sections of the
acquis communautaire on financial reporting and auditing and does not attempt to give
anything more than an introduction to the issues. It is not meant to be an exhaustive
rendition of the law, nor is it legal advice to those reading it. The findings, interpreta-
tions, and conclusions expressed in this guide are entirely those of the authors. They
do not necessarily represent the views of the World Bank, its Executive Directors, or
the countries they represent.

We are pleased to introduce the second edition of this Guide, which is designed to
ensure that a comprehensive overview of the relevant provisions of the acquis commu-
nautaire is available to policymakers, regulators, and other stakeholders in countries
with a “European vocation” (EU Member States, those negotiating accession or hoping
to do so, those covered by the European Neighborhood Policy) or those simply wish-
ing to take the EU regulatory model into account when devising their own national
approaches.
This Guide outlines and summarizes the European Union (EU) legislative framework
governing corporate sector accounting and auditing. It is primarily intended for an au-
dience with little prior knowledge of the EU. Consequently, rather than delving directly
into the issues of accounting and auditing, the Guide begins by giving a brief history
and overview of the EU, its institutions and legislative processes (Section I). Subse-
quently, in Section II, the Guide focuses on the development of the Internal Market,
particularly in the areas of financial market integration and company law harmoniza-
tion. Readers who are familiar with these matters may wish to go straight to Section III.
Section III addresses the harmonization of accounting and auditing in the EU. These
topics have grown in importance over time with the increasing efforts to complete the
Internal Market, particularly regarding company law harmonization. Finally, Section IV
of this Guide looks at the most pressing accounting and auditing issues for the EU.
These issues are currently a central focus for EU policymakers and will remain so for
the foreseeable future.
This document will also be published on the internet and it is planned that the web
version will be periodically updated to reflect changes in the acquis communautaire.

1. A number of treaties provide the fundamental basis of the European Union (EU). The
EU’s origins can be traced to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Com-
munity (ECSC), also referred to as the Treaty of Paris, which came into force in 1952.1
The ECSC’s original objective was to “lead to the realization of the first concrete foun-
dation of a European federation indispensable to the preservation of peace” following
the two World Wars.2 In addition to this underlying motive, the ECSC rested primarily
upon the ideas of economic growth, free market competition, and the improvement of
living standards. The initial success achieved by the ECSC led to a succession of trea-
ties, which gradually created the institutional bodies and the body of EU laws known
collectively as the acquis communautaire (see paragraph 12). Each successive treaty
(or treaty revision) and change to the acquis communautaire has aimed at bringing
the Member States closer together economically, socially, and politically in order to
promote the region’s stability and economic growth.

2. This section begins with an overview of the main treaties establishing the EU. It
then looks at the current state of EU membership and its various policies towards its
neighbor countries, particularly as regards accession. This section then examines the
acquis communautaire and the legislative means by which it is developed, as well as its
application in practice. Finally, it reviews the institutions established by the treaties and
the policy-making process through which these institutions interact.



A. THE MAIN TREATIES 3

3. Following the Treaty of Paris, the Treaty of Rome (commonly referred to as the “EC
Treaty”) entered into force on 1 January 1958, creating the European Economic Commu-
nity (EEC). The EC Treaty laid down the framework for bringing about a common market
and developing a number of common policies. It contained from the outset a legal basis
for company law harmonization. At that time, the role of the European Parliament in the
law-making process was only advisory (through the so-called “consultation procedure”;
see paragraph 26).

4. However, once these initial moves towards greater community integration had been
completed, the integration process lost momentum by the early 1980s. Amidst moun-
ting political criticism, the EEC’s political leaders decided to move forward by passing
the Single European Act (SEA). The SEA, which entered into force on 1 July 1987, ad-
apted the Treaty of Rome in order to hasten the completion of the Internal Market by
31 December 1992. It introduced a new legal basis for harmonization of laws in order to
establish the Internal Market, and a new legislative procedure (the “cooperation proce-
dure,” see paragraph 27).

5. The Treaty on European Union, also referred to as the Maastricht Treaty, entered into
force on 1 November 1993, and built on the integration successes of the SEA. It changed
the name of the European Economic Community to “the European Community” and
introduced detailed provisions for the creation of an economic and monetary union. It
also introduced a new legislative procedure (the “codecision procedure,” see paragraph
28) as well as the principle of subsidiarity (see paragraph 16).

6. The Treaty of Amsterdam, which entered into force on 1 May 1999, amended and
renumbered the previous Treaties. It strengthened the role of the European Parliament
and extended the scope of the co-decision procedure’s application.

7. In anticipation of the addition of ten new Member States, the Treaty of Nice entered
into force on 1 February 2003. The treaty reformed institutions to enable the EU to
function efficiently after its enlargement to 25 Member States.

8. The Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was signed in Rome on 29 October
2004. The intention of this document was to replace the existing treaties with a single
text and bring about a large number of institutional changes aimed at increasing the
efficiency and democratic legitimacy of EU decision-making. Negative referenda in
France and the Netherlands meant that the treaty failed to be ratified by all Member
States.

9. Subsequently on 13 December 2007, EU leaders signed the Treaty of Lisbon, which
was designed to bring an end to years of negotiation on institutional issues and “to
complete the process started by the Treaty of Amsterdam and by the Treaty of Nice
with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the EU and
to improving the coherence of its action.” It includes an important overhaul of the
Maastricht Treaty and the Treaty of Rome including a proposal that the EU will take
on a single legal personality, strengthening the role of the European Parliament and
extending the codecision making process.4 After some political turbulence, the Treaty
of Lisbon was ratified by all 27 Member States and entered into force on 1 December
2009. A coordinated version of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union
(TFEU) was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 9 May 2008.

B. MEMBER STATES, ACCESSION AND
   THE EUROPEAN NEIGHBORHOOD POLICY

10. The EU currently comprises 27 Member States. In 1958, the Treaty of Rome created
a common market and customs union, and provided for the free movement of capital
and labor among the six signatories: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and
the Netherlands. Additional Member States were added to the EU through five enlarge-
ments (see Annex: Timeline).

11. Croatia and Turkey are candidate countries and started accession negotiations in
October 2005. Croatia completed its accession negotiations on 30 June 2011 and is
expected to become the EU’s 28th Member State in July 2013. In December 2005, the
European Council granted the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia the status of a
candidate country. In December 2010 Montenegro and Iceland were also granted the
same status. Serbia formally submitted its application in December 2009. All the other
Western Balkan economies are potential candidates: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina
and Kosovo. The EU has repeatedly reaffirmed at the highest level its commitment to
eventual EU membership of the Western Balkan countries, provided they fulfill the ac-
cession criteria. There are several associative frameworks that extend EU relationships
throughout its geographic region. Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein are members
of the “European Economic Area” (EEA) and therefore have access to the EU single
market; however, they are not allowed to participate in the EU decision-making proc-
ess. Following a referendum in 1992, Switzerland rejected EEA membership; however it
enjoys privileged relations with the EU Internal Market through a number of bilateral
agreements. In addition, the EU has Association and/or Partnership and Cooperation
Agreements5 with many other countries, including through the Stabilisation and Asso-
ciation Process (SAP)6 and European Neighborhood Policy (ENP).7 These relationships
imply varying degrees of harmonization with the acquis communautaire. Whereas the
Stability and Association Processes explicitly include provisions for future member-
ship, the EU is not offering ENP countries/entities the possibility of membership, at
least for the time being. As is evident from the large number of associative relation-
ships, the sphere of influence of the EU’s institutions and of the acquis communautaire
extend far beyond the borders of current EU Member States.



C. THE ACQUIS COMMUNAUTAIRE

12. The entire body of EU laws is known collectively as the acquis communautaire (the
“acquis”). The term is most often used in connection with preparations by candidate



 5
     These agreements are signed bilaterally and each agreement sets forth a different set of objectives.
     Some agreements focus on economic dialogue, political dialogue, and/or trade liberalization, among
     other themes, while others are precursors to an accession treaty.
 6
     See http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/glossary/stabilisation_association_process_en.htm.
 7
     The European Neighborhood Policy applies to the EU’s immediate neighbors by land or sea, i.e. Algeria,
     Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Moldova, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, Ukraine,
     and West Bank & Gaza. Although Russia is also a neighbor of the EU, the EU’s relations with Russia are
     instead developed through a “Strategic Partnership.” See http://ec.europa.eu/world/enp/index_en.htm.


                                                                         "
                                           QXGTXKGY"QH"VJG"GWTQRGCP"WPKQP"                                 5
countries to join the EU. Within the context of EU accession, a country must meet certain
criteria, among which is the adoption of the acquis. All Member States must comply with
the acquis unless they have negotiated an opt-out. Although new Member States may
be granted transition periods for implementation, they will not be granted permanent
‘opt-outs’. For the enlargement negotiations with Croatia and Turkey, the acquis has been
divided into 33 chapters. Chapter 6 (Company Law) has greatest relevance to corporate
sector accounting and auditing; Chapters 2 (Freedom of Movement for Workers) and 3
(Right of Establishment and Freedom to Provide Services), Chapter 4 (Free Movement
of Capital), Chapter 8 (Competition Policy), and Chapter 9 (Financial Services) also have
some implications. When applying for membership, an applicant country will receive a
roadmap from the European Commission tracing its progress in adopting the acquis. Ac-
cession negotiations may be concluded even if the acquis has not been fully adopted, as
transitional measures may be introduced after accession. However, transposition periods
and specific transitional measures are rarely applied in the context of Chapter 6.

13. Each Association Agreement/Partnership and Cooperation Agreement sets out a
different agenda for approximation to parts of the acquis although generally there
are no deadlines. Association Agreements with Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus,
Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Moldova, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, Ukraine, and
West Bank & Gaza have entered into force. As the EU does not offer the incentive
of membership to these countries in exchange for aligning their legislation with the
acquis, ENP countries/entities may not be as keen on adapting to the acquis as acces-
sion countries. However, in return for progress on relevant reforms, ENP countries can
benefit from greater integration into European programmes and networks, increased
financial assistance and enhanced market access.

14. The acquis includes all primary legislation (Treaties), secondary legislation (regu-
lations, directives, decisions, recommendations, etc.) and case law (judgments of the
European Courts). As EU legislation is constantly changing (e.g., new directives are
enacted, regulations are amended), the acquis is not a static document, but one that is
in constant evolution.



    i. Main legislative instruments

15. Article 288 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union (TFEU) states
that “to exercise the Union’s competences, the institutions shall adopt regulations, di-
rectives, decisions, recommendations and opinions”. The ordinary legislative proce-
dure consists in the joint adoption of a regulation, a directive or a decision by the Eu-
ropean Parliament and the Council, on a proposal of the Commission (Art.289 TFEU)8:

•    Regulations are addressed to and directly applicable and binding in all EU Member
     States without the need for any national implementing legislation.9 Regulations
     are the type of legislation that most closely resemble a domestic statute and are
     used when uniformity is crucial.
•    Directives are binding with respect to the results to be achieved and the time
     limit within which the objectives must be reached; however, they leave to national


6      QXGTXKGY"QH"VJG"GWTQRGCP"WPKQP
       authorities the choice of form and means for achieving those results. Directives
       have to be transposed into national legislation in accordance with the procedures
       of the individual Member States and by a fixed date. The deadline for Member
       States to transpose a directive into national law is generally between 18 to 24
       months after its publication. Directives are the most frequently used instrument in
       relation with the establishment of the internal market (Art.50 TFEU).
•      Decisions are binding in all their aspects for those to whom they are addressed.
       Decisions do not require national implementing legislation. A decision may be ad-
       dressed to any or all Member States, to enterprises or to individuals.
•      Recommendations, opinions, interpretative communications, and Commission
       comments are non-binding and are considered “soft law.” Soft law can be defined
       as “rules of conduct, which in principle have no legally binding force but which
       nevertheless may have practical effects.”10 As such they promote good practice
       throughout the EU. Soft law is often the starting point for the “Communitarization”
       of a particular policy area, acting as the precursor to the development of hard law.11



     ii. Main legislative principles

16. A number of legislative principles govern the way the EU formulates and imple-
ments public policy, and how these policies affect the national legislation of individual
Member States. The first of these is the principle of subsidiarity, introduced by the
Maastricht Treaty. According to this principle, in areas which do not fall within its exclu-
sive competence, the EU may act only if and insofar as the objectives of the proposed
action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason
of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at EU level. This is
intended to ensure that decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizen in order
to avoid too much centralization of power. Other principles include the principle of
proportionality, which requires that any Community action should not go beyond what
is necessary to achieve the objectives of the treaty.

17. Before the Lisbon Treaty, EU legislative measures provided for the European
Commission to be assisted by committees in accordance with the “comitology decision”
(Decision of 28 June 1999 modified on 17 July 2006). The committees consist of repre-
sentatives from Member States and are chaired by the Commission. The Commission can
only adopt implementing measures if it obtains the approval by the Member States meet-
ing within the committee and absent objections from the European Parliament. Examples
include the Accounting Regulatory Committee and the Audit Regulatory Committee.



8
     Although the legal acts did not change, the Lisbon Treaty substantially modified the procedure to adopt
     these legal acts. Consolidated versions of the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the functioning
     of the European Union (OJ C115, 9.5.2008). See http://europa.eu/lisbon_treaty/full_text/index_en.htm
9
     However in practice national legislation often has to be changed or removed in order to comply with
     Regulations.

18. Since the Lisbon Treaty, a new legal framework has replaced the comitology. The
Treaty formally distinguishes between two kinds of comitology measures: delegated
acts (based on Art.290 TFEU) and implementing acts (based on Art.291 TFEU). Article
290 makes the Commission solely responsible for drafting and adopting delegated acts,
although the European Parliament and the Council have an ex-post right of control as
they can oppose or revoke the delegation.

19. Article 291 provides that where uniform conditions for implementing legally bind-
ing Union acts are needed, those acts shall confer implementing powers on the Com-
mission. The rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by
Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers have been laid
down by a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council of 16 February 2011
(EU/182/2011).12 Implementing acts will easily be identified since the Treaty requires
that the word ‘implementing’ be inserted in the title of these acts.

20. The new “examination procedure” confirms that, in order to prepare an implement-
ing act, the Commission shall be assisted by a committee composed of representatives
of the Member States where opinions will be delivered with a weighted majority. The
committee shall be chaired by a representative of the Commission who shall not take
part in the committee vote. If the committee does not reach a conclusion or when its
opinion is negative, the Regulation provides for a possible appeal mechanism by the
European Commission. Where a basic act is adopted under the ordinary legislative pro-
cedure, either the European Parliament or the Council may at any time indicate to the
Commission that, in its view, a draft implementing act exceeds the implementing pow-
ers provided for in the basic act. In such a case, the Commission shall review the draft
or withdraw the draft implementing act.



D. EU INSTITUTIONS & THE EU POLICY-MAKING PROCESS

       i. The primary EU Institutions 13

21. At the core of the EU there are seven main institutions, each playing a specific
role: the European Commission, the European Parliament, the European Council, the
Council of Ministers of the European Union, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors
and the European Central Bank. The European Commission (the “Commission”) is the
driving force and executive body of the EU, playing a central role in the European deci-
sion making process.14 As such, it is responsible for proposing new legislation to the



12
     Regulation EU/182/2011 of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning
     mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers.

     The Commission has five basic functions: the right and duty of initiating Community action and legisla-
     tion; the guardian of the Treaties; the responsibility for the implementation of Community decisions;
     the decision-making authority in the field of competition policy; and the external representation of the
     European Community. Op cit. Egenhofer, C, Kurpas, S, van Schaik, L. (2009)

European Parliament and Council. Additionally, it manages and implements the EU’s
policies and budget, “enforce[s] European law (jointly with the Court of Justice) [and]
… represent[s] the EU on the international stage, for example by negotiating agree-
ments between the EU and other countries.” 15 The Commission has 27 Commissioners
who are in charge of Directorates-General (DGs), or institutionalized policy areas. Each
DG and its staff are managed by a Director-General. The Directorates-General are bro-
ken down into policy sub-units called Directorates, which are further broken down into
more specific Units. The entire European Commission is meant to function above the
level of national interests.

22. In contrast to the supranational EU-level focus of the Commission, the European
Council and the Council of Ministers of the European Union (the “Council”) directly
represent the Member States. They consist respectively of Head of States or Govern-
ment16 and of Member States’ Ministers in different configurations depending on the
subjects under discussion. Each country has a number of votes in the Council broadly
reflecting the size of its population, but weighted in favor of smaller countries. The
Council shares with the European Parliament the responsibility for passing EU laws.17
Once the Commission issues a proposal, the Council is responsible for either approving
or rejecting the proposal. The Member States hold the Presidency of the Council on a
six-month rotational basis. The subject at hand in the Council determines which min-
isters from Member States attend a Council meeting. The Council is administered by a
General Secretariat which briefs the Presidency, helps prepare the agenda, and reports
on progress. The Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) is the Council’s
key committee, in which the permanent representatives of all EU Member States sit and
prepare the formal Council meetings by trying to secure political agreement among the
Member States.

23. The European Parliament’s Members are directly elected every five years and rep-
resent the citizens of the EU. There are 736 Members representing all 27 EU Member
States. The main function of Parliament is to pass European laws on the basis of propos-
als presented by the European Commission. Parliament shares this responsibility with
the Council of the European Union. Over time, the European Parliament’s role in approv-
ing legislation along with the Council has increased. Twenty standing committees exist
within Parliament. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) and the
Committee on Legal Affairs (IURI) share responsibilities for the regulation and supervi-
sion of financial services, institutions and markets including financial reporting, audit-
ing, accounting rules, corporate governance and other company law matters specifically

     The wording “European Council” refers solely to the meeting of the Heads of State and Government
     from the respective Member States. It has a permanent President and the President of the Commission
     also attends the meetings. The European Council provides the Union with the necessary impetus for
     its development and defines the general political directions and priorities thereof. It does not exercise
     legislative functions, which is the responsibility of the Council of the European Union. Further details on
     the different configurations of this institution can be found at: http://www.consilium.europa.eu/show-

concerning financial services. With regard to EU law-making procedures, the Parliament
is included in decisions via three processes described below in paragraphs 26 to 28.

24. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) ensures that EU laws are enforced by Member
States and are coherently interpreted and applied uniformly across the EU. In addition,
the ECJ plays a pivotal role of “referee” between the EU and its Member States, as well
as between the EU’s own institutions.

25. Over time and with the passing of successive treaty reforms, the distribution of
powers of these institutions has shifted, particularly as regards the Commission, the
Council and Parliament. Successive EU founding treaties set forth three main proce-
dures (described in paragraphs 26–28) under which these institutions make and/or im-
plement EU policy. A distinctive feature of each procedure is the degree of influence
of the Parliament. Consultation grants the least amount of influence to Parliament;
cooperation increases the powers of Parliament, and the ordinary legislative procedure
grants the most power to Parliament in the policy-making process.



       ii. The law-making process

26. The consultation procedure was the legislative procedure originally provided for
under the Treaty of Rome. It obliges the Council to consult the European Parliament
before voting on a Commission proposal. However, Parliament’s opinion is not binding
on the Council. Until 1987 this procedure applied to the harmonization of company and
accounting law. The Fourth and Seventh EU Company Law directives on annual and
consolidated accounts were adopted on the basis of this procedure.

27. The cooperation procedure was introduced by the SEA. It gives the European
Parliament greater influence in the legislative process, by allowing it two “readings.”
The scope of this procedure was considerably extended by the Maastricht Treaty (see
paragraph 5); however, the Treaty of Amsterdam (see paragraph 6) superseded most
uses of the cooperation procedure by introducing the co-decision procedure. Since
then, the cooperation procedure has applied exclusively to the field of economic and
monetary union.

28. The Treaty of Lisbon (see paragraph 9) further expanded the influence of the Eu-
ropean Parliament. The co-decision procedure, since renamed the “ordinary legislative
procedure”, places the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers on an equal
footing (i.e., no institution may adopt legislation without the other‘s assent and both
institutions have the power to reject legislation). The ordinary legislative procedure
allows legislative proposals to be adopted in one or two readings or after a conciliation
procedure.18 The ordinary legislative procedure to adopt regulations or directives is the
core legislative procedure for the purpose of EU law-making in the areas of company
law, including accounting and auditing.

       iii. EU Institutions primarily responsible for Corporate Sector Accounting
           and Auditing

29. The Directorate-General for Internal Market and Services is one of the 44 Directo-
rates-General and other specialized services which make up the European Commission
(see paragraph 21). Its main role is to coordinate the Commission’s policy on the Euro-
pean Single Market, which aims to ensure ever greater European market integration
and the free movement of people, goods, services and capital within the EU.19

30. In that context, DG Internal Market and Services is responsible for policies and reg-
ulations concerning financial services, company law, financial reporting, professional
qualifications, free movement of services, and freedom of establishment. In the field of
accounting, the work of the DG is directed at improving the quality, comparability and
transparency of the financial information provided by companies. In the field of statu-
tory audit, the DG’s work is directed towards improving the quality of statutory audit
throughout the EU. Another Directorate-General, DG Enterprise, also plays an impor-
tant role in enhancing the Internal Market by developing policies, laws and regulations
for specific industries.

31. The European Parliament (see paragraph 23) has two committees that address
the topics of company law, accounting and auditing, the Committee on Economic and
Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs.

A. BACKGROUND TO THE EU INTERNAL MARKET

32. One of the main objectives of the Treaty of Rome was the creation of a single com-
mon market, with free movement of goods, persons, services and capital, to accelerate
improvements in standards of living. Although a customs union was in force from 1 July
1968, the integration process had slowed considerably by the early 1980s. In order to
revive the effort to integrate the European market, the Commission adopted the White
Paper on the Completion of the Internal Market in June 1985. This paper set out an
ambitious program (the “Europe 1992” program) to create a truly effective internal
market by the end of 1992.

33. In 1987, the Single European Act introduced the notion of an “internal market” into
the existing Articles of the Treaty of Rome, now used interchangeably with the original
expression, “common market.” Although both concepts refer to market integration
and the elimination of all obstacles to intra-Community trade throughout the EU, the
“Internal Market” is seen as a more fully integrated evolution of the “common market”.
The Single European Act introduced a new provision (Article 95) that empowers the
Council to adopt, by a qualified majority vote, measures regarding the establishment
and functioning of the Internal Market. In addition, a new policy in the area of harmoni-
zation emerged, shifting the Commission’s previous aim of comprehensive harmoniza-
tion of laws, including in the area of company law, to a reduced approach, based on the
subsidiarity principle, focusing on the harmonization of only those laws and policies
deemed to be essential.

34. Although the “Europe 1992” project resulted in the adoption of most of the 282 In-
ternal Market directives from the 1985 White Paper by 1 January 1993, a number of
significant measures were still missing. In addition, serious problems existed with the
transposition of these directives within individual Member States. The Commission
therefore issued a 1996 communication on The Impact and Effectiveness of the Single
Market 20 to renew attention on the Internal Market project: it highlighted the gaps in
the current framework, the absence of competition in a number of sectors and the
continuing existence of barriers to trade resulting from a variety of national rules. It
underlined the need for concerted action in the areas of company law and financial
services. Since then, there has been significant progress in deepening the integration
of the Internal Market. In the run up to the 20th anniversary of the symbolic date of
1992, Professor Mario Monti was asked by the President of the Commission to prepare

a report containing options and recommendations for the future of the internal market.
Professor Monti’s report, A New Strategy for the Single Market, was tabled on 9 May
2010 and proposed a new set of initiatives to deliver a stronger single market in Europe.
Fifty proposals were selected by the Commission as priorities in its Communication
of October 2010 Towards a Single Market Act 21. Commissioner Michel Barnier and the
European Commission intend to keep the Single Market Act high on the political agenda
to ensure that these actions are implemented by the end of 2012. The following section
describes in more detail the EU’s strategies towards the internal market.



B. THE EU’S INTERNAL MARKET STRATEGIES

35. The EU has launched a number of strategies and action plans to move nearer to
completing the Internal Market. The European Commission followed up on its 1996
Communication with the European Council’s 1997 Action Plan for the Single Market.22
This action plan stressed the need (a) to promote greater competitiveness of Euro-
pean capital markets as a means for attracting trade and investment, as well as (b) to
make European companies more attractive in international capital markets. These two
goals would be achieved through greater harmonization of intra-EU legislation and by
harmonizing EU accounting rules with internationally accepted accounting standards.
Within the Commission’s subsequent 1999 Strategy for Europe’s Internal Market, four
strategic objectives were outlined:

•      to improve the quality of life of citizens,
•      to enhance the efficiency of Community product and capital markets,
•      to improve the business environment, and
•      to exploit the achievements of the Internal Market in a changing world.
•      These objectives continue to be valid today.

36. Each of these strategic objectives was accompanied by a number of operational
objectives, which were intended not only to contribute to the achievement of the Strat-
egy’s goals but also to act as a benchmark for the progress of the Strategy. Those
relevant to company law, including accounting and audit, are:

•      the Financial Services Action Plan (1999)23 followed by the Lamfalussy Report
       (2001)24 proposing institutional measures to accelerate the implementation of the
       FSAP’s objectives;
•      the Lisbon Strategy (2000)25;
•      the Winter Report (2002)26 followed by the Company Law Action Plan (2003)27;

•      the de Larosière report (February 2009)30 and
•      the Monti report (May 2010)31.

37. The corporate scandals and financial turbulence in the first decade of the century
reemphasized the importance of ensuring high-quality financial reporting and enforce-
ment through an updated Internal Market Strategy in the area of financial services.
A legislative package to strengthen financial supervision in Europe was approved in
September 2010, including the creation of a European System of Financial Supervi-
sors with three new European Supervisory Authorities. The approval of these proposals
changes substantially the framework of regulation for financial services in Europe. (See
paragraphs 47–48)

38. One priority of the Internal Market Strategy is the integration of services markets,
which is of particular relevance to corporate sector accounting and auditing. In the field
of services, there are still considerable differences between Member States in their
domestic legislation, which is a barrier to the free movement of services. This barrier
affects all stages of the business process and can deter companies from operating in
other Member States.

39. The European Commission’s first report on the implementation of the Internal
Market Strategy Priorities for 2003–2006 found that too many European industries,
including accounting services, still operated in fragmented markets due to barriers to
trade and differences in standards and regulations. Fragmented markets hamper inno-
vation and productivity growth and keep prices in some parts of the EU at higher levels
than they would be in a more integrated Internal Market. Although the Internal Market
has boosted EU economic growth and created jobs over the past ten years, much still
needs to be done to build on that success. The European Commission’s second report
on the implementation of the Internal Market Strategy 2003–200632 pointed to the
need for a stronger focus on completing the legal framework of the Internal Market,
ensuring greater coherence with other EU policies and also on making the legal frame-
work of the Internal Market more consistent with the global economic framework.

40. The market turmoil that began in mid-2007 re-emphasized the need to continue to
improve framework conditions for businesses, particularly for small- and medium-sized
businesses, which, in contrast to large companies, often find the single market frag-
mented and difficult to penetrate. In its 2009 Annual Management Plan33 DG internal
Market and Services outlined its general and operational objectives.

These include:
•   Facilitating the free movement of qualified professionals inside the EU;
•   Contributing to the competitiveness of EU business by developing an efficient EU
    company law framework;
•   Ensuring the comparability and transparency of listed company accounts through-
    out the EU and in third countries, notably by ensuring that international standards
    are prepared by an organization with good governance and due process, as well as
    with sufficient EU input;
•   Working towards simplifying accounts for small- and medium-sized enterprises;
•   Improving audit quality and the structure of the audit market in order to ensure a
    high level of confidence in company reporting; and
•   Ensuring the correct implementation and effective enforcement of EU rules on
    company law, free movement of capital and statutory audit by all Member States
    in order to ensure transparent company reporting and to uphold shareholders‘
    rights.



C. THE FINANCIAL SERVICES ACTION PLAN (FSAP)

41. One of the key operational objectives to be achieved by the Strategy for Europe’s
Internal Market was the implementation of the Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP).
EU policymakers viewed the integration of financial services as crucial following the
introduction of the single currency, as the financial sector acted as “the motor for
[economic] growth and job creation.”

42. The FSAP contained some 40 measures aimed at achieving an integrated market
for financial services in the EU. It set out indicative priorities and a timetable for spe-
cific measures to achieve three strategic objectives:

•   establishing a single market in wholesale financial services;
•   making retail markets open and secure; and
•   strengthening the rules on prudential supervision.

43. After the regulatory aspects of the FSAP had been carried out, the Commission
concluded that the EU financial services industry (banking, insurance, securities, asset
management) still had strong untapped economic and employment growth potential.
It issued a White Paper in December 2005, entitled “Financial Services Policy 2005–
2010” detailing the subsequent implementation phase of the FSAP. The policy explored
the best ways to deliver further benefits of financial integration to industry and con-
sumers alike. Priorities included consolidating progress, ensuring sound implementa-
tion and enforcement of existing rules; driving through better regulation principles into
all policy making; enhancing supervisory convergence; creating more competition be-
tween service providers and expanding the EU‘s external influence in globalizing capital
markets.

44. A number of other EU initiatives complement the FSAP. In 2000, the European
Council reaffirmed the need to achieve Community financial market integration, calling


                                                                        "
                                                     VJG"KPVGTPCN"OCTMGV"              35
for the acceleration and completion of the FSAP by 2005 in the context of increasing
Europe’s global competitiveness through the Lisbon Agenda (see Box 1: The Lisbon
Agenda).34

45. These initiatives included the 2002 Winter Report, which recommended a modern
regulatory framework in the EU for company law, the Company Law Action Plan (CLAP)
of 2003 (see paragraph 52), and the Commission’s Communication, Internal Market
Strategy-Priorities 2003–2006. This Communication drew upon previous Internal Mar-
ket Strategies and aimed at strengthening the Internal Market in the light of the EU’s
enlargement. Of the numerous goals that this Communication prioritized, the two most
urgent were the implementation of outstanding FSAP legislation and the development
and implementation of “better governance.” Following the global accounting scandals
which occurred during and after 2000, these priorities were revised to the following:
(a) completing the legislative reforms as laid out in the FSAP in 1999, (b) improving
corporate governance and (c) harmonizing company law.


     Box 1: The Lisbon Agenda
     The European Council met in Lisbon, Portugal in March 2000, to discuss the
     achievements of the EU since the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992.
     In particular, the Council addressed the need for more rapid economic de-
     velopment in light of increasing globalization and the spread of informa-
     tion technology. Following the Lisbon meeting, the Council issued the Lisbon
     Agenda, which comprised a ten-year strategy (2000–2010) for transforming
     Europe into the world’s leading knowledge economy. The Agenda addressed
     a broad range of issues, including the Internal Market and Financial Serv-
     ices. The Lisbon Agenda called for lowering regulatory costs and remov-
     ing barriers to cross-border trade in services within the Internal Market.
     It also called for full integration of financial services and capital markets.

     The Lisbon Agenda was reviewed by a High Level Group in 2004 in a report
     commonly referred to as the Kok Report1, and a White Paper was published in
     May 2005 outlining Financial Services Policy for 2005–2010.1 As most FSAP
     legislation had been adopted by this point, the guidelines of this updated finan-
     cial services policy focused on the “dynamic consolidation” of this legislation.


46. A difficult problem in EU law-making results from the length of the procedures
involved, especially when directives have to be transposed into national legislation.
This seemed to be especially harmful in the areas covered by the Financial Services




34
     See http://ec.europa.eu/growthandjobs/pdf/lisbon_en.pdf.
35
     These bodies currently include the Accounting Regulatory Committee (ARC), the European Securities
     Committee (ESC), the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR), the European Banking
     Committee (EBC), the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS), the European Insurance
     and Occupational Pension Committee (EIOPC), the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational
     Pensions Supervisors (CEIOPS), the Audit Regulatory Committee (AuRC) and the European Group of
     Auditors‘ Oversight Bodies (EGAOB).

Action Plan. In 2001, a Committee of Wise Men on the Regulation of European Securi-
ties Markets produced the Lamfalussy Report. This report set out a transparent proc-
ess of policymaking and laid down a regulatory approach involving different levels of
measures and bodies in what has come to be known as the Lamfalussy Process.35 The
first level involves using the codecision process with the Council and Parliament to
arrive at agreement on the broad principles contained in the legislation. The second
level subsequently enhances the broad principles by adding measures for the actu-
al implementation of the first level legislation. These first two levels aim to promote
greater transparency in the overall legislative process as well as greater consultation
with stakeholders in the process. The next two levels of the Lamfalussy Process, Levels
3 and 4, are respectively the coordination of Member States’ implementation efforts in
an advisory capacity and the proper enforcement of the Lamfalussy measures across
the EU. The Lamfalussy Process overall has been praised for leading to quicker political
agreement on financial markets legislation. Most notably, the process has been cred-
ited with contributing to the timely delivery of the Market Abuse Directive (2002), the
Prospectus Directive (2003), the Market in Financial Instruments Directive (2004), and
the Transparency Directive (2004).36

47. Following the review of the Lamfalussy Process carried out in 2007 by the Commis-
sion, the Inter-Institutional Monitoring Group and the Council, the Commission initiated
a range of actions with a view to strengthening the Lamfalussy Process, and in particu-
lar, improving cooperation between national supervisors and convergence in their prac-
tices. These included, amongst others, a review of national supervisory and sanctioning
powers, of voluntary delegation of tasks, of provisions on supervisory cooperation and
exchange of information and of consistency of terminology in EU financial services di-
rectives. However, the financial turmoil in 2007-2009 revealed some weaknesses in the
system and demonstrated the need to strengthen existing mechanisms and institutions
in order to better deal with cross-border and systemic issues. In particular, regulatory
responses were needed to prevent repetition of major financial systemic crises. The
foundations of the new structure were defined in a report prepared under the leader-
ship of Jacques de Larosière, a former head of the IMF, and issued in February 2009.37

48. The report presented an analysis of the financial crisis, using this to draw up its
recommendations for regulatory changes. The de Larosière group put forward 18 de-
tailed recommendations, including developing common rules for investment funds
across all 27 EU countries, capping bankers’ bonuses in line with shareholder inter-
ests and establishing a crisis management system for the EU‘s financial sector. The
key principles of the de Larosière report were endorsed by the Commission and led
to the comprehensive reform of financial regulation and supervision. The new system
includes a supervisory system that combines much stronger oversight at EU level,
whilst maintaining a clear role for national supervisors. Furthermore, an early warning

new European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB, the early warning body) and the European
System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS) started operating on 1 January 2011.38 The ESFS,
composed of national supervisors and the three new European supervisory authorities:
the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pen-
sions Authority (EIOPA), and European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) have
stronger powers than the committees (CEBS, CEIOPS and CESR) that they replaced.



D. COMPANY LAW HARMONIZATION

49. Although the Treaty of Rome established the European Community in 1958, sig-
nificant disparities between Member States’ company law systems remained until
the 1970s. These disparities hampered the deepening of the Internal Market as, for
example, corporate board structures and accounting practices differed greatly between
Member States. Therefore, a number of Member States actively insisted that the grant
of the right of establishment to companies from all Member States be counterbalanced
by at least some degree of harmonization of national company laws. One key objec-
tive of company law harmonization was to avoid regulatory arbitrage, whereby com-
panies could choose to incorporate in a Member State with lax company laws and then
establish themselves in other Member States. Two further objectives were to facilitate
the freedom of establishment of companies and to guarantee legal certainty in intra-
Community operations.

50. European company law harmonization was also seen as an integral part of an
industrial policy to make European companies more competitive. Directives and regula-
tions had to provide European companies with instruments and rules to facilitate cross-
border mergers and cooperation to allow them to trade and restructure at a European
level.39 Policymakers also realized the need for specific action to harmonize financial
reporting and financial disclosure practices throughout the EU. These measures were
seen as necessary to make company financial information comparable and equiva-
lent in order to protect creditors and other third parties. Harmonization was achieved
through a series of EU Company Law Directives: the Fourth Company Law Directive
on annual accounts of companies with limited liability (1978); the Seventh Company
Law Directive on consolidated accounts of companies with limited liability (1983); the
Eighth Company Law Directive on the approval of persons responsible for carrying out
the statutory audits of accounting documents (1984); the Banking Accounts Directive
(1986); and the Insurance Accounts Directive (1991). These directives are discussed in
greater detail in Section III of this guide.

     Financial Supervision and the three Authorities are published in the Official Journal of the EU L.311 of
     15 December 2010
39
     The Third Directive (1978) on mergers and the Sixth Directive (1982) on divisions, as well as the Directive
     on cross-border mergers (2005) and the Regulations on the Statute for a European Company (2001) and
     on the European Economic Interest Grouping (1985) fall within this category.

51. As one of its main objectives, the FSAP called for an EU-wide review of financial
reporting. It reiterated the importance of comparable, transparent, and reliable finan-
cial information for efficient and integrated financial markets. In particular, the FSAP
highlighted the need for debate on how this objective could be aligned with interna-
tional best practices, which in the Commission’s view included International Account-
ing Standards (IAS). In 2002, a regulation requiring publicly-traded entities to prepare
their consolidated accounts in accordance with IAS was issued (see paragraph 105).40

52. As discussed in paragraph 45, the Commission published the Winter Report in 2002
which underlined the need for immediate action on improving the EU framework for
corporate governance. This led to the Commission’s communication on Company Law
and Corporate Governance in 2003. The European Commission then held a consulta-
tion on this communication, Modernizing Company Law and Enhancing Corporate Gov-
ernance in the European Union: A Plan to Move Forward. The Plan, known as the Com-
pany Law Action Plan (CLAP), adopted on 21 May 2003, proposed a set of initiatives
aimed at strengthening shareholders’ rights, reinforcing protection for employees and
creditors, and increasing the efficiency and competitiveness of European business. It
also detailed a series of corporate governance initiatives aimed at boosting confidence
in capital markets. The CLAP was based on a comprehensive set of proposals, grouped
in six chapters: corporate governance; capital maintenance and alteration; groups and
pyramids; corporate restructuring and mobility; the European Private Company; and
cooperatives and other forms of enterprises. It led to the adoption of two recommen-
dations and a directive amending the Fourth and Seventh EU Company Law Directives
(see Box 2: Measures adopted in June 2006 (DIR 2006/46/EU) based on measures pro-
posed in the CLAP). These recommendations and the directive are discussed in greater
detail in Section III of this guide.

53. The Treaty of Rome set out conditions to coordinate Member States’ economic poli-
cies and bring about the completion of the Internal Market, based on the principle of an
open market economy with free competition. Although the Treaty in its original form
did not mention the harmonization of accounting and auditing in the EU, such harmo-
nization became more important as efforts to complete the Internal Market proceeded
and, especially, once the harmonization of company law became an issue. The many
differences between national systems of accounting, auditing and company law were
perceived to hinder trade and the movement of capital within the EU. Thus, the harmo-
nization of accounting and auditing across the EU became a means by which greater
transparency and comparability of financial reporting could facilitate freer trade and
movement of capital across Member States (see Box 3: Examples of the Reasons for
Harmonization). This section summarizes those parts of the acquis communautaire
which relate to accounting, financial reporting, and auditing.

A. ACCOUNTING: THE ACQUIS COMMUNAUTAIRE AS IT
   APPLIES TO CORPORATE SECTOR ACCOUNTING

54. Two directives form the core of the acquis communautaire on corporate sector
financial reporting: the Fourth EU Company Law Directive (1978)42 (“the Fourth Direc-

tive”) which covers annual accounts43 of companies, and the Seventh EU Company Law Di-
rective (1983)44 on consolidated accounts (“the Seventh Directive”). In adopting these two
directives, the EU was attempting to harmonize accounting. However, the directives include
dozens of provisions that begin with expressions such as “Member States may permit or
require […].” Given this flexibility, the resulting harmonization achieved within the EU was
not complete. This might be explained, to some extent, by the differences in the “purposes
of various national accounting systems in the EU. They include the differences between
creditor orientation in the traditional Franco-German systems and investor orientation in
the Anglo-Dutch systems; between law/tax-based rules and private sector standards.” 45

55. Two additional directives were issued to cover the specific nature of the banking
and insurance sectors; the Banking Accounts Directive of 1986,46 and the Insurance
Accounts Directive of 1991.47 Taken together, these four directives are the fundamental
pillars of the acquis communautaire on corporate sector accounting. They did much
to harmonize national legislation with respect to the obligation to prepare annual and
consolidated accounts, as well as the audit and publication of accounts.

56. However, EU policy-makers recognized in the mid 1990’s that greater harmoniza-
tion of financial reporting was needed for EU capital markets to function efficiently
in an increasingly globalized world. This led to amendments to these directives and
the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and the
Council of July 19, 2002 on the application of International Accounting Standards (now
IFRS). Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 required all companies whose securities are ad-
mitted to trading on a regulated market of any Member State (hereafter referred to as
‘publicly-traded companies’) to present their consolidated accounts in accordance with
endorsed IFRS from 2005. The key legislation is summarized below.

     A Member State may exempt companies which are not profit making from the Fourth and Seventh Direc-
     tive requirements as a consequence of the definition of companies or firms as outlined in Article 48 of
     the Treaty establishing the European Community. It states that ‘companies or firms’ comprise compa-
     nies or firms constituted under civil or commercial law, including cooperative societies, and other legal
     persons governed by public or private law, save for those which are not-for-profit. So far, Luxembourg,
     Ireland, and Greece appear to be the only Member States to have taken advantage of this exemption.

and principles for the preparation, presentation and publication of annual accounts by
limited liability companies. Furthermore, the Fourth Directive forms the basis for the
Seventh Directive (on consolidated accounts) and the two sector-specific directives,
the Bank and Insurance Accounts directives.

58. The Fourth Directive covers the annual accounts of limited liability companies.
Article 1 sets out the types of companies in each Member State, which fall under the
scope of the directive (e.g., in the United Kingdom: public companies limited by shares
or by guarantee, private companies limited by shares or by guarantee, partnerships,
limited partnerships, unlimited companies).

59. Annual accounts under the Fourth Directive must include a balance sheet, a profit
and loss account, and notes on the accounts. The directive does not require a cash flow
statement or a statement of changes in equity. However, Directive 2003/51/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2003 introduced the following pro-
vision within Article 2 of the Fourth Directive: “Member States may permit or require
the inclusion of other statements in the annual accounts.”

60. The Fourth Directive states that the objective of the annual accounts is to provide
a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of the company. This
would normally be obtained by applying the provisions of the directive. However, in
exceptional cases the directive requires a departure from the provisions of the direc-
tives if that is needed to provide a true and fair view. This so-called “true and fair view
override” has been extensively discussed and remains a heavily-debated topic in the
context of international accounting standard setting.49

61. One of the amendments to the Fourth Directive (Directive 2006/46/EC), which came
into effect in September 2008, requires the members of the administrative, manage-
ment and supervisory bodies of the company to be collectively responsible at least
to the company for the annual accounts, the annual report and, when required, the
corporate governance statement. This amendment introduced into legislation a recom-
mendation made in the Winter Report (see paragraph 52).

62. The directive contains relatively prudent recognition and measurement principles
(referred to as “valuation rules” in the directives).50 Moreover, some recognition and
measurement options allow Member States to closely align financial reporting require-
ments with tax accounting.51

63. This may be explained by the fact that “in most continental European countries



49
     For example, refer to Alexander, D. (1993), A European true and fair view?, European Accounting Review,
     Vol. 2, No. 1.
50
     It should be noted that the Directive includes very few recognition principles. For example, the principles
     governing the recognition of the revenue from the sale of goods or the rendering of services are only
     briefly set out.

     tion of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), World Bank, Washington, USA.


42        CEEQWPVKPI"CPF"CWFKVKPI"KP"VJG"CESWKU"EQOOWPCWVCKTG
[…], the traditional paucity of ‘outside’ shareholders has meant that external financial
reporting has largely been invented for the purposes of protecting creditors and for
governments, as tax collectors or controllers of the economy. […] It also seems likely
that the greater importance of creditors in these countries leads to more careful (pru-
dent, conservative) accounting.” 52

64. With the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 and the subsequent endorse-
ment of individual IFRS,53 new recognition and measurement principles became part of
the acquis communautaire, in particular measurement at fair value. Some of the Fourth
and Seventh Directives’ prudent recognition and measurement principles needed to be
modified to enable the use of fair value in certain circumstances. Therefore, the Fourth
and Seventh directives were amended in 2001 and 2003 to allow the use of fair value
and to pave the way for the endorsement of IFRS. As a consequence, the Fourth Direc-
tive currently includes a broad range of measurement options. In particular Section 7a
provides for specific rules related to valuation at fair value of financial instruments,
including derivatives. The directive defines how fair value will be determined, whether
changes in fair value will be included in the income statement or directly in equity, and
what information needs to be disclosed in the notes.

65. The Fourth Directive sets out standardized formats for the lay-out of the balance
sheet and the profit and loss accounts. The Fourth Directive also defines the minimum
contents of the notes to the annual accounts and the format of the annual manage-
ment report. However, it does not impose a uniform chart of accounts as exists, for
example, in Belgium, France or Spain.

66. Directive 2006/46/EC amending the Fourth Directive, which came into effect in Sep-
tember 2008, requires companies to disclose off-balance-sheet arrangements and related-
party transactions in the notes to the annual accounts. Moreover, publicly-traded compa-
nies now have to issue a corporate governance statement in their annual management
report or in a separate report published together with the annual report (Article 46a).

Exemptions for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs)
67. As discussed above, the Fourth Directive applies to all limited liability companies.
However, the directive provides Member States with several options to ease the finan-
cial reporting burden on small and medium-sized companies, as defined in Articles 11
and 27 of the Fourth Directive, i.e.:

•      Definition of Small Companies: Small-sized companies may not exceed two of
       the following three thresholds for two consecutive years: (a) balance-sheet total:
       € 4,400,000; (b) net turnover: € 8,800,000; (c) number of employees: 50. Mem-
       ber States may set lower thresholds.



52
     Christoper Nobes, Robert Parker (2004), op. cit., p. 23.
53
     To be adopted for application in the EU a standard must meet the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regu-
     lation (EC) No 1606/2002: Its application must result in a true and fair view of the financial position and
     performance of an enterprise; it must be conducive to the European public good; and it must meet basic
     criteria as to the quality of information required for financial statements to be useful to users.


     CEEQWPVKPI"CPF"CWFKVKPI"KP"VJG"CESWKU"EQOOWPCWVCKTG                                                    43
•      Definition of Medium-sized Companies: Medium-sized companies may not exceed
       two of the following three thresholds for two consecutive years: (a) balance-sheet
       total: € 17,500,000; (b) net turnover: € 35,000,000; (c) number of employees:
       250. Member States may set lower thresholds.
•      The values of the monetary thresholds are regularly increased to take into account
       monetary and economic developments.54

68. Member States have the possibility of allowing small companies to draw up abridged
accounts and notes to the accounts, and to exempt small companies from the require-
ment for a statutory audit and from drawing up an annual report. Member States can
also allow medium-sized companies to adopt different layouts for the profit and loss
account, to prepare aggregate balance sheet information, not to draw up consolidated
accounts, and to leave out non-financial information from the annual report. However,
consistent with the EU’s overarching objective of protecting investors, the exemptions
available to small and medium-sized companies do not apply to publicly-traded SMEs.

69. There are large differences between Member States regarding how these thresholds
are set. These reflect differences in policymakers’ priorities which may be explained by:

•      Concerns about the potential inclusion of “public interest” companies: some Member
       States are concerned that accepting the thresholds set out in the directive may re-
       sult in including fairly large companies, where full financial information is of interest
       to financial institutions, public and private shareholders and to the public in general.
•      Concerns about the impact on SME financial management practices: some Mem-
       ber States are concerned that the relief options may affect SMEs’ financial man-
       agement practices and, indirectly, the processes of tax collection by Governments.
•      The perception by some Member States that follow the directive’s thresholds for
       defining SMEs that higher thresholds are a key way of limiting the administrative
       burdens on companies.

70. The most commonly implemented options appear to be in relation to publication of
an abridged balance sheet and the profit and loss statement. Exempting small compa-
nies from statutory audit is implemented in most Member States although only a mi-
nority of Member States has adopted the maximum thresholds allowed by the Directive
(e.g., Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom).

71. More recently, in order to reduce the administrative burdens on micro-entities, the
European Commission has proposed allowing Member States to exempt them from
the application of the accounting directives.55 Micro-entities would be companies not
exceeding two of the following three thresholds for two consecutive years: (a) balance-
sheet total: € 500,000; (b) net turnover: € 1,000,000; (c) number of employees: 10.
Applying the general principle of subsidiarity, these micro-entities would then be
submitted to the regulatory regime defined at national level. The European Parliament
has approved the proposal but the Council has so far not done so.


54
     The latest such amendment dates to June 14, 2006, with the adoption of Directive 2006/46/EC.

Publication and Statutory Audit
72. The Fourth Directive requires limited liability companies to publish their annual
accounts, annual report, and the statutory auditor’s report by filing them with a com-
mercial register (e.g. Companies House in the United Kingdom). The publication of the
accounting documents follows the mechanisms set out in the First EU Company Law
Directive (the “First Directive”). The First Directive requires Member States to provide
for appropriate penalties in the case of failure to disclose these accounting documents.
It also requires Member States to make these accounting documents available in elec-
tronic form from 1 January 2007.

73. The scope of statutory audit also derives from the Fourth Directive, which requires
that, except for the exemptions available for small companies, annual accounts of all
limited liability companies be audited by an approved statutory auditor. Statutory au-
ditors are also required to express an opinion concerning the consistency of the an-
nual report with the annual accounts. The Fourth Directive defines the types of audit
opinions and the structure of the audit reports. A comprehensive regime applicable to
statutory auditors is defined by Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and
of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated
accounts, amending Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC and repealing
Council Directive 84/253/EEC (the “new Eighth Directive”, see paragraph 121).

Recent Amendments to the Fourth Directive
74. The most recent amendment to the Fourth Directive in 2009 aimed at alleviating
administrative burdens on smaller companies. Directive 2009/49/EC slightly reduced
the disclosure requirements on these companies.56 However, the European Commission
plans to carry out a more fundamental overhaul of the directive. It has carried out a
public consultation on reviewing the accounting directives with the aims of reducing
the administrative burden on small enterprises (“think small first”) as well as making
qualitative improvements for all enterprises in the scope of the directives. An additional
objective is to increase the clarity of the text for lawmakers and users in general.57



     b. The Seventh EU Company Law Directive (the “Seventh Directive”)

Scope and objective
75. The Seventh Directive lays down rules and principles for the preparation, presen-
tation and publication of consolidated accounts and a consolidated annual report by
groups of “undertakings” (this term includes companies and other entities).

76. Consolidated accounts under the Seventh Directive must include a consolidated
balance sheet, a consolidated profit and loss account, and notes on the consolidated
accounts. The directive does not require a consolidated cash flow statement or a con-
solidated statement of changes in equity. However, Directive 2003/51/EC of the Euro-
pean Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2003 introduced the following provision

within Article 16 of the Seventh Directive: “Member States may permit or require the
inclusion of other statements in the consolidated accounts.”

77. The Seventh Directive states that the objective of the consolidated accounts is to
provide a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of the group
of undertakings, which would normally be obtained by applying the provisions of the
directive. However, in exceptional cases the directive requires a departure from the
provisions of the directive if that is needed to provide a true and fair view.

78. One of the amendments to the Fourth Directive of June 2006 (Directive 2006/46/
EC), which came into effect in September 2008, requires the members of the adminis-
trative, management and supervisory bodies of the company to be collectively respon-
sible at least to the company for the consolidated accounts, the consolidated report
and, when required, the corporate governance statement.

Recognition and Measurement Principles
79. Recognition and measurement principles (referred to as “valuation rules” in the
directives) in the Seventh Directive are defined by reference to the Fourth Directive.
The assets and liabilities of undertakings must be recognized and measured in accord-
ance with the Fourth Directive (Article 29). As mentioned in paragraph 64, these rela-
tively prudent principles were amended in 2001 and 2003 to allow the use of fair value
and to pave the way for the endorsement of IFRS.

80. A parent undertaking is required to prepare consolidated accounts if it has legal or
economic control over subsidiary undertakings (wherever they are established). The
detailed criteria for determining legal or economic control are very similar to the con-
solidation criteria of IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements. If the
parent undertaking is itself a limited liability company, it has to prepare both annual
accounts and consolidated accounts.

81. The Seventh Directive requires full consolidation of all subsidiaries in the consoli-
dated financial accounts by eliminating intra-group transactions and intra-group prof-
its. However, Member States may allow exclusions from consolidation in cases where
IFRS requires the subsidiary to be consolidated.

Presentation
82. The Seventh Directive requires the same standardized formats for the lay-out of
the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated profit and loss statement as the
Fourth Directive. The Seventh Directive further sets out a number of essential adjust-
ments resulting from the particular characteristics of consolidated accounts as com-
pared with annual accounts (e.g. minority interests). The Seventh Directive also defines
the minimum contents of the notes to the consolidated accounts and the format of
the consolidated annual report. The notes must include specific information about the
subsidiary undertakings included in the consolidation, such as their registered office
and the proportion of the capital held by the parent undertaking.

83. One of the amendments to the Seventh Directive of June 2006 (Directive 2006/46/EC)
requires companies to disclose off-balance-sheet arrangements and related-party transac-
tions in the notes to the consolidated accounts. Moreover, publicly-traded companies will
have to issue a corporate governance statement in their annual management report.

Exemptions and Simplifications for Small and Medium-sized Groups
84. The Seventh Directive includes a number of possible exemptions and simplifica-
tions that Member States may decide to implement in their national law:

•      Small groups may be fully exempted from preparing consolidated accounts if two
       of their consolidated thresholds (i.e., consolidated balance sheet, net turnover,
       and number of employees in the group) do not exceed the criteria applicable to
       medium-sized companies (see paragraph 67). However, consistent with the EU’s
       overarching objective of protecting investors, the exemptions available to small
       and medium-sized groups do not apply to publicly-traded groups.
•      Member States may exempt sub-groups of companies from preparing separate
       consolidated accounts if they are part of a larger group preparing and publishing
       audited consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Directive or in an
       equivalent manner, if the parent company is not established in the EU.

Publication and Statutory Audit
85. The publication requirements are identical to the Fourth Directive (see paragraph
72). However, contrary to the Fourth Directive, when consolidated accounts are required
by the Seventh Directive, they must be subject to a statutory audit, i.e. no exemption
from statutory audit applies.58

Recent Amendments to the Seventh Directive
86. In June 2006, the European Parliament and the Council adopted a directive amend-
ing the Fourth and Seventh Company Law Directives, which Member States had until
September 2008 to transpose into national law.59 The main points contained in this
directive were discussed in paragraphs 66 and 83 above. The most recent amendment
in 2009 (Directive 2009/49/EC) aimed at alleviating administrative burdens on smaller
companies by slightly reducing the disclosure requirements.



     c. Directive on the Annual Accounts of Banks and other Financial Institutions
     (The “Bank Accounts Directive”)

87. The Fourth and Seventh Directives acknowledged the special nature of the activi-
ties of banks and other financial institutions (hereafter referred to as “banks”) and of
insurance undertakings by allowing Member States not to bring those bodies within the



58
     The Seventh Directive requires that consolidated accounts when required under the Directive, be au-
     dited. However, where a small or medium-sized group elects to prepare consolidated accounts, although
     it is not required to under the Directive (e.g., to provide additional information about the group’s per-
     formance to its shareholders), there is no statutory requirement that these accounts be audited.

scope of the directives when implementing them. The gap in respect of banks was filled
by the Bank Accounts Directive, and the gap in respect of insurance undertakings was
filled by the Insurance Accounts Directive.

88. The Bank Accounts Directive (86/635/EEC)60 applies to the annual and consoli-
dated accounts of banks established in the EU regardless of their legal form (but not
to branches, see paragraph 101). The Bank Accounts Directive covers the same areas
as the Fourth and Seventh Directives and most of its general provisions are to be read
across directly from them. Apart from applying these read-across provisions to banks,
the directive sets out specific formats for the balance sheet and for profit and loss
statements; it determines what items should be included under each statement head-
ing; it requires a number of additional disclosures in the notes to the accounts; it estab-
lishes specific measurement principles; and it adapts the consolidation requirements
set out in the Seventh Directive.

89. The provisions set out in the directive contain a number of options for Member
States:

•      “Hidden reserves”: Member States have the option to allow banks to understate
       by up to 4 per cent the value of certain assets (e.g., loans and advances). The
       principal arguments for the maintenance of these “hidden reserves” — which had
       been widely used in the past — related to the importance of maintaining confi-
       dence and thus stability in financial markets and the consequent need to smooth
       out the fluctuation in profits from year to year inherent in the banking business.
       The principal arguments against the maintenance of “hidden reserves” were that
       they limited the usefulness of the profit figure in the accounts as an indicator of
       performance and that their existence is inconsistent with the need for creditors
       and shareholders to be in a position to make informed assessments of a bank’s
       financial strength, its short-term performance and long-term trends.
•      Fund for general banking risks: if the “hidden reserves” option is permitted but
       not exercised, Member States have the option to permit banks to create a fund
       for general banking risks; if “hidden reserves” are not permitted, the directive
       requires that banks be permitted to create such a fund. The fund is intended as
       a means of allowing banks to set aside amounts required to cover ”the particular
       risks associated with banking” and is disclosed as a balance sheet liability.
•      Foreign currency translation: the general rule was that assets and liabilities should
       be translated at the spot rate at the balance sheet date. Member States may, how-
       ever, require or permit assets held as non-monetary assets to be translated at the
       rates ruling on the dates of their acquisition. Outstanding forward and spot ex-
       change transactions should be translated at the spot rates of exchange ruling on
       the balance sheet date. However, Member States may require forward transactions
       to be translated at the forward rate ruling on the balance sheet date. The directive
       also included a number of other options regarding foreign exchange translation.

90. There is some doubt as to whether the application of the specific recognition and
measurement possibilities of the Bank Accounts Directive provides a true and fair view
of the financial position and performance of banks. Also, the many options available
to Member States hinder comparability within the EU. At the time of the adoption of
the directive, the more important policy prerogative appeared to be maintaining public
trust in the stability of the banking sector by allowing income smoothing and the crea-
tion of reserves. The requirement to apply endorsed IFRS changed this drastically for
publicly-traded banks, which prepare consolidated accounts (see paragraph 105).

91. After IFRS became mandatory for the consolidated accounts of publicly-traded
banks, the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (which became the European
Banking Authority – EBA – in January 2011) issued guidance on a standardized financial
reporting framework for banks based on IFRS (FINREP).61 This framework should en-
able banks to use the same standardized data formats and data definitions for financial
reporting in all countries where the framework will be applied. This is intended to re-
duce the reporting burden for banks that have cross-border operations, and to reduce
the barriers to the development of an efficient internal market in financial services.
CEBS published a revised version of its guidelines on 15 December 2009. Changes in
IFRS which have been endorsed by the European Commission have been incorporated
into the revised FINREP. Further major changes to the accounting standards governing
banks are expected and FINREP will be revised in due course to take account of the
changes that may arise in IAS 39 (IFRS 9), as well as IAS 1.

92. CEBS also published Guidelines on Common Reporting (COREP).62 These guidelines
are intended to be used by banks when preparing prudential reports to be sent to
any EU Supervisory Authority according to the new capital framework established in
the Capital Requirements Directive, which implements the revised international capital
framework (Basel II) in the EU. This international regulatory framework is itself being
reviewed in the wake of the international financial crisis (“Basel III”) and the EBA, as
CEBS successor, will amend the COREP guidelines once these changes are implement-
ed in the EU.



     d. Insurance Undertakings Directive (the “Insurance Accounts Directive”) 63

93. The Insurance Accounts Directive (91/674/EEC)64 draws on a large number of the
provisions in the Fourth and Seventh directives which had not, until then, applied to
insurance undertakings. Notwithstanding a few exceptions (e.g. undertakings which are
not companies within the meaning of Article 58 of the Treaty and certain bodies or
mutual associations), the directive applies to undertakings engaged in life, non-life or
reinsurance business.

94. The directive requires insurance undertakings to prepare accounts comprising a
balance sheet, a profit and loss account, and notes. The directive requires that the ac-
counts be prepared in accordance with its detailed provisions and, by referring to the
Fourth and Seventh Directives, requires that individual and consolidated accounts give
a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of insurance undertak-
ings. This had not been required for insurance undertakings throughout the EU prior
to the directive.

95. The differences from the requirements which are imposed on companies in general
(through the Fourth and Seventh Directives) include, but are not limited to, the follow-
ing issues:

•      Valuation of investments: most assets of insurance undertakings are investments
       held to meet future liabilities to policyholders and therefore there is considerable
       interest in the method of valuation employed. The categories of fixed and current
       assets required by the Fourth Directive are abandoned in favor of a single con-
       cept of investments which includes all lands and buildings.65 The Insurance Direc-
       tive provides that investments may be valued either according to historical cost
       principles or at current value (values according to the non-chosen option should
       however be presented in the notes). It does not seek to choose between the merits
       of either method.
•      The fund for future appropriations: a Member State may permit an insurance
       undertaking to include amounts whose allocation either to policyholders or to
       shareholders remains undetermined at the close of the financial year. The fund
       for future appropriations is largely a holding account to enable a smooth flow of
       surplus to emerge.
•      Deferred acquisition costs: the Insurance Directive requires that the costs of ac-
       quiring insurance policies be deferred in accordance with the Fourth Directive,
       insofar as a Member State decides not to prohibit deferral.
•      Technical provisions: the directive requires insurance undertakings to draw up
       sector-specific provisions, including technical provision for unearned premiums,
       life assurance provision, claims outstanding and equalization provisions.66

96. While the directive broadly harmonizes accounting for insurance undertakings in
the EU, the existence of numerous options restricts comparability. The requirement to
apply endorsed IFRS changed this drastically for publicly-traded insurance undertak-
ings which prepare consolidated accounts (see paragraph 105).

97. In addition, the European Commission is undertaking a significant amount of work
to improve the links between the annual/consolidated accounts and the supervisory re-
turns required from insurance undertakings. This issue is particularly important in the
context of the Commission’s proposed new regulatory framework for insurance com-
panies (“Solvency II“), as it relates to the issue of highlighting what are supervisors’

     Provision to compensate the frequent fluctuation in claims that characterize natural events.

needs for accounting information, as well as identifying possible alternatives where
such information or inputs can be found.67

98. The prudential directives require every insurance undertaking to produce an “an-
nual account, covering all types of operation, of its financial situation, [and] solvency
[…].”68 There is no general requirement that this set of annual accounts should be
established in accordance with the Insurance Accounts Directive or endorsed IFRS.

99. However, to a large extent Member States have used financial reporting and su-
pervisory reporting requirements to arrive at a situation where the same accounting
rules are used for both purposes. Several Member States use the same set of accounts
in principle without adjustments; others perform certain adjustments or require addi-
tional information for supervisory purposes. A few Member States have more extensive
supervisory reporting rules, in certain cases leading more or less to a separate set
of prudential financial statements. However even these separate financial statements
normally take the annual and consolidated accounts as their starting points.

100. The Commission evaluated different accounting alternatives for the Solvency II
project. In that context, there appears to be increasing alignment between the unfold-
ing proposals for Solvency II and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
project on Insurance Contracts (IFRS4 Phase II). The IASB originally planned to issue
the standard on insurance contracts in 2011. The Committee of European Insurance and
Occupational Pensions Supervisors (which was transformed into the European Insur-
ance and Occupational Pensions Authority – EIOPA – in January 2011) has advised the
European Commission on the development of Solvency II and presented a paper to the
IASB outlining the structure and work of Solvency II, arguing that the solvency system
should be compatible with IFRS.



      e. Other relevant Company Law Directives and “soft law” Instruments

101. A number of other important directives and “soft law” instruments relate to ac-
counting, including:

•       Directive 2009/101/EC on coordination of safeguards for the protection of the in-
        terests of members and third parties.69 Among other things, the Directive requires
        companies to publish specific company information in a commercial register or
        companies register in the Member State in which they are registered. Member
        States shall ensure that the filing of all documents is possible by electronic means.



67
     The solvency margin is the amount of regulatory capital an insurance undertaking is obliged to hold against
     unforeseen events. Solvency margin requirements have been in place since the 1970s and have been
     amended by the Solvency I Directives in 2002. Whereas the Solvency I Directives aimed at revising and
     updating the current EU solvency regime, the Solvency II project is a fundamental and wide-ranging review
     of the current insurance Directives to ensure adequate policy-holder protection in all EU Member States.

     See Directive 73/239/EEC Article 19, Directive 79/269/EEC Article 23.

       Financial information which is required to be published in accordance with EU Di-

       whole or any part of the documents must be obtainable on application by paper
       means or by electronic means as the applicant chooses.
•      The Second Company Law Directive (77/91/EEC): minimum capital and capital
       maintenance.70 The Second Directive was adopted in 1976. It sets forth the means
       of coordination of safeguards for the “minimal equivalent protection for both
       shareholders and creditors” of public liability companies. It sets out two principles
       which Member States must adhere to (i) the minimal capital with which a com-
       pany must initially begin and subsequently maintain, and (ii) shareholders’ rights
       regarding the issuance of new capital and the payment for shares. It includes de-
       tailed rules on the formation and the maintenance, increase or reduction of their
       capital. Profit distribution is also regulated.
•      The Eleventh Company Law Directive (89/666/EEC): disclosure requirements in
       respect of branches.71 The Eleventh Directive, adopted in 1989, sets forth the disclo-
       sure requirements for branches of companies operating in Member States. These
       branches can be of a company under the jurisdiction of another Member State or
       of a third country. While subsidiaries of companies incorporated in one Member
       State fall under the jurisdiction of the host Member State, the treatment of foreign
       branches of a company was unclear until the adoption of the Eleventh Directive.
•      Directive 89/117/EEC: accounting documents of branches of foreign credit and
       financial institutions.72 This directive extends the Eleventh Directive to include
       branches of credit institutions.
•      Recommendation 2001/453/EC: recognition, measurement and disclosure of environ-
       mental issues in the annual accounts and annual reports of EU companies.73 This rec-
       ommendation was adopted in order to address the lack of harmonization of Member
       States’ rules and definitions concerning the disclosure of environmental information.
       Because this information was often considered to be unreliable or was lacking alto-
       gether, this Commission recommendation seeks to set a standard for its disclosure.

102. These accounting directives brought about a degree of harmonization and im-
provements in the quality of financial information across the EU; however, by the end
of the 1990s it was clear that financial statements drawn up in compliance with the
Fourth and Seventh directives did not fully achieve the intended policy objectives, in-

cluding the creation of an integrated market in financial services as set out in the FSAP
adopted in May 1999 (see paragraph 36).

103. In 2000, the Commission outlined a strategy designed to eliminate the remaining
barriers to cross-border trading in securities. In particular, this strategy recommended
that there be one set of accounting standards so that company accounts throughout
the EU would be more transparent and could be compared more easily. The Commis-
sion indicated that the adoption of IFRS (then International Accounting Standards) was
the way forward.

“[The adoption of IFRS] signals Europe’s firm intention to remove accounting
differences as a step forward towards developing integrated, deep and liquid capital
and financial services markets to improve capital raising efficiency while preserving
investor protection.”
Frits Bolkestein, Commissioner for the Internal Market, Brussels, June 2000.

104. Right at the outset, the Commission stressed two fundamental preconditions for
achieving its policy objectives:

•      The need for legal certainty: the Commission contemplated the establishment of
       an endorsement mechanism at the level of the EU with a two-tier structure (a
       technical level and a political level) to confirm the standards that would have to be
       applied (See Box 5: Major Bodies involved in the Endorsement of IFRS in the EU).
•      The need for proper enforcement: the Communication noted that high quality ac-
       counting standards would not automatically guarantee transparent financial re-
       porting; rigorous and disciplined application would be vital for the credibility of
       accounts. To achieve this, the Commission stressed the need for high quality statu-
       tory audit (which partly led to the revision of the Eighth EU Company Law Direc-
       tive as discussed in paragraph 121) as well as strengthened co-ordination among
       European securities regulators in order to establish the consistent enforcement of
       high quality financial reporting throughout the EU.



     b. Regulation (EC) 1606/2002 on the Application of IFRS

105. Regulation (EC) 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the
application of IFRS74 (“Regulation 1606/2002”) was issued on July 19, 2002. It requires
publicly-traded companies, including banks and insurance companies, to prepare their
consolidated accounts in accordance with IFRS endorsed by the EU for financial years
beginning January 1, 2005.75 Within this paper, “publicly-traded companies” are those




74
     See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2002R1606:20080410:EN:PDF.
75
     The Regulation allows Member States to defer the application of certain provisions until 2007 for those
     companies publicly-traded both in the EU and on a regulated third-country market which are already
     applying another set of internationally accepted standards as the primary basis for their consolidated
     accounts as well as for companies which have only publicly-traded debt securities.

companies with securities admitted to trading on a regulated market in the EU (See
Box 4: Regulated Market). Understanding what a “regulated market” entails is there-
fore important to assess the actual scope of Regulation 1606/2002.


     Box 4: Regulated Market
     A “regulated market” is defined in Article 4(1), point 14, of Directive 2004/39/
     EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 21, 2004 on markets
     in financial instruments (MiFID), i.e. “a multilateral system […], which brings to-
     gether or facilitates the bringing together of multiple third-party buying and sell-
     ing interests in financial instruments […], and which is authorized and functions
     regularly […].”

     In accordance with Article 47 of the MiFID Directive, each Member State draws
     up a list of the regulated markets for which it is the home Member State and
     forwards it to the Commission.76 The Commission publishes a list of all regulated
     markets in the Official Journal of the EU and updates it at least once a year.

     In the UK, for example, the Main List is a “regulated market”. By contrast, the
     Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”) is an “exchange-regulated market” (under
     MiFID, exchange-regulated markets are now referred to as “multilateral trading
     facilities” (MTFs). Therefore, companies quoted on AIM are not subject to the
     requirements of Regulation 1606/2002.


Application of IFRS in Annual Accounts
106. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, Regulation 1606/2002 gives Mem-
ber States the option to permit or require publicly traded companies to prepare their
annual accounts in conformity with endorsed IFRS. Also, Member States may extend
this permission or this requirement to other companies as regards the preparation of
their consolidated accounts and/or their annual accounts. As of the date of this publi-
cation, only a few Member States have exercised the option to require the use of IFRS
in their annual accounts (e.g., Bulgaria Cyprus, Malta and, in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
Slovakia, Slovenia, for credit institutions); all member states have to some extent exer-
cised the option to allow other companies to use IFRS for their consolidated financial
statements. The Commission regularly updates a table summarizing the intentions and
decisions of Member States and EEA countries concerning their use of these options in
Regulation 1606/2002.77

107. The small number of Member States requiring (or, to a lesser extent, allowing) com-
panies to use IFRS is partly explained by the fact that IFRS are increasingly developed
to address the needs of large, publicly accountable entities. This is implicitly recognized
by the IASB’s Basis for Conclusions of the IFRS for Small and Medium-sized Entities.

The IASB noted that “circumstances of SMEs can be different from those of larger,
publicly accountable entities in several ways, including:

•      The users of the entity’s financial statements and their information needs;
•      How the financial statements are used;
•      The depth and breadth of accounting expertise available to the entity; and
•      SMEs’ ability to bear the costs of following the same standards as the larger, pub-
       licly accountable entities.”

Legal Certainty
108. The IASB is the body which issues IFRS.78 However, IFRS are not automatically
adopted by the EU as they are issued by the IASB. Instead, each standard must first
be endorsed individually by the European Commission before it can enter into force.
Article 3 of Regulation 1606/2002 sets three conditions that individual IFRS must meet
in order to be endorsed and adopted for use under Regulation 1606/2002:

•      Its application must result in a true and fair view of the financial position and
       performance of an enterprise: this principle is considered in the light of the Fourth
       and Seventh Directives but does not imply a strict conformity with each and every
       provision of those directives;
•      It must be conducive to the European public good (this is sometimes interpreted
       as follows: “IFRS accounts should build the foundation of a level playing field for
       European companies to compete for financial resources on EU and international
       capital markets”); and
•      It must meet basic criteria as to the quality of information required for accounts to
       be useful to users (i.e., the understandability, relevance, reliability and comparabil-
       ity required of financial information needed for making economic decisions and
       assessing the stewardship of management).

109. As of the date of this publication, the Commission has endorsed or is about to
endorse all existing standards or amendments to standards (IASs and IFRSs) issued
by the international standard setter and which are still applicable. However, some dif-
ferences continue to exist concerning financial instruments. IAS 39 was approved with
a “carve out” of some paragraphs concerning fair value hedge accounting. The IASB
intends to replace IAS 39 with a new standard for financial instruments, IFRS 9. These
standards and proposed standards are very much debated in Europe and none of them
has been endorsed so far. In addition, the endorsement process requires time. Conse-
quently, there will always be a risk that some standards become applicable in Europe
at a later date than the one defined by IASB.79 Regulation 1606/2002 also requires that
interpretations of the standards be endorsed following the same procedure. All inter-

     EFRAG frequently updates the Endorsement Status Report. The report contains an overview per
     issued standard and interpretation, listing the date of the endorsement date and the date the
     endorsed standard / interpretation was published in the Official Journal of the European Union.

pretations by the Standards Interpretation Committee (SIC) before 2001 and the IFRS
Interpretation Committee since then, relating to standards which are still applicable,
have been approved by the Commission.

110. The endorsement process established by the Commission in accordance with Regu-
lation 1606/2002 involves a number of stakeholders (see Box 5: Major Bodies involved
in the Endorsement of IFRS in the EU). The endorsement process was established to
act expeditiously on standards and interpretations adopted by the IASB. It also pro-
vides a framework to deliberate, reflect and exchange information on IFRS among the
main stakeholders in financial reporting in the EU, in particular national accounting
standard setters, supervisors in the fields of securities, banking and insurance, central
banks including the European Central Bank, the accounting profession and users and
preparers of accounts.


     Box 5: Major Bodies involved in the Endorsement of IFRS in the EU
     The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG),80 is a private-
     sector initiative set up in 2001 by a number of parties in Europe involved in fi-
     nancial reporting (e.g., users, preparers, the accountancy profession, national
     standard setters). Its work comprises two main tasks: providing input to the IASB
     in the standard-setting process, and providing technical advice to the Commis-
     sion on the application of IFRS in Member States. When the IASB issues a new
     standard, EFRAG reviews it and issues an opinion on it; EFRAG also elaborates an
     analysis of the costs and benefits of each IFRS for both EU users and preparers
     and forwards the documents to the European Commission. EFRAG is made up
     of a Technical Expert Group (TEG), which conducts the majority of the technical
     evaluation and advice, and a Supervisory Board to ensure European interest and
     legitimacy. EFRAG is to act in the interest of Europe as a whole, and not in any
     national or other interest. EFRAG’s technical group meets on a monthly basis and
     must respond to the Commission with its endorsement advice within two months
     of an IFRS being published by the IASB.

     The Accounting Regulatory Committee (ARC)81 was established by Article 6 of
     Regulation 1606/2002 to provide the Commission with an opinion on proposals to
     endorse new IFRS and amendments to existing IFRS. It is composed of high-level
     representatives from Member States, mainly from the respective Ministries of Fi-
     nance, and is chaired by the Commission. The ARC decides on the applicability of
     the IFRS within the EU based on existing Member State and Community legislation.

     The European Commission82 first receives the technical opinion from EFRAG.
     The Commission then makes a proposal to either adopt or reject the standard (or
     amendment) and submits this proposal directly to the ARC along with a report
     detailing the standard and its conformity with the existing Accounting Directives.

56       CEEQWPVKPI"CPF"CWFKVKPI"KP"VJG"CESWKU"EQOOWPCWVCKTG
     The Commission can endorse the standard if:

     •     the ARC approves the standard and the EP and the Council do not oppose;
           or
     •     in the event the ARC does not approve the standard, the Commission may
           override the ARC’s refusal with support from the Council and the EP.

     When the ARC issues a positive opinion on a standard, the Commission then
     forwards it to the Parliament83 and to the Council84, which have a three-month
     period to scrutinize the standard. Should the Parliament or the Council oppose
     the proposed standard, the Commission may not adopt it.

     In February 2007, the European Commission appointed the seven members of
     the Standards Advice Review Group85 whose task is to advise the Commission
     on the endorsement process of IFRS and the decisions of the IFRS Interpreta-
     tions Committee. It will assess whether EFRAG’s opinions on the endorsement of
     IFRS and interpretations from the IFRS Interpretations Committee are balanced
     and objective.



Proper Enforcement
111. The European Commission had recognized that only properly enforced IFRS would
bring about the expected policy objectives (see paragraph 104). Also, as discussed in
paragraph 145, proper enforcement was one of the pre-conditions for the US Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) to eliminate the need for reconciliation between IFRS
and US GAAP for European companies issuing securities on US capital markets.

112. In this context, Regulation 1606/2002 requires Member States to take appropriate
measures to ensure compliance with IFRS. The Committee of European Securities Reg-
ulators (CESR; since January 2011, the European Securities Markets Authority, ESMA)
has developed a common European approach to enforcement.86 The Review Panel, a
peer pressure group established in 2003 by CESR, intends to contribute to supervisory
convergence through the consistent and timely implementation of Community legisla-
tion in the Member States. It maintains a database on the implementation of CESR
standards on financial reporting covering Standard no. 1 on Enforcement of standards
on financial information and Standard no. 2 on Co-ordination of Enforcement Activi-
ties.87 ESMA has decided to maintain a database with the relevant enforcement deci-
sions taken by independent EU National Enforcers in respect of financial statements.

The purpose of this is to increase convergence amongst enforcers’ activities across
Europe. The most relevant of these decisions are gathered by the European Enforcers
Co-Ordination Sessions (EECS) and are published on the ESMA website.88



     c. Interaction between Regulation 1606/2002 and the Accounting Directives

113. With the adoption of Regulation 1606/2002 and the subsequent endorsement of
individual standards, IFRS have become part of the acquis communautaire. The regula-
tion does not supersede the existing accounting directives. However, since the account-
ing directives apply to companies through their transposition into national law, there
is no direct interaction between the accounting directives and the regulation; only the
latter is directly applicable to companies. Specifically, the interaction is one between
national law and Regulation 1606/2002.

114. The issue of interaction is only relevant to the extent that national law deals with
the same subject matter as Regulation 1606/2002. Some aspects of national law which
have been transposed from the accounting directives deal with matters outside the
scope of the Regulation and continue to apply (e.g. the responsibility for the prepara-
tion of accounts, the requirement for a statutory audit, the requirement for publication
of accounts). In 2003, the Commission commented on these matters and clarified the
interaction between the directives (as implemented by Member States) and Regulation
1606/2002.89



     iii. Other Relevant Financial Market Directives

115. Prospectus Directive (2003/71/EC)90 : the Prospectus Directive, which replaced the
Public Offer Directive and some parts of the Consolidated Admission and Reporting
Directive, came into force on 31 December 2003. It regulates the laws in relation to
the drawing up and the publication of prospectuses when securities are offered to the
public and/or admitted to trading on a regulated market in the EU. It is a maximum
harmonization directive in relation to the contents and format of prospectuses and, as
such, Member States may not impose additional disclosure provisions to those required
by the directive. One of the major consequences of the directive is the “passport”, i.e.
the ability to raise capital in any of the 27 Member States on the basis of a prospectus
which has been drawn up and approved in one Member State. This was one of the cen-
tral priorities set forth in the FSAP in 1999 (see paragraph 36). Directive 2010/73/EU of
24 November 2010 amends the original version of the Prospectus Directive in order to
reduce to a minimum the burdens weighing on companies, without compromising the
protection of investors and the proper functioning of securities markets in the Union.

116. The Prospectus Directive requires that issuers include consolidated accounts pre-
pared in conformity with the requirements of Regulation 1606/2002, i.e. endorsed IFRS.
The Commission regulation EC/1569/2007 of 21 December 2007 established a mecha-
nism for the determination of equivalence of accounting standards applied by third
country issuers of securities. The Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAPs)
of the US, Japan, China, Canada, South Korea and India were found to be equivalent to
IFRSs as adopted by the EU. The Commission will review the situation of some of these
(China, Canada, South Korea, and India) by 2011 at the latest. Under certain conditions,
other third country issuers may also be permitted to use financial statements drawn up
in accordance with other third country GAAP to provide historical financial information
for a period commencing any time after 31 December 2008 and expiring no later than
31 December 2011.91

117. Transparency Directive (2004/109/EC)92: the Transparency Directive addresses one
of the central priorities set out in the FSAP, i.e. the transparency of financial informa-
tion supplied by issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated mar-
ket. Regulation 1606/2002 had already paved the way for a convergence of financial
reporting standards throughout the EU for those issuers. The Transparency Directive
builds on this approach with regard to annual and interim financial reporting. It re-
quires that:

•      an issuer shall make public its annual financial report at the latest four months
       after the end of each financial year; and
•      an issuer of shares or debt securities shall make public a half-yearly financial re-
       port covering the first six months of the financial year as soon as possible after
       the end of the relevant period, but at the latest two months thereafter.

118. The annual financial report must include the audited accounts, the management re-
port, and statements made by the persons responsible within the issuer, whose names
and functions must be clearly indicated, to the effect that, to the best of their knowl-
edge, the accounts prepared in accordance with the applicable accounting standards
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of
the issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole. Where
the issuer is required to prepare consolidated accounts, the audited financial state-
ments shall be drawn up in accordance with IFRS.

119. The Commission adopted on 8 March 2007 a directive laying out detailed rules
for the implementation of certain provisions with regard to the harmonization of the
transparency requirements prescribed within the original Transparency Directive, such
as disclosure of certain voting rights, of the issuer’s choice of home Member State, of
the condensed set of half-yearly financial statements, and of any major holdings or
changes thereto.93

120. The Takeover Bid Directive (2004/25/EC) 94 : The Takeover Bid Directive is another
of the priorities set out in the FSAP to establish the minimum requirements for compa-
ny takeovers involving issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated
market. The directive requires Member States to have in place a designated national
authority supervising takeover activities and to ensure equal treatment of security
holders as well as sufficient time and information in advance of a takeover bid decision,
among other stipulations.



B. AUDITING: THE ACQUIS COMMUNAUTAIRE AS IT APPLIES
   TO CORPORATE SECTOR AUDITING

121. On May 17, 2006, the European Parliament and European Council issued a new
Eighth Directive on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts
which entered into force on June 29, 2006. This directive (2006/43/EC)95 repeals and
replaces the previously existing Eighth Company Law Directive issued in 1984 (the “old
Eighth Directive”). Although the old Eighth Directive made major progress on harmo-
nizing the education and training requirements for statutory auditors, it did not ad-
dress how a statutory audit should be carried out and did not deal with ethical and
independence principles in detail. Recognizing these shortcomings, the Commission
issued in 1998 a Communication, Statutory Audit — the Way Forward, and established
the EU Committee on Auditing.

122. The overall objective of the new Directive, which is often described as “the new
Eighth Directive” is to improve and harmonize audit quality and to support public con-
fidence in the statutory audit function. To that end, the directive sets out requirements
for (a) education and training, (b) approval and registration of statutory auditors and
audit firms, (c) ethical principles and auditor independence, (d) auditing standards, (e)
quality assurance, (f) public oversight, (g) the appointment and removal of auditors,
and (h) audit committees for public interest entities. In addition, the directive aims to
improve the functioning of the Internal Market via provisions on recognition of auditors
from other Member States and easing restrictive rules on the ownership and manage-
ment of audit firms. The directive also promotes regulatory co-operation within the
EU, and deals with the approval of auditors from third countries and the registration of
audit firms from third countries.

Legislative approach
123. The directive is a minimum harmonization directive and, as such, Member States
are allowed to enact more stringent or additional requirements. However, the directive
prevents spill-over effects from more stringent national regulations in the case of group
audits and issuers from other Member States. Furthermore, the directive supports the
idea of home-country control on the basis of mutual recognition of equivalence and
promotes close co-operation between Member State regulators. The European Group

5:       CEEQWPVKPI"CPF"CWFKVKPI"KP"VJG"CESWKU"EQOOWPCWVCKTG
of Auditors’ Oversight Bodies (EGAOB) facilitates cooperation between audit regulators
in the EU.

124. In line with the principle of proportionality, the directive sets out more stringent
and/or additional requirements for the statutory audits of public interest entities (PIEs).
The directive defines PIEs as publicly traded companies, banks, and insurance under-
takings. It allows Member States to expand the definition of public interest entities.

125. The directive follows the Lamfalussy approach to capital market regulation by al-
lowing the Commission to adopt (binding) implementing measures for certain provi-
sions such as auditing standards, ethics and independence, quality assurance and the
equivalence of third-country systems of quality assurance, discipline, and public over-
sight. The procedure involves Member States through the Audit Regulatory Committee
and the European Parliament.

Education and Training
126. The directive makes few changes to the minimum requirements on education and
training as compared to the old Eighth Directive. The education and training cycle in-
cludes university entrance or the equivalent level at the start, the completion of the-
oretical instruction, three years of practical training, some of which must be with a
statutory auditor or audit firm, and a final examination of professional competence
equivalent to university degree level. The directive lists the curriculum subject matters
for the theoretical instruction, including accounting, auditing, tax, civil, commercial
and company law. Furthermore, statutory auditors must undergo continuing education
programs in order to maintain their approval and registration.

Approval and Registration of Statutory Auditors and Audit Firms
127. Only persons who have met the qualification requirements and are of good repute
can be approved as statutory auditors. They must be registered in an electronically
accessible public register before they can conduct statutory audits.

128. The directive also requires the approval and registration of audit firms. It sets
out restrictions on the ownership and management of audit firms. Natural persons
having the relevant knowledge (or, should Member States decide so, statutory auditors)
or other audit firms shall have at least a majority of the voting rights and represent
a majority of members in the administrative or management body. The majority
threshold should not exceed 75% in the latter case. This is to ensure that the statutory
audits cannot be compromised by other commercial interests or undue influence.

129. However, under the old Eighth Directive, some Member States required auditors
and audit firms to be approved nationally, sometimes preventing foreign ownership
and management of national audit firms. Such restrictions on approval are no longer
possible under the new Eighth Directive, and Member States must allow statutory audi-
tors or audit firms approved in other Member States to own and manage audit firms.
In addition, restrictions on ownership and voting rights have been reduced compared
to the old directive. Statutory auditors carrying out an audit on behalf of an audit firm
should always be approved and registered in the host Member State.

Ethics and Independence
130. The directive contains stipulations on professional ethics (public interest, integ-
rity, objectivity and professional competence), independence, and confidentiality and
professional secrecy. The approach to auditor independence builds upon the Commis-
sion’s recommendation on auditor independence, whereby the statutory auditor self-
assesses the risks to his independence and applies mitigating safeguards. In many ways
the Recommendation is comparable to the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants
issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA). However,
full compliance of the IESBA Code with the combination of the recommendation and
the new Eighth Directive has not yet been demonstrated. The new Eighth Directive
states that statutory auditors or audit firms shall not carry out a statutory audit if
there is any direct or indirect financial, business, employment or other relationship —
including the provision of non-audit services — between the statutory auditor, the audit
firm or the network to which the audit firms belongs, and the audited entity that would
compromise the independence of the auditor.

131. Member States have diverging views as to what discretion can be given to the
auditor to self assess the risks to their independence. Therefore, the directive gives
the Commission the possibility of adopting binding implementing measures that would
narrow the auditor’s discretion in assessing risks and applying safeguards. The Com-
mission could, for example, adopt a list of prohibited non-audit services. The auditor’s
assessment of his independence is complemented by other safeguards included in the
directive, such as the audited entity having to disclose in the notes to its financial state-
ments the audit fee and the fees for non-audit services paid to its statutory auditor
or audit firm. In the case of the statutory audit of public interest entities, the auditor
has to declare in writing his independence and disclose any additional services to the
entity’s audit committee; the key audit partner should be rotated at least every seven
years.

Auditing Standards
132. The directive provides that Member States must require the use of International
Standards on Auditing (ISA) after they have been adopted by the Commission through
the comitology process (or as delegated acts under the Lisbon Treaty). However, the
directive does require the Commission to adopt ISA or set out a timescale for it to
do so, though it sets out basic conditions which have to be met before ISA could be
adopted. ISAs should (a) have been prepared following a proper due process, (b) be of
high quality, and (c) be conducive to the European public good. Member States may add
to, or in exceptional circumstances carve out, elements of ISA only when it relates to
legal differences in the scope (mandate) of the statutory audit, which may differ from
the scope defined in ISA.

133. The directive also has a specific provision on international group audits, for which
the group auditor should be solely responsible and have appropriate documentation
concerning the audit of components in third countries. The directive prescribes that
the individual auditor shall case sign the audit report to stipulate his professional ac-
countability.

134. Each Member State shall establish a system of quality assurance covering all
statutory auditors and audit firms in compliance with the functional criteria of the
directive. The system of quality assurance shall be independent from the reviewed
statutory auditors and audit firms, have secure and independent funding, have suffi-
cient resources, and be of sufficient quality. The directive also defines the scope of the
quality review/inspection as an assessment of compliance with auditing standards and
independence requirements, and defines the quantity and quality of the resources to
be used. Quality assurance must take place at least every six years (every three years
for statutory audits of public interest entities), with the overall results being published
annually and, where needed, followed up on.

135. The Commission issued on 6 May 2008 Recommendation 2008/362/EC on ex-
ternal quality assurance for statutory auditors and audit firms auditing public inter-
est entities.96 This recommendation provides guidance for implementing independent
quality assurance systems for statutory auditors and audit firms conducting an audit
of public interest entities. Independent oversight bodies must play an active role in the
inspections of audit firms. The recommendation provides guidance for ensuring the in-
dependence of the inspection system. Focusing on PIEs is justified by the priority given
to co-operation between Member States and third country oversight bodies. However,
the Commission considered that there is no need to provide detailed guidance with
regard to the quality assurance systems for statutory auditors and audit firms auditing
entities other than public interest entities.

System of Public Oversight
136. Each Member State must establish an effective system of public oversight in com-
pliance with the functional criteria of the directive. This system is to be governed by
non-practitioners knowledgeable in areas relevant to statutory audit and will subject all
statutory auditors and audit firms to public oversight. This aspect overlaps with many
of the others set forth in the directive, as this system will have the ultimate oversight
not only of auditor approval and registration, but also of all standards adoption, con-
tinuing education, quality assurance, and investigative and disciplinary systems. There
is to be coordination between respective Member State systems of public oversight, in
addition to mutual recognition of regulatory arrangements between Member States.
Member States are responsible for designating the competent authorities to carry out
the duty of public oversight and to co-ordinate cooperation at EU level. The European
Commission has published a list of competent authorities for the tasks provided for in
the statutory audit directive; this mainly comprises those bodies charged with public
oversight activities.97

Appointment and Dismissal
137. In order to keep a sufficient arm’s length distance between the management of the
company and the auditor, the auditor shall not be directly selected and appointed by

the company’s management, but rather by the general meeting of shareholders. The
directive also specifies that the dismissal of auditors during their mandate can be done
only on proper grounds and must be communicated to the public oversight authority.

Statutory audit of Public Interest Entities (PIEs)
138. The directive includes some additional requirements concerning the statutory au-
dit of PIEs. Audit firms which audit PIEs must present an annual transparency report
with information on the firm’s (a) legal structure, (b) governance and ownership, (c)
network arrangements, (d) systems of internal quality control, and (e) the basis of part-
ners’ remuneration.

139. PIEs must have an audit committee with specified tasks such as monitoring the
financial reporting process and statutory audit. The audit committee is an important
element for safeguarding audit quality and auditor independence, and it is involved in
the selection of the auditor. The statutory auditor must report to the audit committee
on key matters arising during the audit and on independence issues. The directive pro-
vides several exemptions from the audit committee requirement, such as for subsidiar-
ies and investment undertakings.

Approval of Third-country Auditors
140. Competent authorities of Member States may approve third-country auditors as
statutory auditors. These third-country auditors are subject to the same approval pro-
cedure as Member State auditors wishing to carry out audits in a second Member State,
mandating good repute as well as the above mentioned educational requirements.

Registration of Third-country Audit Firms
141. Third-country (i.e. non-EU) auditors and audit firms are subject to registration
where they audit a company which has equity and/or debt traded on an EU Member
State regulated market. This may be waived in some cases with regard to debt securi-
ties traded by professional investors. Registered third-country auditors and firms will
be subject to the same systems of oversight, quality assurance, and investigation and
penalty systems as their EU equivalents. The new Eighth Directive sets out more spe-
cific limitations for the registration of third-country audit entities. Mainly, such audits
should be carried out in accordance with ISAs or equivalent approved standards. The
directive also sets out the specifics of cooperation with competent authorities from
third-countries, as regards working arrangements and the transfer of working papers
or other documents.

142. Third-country auditors and auditing entities may be exempted from these require-
ments if their third-country system has been deemed as equivalent to the EU system
with respect to public oversight, quality assurance, investigations and penalties. On
19 January 2011, the Commission decided to recognize the equivalence of the audit
oversight systems in 10 third countries (Australia, Canada, China, Croatia, Japan, Singa-
pore, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland and the USA), This not only allows Mem-
ber States to exempt the statutory auditors and audit firms originating from these
countries from registration, but also allows their oversight authorities to have access to

audit working papers for the purpose of their oversight activities.98 The Commission‘s
assessments show that 20 other third countries are in the process of establishing inde-
pendent public oversight systems for auditors. A transitional period for the activities of
auditors from these 20 third countries has been granted until 31 July 2012.

143. The EU has made great strides in harmonizing corporate sector accounting and au-
diting within its Member States. As is evident in the recent adoption of the new Eighth
Directive and the updates to the Fourth and Seventh Company Law Directives, the EU’s
efforts have intensified over time and are increasingly international in scope. Despite
this progress, there a number of issues which the EU will need to address either in the
immediate future or in the longer term. These include the convergence of IFRS with US
GAAP and other GAAP and the recognition of equivalence between these standards;
financial reporting by SMEs; the handling of registration and oversight of third country
auditors and audit entities; the resolution of the debate surrounding the extent of audi-
tor liability; the Commission’s proposed adoption of International Standards on Audit-
ing (ISA) and more broadly the future role of statutory auditors.



A. IFRS CONVERGENCE WITH US GAAP AND RECOGNITION OF
   EQUIVALENCE

144. Until 2007, in order to be publicly traded on both American and European se-
curities exchanges, European companies had to incur the costs of reconciling their
financial statements with US GAAP.99 The European strategy towards IFRSs was partly
motivated by the idea that global standards could avoid such reconciliation costs. From
2006, this issue became an important item on the agenda of the regulatory dialogue
between EU and US policy-makers. After IFRS had been adopted for several years in
Europe, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided on 15 November
2007 to do away with the need for foreign private issuers to reconcile financial state-
ments drawn up in accordance with “IFRSs as published by the IASB” to US GAAP.
However the decision was made on the understanding that the IASB and FASB would
continue working on reducing the differences between the two major financial report-
ing frameworks, a process usually described as “convergence”.

145. Convergence and consistent application of standards remain the essential ele-
ments for achieving the objective of having a single set of financial reporting standards
for the world. In 2006, the FASB and the IASB agreed a Memorandum of Understand-
ing (MoU) that described a programme to achieve substantial convergence between
the two sets of standards. The two boards issued a further statement in November
2009 outlining further steps for completing their convergence work by 2011. The issue
of the consistent application of standards was also a concern of securities supervi-
sors in countries applying IFRSs and also in the US. In April 2004, the CESR issued its



99
     FEE Position Paper March 2006, “Financial Reporting: Convergence, Equivalence and Mutual Recognition”.


66        EWTTGPV"KUUWGU
Standard no. 2 on Financial Information – Coordination of Enforcement which aimed to
achieve the necessary coordination and convergence of enforcement activities carried
out by EU National Enforcers. This Standard is a principle-based standard establishing
a framework that will be completed by implementation measures necessary for the
realization of the identified principles.100



B. IFRS CONVERGENCE WITH OTHER GAAP AND RECOGNITION
   OF EQUIVALENCE

146. EU Commissioner Charlie McCreevy stated in a speech in April 2006 that the EU
would increasingly need to adapt its efforts to facilitate cross-border investment by
taking international financial developments into account.101 Although the EU in the past
has focused much of its attention on solving divergences with US financial market
standards, there is growing interest in, and attention to, other international capital
markets such as those of China and India. These countries are increasing their coop-
eration with the IASB in order to bring more transparency and comparability to their
financial statements on the global markets. This was underlined by the Commission
White Paper, Financial Services Policy 2005–2010 (see paragraph 36), in which the
Commission declared its intention to widen its dialogue and cooperation with emerg-
ing players in the global financial markets and to seek their stronger representation in
international bodies such as the Basel Committee and IOSCO.102

147. As explained above (see paragraph 118), the European Commission regulation
EC/1569/2007 of 21 December 2007 established a mechanism for the determination
of equivalence of accounting standards applied by third country issuers of securities.
Financial reporting standards of the US and Japan were found to be equivalent to IFRS
as adopted by the EU. For some other countries (including China, Canada, South Korea
and India), the Commission took temporary decisions in the expectation that these
countries would move towards IFRSs by 2011 at the latest. Issuers from these countries
are not obliged to restate historic financial information in accordance with endorsed
IFRS. In addition, the SEC has already announced that it will decide during 2011 whether
IFRSs may be used also by US-based issuers to prepare their financial statements. A
positive decision form the SEC would clearly make IFRS a generally accepted global
framework for financial reporting. In the meantime a growing number of countries
around the world have decided to move towards IFRS, which makes any further equiva-
lence decision superfluous.

C. SME FINANCIAL REPORTING

148. The EU is increasingly prioritizing financial reporting issues for small and medi-
um-sized enterprises (SMEs). As Günter Verheugen, Vice President of the European
Commission responsible for Enterprise and Industry, stated “small and medium-sized
enterprises are the engine of the European economy. They are an essential source of
jobs, create entrepreneurial spirit and innovation in the EU, and are thus crucial for
fostering competitiveness and employment.” 103 A recent report 104 concluded that there
were approximately 3.7 million small companies and 66,000 medium-sized companies
(as defined within the scope of the Fourth Directive) in the 20 Member States for which
data were available.105

149. As discussed previously, EU Member States can allow small companies to draw up
abridged accounts and notes to the accounts, and to exempt small companies from the
requirement for a statutory audit as well as from drawing up an annual report. Mem-
ber States can also allow medium-sized companies to adopt a different layout for the
profit and loss account, to present aggregate balance sheet information, not to draw up
consolidated accounts, and to leave out non-financial information from the annual re-
port. As a part of the Commission’s better regulation initiative, DG Internal Market and
Services is examining further simplifications for SMEs in the field of financial reporting.

150. In July 2009, the IASB issued its IFRS for SMEs reporting standard, a simplified
version of IFRS intended for use by SMEs, for whom the full IFRS was too complex. Sev-
eral EU Member States expressed their intention to allow smaller companies to use this
standard in their domestic environment. The European Commission launched a public
consultation on the issue but no clear response resulted.106 As demonstrated by EFRAG
in a study commissioned by the Commission,107 there are very few inconsistencies be-
tween accounting directives and IFRS for SMEs that would prevent a Member State
from requiring or allowing this standard to be applied for companies falling outside the
scope of regulation 1606/2002.



D. REGISTRATION AND OVERSIGHT OF
   THIRD-COUNTRY AUDITORS AND AUDIT ENTITIES 108

151. There are approximately 1,700 third-country companies with securities admitted to
trading on a regulated market in the EU (mainly in Ireland, Luxembourg, and the United
Kingdom). These issuers are incorporated in approximately 60 non-EU countries, pre-

dominantly from high income countries (e.g. Australia, Japan, the United States) and
middle income countries (e.g. Brazil, China, India, Russia, Turkey). A significant propor-
tion of these issuers are incorporated in offshore financial centers, such as Bermuda
and the Cayman Islands.

152. As discussed in paragraph 122, the basic premise of the Directive on Statutory
Audit is that auditors of a company which issues equity or debt in a Member State
should be subject to an equivalent minimum level of regulation, regardless of whether
the auditor is regulated by that Member State, by another Member State or by a third
country. This is intended to give investors in the EU a similar level of confidence in the
auditors of companies in whose securities they invest, regardless of the country of
incorporation of the issuing company.

153. To achieve this objective, the directive introduces stringent registration require-
ments for third-country audit entities. However, the directive permits exemption (in
whole or in part) from this regime if the third country’s regulatory system is deemed
equivalent to the EU regime.

154. A number of observers have argued that the directive’s provisions have an “extra-
territorial” effect, which has some similarity to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and potentially
presents serious risks to EU capital markets’ competitiveness as international financial
centers.

155. With a growing number of third-country issuers seeking to raise capital on inter-
national markets (e.g. companies from China, India, Russia), these provisions will no
doubt attract considerable interest from EU international financial centers seeking to
maintain their competitive edge against capital markets where regulation is sometimes
perceived as more onerous. While not wishing to regulate risks out of capital markets,
EU policymakers and regulators seek to exempt countries on grounds of equivalence,
in a way that is consistent with the directive’s underlying objective.

156. As discussed above (see paragraphs 140-142), cooperation with public oversight
authorities of third countries is an important element of the system of investor protec-
tion on European regulated markets. The adequacy of third countries oversight author-
ities is assessed in the light of the competences exercised by these authorities in the
country concerned, the safeguards against breaching confidentiality rules and their
ability under their own laws and regulations to cooperate with the competent authori-
ties of European Member States. Reciprocity is also considered and this, for instance,
delayed recognition of the adequacy of the PCAOB in the US until the US Congress had
approved some amendments to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.




108
      The Eighth Directive uses the term “audit firm” when referring to a legal person or any other entity that
      is approved in accordance with the Directive by the competent authorities of a Member State to carry
      out statutory audits. The Directive uses the term “audit entity” when referring to an entity which carries
      out audits of annual or consolidated accounts of a company incorporated in a third-country, i.e. outside
      of the European Union (as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein).


                                                                           EWTTGPV"KUUWGU                   69
E. AUDITOR LIABILITY

157. Auditor liability has become a major issue across the EU and the world. Responding
to this, the Commission launched a study into systems of civil liability which was com-
pleted in January 2001. One of the conclusions of the study was that auditor liability
is part of a broader concept of national civil liability systems and that differences in
auditors’ civil liability are derived from the basic features of national legal regimes.
The study concluded that harmonization of professional liability would be very difficult.

158. Article 31 of the Statutory Audit Directive requests the European Commission to
present a report on the impact of current national liability rules for the carrying out
of statutory audits on European capital markets and on the insurance conditions for
statutory auditors and audit firms, including an objective analysis of the limitations of
financial liability. As a first preparatory step, the Commission Services commissioned
the consultancy firm London Economics to study these issues on an EU-wide scale. The
study concluded that “the level of auditor liability insurance available for higher limits
has fallen sharply in recent years. The remaining source of funds to face claims may
essentially be the income of partners belonging to the same international network.
Constantly large claims might therefore put at risk an entire network.” 109

159. Subsequently the European Commission launched a public consultation on wheth-
er there is a need to reform rules on auditors’ liability in the EU and on the possible
ways forward. All respondents belonging to the audit profession expressed the need for
a Commission initiative on auditors‘ liability, whereas other contributors had divided
views on the matter. 110

160. As a result of this consultation, on 5 June 2008, the European Commission ap-
proved a recommendation to Member States concerning the limitation of the civil liabil-
ity of statutory auditors and audit firms. Article 2 recommends that “The civil liability of
statutory auditors and of audit firms arising from a breach of their professional duties
should be limited except in cases of intentional breach of duties by the statutory auditor
or the audit firm.” However, in view of the considerable variations between civil liability
systems in the Member States, each of them will remain able to choose the method of
limitation which it considers to be the most suitable for its civil liability system.111



F. COMMISSION ADOPTION OF INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS
   ON AUDITING (ISA)

161. Article 26 of the Directive on Statutory Audit allows, but does not require, the
European Commission to adopt International Standards on Auditing (ISA) for statutory
audits of annual and consolidated accounts. The Commission’s decision on adopting

6:         EWTTGPV"KUUWGU
ISA will be a regulatory procedure with scrutiny by the Audit Regulatory Committee.
In contrast to the provisions of Regulation 1606/2002 on the use of IFRS, the directive
does not set a target date for such adoption.

162. In cases where the Commission has not endorsed an ISA covering a specific sub-
ject, EU Member States are allowed to apply their national auditing standards. However,
once an ISA has been endorsed, statutory audits will have to be conducted in accord-
ance with the endorsed ISA. Member States may add audit procedures or requirements
or carve out parts of an ISA only if this is needed to meet national legal requirements
relating to the scope of statutory audits.

163. Article 26 sets out three preconditions for ISA to be adopted, i.e., whether the
standards (1) have been developed with proper due process, public oversight and trans-
parency, and are generally accepted internationally; (2) contribute to a high level of
credibility and quality of the annual and consolidated accounts; and (3) are conducive
to the European public good. The directive states the Commission should review ISA
and report to the Audit Regulatory Committee as to whether the ISA meet these re-
quirements. The adoption of ISA will require translation and publication in full in the
Official Journal of the EU in each of the 23 official languages of the EU.

164. To inform its decision on whether to adopt ISA, the European Commission organ-
ized a public consultation and commissioned two pieces of research on the evaluation
of the differences between ISA and the standards of the US Public Company Account-
ing Oversight Board (PCAOB), and on the costs and benefits of an adoption of ISA in
the EU. The overall conclusions of the latter study was that “On balance, adoption of
clarified ISAs through the EU would contribute to the credibility and quality of financial
statements and to audit quality in the EU, and to a greater acceptance of audit reports
outside of their home jurisdictions within and outside of the EU. There are significant
net benefits expected from the EU’s adoption of ISA adoption beyond those expected
from their adoption by the international auditing networks (grouped together in the
Forum of Firms – FoF) or individual EU member states.112

165. The result of the consultation was equally positive. “The overwhelming majority
of respondents to the consultation favor an adoption of the International Standards on
Auditing (ISAs) at EU level. A significant majority of the respondents support the ap-
plication of the ISAs to the statutory audit of all companies, including small companies
for which an audit is required. The international acceptance of ISA is widely accepted
by the respondents. Any amendments to ISA by either the European Commission or the
Member States should be very limited. The vast majority of respondents support the
adoption of the Application and Other Explanatory Material with a special status, how-
ever, not as best practice.” 113 However, at the time of writing the European Commission
had not made a decision on whether to adopt ISA.

G. THE FUTURE ROLE OF STATUTORY AUDITORS

166. In 2010, the European Commission published for comment a Green Paper entitled
“Audit Policy – Lessons from the crisis”. The Green Paper raised a number of questions
that could help the Commission to define its future strategy on auditing. In particular,
it identified the clarification of the role of auditors concerning risk management and
going concern problems in a company as major topics. The Green Paper also discussed
rules to avoid conflict of interests and possible remedies to the problem of concen-
tration and choice in the audit market. Finally, the European Commission raised the
question of whether systems of oversight needed to be enhanced and mechanisms
developed at the EU level, which would also allow strengthening international coop-
eration. A summary of the 700 responses to this consultation was released by the
European Commission early in 2011 and EU Commissioner Michel Barnier announced
at a European Commission conference on auditing in February 2011 that he would be
making legislative proposals on the issues raised by the Green Paper by the end of 2011.
