What is the Lagging Regions Initiative
The scope of the EU Cohesion Policy is to narrow development gaps and reduce disparities between Member
Countries and regions. To this extent, around €454 billion of ESI (European Structural and Investment) Funds
have been allocated to help EU regions become more competitive. However, not all EU regions have been able
to fully take advantage of the benefits of EU growth, due to the effects of the 2008 economic crisis and due to
a host of structural problems.

To this end, Corina Crețu, the Commissioner for Regional Policy, together with the Task Force for Better
Implementation has started the Lagging Regions Initiative. The aim of the Initiative is to identify what holds
back growth in less developed regions, and to provide targeted actions for unlocking their growth potential.
Thus, these lagging regions will be assisted to involve a broad range of stakeholders (regional and local
administrations, educational institutions, business support institutions, SMEs, entrepreneurs, investors, NGOs,
IFIs) to help respond to concrete needs they have and to maximize the impact of regional investments. Two
types of lagging regions have been identified:

•	   LOW GROWTH REGIONS, which cover the less developed and transition regions that did not converge to
     the EU average between the years 2000 and 2013 in Member States with a GDP per Capita (PPS) below
     the EU average in 2013. These include almost all the less developed and transition regions in Greece, Italy,
     Spain and Portugal

•	   LOW INCOME REGIONS, covering all the regions with a GDP per Capita (PPS) below 50% of the EU average
     in 2013. This group covers the less developed regions of Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and Romania.

Poland and Romania are the first countries to pilot this initiative, with two regions each – Swietokrzyskie and
Podkarpackie in Poland, and North-West and North-East in Romania. In April 2016, Commissioner Crețu together
with Marshal Adam Jarubas in Swietokrzyskie and Marshal Wladyslaw Ortyl in Podkarpackie have officially
launched the Polish part of the Lagging Regions Initiative called „Catching-up Regions Poland”. The „Catching-
up Regions Poland” is an implementation-focused program that aims at providing tailored support to the two
Polish regions to boost the impact of EU and private investments in specific areas selected by the two regions.

Over a year of joint work, the World Bank provided hands-on technical assistance and helped coordinate five
activities that were selected by the Podkarpackie and Swietokrzyskie regions in coordination with the European
Commission, Ministry of Economic Development, and the Bank. The five selected activities were:

•	   Improving the commercialization of Research & Development (R&D) results generated by public research
     facilities and enabling better utilization of existing technology transfer centers in the Podkarpackie region.

•	   Strengthening the vocational education and training system in the Swietokrzyskie region, using best practice
     examples from around the world and tailoring them to the regional context.

•	   Activating entrepreneurship in deprived areas in the Podkarpackie and Swietokrzyskie regions.

•	   Identifying ways to improve conditions for starting a business in the Podkarpackie and Swietokrzyskie
     regions.

•	   Supporting the creation of in-house financial instruments in the Podkarpackie region.

6   ACTIVITY 4 - Financial Instruments – Podkarpackie Region
Overview

This Report has been prepared as part of the pilot project of the European Commission titled: Catching-up
Regions Initiative, implemented in 2016-2017 in selected regions of two European Union states, i.e. Poland and
Romania. In Poland, the pilot project included Świętokrzyskie and Podkarpackie regions.1


The initiative objective is the identification of economic growth restrains in lagging regions of Europe and –
on that basis – provision of advisory assistance consisting of individualised activities (specific for each region),
contributing to the reduction of those restrains to improve conditions for investment and economic growth.
The scope of advisory activities was determined with participation of the European Commission, regional and
central government (in Poland: Marshal Offices of both regions and the Ministry of Economic Development)
and the World Bank which also played the role of an entity implementing advisory services.


One of the intervention areas, agreed for the action plan for Podkarpackie, were matters related to the development
of regional mechanism of supporting micro, small and medium enterprises in accessing financing (Task no. 4).
The subject of advisory services performed by the World Bank experts specifically concerned management of
funds allocated in the region under the Regional Operational Programme for 2007-2013 (Podkarpackie ROP
2007-2013) to financial engineering instruments, subject to return following project implementation by financial
intermediaries (approximately PLN 135 million). The objective was, therefore, to develop a strategy for this and to
choose organisational form and to design operational model of re-engagement of funds, also considering the
next programming perspective of EU aid (European Structural and Investment Funds) for 2014-2020, which also
includes support of financial instruments.


As part of advisory services, activities leading to incorporation of a limited liability company in Podkarpackie have
been taken already. The company is to be called Podkarpacki Fundusz Rozwoju [Podkarpacki Development
Fund - PDF]2 and it will take over tasks related to the organisation and management of financial instruments
based on funds returned from Podkarpackie ROP 2007-2013 financial instruments and (like in the past) other
financing sources.


This document constitutes final report on advisory services performed from November 2016 to March 2017 in
the scope described above.

Summary
It is very important to design the rules of return of the funds allocated previously to the implementation of
financial instruments under Podkarpackie ROP 2007-2013 (which will be the subject of separate “exit policy”
developed by the representatives of the Marshal Office supported by WB consultants) and their further use
in a way that would not compete with the funds of Podkarpackie ROP 2014-2020. This document contains
an analysis of various aspects of regulating this last issue in the context of targeting financial instrument
implementation under current programming perspective for 2014-2020.

In Podkarpackie region the demand for loan instruments, and to a certain degree also guarantees, should be
considerable, regardless of the financial instruments available in the current programming period. This thesis is
supported by the estimated financing gap. Additionally, purely working capital loans may raise special interest.
In the longer term, offering equity instruments may be considered.

Possibility to freely design instruments, without restrictions of the EU fund application rules, is very important
(and it is also a chance to ensure new instruments’ success), obviously maintaining compliance with applicable
laws and regulations, including in particular regulations on eligibility for public aid. This also enables testing of
new innovative instruments – previously very rare or non-existent on the regional financing market.

The financial intermediaries interviewed are comparatively open to accept new solutions, although they are
also rather cautious, indicating very limited cooperation between financial intermediaries in the region, and
also between financial intermediaries and the Marshal Office. It is a common opinion that the capacity and
experience of local financial intermediaries should be utilised.

At this stage, we propose designing two types of working capital loans and loans for pre-financing and co-
financing of projects implemented by SMEs under Cohesion Policy 2014-2020. Obviously, in a longer term, the
range of financial instruments should be developed and expanded based on the needs analysis and sufficient
demarcation between 2014-2020 funds.

In terms of instrument implementation models, we propose three models for consideration, each based on a
different level of involvement of the institution created at the regional level (Podkarpackie Development Fund).
    1) Model 1 is the most traditional and is based on purely coordinating and accounting role of the regional
       fund (Podkarpacki Development Fund). It is very similar to the model previously used in Podkarpackie ROP
       2007-2013, where virtually all lending activities were performed by local financial intermediaries.
    2) Model 2 assumes execution of all lending activities at the regional level (by the regional fund). Financial
       intermediaries and their employees deal exclusively with identification and preliminary analysis of potential
       borrowers and support in the loan repayment monitoring process.
    3) In turn, the model recommended by us – Model 3, is to a certain degree a combination of the first two
       models; it provides for loans to be granted by local financial intermediaries, they are fully liable for their
       repayment (obviously with certain loss ratio limits), and the loans are granted from a sub-account of
       Podkarpackie Development Fund to which financial intermediaries are authorised. Loans are also repaid
       to the account of Podkarpackie Development Fund.
      PDF is also responsible for determining the parameters of individual financial products offered by local
      intermediaries. The types and parameters of individual products should be determined with consideration
      given to the identified needs of regional micro, small and medium enterprises.

Application of each model of financial instruments implementation, in particular of Models 2 and 3, will require
ensuring specific organisational capacity (managerial) of the regional fund, provision of capital and other
necessary assets, including knowledge of its staff and access to advisory services. We have specified those
issues in the final part of this Report, underlining also their immense importance.

  Conversion to Polish zloty at the EUR 1 = PLN 4.3 rate. In further parts of this Report, making estimations related to the planned use of
the allocation, we considered only its value arising from the support from European Union funds (on the basis of values set out in Detailed
Description of Priority Axes of Podkarpackie ROP for 2014-2020). We do not consider additional amounts which will be contributed to the
instruments by the implementing institution. In accordance with the Detailed Description of Priority Axes of Podkarpackie ROP, maximum
percentage level of total co-financing of eligible expenditure at the project level (EU funds + potential co-financing from the state budget
or other sources granted to beneficiaries by relevant institution) amounts to 95%. This means that the results of the estimations are slightly
distorted – in reality, following allocation supplementation, they will be slightly higher. The calculations also do not consider allowances for
costs and charges related to instrument management (those issues are also not considered in the Ex-ante evaluation for Podkarpackie ROP
financial instruments which is our main reference here – so in general, results of all calculations are indicative only).

  The Ex-ante evaluation is in many places rather general and some of its findings / recommendations are controversial, often their description
is unclear (for the present analysis the document is not that useful – this in fact means that it must be verified and updated when the
implementation of financial instruments would be started; considering the purpose of the present Report, we do not analyse here those
defects). However, in our opinion some general description of the products planned is useful from the point of view of designing products /
instruments provided from funds returned from Podkarpackie ROP 2007-2013 financial instruments and re-engaged. We consider those parts
of the analysis that refer to measures/sub-measures of the Programme where (in the current Programme version) the premise of the financial
instruments application was maintained.

  The distribution scheme of support allocation in Sub-measure 1.4.2 of Podkarpackie ROP presented in the tables below constitutes fairly
specific recommendations for the entity implementing the fund of funds in Podkarpackie, however, the entity managing the fund of funds,
i.e. BGK, will have – as we assume – certain freedom in verification of those assumptions to better adjust them to the current situation in the
region in terms of financial instrument supply and demand and the scale of the financing gap (it is justified even just considering the time that
has passed since the issue of Ex-ante evaluation of financial instruments).

 In the table, the allocation value for those products is calculated based on the allocation value for standard loans (25% * PLN 128.8 mln). This
means that the share of such products in the total allocation for debt instruments (standard and innovation loans) will be about 20.7%.

  To simplify, it was assumed that the average value of financing will be equal to the maximum value, which obviously will not be the case. It
may be therefore assumed that the number of loans and guarantees will be in reality higher than those indicated, even by 30-40%.

1.4 Conclusions for development of financial instruments
    strategy beyond Podkarpackie ROP 2014-2020

  Characteristics of the proposed financial                 financing gap in Podkarpackie in the
  instruments/products outlined in the                      upcoming years constitute a context

     This assumption is not fully convincing. Disregarding changes occurring in the financing market and also more general changes – in the
  whole economic system – is a little reckless (in the gap calculations – in some of the methods used – the Ex-ante evaluation uses data from
  2012). However, for the purposes of this Report that estimation is not without use. In our opinion, it may determine the initial size of the gap.
  Its potential growth does not matter as it will (even more so) confirm justification of the use of financial instruments as a form of supporting
  enterprises (for example, in relation to access to financing sources or creation of incentives to invest). On the other hand, there are no obvious
  reasons which would justify a thesis that the gap will significantly decrease (for example, the cost of financing was not deemed in the Ex-ante
  evaluation a condition significantly affecting the gap size – therefore, the recent decline in the market level of interest rate of debt instruments
  should not play an important role). Naturally, cyclical study of the financing gap would greatly facilitate financial instrument programming.

                Financing gap – its size means that there is no risk of internal competition among financial
       2        instruments supported by various sources (instruments created basing on funds returned
                from Podkarpackie ROP 2007-2013 vs. deployed under Podkarpackie ROP 2014-2020).

Activities of loan funds (throughout                     regulatory framework for provision of

  In the 2014-2020 programming period for EU financing, the possibility of directing funds to financial instruments used for working capital
purposes has been finally clarified and – in accordance with the latest interpretation – is allowed (in the previous programming period there
were many ambiguities in this regard). Currently, possibilities (and rules) of financing working capital are described in relevant guidance of the
European Commission of 27 March 2015. (EGESIF_14_0041-1), see Guidance for Member States on Article 37(4) CPR – Support to enterprises/
working capital, [https://www.fi-compass.eu/publication/ec-regulatory-guidance/ec-regulatory-guidance-guidance-member-states-article-
374-cpr]. This means that instruments for financing of working capital needs may be present as part of Podkarpackie ROP 2014-2020 funds.
However, we assume that instruments will eventually be diversified in such way that funds from 2014-2020 perspective will serve mainly for
financing of investment, as determinations of the Ex-ante evaluation indicate such scenario. Moreover, it should be added that to finance
working capital from funds of 2014-2020 perspective, although allowed, will be subject to the requirement to justify a given undertaking
in the business plan (which will constitute certain burden on the part of final recipient, and also financial intermediary who will analyse
such document). So, we would like to stress that a business plan is also required when the purpose of financing is “delivery of capital for the
strengthening of the general activities of an enterprise (such as activities aimed at stabilising and defending the existing market position,
strengthening of capacity utilisation)” – conclusion on the basis of the answer to questions related to the presentation of financing issues
+ EGESIF of 17 December 2014. Therefore, for example, making a decision on provision of financing for general working capital purposes
cannot be limited to a justification based on historic data. To sum up, working capital financing based on funds from 2014-2020 perspective
is allowed, but it requires certain level of documentation justifying that type of financing.

  For example, this assumption is very strongly reflected in the offer of Dolnośląski Fundusz Rozwoju (Dolnośląski Development Fund –
regional institution managing financial instruments funded from funds returned from Dolnośląskie ROP 2007-2013), under which funds are
provided to intermediaries to grant two types of working capital loans: (1) to fund ongoing expenditure and (2) to fund current expenses
related to the needs of manufacturing operations.

             As clear and specific demarcation of financial instruments as possible, depending on the

             An expansion of the range of financial instruments by equity instruments (to target early
             stages of enterprise development) is recommended.

   We should remember, however, our previous conclusion which indicates that significant level of the financing gap means that some overlap
of the purpose of financial instruments/products should not pose special risk of internal competition between instruments/products funded
from various sources (funds returned from Podkarpackie ROP 2007-2013 vs. Podkarpackie ROP 2014-2020).

Financial instruments created basing on                    use of funds (also too rigorous parameters

     This aspect is not considered in the Ex-ante evaluation of financial instruments for Podkarpackie ROP 2014-2020.

  We can again look at the example of Dolnośląski Development Fund that is planning to invest some of the funds in equity instruments,
targeted at financing seed and start-up phases of enterprises (innovative projects, including those based on the results of research and
development activities).
19
  In Podkarpackie, availability of “indigenous” (regional) investment vehicles specialising in financing early phases of development, is very
limited. For example, in Measure 3.1 of the Operational Programme Innovative Economy (2007-2013), among 70 supported investment
incubators only one was located in Rzeszów (based on: PAG Uniconsult and Imapp Analiza zasadności zastosowania poszczególnych form
finansowania projektów I osi priorytetowej Przedsiębiorcza Polska Wschodnia, Etap 1 - Raport końcowy, Warszawa 2016, p. 75-79). In another
report, in turn, (M. Gajewski, J. Szczucki, J. Witkowska, R. Kubajek Ewaluacja ex-post projektu systemowego <Utworzenie i dokapitalizowanie
Funduszu Pożyczkowego Innowacji w ramach pilotażu w III osi priorytetowej PO IG>, PAG Uniconsult, Warszawa 2015), one small private
investment fund based in Rzeszów was identified.
20
   We refer here to the experiences and conclusions related to the execution of another advisory component under the Catching up Regions
Initiative, i.e. Activity 1, concerning the creation of a Regional Technology Transfer Office (RTTO). At the early stages of advisory works under
Activity 1, it was discussed that one of the operational components of RTTO would be some financing mechanism for early development
stages of ideas generated in RTTO. Those discussions were supported by identified interest of potential beneficiaries. In the end, however,
that component was not included, assuming correctly that this may be realised (and would be more appropriate) within the component
dedicated to financial instruments. In the future, development of equity instruments in Podkarpackie should be realised in connection with
tasks/support offered as part of RTTO. It should be added here that the context of supporting equity instruments in Podkarpackie contains
also another support instrument, executed as a pilot project under Operational Programme Eastern Poland 2014-2020 (OPEP). These are the
so called Start-up Platforms (in Rzeszów some of the undertakings of Kielce Start-up Platform - Technopark Business Hub - are animated),
developed under Sub-measure 1.1.1 OPEP (titled: Starting Platforms for New Ideas) and their accompanying instrument (Sub-measure 1.1.2
OPEP titled Start-up Development in Eastern Poland), in which the start-ups created in the Platforms may be capitalised through development
subsidies (granted in competitions through the Polish Agency for Enterprise Development) of up to PLN 800,000. Without a doubt, the
functioning of the Platforms and capitalisation support could be appropriately connected with the future offer of equity instrument support
in Podkarpackie (provided that the pilot project brings positive results and consequently both measures are continued – which should be
known at the latest by mid-2018).

   The models presented and discussed in this section provide solutions that may be used by the entity implementing financial instruments in
Podkarpackie (Podkarpackie Development Fund), based on the funds returned from the financial instruments under Podkarpackie ROP 2007-
2013, and in the future also with the use of different sources. Due to the implementation priority which has been assigned to debt financial
instruments, these solutions refer to such instruments.
32
     As we expect, we will be dealing with such situation in the case of funds returned from Podkarpackie ROP 2007-2013.

   A lot will depend, however, on the objectives set for the regional fund and the action strategy developed for the fund, as well as determination
in its implementation, leading (in the long-term) to the development of regional fund as the key financial institution of the region, active in the
particularly deficient areas of the financial market.
35
   It is recommended that this type of activities are preceded by deeper research of attitudes/positions of financial intermediaries as to their
perception of this type of solution. If a decision is made to implement this solution, it will be necessary to consider potential promotional
activities, including identified attitudes and the level of readiness, and also terms of potential collaboration.

   We cannot really expect that those functions may be “safely” (from the point of view of the interest of the regional fund, in particular
in relation to the credit risk control) assigned to the level of LRs, without the need to create very restrictive solutions burdening the local
representatives with risk. However, even assuming that this could succeed, it would still be necessary to establish, at the level of the regional
fund, the final verification function in relation to investment decisions (and not just approval of the formal aspect of investment decisions
made by LRs).

the regional fund might be able to make
its offer easily accessible in the whole
region, maintaining the standards of
acceptable risk and conducting proper
risk management in comparatively short
time is not realistic. Therefore, there are
several important restricting factors here
that arise from the attempt to change

     Ensuring appropriate, professional staff of the Podkarpacki Development Fund is a particularly important
     issue, vital to its success. Other various assets will also be important. As follows:

            PDF must have appropriate human resources – here, we list people possessing the following experience
            and qualifications:
                 Person(s) managing the whole institution, with at least a few years of experience in a managerial
             a role with an institution providing repayable financing (bank, loan or guarantee fund, equity
                 investment funds).

      1          People designing loan products and managing ongoing collaboration with financial intermediaries
             b (2 or 3 persons). They should have experience in specific matters related to lending activities.

                 Person responsible for promotional and informational activities implemented directly and through
             c the network of financial intermediaries.

                 Person (external company) responsible for the functioning of monitoring system for the transfer of
             d funds to financial intermediaries and loan repayment.

            The fund must be equipped with hardware (computer network, server, work stations), software, remote
     2      connectivity devices, and vehicles relevant to the activities conducted.
            The provision of consultancy services for the regional fund, in particular in relation to the design of
            strategic solutions and selected operational issues: in the area of design of the model of cooperation
            with intermediaries, independent monitoring of its functioning, verification of adequacy of the financial
            products offered, evaluation of the needs of enterprises in relation to access to external financing
            sources, evaluation of financial intermediaries, forming recommendations in relation to improvement
            of the functioning of the whole mechanism (in terms of its capacity and efficiency), and also obtaining
      3     funds from external sources. An important aspect of consultancy services is also related to the assistance
            in designing regional fund organisational solutions in the scope of financial management, credit risk
            management, reporting system, public information on the effects of lending activities, in accordance
            with the European Code of Good Conduct for Microcredit Provision38 – it’s an important factor in the
            context of the ability to obtain financial support from funds provided at the European level (by the
            European Investment Fund39).

42        ACTIVITY 4 - Financial Instruments – Podkarpackie Region
     Below, we present recommendations concerning the adoption of the model of financial instruments
     implementation based on Podkarpackie ROP 2007-2013 funds.

         All activities related to the selection of one out of the three models described above (in our opinion,
         Model 3 if most relevant), should be executed after appointment of the institution responsible for funds
         management at the region-wide level and after commencement of activities described above aimed at
     1   reinforcement (provision) of that institution’s capacity. Ideally, this would occur by the end of Q2 2017. Until
         then, talks need to be conducted with financial intermediaries to establish the rules of return of funds
         from financial instruments of Podkarpackie ROP 2007-2013 and (in general) the terms of collaboration
         between the regional fund and financial intermediaries.
         When the Podkarpacki Development Fund is ready to conduct operations or it is realistically anticipated
     2   that such readiness would be achieved in relatively short time, the decision on the use of selected
         implementation model must be made (and implemented)40.
         The decision on the implementation model selection should be accompanied by the preparation of PDF’s
         business plan considering the cost of implementation of the model selected (and also – PDF activities
     3   as a whole). The business plan should be based on a realistic prognosis of the rate and volume of funds
         obtained (returned) from financial instruments of Podkarpackie ROP 2007-2013. The rate and scale of
         returns will determine the actual operational capacity of PDF41.
         The decisions on the demarcation of products offered in the region by PDF and – on the other hand – by
         BGK as the fund of funds for the purposes of financial instruments distribution under Podkarpackie ROP
         2014-2020 should be made as soon as possible. Those decisions should refer to the recommendations
     4   made in this Report, although they obviously may lead to slightly different development of financial
         instruments/products distribution (it is an opinion of the authors of this Report, however, that the proposal
         presented herein is close to the optimal solution).
         During the initial period of PDF existence, it should focus on offering support to financial intermediaries
         that will enable them to implement a limited number of financial products – this should be appropriately
     5   correlated with the planned volume of funds to be managed by the PDF (the starting point for those
         determinations should be proposals presented in this Report – two debt financing products for working
         capital needs of enterprises).




40
   A solution anticipating the use of a “mixed” mechanism, combining different implementation models, should not be ruled out. Although this
is perfectly viable, in our opinion, the use of a “mixed” variant is not advisable already at the initial stages of PDF functioning. During the “start
up” stage, the Fund should not overly complicate its proposal or its operating mechanism. This type of organisational activities/modifications
will be reasonable after full operational stability and capacity is achieved.
41
  Those matters will be agreed with financial intermediaries who are currently managing the funds invested in the financial instruments
distributed under Podkarpackie ROP 2007-2013.
