﻿Foreword
Sub-Saharan Africa, and West Africa in particular, continues to be an important destination for mining foreign direct
investment. About 60% ofthe world's discoveries of mineral resources in the past 10 years lie in non-OECD countries, and
25% of these in Sub-Saharan Africa. The West Africa region is already an important producer of gold, bauxite, and hosts a
number of large iron ore projects. If this resource sector could be used to underpin broader economic development, these
countries' prospects would be transformed.
Local content has emerged as one of the main tools to avoid enclave developments, create skills, and develop a domestic
industry and diversification. As such, local content includes both skills and the hiring of local workforce, and the purchasing
of locally produced goods and services. The use of specialised inputs, the technological complexity of the resource sector,
restrictive business conditions, such as difficulties in accessing finance, lack of relevant skills, and timing and information
asymmetry, typically constrain efficient supplyfrom the domestic or regional markets. As a consequence, the skilled labor
and a large share of the value of goods and services used in mining projects are often imported.
This 2015 version of the Practical Guide to Mining Local Procurement in West Africa addresses questions that are commonly
asked by governments, companies, and citizens in the region. How do we define and measure local procurement? Do we
create a specific policy or legislation to encourage mining companies to buy more locally? If so, what dothese look like, and
what has led to successful outcomes in other countries? Do we pick winner productive sectors? How do we best support
suppliers to developthe right capacities and standards to meet mine requirements? What institutional framework and
which actors need to be involved to deliver?
Ratherthan laying the main responsibility for increasing domestic sourcing on the mining sector, this Guide aims at
promoting a multi-stakeholder approach, in which all actors have clear roles and responsibilities.
We hope that this Practical Guide will serve as a working document for governments, industry associations, citizens,
and individual companies that wish to enhance the value created bythe mining industry in the region. We welcome
yourthoughts and comments on how it has been used and the results it has contributed to. For more information,

﻿About this guide
What is the purpose of this guide?
This document provides information, guidance and tools to support decision-making, planning and implementation of
mining local procurement in West Africa, in particular at a country level. It can be used by individual role players as well as form
the basis of consultative processes. The guide can also support regional harmonisation relating to mining local procurement.
Who should use this guide?
The guide will be most useful for key role players of mining local procurement in countries in West Africa that have mineral
resources. These role players include government, mining companies, supplier organisations, support entities, donors, and
civil society organisations.
Whilst it has been developed for mining in West Africa, some aspects may also be relevantto other extractive industries and
to other geographies outside the region.
How is the guide structured?
This guide has been organised into eight modules that each address a set of related questions that have been consistently
raised by role players.

﻿How to use this guide
The modules are designed in a way to encourage active participation by you as the user: each module will guide you
through making strategic decisions after considering international experience and gathering data to answer key
information questions.
The modules can be completed by individual organisations or collaboratively by role player groupings (e.g. Chambers
of Mines) or through multi-stakeholder processes (e.g. national multi-stakeholder mining forums).
Each module is structured into four sections, as shown below.

information
Section 1 of each module shows the strategic questions that you need to answer in order to make the critical decisions for
each module. Section 2 then presents examples from around the world, with particular emphasis on how countries have
approached the strategic issues set out in Section 1. Section 3 sets out the information requirements in order to make
informed decisions. Illustrative examples from the WALPI project (from either Liberia or Burkina Faso) are also provided here
to guide you in answering each information question. Finally, Section 4 returns to the strategic questions, presenting the key
considerations for each, allowingyou to complete the process, and answer the strategic questions.
Is there a particular order for completing the modules?
Users do not need to complete all of the modules, but it does make senseto complete some modules before others, or at
least reviewtheir content. In particular, it makes sense for Modules l and 2 to be completed or reviewed first before working
on Modules 3 to 6. For example, it would be possible for a mining companyto draft a Local Procurement Plan making use of
Module 6 without having completed the previous modules, but this process would be greatly enhanced by first considering
the overall approach (Module 1) and the key definitions (Module 2). Users can choose to complete Modules 3 to 6 in the
order that fits best with the key decisions made in Modules land 2. Modules 7 and 8 are best completed later on in the
process as they are somewhat dependent on decisions made in previous modules.

0
1. DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO FOCUS ON INCREASING LOCAL PROCUREMENT?
0
a.. Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Nature, scale and diversity of the mineral resource
* High quality and large volume of mineral resources across a nurmber of mineral groups typically lay a better foundation for sustainable
(u          local procurement
- Mine lives/activity of more than 10 to 15 years may be required to achieve significant benefits from local procurement, in particular
where suppliers do not currently meet mines' requirements (based on a 3 to 5 year lead time on supplier development)
* Local procurement is likely to be more limited during the exploration and construction phases due to the nature of the expenditure
;J          and the relatively short term timings of these phases
Wider markets
The existence of other major markets increases the viability and sustainability for mine suppliers and can help build a diverse client base.
Local business capacity
The less developed the local business and supplier community, the smaller the short-term opportunity to supply mines will be.
0
Country stability
For fragile states, the potential to deliver on local procurement initiatives may be constrained by the following factors: government capacity
and more pressing priorities, risks for mining projects becoming operational,and suppliers'willingness to make long-tern investments.
2. WHAT SHOULD BE THE PRIORITIES GIVEN THE UNDERLYING SOCIO-ECONOMIC OBJECTIVES?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Local procurement has the potential to contribute to objectives such as enterprise development, improved competitiveness,
technology and quality upgrading, citizen empowerment and local economic development. However, there may be trade-offs between
these objectives which will need to be reflected in the approach.
E.g. a focus on SMEs may exclude important larger contributors to the economy in terms of job creation; a focus on manufacturing
may inadvertently exclude important service opportunities; a focus on locally owned businesses may deprioritise local value addition.
3. SHOULD LOCAL PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES FOCUS JUST ON THE MINING SECTOR OR WIDER MARKETS?
IF SO, WHICH MARKETS?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
In cases where wider markets exist, it may also be appropriate to have a wider local procurement approach that extends beyond mining
to improve the sustainability and growth prospects for suppliers. This wider approach may be particularly relevant for market linkages
and supplier database development. This will depend on the extent to which they have similar requirements and types of suppliers.
Another consideration is institutional capacity and arrangements - would it be more practical to have a single line ministry lead the
initiative, or is there capacity and policy levers in an institution with wider reach (e.g. investment or commerce/enterprise development,
national development agency)?
4. WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE OPPORTUNITY? SHOULD SPECIFIC PRODUCTS/SERVICES OR SECTORS BE TARGETED?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Where both institutional capacity and local supplier capacity are limited, it may be more appropriate to prioritise supply sectors with
higher potential, rather than trying to develop local procurement across the board.
5. WHAT SHOULD BE THE FOCUS OF LOCAL PROCUREMENT SUPPORT EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES GIVEN THE
CONSTRAINTS TO REALISING THESE OPPORTUNITIES?

﻿6. WHAT ARE THE BEST OVERALL MECHANISMS TO DELIVER INCREASED LOCAL PROCUREMENT?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Different mechanisms to develop the approach may be appropriate for different countries.
The approach will depend on issues such as:
* Extent and reliability of publicly available information
* Resources available to develop the approach
* Willingness of stakeholders to share non-public information
* Willingness and capacity of various stakeholders to participate in a consultative approach
Processes with different final outputs will also call for different mechanisms:
* Policy, legislation, and regulation: will require formal development and consultation processes
* Social compact, charter, or Memoranda of Understanding: in the case of a multi-stakeholder agreement, greater emphasis is placed
on consensus-building or negotiation and joint ownership, with each party becoming a signatoryto the agreement
* Code of practice, guideline or action plan: mechanisms could be less formal and non-binding, or individual parties could adopt or
endorse the guidelines, also suitable for a privately-led initiative or interim measure to test out an approach
* Programmes or projects in priority areas: in existing laws, make use of institutional mandates or stakeholder agreements
Where there is strong social capital and some level of shared buy-in across key stakeholdersto a common vision, a more collaborative
approach is likelyto be both workable and beneficial. Where this is absent, it may be more necessaryto have one strong lead agency
and a more prescriptive approach, whilst still consulting with stakeholderstotryto address their needs within the approach.
Depending on the approach, different tools, projects and programmes may be appropriate.
7. HOW COLLABORATIVE OR PRESCRIPTIVE SHOULD THE APPROACH BE?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
A more consultative approach typically increases the likelihood that role players will support implementation.
However, as mentioned above, where there is a lack of shared vision, the nature of these consultations may be different, focusing on tryingto
makethe approach more workable and effective, and increasing understanding of what it will mean e.g. in terms of compliance.
It can be challenging to get key decision-makers to allocate time to participate in processes, and then sustaining consultations. It is also
challengingto find the balance between inclusivity and speed/efficiency, as well as coordinating technicaI vs. political processes.
8. WHAT SHOULD BE THE BROAD USE OF LEGISLATION AND REGULATION?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Where there is strong buy-in across key stakeholders to a common vision, legislation may play less of a role, with a greater emphasis
on mulIti-sta keholder agreements. Where th is is abEsent, it is Ilikely that legislation may be req u ired to galIva nise action.
TypicalIly policy docu ments woulId set out a broad vision aInd respons! iIities; i n some cases m ini ng pol icy docu ments may alIready set out

However, having a blanket statement as part of mining law or policy which generally encourages preference for local procurement

or being refined.
Arbitrary local procurement targets in legislation or regulation (often not clearly defined) have not demonstrated to be effective tools
to increase local procurement levels.
Experience in West Africa has shown that timing local procurement approaches to coincide with reviews of the mining law or mining
codes has been helpful in promoting active consultation on issues, and allowingfor alignment where necessary.
9. WHO SHOULD LEAD THE PROCESS?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
*Relevant line ministry based on mandates and legislation
*Availability and interest of a suitable champion
*Capacityto manage the approach
*A strong Chamber of Mines (with some sub-structure to focus on local procurement/content) has shown to greatly help facilitate
the process

Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
o
o         Required effort levels will be informed by the gap between the desired context and the current situation, in terms of issues such
as market linkages and information dissemination, supplier capacity, enabling operating environment, monitoring & evaluation
The appropriate level of effort to place on mining local procurement can be evaluated both against the potential benefit, and the relative
cost-benefit of other socio-economic opportunities and programmes in the country
Mining local procurement efforts, in particular supplier development and reporting, can take significant human and systems resources,
and in many countries this will be beyond existing institutional capacity i.e. will require additional resources.

12. WHO CAN FUND THE PROCESS?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Funders typically include line ministries, Chambers of Mines, and international donors.
Different funding options may be available forthe process of developing a local procurement approach vs. managing and implementing
the approach. For example multi-donor funded programmes could be approached to support the initial gathering of information and
consultations to develop the approach.

﻿As the country with the most advanced efforts around mini ng localI procurement in the West African region, Gh an a is a
particularly interesting case.
Ghana's mining local procurement approach                                                    "T
In 2006, the Ghana Minerals a nd Mining Act was enacted, stating that mining companies should give
procurement preference for: materials and products made in Ghana; service agencies located in the country and owned
by citizens; and companies or partnerships registered under Ghanaian Company Code or Partnership Act. The Act also
sets out requirements for employee loca lisation: hiring a minimum proportion of staff in various employment categories,
with the Minerals Commission working with mining companies to identify staff positions that can be filled
by Ghanaians, and local candidates who can be trained to replace foreign staff.
n 2008, the Minerals Commission of Ghana started to focus more on local procurement- The Commission drafted
some proposed regulations for local procurement including specific targets. They placed an emphasis on promoting
ocal manufacturing and preference for high Ghanaian participation. At this stage, the nature of this preference was not
clearly specified.
The mining industry responded to this, through the Chamber of Mines, with proposals on what they felt was the most
practical way to achieve increased local procurement; various consultations followed to try to refine the approach. They
also initiated a collaborative process of identifying high opportunity products for local supply (see Module 3 for further
detail on the approach followed)
In August 2011, the Minerals Commission, the Chamber of Mines, and the IFC signed a Memorandum of Understanding
to collaborate around mining supplier assessment and development, including their respective financial commitments.
The focus of this collaboration was around SME development.
In early 2012, an overall supplier capacity assessment was conducted, as well as individual supplier diagnostics to identify
support needs.
Regulations in 2012 (effective 2013) required development of a 'local procurement list'of products of Ghanaian content,
and submission of individual local procurement plans by the mines. The Chamber of Mines submitted a collective local
procurement plan on behalf of members in 2013. Consultations are ongoing regarding the next phase,the initiation of
a supplier development programme. Both the Minerals Commission and the Chamberof Mines have needed to increase
their resourcesto improve local procurement.
Since then, local procurement efforts are being extended to oil & gas, but with separate regulation and institutions.
Lessons learned:
*Need for clarity on the nature of preference and a definition of "local"
*Benefits of institutional capacity and effective consultations between role players- notably the regulator and the
rninrg industry; however, challeriges exist in the Ilack of represent ative orgarilsaliori of suppliers and in capacity
to review submissions Uimeousiv
*Challeriges of charigirig ecorioric conditions (e.g. decreasing gold prices) affecting willingness/capacity of mines
to contribute, and changing the nature of demnand
*Long timelines in assessing and developing su ppliers, both in terms of rolling out support programmes and the
supplier development itself
*SMF focus vs. all sizes of loxal suppliers -tension of foulsing on SMFs vs. required economies of scale to cornpet itively
manufacture some products for mines, as well as having a large-scale impact on production capacity in a country;
also need to ensu re that anti-cornpetitive practices do not emerge -eouraiging development of multiple suppliers
is rieeded, which may require irivestrnrt facilitatiori

﻿How should we define local procMINfENt given our
socio-economic priorities and Wider legis tie cntext?
What are our curre          s ofocal
procurement based,on that definition?
Stakeholders often disagree about the level of local procurement that is taking
place. One key reason can be that there is no common understanding of what
is meant by "local procurement". An agreed definition lays the foundation for a
shared approach to implementation.

One particular approach - defining local suppliers based on three core elements
Kaiser Economic Development Partners has developed an approach to defining local suppliers as a result of a number
of strategy and implementation projects conducted in Africa for the World Bank, involving extensive consultations
with governments and mines across the continent. This approach is based on the principle that there are three distinct
aspects that make up the concept of 'local':
1.                          2.                          3.
Geographical location       Citizen participation          Local content

Wider region                Employment                 tranSTration
Each of these critical elements relate to important (and different) areas of benefit to local economies: genuine
involvement of local citizens (including in partnerships with international companies), job creation through value
addition, and emphasis on the most appropriate geographical focus. See Appendix 2 for further details on how
this definition can be applied.

*          Definitions
There is no one, standardised definition of local procurement. However, many countries officially define "local" based
on the components of location, participation, and local content or value addition:

E          1. Geographical Ilocation: A requirement that the registration, incorporation, or activities of a business take place
at the regional, national, state, or "local local" level (community affected by the mine).
2.Participation: A requirement that a business be majority-owned by citizens of the country (unless otherwise noted),
or that a percentage of the management a nd/or employees are citizens of the country.
3. Local content and/or value addition: A requirement that goods, works, and services be created or provided for locally,
Q            that locally-made parts and/or labour are used, or that value is added to the product or service in-country

National and state-specific with comprehensive definitions
Captured in the "Local Industry Policy-Afair go for local industry, Interim Update 2013 (LIP)" S2, pp. 5-6;
part of the Queensland Industry Participation Policy Act 2011.
Contestable goods and services are the goods and/or services included in, or may potentially be included in,
contracts for an eligible project that can be potentially supplied from any of the following locations:
- Geographically closeto the project;
Queensland;
- Other locations within Australia or New Zealand; or
- Outside Australia and New Zealand (ANZ).
It excludes goods and/or services which are, in normal circumstances, highly likelyto be supplied from sources
geographically close to the project, or goods and/or services that are, in normal circumstances, highly likely to be
supplied from locations outside ANZ because they are not currently manufactured or provided by ANZ suppliers.
Full, fair and reasonable opportunity is the provision of equitable opportunity for capable local industry to
participate in the procurement activity by ensuring:
- Local industry has the same opportunity afforded to supply chain participants from elsewhere to participate
in all aspects of a project, includingfront-end engineering and design, and project management
- Expression of interest/tender documents should encourage local industryto collaborate in circumstances where
the project delivery requirements are outsidethe capacity and capability of a single local business but could be
delivered competitively by a number ofcapable local businessesthrough collaboration (including consortia)
- Tender documentation is free from technical requirements that might rule out local industry and is structured
in such a way as to provide local industry the opportunity to participate in projects
- For example, wherever it is practicable to do so, use ANZ standards and codes to ensure that local industry
is not excluded from the market (if ANZ standards and codes are not able to be specified, and an equivalent
to these standards and codes is used, then the reasons for adopting this approach must be explained in the
Local Industry Participation Plan (LIPP))
- As part of value for money, that due consideration in the tender evaluation is given not only to price but
also to environmental sustainability, quality and delivery, whole-oflife costs and/or administrative and risk
mitigation advantages and the advancement of the priorities of Government arisingfrom local sourcing
Local industries is defined as Australian or New Zealand small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
Small to medium enterprise (SME) is defined as an Australian or New Zealand firm with fewer than 200
full time equivalent employees.
Local content includes all value-added activities undertaken by local industry
Value added refers tothe substantial transformation of goods and a minimum of 50 per cent of production

11. ANGOLA
Emphasis on participation
As per order 127/03 of 2003, national, private, or state
companies enjoy preferential rights over foreign companies
for sourcing of goods and services. As per the law, exclusivity
to Angolan businesses is given for the sourcing of goods
and services that require limited capital and non-specialised
know-how. Activities requiring reasonable level of capital
and limited level of specialised capabilities fall under semi-
compliance preferential treatment and requirejoint ventures
between domestic and international companies. Other
activities are open for competition.

Relevant definitions within WAEMU AND ECOWAS frameworks:
As yet there are no specific definitions of local procurement within WAEMU or ECOWAS mi ning local procurement
frameworks. However:
*The WAEMU framework refers to "services and materials of Community origin, products manufactured or sold in
the Union".
*The ECOWAS framework refers to "a) materials and products of a Member State; b) Service agencies located mna
Member State and owned by a citizen (corporate or otherwise) of such Member State and/or public corporation:'
For purposes of trade and customs, there is a precise definition of "originating products", and a process for approva:
(ECOWAS and WAEMUJ rules of origin have been harmonised since 2004):
1. Unprocessed goods (e.g. animal, lplant, and mineral products) and handmade products, without the need of a
certificate of origin
2. Products that have been sufficiently worked or processed (i.e., industrial products) and are accompanied by a certificate
of origin delivered bythe identified national authorities. Forthese products, community origin is conferred according to:
2.1 Local content: goods that have been produced in member states with a minimum of 60% originating raw
materials content.
2.2 Substantial transformation, as measured by a change in tariff cassification: goodsthat are not wholly produced in
member states, but their production requires the exclusive use of materias which are classified under a different
tariff subheading from that of the finished product.
23 Value-added:goodsthat are not wholly produced in memberstates, but have received a value
added of at least 30% of the ex-factory price of the finished goods. Value-addled is defined as
the difference expressed as a percentage of the ex-factory price before tax of the industrial
product concerned and the value of raw materials, consumables, and packaging of foreign origin.
The ex-factory price used is made essentially of the costs of raw materials, consumnables, and packaging
of both foreign and community origin, wages and salaries, duties and taxes, works and external services,
and depreciation charges.
A process for certifying origin of goods is set out which is relatively complex, requiring application with supporting
documentation to the ministry responsible for trade liberahisation matters, approval by the ministry after getting
opinions from members of the National Approvals Committee, and final approval by ECCVWAS Commission based on all
documentation indcling basis for national-level approval to be transmitted by the Ministry.

To completethis electronically, please download the Workbook  ,
1. WHICH SOCIO-ECONOMIC ELEMENTS SHOULD BE EMPHASISED IN THE LOCAL PROCUREMENT DEFINITION?
E
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Mining companies, governments and other stakeholders in West Africa have adopted a wide variety of approaches for defining local
'U        procurement and these have often failed to consider important factors that will encourage sustainable economic benefits to local
citizens. Often, no clear definition is provided at all.
E         Existing definitions by mines are generally limited to locally-registered companies, locally-owned companies, or spend in the'affected
communities'.
0         Selection of elements of the definition (and how these are prioritised) will impact the focus of efforts e.g. use of employment in the
definition is likelyto result in an emphasis on job creation whilst a definition based on locally-registered companies may result in an
7i        emphasis on local business registration (which may impact tax revenues but may not impact significantly on local value-adding activity
0         or local participation). Definitions that do not include a value-add element may result in a focus on importers, which may create some
opportunities but may also increase input costs for mines rather than adding value (unless importers develop the capacityto hold
.E         appropriate stock and provide value adding services such as maintenance and after-care).
4-         Where objectives such as technology transfer, skills upgrading and increased global competitiveness of enterprises have been
QJ
a prioritised, consideration of the role of FDI could be useful (for more detail see Thomas Farole and Deborah Winkler (Eds), 2013,
-          Making Foreign Direct Investment Work for Sub-Saharan Africa, available at https://openknowledge.worldbank.org).
w         For fragile states, care should be taken that definitions do not touch on sensitivities that might reignite social divisions.
There has been general support in consultations with a wide range of stakeholders in West Africa to incorporate all three components
of location, participation and value addition into definitions.
The figure below represents the framework developed by Kaiser EDP used for categorising suppliers during the WALPI project.
FRAMEWORK FOR CATEGORISING SUPPLIERS

services provided
locally
No local participation             Full local participation
Local value-addition (along the left side) ranges from a supplier not manufacturing or providing services locally through to all
manufacturing or services provided locally Similarly, the range for local participation (along the bottom) is from no local participation,
to joint ventures and meaningful partnerships, through to full local participation within the supplier (in terms of citizen ownership,
management and employment). Each supplier is plotted against the two axes and is categorised into one ofthe nine combinations.

﻿2. WHAT IS THE BEST WORDING FOR THE OVERALL DEFINITION AND SUB-DEFINITIONS SO THAT THEY ARE
MEASURABLE E.G. THROUGH USE OF CRITERIA, THRESHOLDS OR FORMULAS?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
The choice of wording in definitions is essential as it will laythe foundation for whether or not local procurement can be effectively
measured (see Module 8 on measuring, monitoring, and evaluation).
Tools to help provide clarity and avoid ambiguity include criteria, thresholds and formulas. In order to be both realistic and ambitious,
thresholds should ideallytake into account both the current baseline of suppliers and the likely constraints/potential to improve
performance in terms of the selected elements of the definition, e.g. levels of local employment or value add.
Elements of the definition where there is existing information and reporting systems will be easier to administer, e.g. if companies already
report to government on local ownership or employment, or if mines already capture information in their procurement or invoicing
systems. However,these may not necessarily bethe most important aspects forthe reasons discussed above. Where information is lacking,
consideration should be given to defining elements in a way that takes into account ease of implementation for mines, and capacity
of verification authorities/regulators.
For example, definitions based on local content of individual transactions have been shown to be accurate but require significantly
more resources whereas definitions based on the characteristics of suppliers may require less resources.
Selecting different thresholds for mining vs. other sectors may cause confusion amongst suppliers and support entities which could
create implementation difficulties and administrative hassles.
There has been broad consensus in West Africa mining-related consultations that a system that defines local procurement as the
local content of all mines' purchases (as in Brazil's Oil and Gas sector) will be too onerous to administer, given capacity constraints
of government.
In line with the above,there has been a general positive responsetothe model proposed by Kaiser Economic Development Partners
which specifies:
1. Participation of local citizens (and other West Africans) through:
* Enterprise ownership
* Employment
* Management
Thresholds would relate to local circumstances and existing national definition. In some cases a focus on ownership alone may be
more practical given information and constraints.
2. Extent of local content and value add in the country and in West Africa:
Drawing on ECOWAS &WAEMU definitions and extendingthese principles to services, at least one of the following should apply:
* Supplier provides majority local unprocessed goods (e.g., animal, plant, and mineral products) and handmade products
* Majority of products provided by supplier are substantially transformed locally (i.e. would change categorisation from one tariff
headingto another)
* Supplier uses more than 60% local originating raw materials
* At least 30% value-add on the ex-factory price offinished goods: incl. materials, consumables, packaging, salaries, payments
to govt., works, external services, depreciation.
* Where a service provider undertakes, manages, and controls the majority of its services in country or in the region
It may also be appropriate in some context where there is less local capacityto define a "mid" category threshold for suppliers that
do not meet above thresholds but have:
* Some local origin materials
* Some products that are substantially transformed
* Some value-add, but less than 30% overall
* Some local service delivery
3. Geographically, preference for an enterprise located in the same country as the mine followed by companies in West Africa

﻿3. WILL EXISTING, AMENDED OR NEW DEFINITIONS BE USED? IF NEW DEFINITIONS, IN WHICH DOCUMENT WILL
THEY BE CAPTURED?
.0
w          Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
International benchmarking demonstrates a variety of places where definitions are housed, including in mining regulations or law,
industrial policies or strategies, and even manuals. Sub-definitions may refer to existing definitions of locally owned businesses or
national citizens.
E
Any related definitions in national mining law will need to be taken into account-if contradictory with the agreed definition theywill
w          need to be revised; other business registration definitions are also likely to be important - if suitable, these could be cross-referred as
sub-definitionsfor a local business. Changesto definitions within mining laws may have long lead times, whereas those in regulations
a          could be shorter. Changes to definitions in line ministries that are not closely involved in the local procurement effort are likelyto be very
C          difficuItto implement.
E          Ideally, definitions of value add should cross-refer to WAEMU and ECOWAS definitions of product origin.
Inclusion in regulation ratherthan law or policy could provide greater flexibility to accommodate changes if needed, as circumstances
0          change or data availability improves. This could be through the mining ministry, orthe commerce/investment ministry ifthe definition
will be used across different sectors. An alternative mechanism is practice notes or guidelines -these could either be the ultimate
7i         mechanism, or could be used as an interim mechanism to test out and refine definitions into a more workable form.
0
4. WHAT PROCESS SHOULD BE FOLLOWED TO AGREE ON THESE DEFINITIONS? WHO NEEDS TO BE INVOLVED?
QJ
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
N          Irrespective of the selected process, consultation around the definition with stakeholders can be beneficial in ensuring the definition
is workable and does not have significant unintended consequences. If the definition is within a procedure, practice note, or manual,
a less formal consultation is likelyto be required.
o
If definitions are to be included within law or regulation, then the appropriate formal process for a country will need to be followed,
e.g. legal drafting, public hearing, submission to parliament.This approach has greater power in terms of enforcement, but it may
be less flexible and take longer to formulate and implement. See also Module 5: Policy, Law and Regulation.
The least formal process of all is to use programme terms of reference by regulators, support entities, chambers of mines or supplier
associations to define priority supplier types, e.g. in terms of beneficiary types for a supplier development programme. This approach
has the advantage of flexibility, but does not create certainty or clarity, and has no legal status.

﻿2. Learning from international experience
Mining and oil & gas sectors around the world are generally at the early stages of identifying specific product and service
opportunities for local procurement. Countries with oil and gas resources appear to be slightly more advanced in this regard.
o       They often include the identification of specific opportunities as a priority action within their policy framework (e.g. Trinidad
and Tobago). Some countries have developed formal lists of opportunities (e.g. Angola, Indonesia, Libya and Nigeria.
Examples of local procurement opportunity identification in the
oil and gas sector
Angola
Angola's local content strategy in the oil and gas industry has focused both on the "Angolanisation"of the country's
workforce and procurement of local goods and services. In terms of procurement, Degree 127/03 created a list of priority
goods and services based on the level of skill and required capital, creatingthree keyopportunity groups':
1) Exclusive goods and services are those deemed "non-specialised" and require low capital -this group is to be provided
exclusively byAngolan businesses. Foreign companies could be engaged as a subcontractorto an Angolan company
2) Semi-compliance goods and services require a certain level of knowledge and moderate levels of capital - Foreign
companies that wish to supplythese goods and services can only do so in association with an Angolan-owned
company, such as a joint venture
3)All other goods and services fall within the competitive goods and services category, requiring a high level of capital
and specialised knowledge. There are no restrictions on who can provide competitive goods and services, but Angolan
companies will receive preference as long as their price is not more than 10% above that of a foreign company2.
The products and services under "exclusive"and "semi-compliance"are shown below.

﻿Indonesia314
As part of the process of drafting their initial local content policies, Indonesia created a list of goods based on the
available capabilities of domestic suppliers. TKDN (local content levels) are based on multiple factors including the origin
of materials used in production, geography ofthe producer, ownership ofthe company, and citizenship of the labour
force. Indonesia's categorisation system is based on three levels of goods for which different procurement processes need
to be followed and where domestically produced goods meet quality requirements:
1.Required/mandatory goods -There exists a domestic producer with a TKDN of at least 25% and a BMP (Company
Benefit Weight) ofat least 40%
- Domestic manufacturers with a local content level of at least 15% are allowed to bid in this category
2. Maximised goods -There exists a domestic producer with a TKDN of at least 25% and a BMP of less than 40%
- For contracts above US$100,000, domestic manufacturers with a local content level of 10% and above may bid in this
category

Ghana mining local procurement opportunity identification
Ghana's initial focus was to identify high opportunity products for local manufacturing, with a view to examining
-      the opportunities for local service delivery at a later stage. Working through the Ghana Chamber of Mines, the
major gold mining companies provided information on spend and volumes of a number of products. Products were
evaluated against a range of criteria including whether they were already manufactured in Ghana or could feasibly be
manufactured locally within a 5-10 year time period. The result of the process was the following list of 27 products
to be prioritised bythe mining sector in Ghana:
o          27 PRODUCTS INITIALLY IDENTIFIED BY THE GHANA CHAMBER OF MINES
1. Activated carbon                             15. Heavy duty electric cables
2. Ammonium sulphate                            16. Metal or PVC core trays
3. Bolts and nuts                               17. Mill liners
4. Bullion boxes                                18. Motor re-winding and re-furbishing
5. Calico bags                                  19. OTR tyre-re-treading
6. Cement products/grout                        20. Overalls & work clothes
7. Fencing, wire & mesh products                21. Plastic sample bags
8. Chemicals (caustic soda)                     22. Quick lime & hydrated lime
9. Conveyor rollers/idlers, pulleys             23. Rock-bolts & split-sets
10. Cupels & crucibles                          24. Steel products (plate, angles, brackets, sprockets)
11. Explosive supply-emulsion                   25. Ventilation ducting
12. General & speciality lubricants             26. Wood products
13. Grinding media                              27. Yelomine pipe
14. HDPE & PVC pipes
With the support ofthe IFC, the above opportunities were then assessed to establish supplier capacity, gaps and
support needs. An exercise of assessing 28 companies in 18 of the above sectors was carried out, resulting in a gap
analysis of each sector. The most competitive product groups were: overalls and work clothes, plastic sample bags,
OTR tyre re-treading, cement or grout products.
This list is currently being refined to create a list of 6-8 higher opportunity products to strongly focus on in the short-
term.These opportunities will likely form part ofthe'local procurement list, as required by Ghana regulation. It is
intended that this list of products will be removed from the mining list (as long as the required quality and quantity
can be produced locally) and as a consequence imports ofthese products will attract import duties and VAT.

﻿4. Answering the strategic questions /
Once the above information has been gathered, the following strategic questions need to be answered.
o       To complete this electronically, please download the Workbook

on
1. HOW DO STAKEHOLDERS' OBJECTIVES SHAPE LOCAL PROCUREMENT OPPORTUNITIES?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
The socio-economic objectives and sectoral priorities of a country are a key starting point for determining opportunities. For example,
-          a focus on job creation would likely favour labour intensive sectors and/or opportunities with high labour-absorption potential due to
rn         scale. Other objectives such as SME development, increasing the number of women-owned businesses, developing technology-driven
sectors or promoting exports, would all impact prioritisation of opportunities in different ways. Note that these objectives also play a key
role in determining the overall approach to local procurement (Module 1) and definitions (Module 2) which in turn also impact the most
0
appropriate opportunities to select.
Whilst regional integration may be an overall objective, in practice few countries have included regional supply opportunities as a
priority focus a Ithoug the WAEMU agreement commits members to "national treatment" of firms from the region. There is often more
political impetus to support local suppliers than regional suppliers. In addition, given the more advanced nature of the mine supply
industry in Ghana, many feel that suppliers from that country will gain disproportionately from a regional approach to opportunities.
When evaluating these options, considering the potential for clustering to provide complete solutions within the region will give a more
accurate picture of potential benefits than just considerering the first-level contracts. This is particularly true in cases where the scale
required for viable production is larger than the market of any one mining country in the region. Regional trade, investment, and mining
forums, including those organised by WAEMU, ECOWAS and the Regional Association of Chambers of Mines, present a mechanism for
identification of regional opportunities.
Mining companies also often have clear ideas on the products and services that make most sense to source locally There are frequently
a number of products and services where local sourcing would benefit the mines commercially (e.g. by reducing logistics cost, increasing
security of supply) or in terms of social license to operate (e.g. opportunities that could be met within affected communities). Mines will
also have particular views on which products and services are most likelyto be successfully provided by local companies, based on their
experiences with existing suppliers. Their priorities for local supply may also be constrained by their regional or global policies around
which product/service categories can be procured through local management.
2. WHICH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE LIKELY TO HAVE SUITABLE DEMAND TO JUSTIFY LOCAL SUPPLY?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Typically the products and services that offer the best opportunities demonstrate one or more ofthe following characteristics of demand:
* The volume and value required across the mines is significant. These products and services do not necessarily need to be the largest
purchases by the mines but they must at least have a sufficient scale tojustify capital investment for a few local suppliers.
* Demand is consistent. Products and services that are consistently required are more likelyto provide a sustainable market for local
suppliers. Products or services that are only needed during exploration or construction may not provide a sustainable opportunity for
local businesses unless a country is expected to have a longtime horizon of continued exploration and mine development. A clear
demand for at least five years is preferable. As such, it is beneficial to establish demand across mines both now and in future based
on estimates of future development of the sector
* There are often wider markets available (outside mining). These could include construction, oil and gas, agriculture, ortourism.
Multiple buyers are likelytoyield more sustainable opportunities for suppliers. It is also important to considerthe wider (West African)
regional market, in particular in cases where the scale required for viable product is largerthan the market of any one mining country
in the region.
3. IN WHICH PRODUCT/SERVICE CATEGORIES IS THERE SUITABLE LOCAL SUPPLY CAPACITY?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
The first consideration is the level of local supply for each product/service category See Module 2 (Defining local procurement and
estimating the baseline) for some specific ideas on measuring existing local supply In the areas where local suppliers are already present,
it is important to understand current capacity, e.g whether the necessary price, scale, quality, and reliability exist currently
If there are gaps in supplier capabilities, it is important to make an initial assessment of whether capacity can realistically be expanded,
and how long this would take. The expected timeframes will impact the point at which these opportunities could be realised, as well as
targeted growth rates. See also Module 4: Enabling suppliers to compete.
It is also important to ensure that there are multiple suitable local suppliers of a product or service in order to avoid inadvertently
encouraging monopolistic practices and price escalation. There are some examples in West Africa and elsewhere where prioritisation/
preference has led to anti-competitive practices where there are only one or two local suppliers.
38    | A practical guide to increasing mining local procurement in West Africa


﻿4. HOW ARE OPPORTUNITIES CONSTRAINED BY THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Constraints in the operating environment may impact on different opportunities to different degrees e.g. unreliable or high cost power
is likelyto constrain manufacturing most severely
It is important to make an initial assessment of whether these operating environment constraints can realistically be addressed.
See also Module 4: Enabling suppliers to compete. The expected timeframes for addressing these issues will impact the point at
which these opportunities could be realised.
5. WHAT ARE THE PRIORITY OPPORTUNITIES IN THE SHORT, MEDIUM AND LONG-TERM?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Once the previous four questions have been answered, a number of high opportunity products and services are likely to emerge. These
questions may interact with each other to reveal overall conclusions. For example, demand analysis will result in certain products/
services being proposed (e.g. with significant demand and wider markets). These will then be examined in terms of supplier capacity
which may refine the nature of the opportunity, requiring additional demand analysis. Similarly, a review of supplier capacity may
uncover new opportunities that were not considered as stakeholders' priorities or arose from the demand analysis.
It is important to be realistic in terms of the time frames for achieving certain opportunities. Short term opportunities are only likelyto
be realistic where there is existing suitable local supplier capacity; areas requiring significant capacity upgrading are more likely to be
medium-term; areas requiring significant changes in the operating environment are more likelyto be longer-term unless innovative
solutions can be fou nd that fast-track improvements.
6. WHAT PROCESS WILL WORK BEST TO IDENTIFY THESE OPPORTUNITIES, INITIALLY AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS?
WHO NEEDS TO BE INVOLVED?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Experience has shown that the most effective mechanism for identifying opportunities is a combination of stakeholder consultation
and rigorous analysis.
Collaborative processes which have strong involvement from mining companies as well as the supplier industry are likelyto yield the
most realistic opportunities, and result in increased local procurement by mining companies. Working sessions with a core team of
mining procurement officials can be an effective first step, because they can openly share information on requirements, thoughts
on opportunities and initial criteria for prioritisation. The outputs of these small brainstorming sessions can form the basis for wider
consultations and testing. Policy makers and officials, regulators, statistics bodies and donors may also have useful input and access to
data or prior research. When this input is combined, opportunities that individual stakeholders may have failed to identify quickly come
to the surface. These processes are often led by:
* ChambersofMines
* Market linkages support entities in the public or civil society sectors
* Mining regulators (ifthey have sufficient capacity around mining demand and supply issues)
Opportunity identification processes often build in a review process to take into account both changing demand and supply capabilities
e.g. a review every one or two years.
Process example: Opportunity identification process followed during WALPI project in Liberia and Burkina Faso.
1. Initial understanding, measurement and categorisation of overall demand: gathering data from a number of representative mining
companies on their current spend based on their accounting, vendor and invoicing systems. This data, which was kept confidential
at a disaggregate level, was consolidated bythe project team into demand across mines by standardised demand category
2. Workshops with mines' procurement officials to brainstorm local procurement opportunities: the result of the demand analysis
in the previous step was presented as background and to support the brainstorming exercise.
3. Consolidated data from the mining companies was extrapolated and scenarios used to estimate future demand levels.
4. Wider workshops were held including mines, suppliers and other stakeholders to help understand:
* Drivers of demand e.g. ore moved, number of employees
* Typical cost ranges and order volumes
* Requirements
* Challenges in supplying the mines for this product/service
NOTE: This exercise was not definitive or complete, but supported the initial steps for opportunity prioritisation by local stakeholders.
Some of the lessons learned include:
* Gathering of data from mines can be time consuming and relies on the goodwill and availability of mines'procurement officials
* Sitting with mine officials and accessing direct reports from their accounting or vendor systems seems to be the most efficient
approach, rather than sending out spreadsheets or surveys for completion by officials
* Mines may be less likely to share local procurement opportunities if these discussions or consultations take place in the context
where they expect targets to beset based on these opportunities
There are three tools offered bythis guide to assist in this area:
- Excel template for analysis of mining company demand by categories (Appendix 6)
* Initial assessment of demand for Liberia and Burkina Faso (Appendix 7)
* Opportunity brainstorming workshop -example agenda and brainstorming too (Appendix 8)

﻿How do we ensure full, fair, and reasonabe
access to opportunities?
What capacities do suppliersneed to develop
in order to compete?
How can we support suppliers to develop
those capacities and create a more competitive
operating env ronment?
In order for local supply to increase significantly, many changes
are needed so that local suppliers can compete, including:
behaviours, procedures, systems, capacities, infrastructure, and
support measures. Mines, suppliers, and support organisations a

﻿IFC and Rio Tinto in Guinea -
Increasing Local Impact in the Guinean Mining Sector9
The I FC and Rio Tinto, a multi nationalI mini ng company, are working together in Guinea to increase localI impact of the
mining sector. The I FC has a 5% share holding in Rio Tinto's Simandou iron ore project, which, as of June 2013, was the
largest potentialI private sector investment in Africa. The project lays out plans to build an iron ore mine, a port, and
700km of railway Combined, these three developments coulId completely transform the economy of the country and
improve economic opportunities for many Guinean s-To ensure that mini ng-affected communities and other Guinea ns
benefit from this project, the I FC started a pilot programme, Guinea Linkages, with Rio Tinto and Guinea Alumina
Corporation.
The I FC's Guinea Linkages programme works to reduce the gap between localI suppliers and mining companies through
five main areas:
1. Improve local supplier capacity so they are able to meet the needs of mining companies and also assist in their ability
to access financing
2-Train local trainers and consulting firms in the IFC Business Edge program so they can assist SMEs in developing
their managerial skills and improve their businesses. Courses are offered in Human Resources, Marketing, Finance,
Operations, and Personal Productivity Skills10
3. Develop the "Guinea Buy Local Program"with RioTinto to help them with their own local procurement policies and
procedures
4. Collaborate with donors, governments, financial institutions, and other stakeholders to aid in the development
of a local supply chain
5. Create a database of Guinean businesses that could supply mining companies
As of December 2012, the results of this programme have been positive and include the following:

Examples:
Electricity: Most of Liberia does not have reliable grid power, and
relies on expensive generators, resulting in power costs that can be
around four times the global average.
Credit and funding: The requirement for at least 150% collateral
makes credit unattainable for many businesses. Interest rates for
local companies can be in excess of 25%; however, foreign companies
that access credit internationally receive significantly lower interest
rates. The private equity market is very underdeveloped (with some
developmental funds) but many small businesses are not interested
in relinquishing operational control.

AND MAIN CHALLENGES TO INCREASING COMPETITIVENESS?

business registers                                         Stronger local suppliers demonstrate competency in service
delivery, preparing quotes and creative problem solving. Businesses
interested in supplying mines have noted challenges such as:
* Affordable and reliable power
* Affordable expansion and working capital
* Affordable access to inputs
* Available pool of skilled local managers
* Logistics and transport to reach the mines

Mine-supplier interactions
o         1. WHICH INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MINES AND SUPPLIERS NEED TO BE IMPROVED SO THAT LOCAL SUPPLIERS
W             CAN COMPETE?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
r_        The priority improvement areas mayvaryfor each country based on the context and the practices of the particular mines and suppliers
active there. However, experiences in West Africa to date have often raised issues about:
* Accessibility of mines'demand information and procurement processes to local suppliers, including feedback
* Lack of up-to-date and accessible databases of potential suppliers
* Reliability of local suppliers when delivering contracts
o         * Paymentterms
* Reduction of corrupt practices
2. WHAT CHANGES TO BEHAVIOURS, SYSTEMS AND CAPABILITIES ARE NEEDED TO ACHIEVE EACH OF THESE
IMPROVEMENTS?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
It is important that both mines and suppliers recognise their active roles in addressing issues, rather than a culture of blaming the other
party for problems experienced. They also need to understand their respective limitations in terms of what they have the power or the
capacity to change. Taking a "systems approach" may help both mines and suppliers see how their practices interact.
Consideration can also be given to efforts to date by both mines and suppliers to address these issues, and lessons learned, e.g.:
* What have mines already tried to do to increase the accessibility of their procurement?
* What have suppliers already doneto improve their capacityto deliver to the necessary scale, time, quality and price?
The table below provides consideration for some interactions.
Interaction     Considerations and experiences
Demand          Mines may not be able to share accurate long-term demand figures in earlier stages of development, because of
information and  commodity price fluctuations
accessibility of Mines typically prioritise consolidation ofthe supply base in the interest of efficiencies rather than extending their
procurement     databases; whereas support entities and government would preferthat theyworked with more suppliers.
processes       Consolidated tender opportunity notices can help suppliers know where to find information.
Experience has shown that email is not always used as a business tool by suppliers in West Africa; support may
be needed to change this and, in the interim, SMS communication is a useful tool. Tender Information Centres
where suppliers can access computers and submit bids can also be useful.
Supplier        Experience has shown that hiring a local citizen as the procurement manager/buying officer improves the mines'
information and  awareness of local supplier capacities.
databases       Building shared supplier databases has been shown to be a useful tool; however, care needs to be taken to
regularly update information e.g. every six months. An online portal can be useful for mines. Implementing a
shared supplier assesmenttool can also be useful (see box at the end of the section)
Reliable delivery  Placing obligations on primary contractors has helped to build the capacity of local suppliers in their supply chain,
by suppliers    and supportthem to meet delivery requirements.
It can be useful to conduct joint product testing and R&D, support for certification and development
of business processes and improvement to management and production systems.
Some countries have instituted rating systems for suppliers, which help buyers to recognise and reward more
reliable suppliers.
Payment terms   Some mining companies have implemented a policy of seven day payment to local suppliers to assist with cash
flow; others assist with up-front payment or purchasing/ pre-financing of materials.
Sometimes there are internal limitations within mines, especially in the development phase when mines rely on
head office cash transfers for operating budgets.
Reduction of    Independent supplier verification and screening can assist to identify potential exposure and risks relating to
corrupt practices  company ownership.
Decision-making procedures can also be amended to include review processes, rotation of officials and
separation of negotiator and contracting roles.
Increasing transparency of contract information, including to civil society, can assist with building independent
"watchdog" functions.

3. WHO SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING THESE CHANGES? IF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE NEEDED,
HOW CAN THEY BE SECURED?
Considerations, indluding experience from the WALPI project
Iin m ines, typicalIly there will need to be a day-to-day cha mpion withi n the procu rement manragement tea m, who ca n alIso advocate for
changes in other departments where required e.g. finance. Experience shows that the chances of successfully making changes and
maintaining new systems are improved if there is buy-in from the senior leadership in the company e.g. country director or global MD.
Suppliers will be able to make some changes internally, in other cases there made need to be additional support provided e.g. around
management capabilities and good business practices, improvement of production processes, standards compliance and certification.
Various support agencies may need to be involved. Experience has shown that support programmes tend to be more eifective where
suppliers make some contribution to the cost of the support.
Chambers of Mines, as well as supplier associations and support entities, can play a useful role in building common platforms such as
databases and information portals.
In some countries, the capacity of support organisations is weak, including public enterprise development agencies, technical standards
and certification bodies, industry associations / chambers of commerce, and private business development service providers. Capacity
building may be required so that these organisations can effectively meet the needs of mining suppliers, which may be more complex
than those of their other clients. Where the scale of need does not justify building specialist local institutions, or where this will take too
ong, it may be more effective to draw in regional or international institutions. (See also Module 7)
4. WHAT ARE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY OPERATING ENVIRONMENT ISSUES TO RESOLVE SO THAT SUPPLIERS
CAN COMPETE?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Identifying the priority issues may need to consider both how critical these issues are, as well as the extent to which they can be
iinflIuenced. Operati ng envi ronment chalIlenges often relate not just to m in ing su ppliers but ma ny other busi nesses a nd even the society
overall. Approaches are therefore often shaped by many other factors, with the needs of mining suppliers not always being a priority.
Ideally, there should be an iterative relationship between these decisions and identifying opportunity in the medium vs. long-term.
As more is learned a bout the pace of possi ble chanrge, opportu nities may sh ift i nto d ifferent ti me horizons.
5. WHAT SOLUTIONS FOR EACH OF THESE ISSUES ARE LIKELY TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE GIVEN THE CONTEXT?
Considerations, indluding experience from the WALPI project
PotentialI sol ution s may emerge from:

6. FOR EACH OF THESE ISSUES, WHO SHOULD LEAD: DEVELOPMENT OF SOLUTIONS, TESTING/PROTOTYPING,
E             IMPLEMENTATION?
E
0
o         Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
%A   In many countries there is a forum with a mandate to improve performance on "doing business" and competitiveness indicators. This is
.often a multi-stakeholder task team led by the investment authority, commerce ministry or in some cases a task team or working group
within the Presidency. If such a forum exists, it could be a good place to raise the specific issues experienced by mining suppliers.
A separate process might be needed if such a structure does not exist or is ineffective, or if the needs of mining suppliers are very
-A         different from those in the rest of the economy.
0 Ideally, the development of a solution should involve the entity responsible for final rollout, but this may not always be possible if that
Wo entity is resistant to change. In these cases, it may be necessary for those who are affected to take a lead in finding solutions, ideally
with backing from support entities.
.
Testing and prototyping can be a key step in trying out new solutions without incurring massive costs or having to change the whole
ai        system at the same time. Ideally, the testing or prototyping can involve the entity responsible for final rollout. However, where the
agency responsible for the issue does not buy into finding a solution, it may be necessary to test the new solution out through another
mechanism e.g. a short-term project with separate funding, which may either reduce the perceived risks, or help to mobilise political will
" for the change.
0    The decision of who should lead implementation relates to the fit with mandates as well as operational capacity. It may also relateto
the nature of the change required and who has influence over these, e.g. does it require changes to legislation or regulation, changes to
procedures and practices, or investments in infrastructure, systems and/or people?
Typically the first option is to start with existing institutions that are based - or are active - in the country. Secondary consideration
may be given to either partnering with international institutions or creating new institutions/agencies. Creation of new institutions
is generally a long-term and expensive exercise, often with concerns about sustainability of these organisations and challenges of
marketing them so that potential beneficiaries are aware of what they offer, and it is therefore often a last resort. (See also Module 7)
r7. WHO ELSE NEEDS TO BE INVOLVED?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
A problem-solving process is often greatly enhanced by including a diverse range of people with different experiences and ways of
thinking, including technical experts, practitioners, those who experience the problem on a daily basis, as well as people from unrelated
fields who may bring fresh perspectives.
It may also be helpful to involve experienced facilitators who can ensure that the design process takes into account user needs and yields
a workable solution. Experts that can analyse the economic or commercial feasibility of solutions will also need to help screen solutions,
Other role players and stakeholders that may need to be involved or consulted could include related line ministries, potential funders,
and support agencies, whilst taking care to avoid the outcomes being shaped by vested interests.
It may also be helpful to have a multi-stakeholder group that can regularly assess performance in identified problem areas. (See Module 8)
8. IF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE NEEDED FOR IMPLEMENTATION, WHO MIGHT PROVIDE THESE?
Considerations, indluding experience from the WAILIPI project
In some cases, implementation may be funded through organisations'existing budget allocations e.g. where existing services are
adjusted or re-oriented. In other cases, additional resources may be required for implementation. Experiences in West Africa show that
there is often funding available if one knows how to navigate through funding processes.
It may be helpful to develop a matrix of available funders -whether national funds, international donors, foundations, or corporate
investors -as well as what types of areas they support, and their funding and reporting processes. Types of funding and resources
required (whether cash or in kind contributions) may include:
*ProfessionalI fees for:
- Facilitation of idea generation
- Feasibility studies and related analysis

Government policy, law, and regulation can be important tools to formalise and
create clarity around an agreed local procurement approach. They can range
from setting out overall principles in a sector-specific or more general local
content policy to providing clear obligations and guidance on roles and
responsibilities, definitions, and reporting. They can be voluntary guidelines
or more prescriptive and can provide different incentives and enforcement
mechanisms. They can also create the basis to secure resources for support.
However, consideration needs to be given to administrative capacity, local
business capacity, overall socio-economic objectives, and potential impact on
the investment climate, as well as other legal and international obligations.

Module 1: Approach
Module I raises a number of key strategic questions that need to be answered in order to
decide on a local procurement approach, including howto encourage behaviour from all role
players that leads to increased employment, diversification, and spillovers to the local economy.
As part of these considerations, Module 1 discusses where and how policy, law and regulation
can be appropriate tools forthe approach depending on the level of formality and scope, as well
as key considerations governments may need to take into account.

﻿.0      2. Learning from international experience
Recent research by the McKinsey Institute has shown that most resource-intensive economies in the world have
local procurement legislation and regulation. As shown in the figure below, it is a mix of 'hard'and 'soft' regulation12.

mA      This research found that countries such as Angola, Brazil, Indonesia, and Nigeria have "hard" regulations with specified
quotas and targets, as well as requirements for international entities operating in countryto set up a local subsidiary.
Mozambique, Australia, and Mexico have "soft" regulations, where targets are not obligatory. Chile, Canada, Lithuania, and
0
Norway have no local content regulations; Chile and Norway used to, but they achieved their objectives and were ableto
phase them out. In its research, McKinseyfound four gaps in local content regulation across all the countries it studied:
1. Requirements seldom customised to sectors: Most of the requirements are generic and not adapted to the supply
structure of different sectors.
2. "Value pools"of higher opportunity not targeted: Opportunities with the greatest potential are not always prioritised.
In other cases, unrealistic targets have been set.
3. Time frames undefined: As an exception, Ghana has been clearer about phasing the approach to local content in oil
and gas, with increases of 10% each year for locally-made or locally-provided goods and services.
4. Lack of supporting government institutions.
More widely, it is important to note that there is limited empirical evidence to date on the achievement of desired outcomes
of the different kinds of local content policy and regulatory measures.
The type of regulation around local procurement in West Africa has evolved over time, from general principles captured
in overall law to more prescriptive requirements, often captured in regulations or individual mining agreements. Based
on WALPI experience, the main challenges that have been observed in terms of regulation are a lack of clear definitions
(see Module 2), and a lack of implementation capacity for both oversight and supplier development.
The following matrix is an overview of some of the countries highlighted throughout the Guide, capturing whether they
have hard or soft regulation in line with McKinsey's definition, as well as indicating which aspects have been included in
their policy, regulation, or legislation. Please note that not all of these local procurement legal mechanisms are working
as expected, and their inclusion here should not be taken as an endorsement as best practice.

﻿Overtime, changes have occurred in the typical coverage of policy, legislation and regulation. Initially, few policies included
supplier development and capacity building activities, but now almost halfthe countries mentioned include it to some extent.
Many countries have also historically used customs exemptions as part of their mining code and convention incentives
to mining investors. Increasingly, countries are seeking to align these mechanisms with their local procurement efforts.
The use of customs instruments in relation to mining local procurement
in West Africa
Most countries in West Africa provide special customs exemptions to mining companies as away toe ecourage mining
investment. Customs exemptions are generalIly provided under certain conditions and to certain products that may be
defined in a predetermined list (often referred to as "mining list") available centrally or in mining/concession agreements.
Mining lists and customs treatment of inputs are primarily used as tools of investment and FDI policy Only recently
have countries started to change how they are being applied to ensure they support local procurement, for example,
by removing exemptions where items are locally available and/or prioritised for local supply.
Using customs instruments to encourage support for local procurement depends on two processes: the ordinary process
by which tariff rates are set for A  products, and the exemption scheme process. As most West African countries are
members of the WAFMU customs union and/or ECOWAS (Which is in the process of establishing a customs union),
the setting of the generally applicable tariff regime happens at the regional level. The mining exemption schemes are
currently happening at the national leveL There is an attempt by WAEMU to "region aise" that process, i.e. developing the
mining list at a regional level.
Some examples of West African countries with mining lists are shown blowr highlighting the variety of approaches
followed. Fu rLher detail on these and other countries, as welli as \AAMU tariff rates, is available in Appendix 10. F.

organisations and enterprises must cause a strategy and action plan to be developed and implemented
to increase linkages between mining operations and business enterprises in Liberia.
(2) The Minister must ensure that lists ofgoods and services that have potential to be supplied by business
enterprises in Liberia and lists of suppliers of goods and services that could be supplied or adaptedfor
supply to mining operations are prepared and published.
3) The Minister may prescribe aframework for promoting, measuring and monitoring linkages and

local content and guidelines for linkages and local content plan.
(4) The holder of a large scale mineral mining licence must
(a) prepare and implement a plan for linkages and local content,
(b) in the conduct of mining operations including the purchase, construction and installation of
facilities, givefullfair and reasonable access to opportunities, to the maximum extent possible
consistent with safety, efficiency and economy to materials and products made in Liberia and
to businesses located in Liberia and in particular to businesses that are owned and managed by
Liberian citizens.
(c) share information on procurement needs and help to identify and assess the viability of suitable
products and services for local supply
(d) collaborate with and assist potential local suppliers with technical support, product testing, advice
on standards, preferential payment terms and supportfor access to finance.
* Planned accession to the WTO (spearheaded by Ministry of Commerce & Industry)
* Current review of the Constitution, including definition of a citizen (led by Constitution Review Committee)
* Review of local content requirements for the oil and gas industry also underway
As discussed above, when developing national local procurement policy, legislation and regulation, countries need to take
into account their existing regional and international obligations. The boxes below provide further detail on relevant regional
and WTO provisions.
Relevant AU, WAEMU, and ECOWAS provisions
A framework has been set bythe AU Mining Vision and Action Plan, in particularthe pillar on local content, and by
regional organisations (WAFMIJ, FCOWAS). These address both local procurement (as part of the harmonisation of
mining legislation) and areas re6evant to local procurement (trade, customs, competition law, investment, enterprise
development, sectoral policies, infrastructure programs, etc.).
WAFMU has been a customs union since 2000 and, as such, has a Common External Tariff (CET). FCOWAS has
established a free trade area since the 1993 Treaty and has recently been making progress towards the adoption of a CET
Therefore, when in pursuit of local procurement a Member country needs to take care not to impose tariffs or non-tariff
barriers or otherwise impede the movement of a good originating from another Member state.
Other areas of regional harmonisation include:
- Regional competition law in WAEMU: the constitutive treaty comprises the core competition law interdictions of
agreements and abuse of dominant position, which are further specified by regulations and directives (Fxample:
regulation 02/2002/CM/UFMOA relating to anticompetitive practices, regulation 04/2002/CM/UFMOA relating
to state aids within WAEMU, etc.). Note that due to centralised enforcement combined with institutional issues,
effectiveness of the regional competition law is limited
- Sectoral polices and harmonisation: maritime transport, agriculture, industry, telecommunications, energy, tax
system, macroeconomic policy etc.
- Regional infrastructure programs (example: WAFMU PFR) aiming to reduce friction in the flow of goods and services

﻿WTO     provisions and special treatment
Note: all West African countries except Liberia" are members of the WTO
tJ
Reevant WTO agreements include:
* Trade Related Investment Measures (TRIMs): This falls within the scope of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) and applies to all WTO members, and therefore only applies to trade in goods
-* General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS): WTO members indicate which sectors they commit to compliance
with GATS"6
* Agreement on Government Procurement: This agreement is pluri-ateral and therefore only applies to countries that
sign up to it
There are a few aspects of the above that are of particular interest in relation to local procurement in the West African
E
w3       context:
0        GATT:
* TRIMs Annexure F on Special and Differential Treatment of the Doha Work Programme Ministerial Document (2005).
This special treatment is provided to developing countries (Nigeria, Mauritania, Ghana, C6te d'lvoire, and Cape Verde are
designated Developing countries) and least developed countries (LDCs) (Benin, Burkina Faso, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-
-          Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo are all designated LDCs). The specia treatment makes provision for:
* An additional transition period for eliminating TRIMs in five years for developing countries and seven years for LDCs
GJ has now lapsed
0           The Council for Trade in Goods may also extend this period for LDCs where the member is experiencing difficulties
implementing the provision
* Introduction of new measures that deviate from TRIMs obigations was limited to a period offiveyears, provided that
these measures are eliminated by 2020.
* Local procurement measures in some cases could be considered as'providing economic assistance'under Artice XVIII
of GATT 199417
* The infant industry rationale, or declining industry argument, could apply to some industries
* In fragile states, national security might be deemed a motivation for particular economic policies/regulations,
e.g. Nigeria's local content policy in the oil and gas industry in mitigation of politica upheaval
* Under the provisions of Article X1I, XVIII: B and the "Understanding of the Balance-of-Payments Provisions of the
GATT 1994  a Member may apply import restrictionsfor balPrce-of payments reasons
*The removal of special exemptions on tariffs for imports of certain goods and services by mining companies
(e.g. mining lists) can be done without affecting international trade commitments as this simply returns a country's
trade lawto its agreed levels of tariff protection
GATS:
*As this agreement only appkiesto a country's lodged sector commitments, there may be sectors re6evant to mining local
procurement that are not covered byIthe agreement
Public Procurement
*No African country is a signatory to the Agreement on Public Procurement, ' and therefore, none are bound by its
provisions
*As government procurement is excluded from TRIMs requirements, those West African countries where mines are
concessioned through government procurement may be excluded from compliance with TRIMs obligations such as
national treatment (however, see Canadian and Indian cases below)
Cases concerning TRIMs and public procurement
Canada lost a court case in 2013 in relation to its local content requirements. The WTO (on 6 May 2013) confirmed that the
local content requirements in the Canadian province of Ontario's feed-in tariff (FIT) programme for renewable energy were
inconsistent with international trade ruIes.'5
India argued in a case brought against them that the local content clause in the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission
(JNNSM) is primarily aimed at promcting domestic manufacturing and is fully consistent with India's existing obligations
under the WTO agreements. According to the Indian government, since the JNNSM is essentially procurement of solar
power bythe government through a state-owned entitythere is no violation ofW\ATOobNigations."
Note: At time of print, there have been no cases brought to the WTO in either the mining or oil and gas sectors. There is
also recognition amongtrade scholars and practitioners that because oil, gas, and mining projects have potentially such
extraordinary impact on the economy of the host countries, these sectors need extraordinary measures, in particular in
Least Developed Countries.

﻿4. Answering the strategic questions /1
Once the above information has been gathered, the following strategic questions need to be answered.
To complete this electronically, please download the Workbook  ,
1. WHAT ARE THE PRIORITY CHANGES/ADDITIONS TO POLICY, LAW AND ASSOCIATED SCHEDULES, REGULATION,
GUIDELINES, AND PRACTICE NOTES?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
* Changes could include amendments to existing, or development of new, legal documents
* Currently there is no common approach to mining local procurement policy, legislation, and regulation across the region, which could
guide changes; however, this may develop over time
* Typically, it is more difficult to change or create new policy; regulations, guidelines and practice notes are generally easier to amend
* Mining law reviews and development of local procurement regulations are taking place across a number of West African countries,
including Liberia, Burkina Faso, and Ghana. As these legal frameworks are tested out over time, they may inform changes in other
countries in the region
* Changes may include both alignment to avoid contradictions or inconsistencies, as well as setting out the principles, definitions,
approach, responsibilities, reporting obligations, etc.
* Examples of changes covered are included in the table below, along with some considerations:
Definitions          Unclear or implied definitions have provided limited value; there have often been contradictory definitions
which create uncertainty and lack of clarity. See Module 2 for further information.
Some countries have chosen to include definitions in regulations or practice notes ratherthan in law.
This provides greater flexibility and abilityto respond to changing circumstances and lessons learned.
Scope or application  Clarity on who the provisions applyto is important, e.g. stages of mining, other extractive industries,
categories of mining licence.
Access to            This may include requirements for regular updating of vendor registrations, open tendering, advertising,
opportunities        and, in some cases, a central portal for procurement information and/or submissions. Care should be taken
that provisions are workable for mining companies and suppliers, i.e. they do not introduce significant
administrative burdens or delays.
Approach to          For example, equal treatment, margin of preference, or set asides. Phrases such as "to the maximum
preference           extent possible"and "being equal on price, quality, and reliability"are difficult to independently verify and
therefore are of limited use. Percentage allocations for margins of preference are difficult to apply given the
wide variation in types of goods and services, some of which are more commoditised, others having wide
variations in pricing. Often this preference is required to "flow through"to primary contractors. Set asides
may have unintended consequences resulting in uncompetitive practices and pricing by suppliers.
Priority products/   Lists that have been developed in consultation with the mining industry and suppliers have been shown
services for local   to be more realistic and achievable.
procurement         It is likely that these lists will need to be updated either annually or every fewyears. Inclusion in core
legislation is therefore not likelyto be appropriate. Inclusion in schedules or annexures to legislation,
or guidance notes that can be more easily updated might therefore be more appropriate.
Note: Care should be taken to align any mining list provisions to avoid a disincentive to source locally
Objectives, measures, Clear objectives and measures can be helpful to ensure there is a common understanding of what
and targets          stakeholders want to achieve.
However, arbitrary targets in lawor regulation have been shown to be ineffective astheycan often not
be achieved in reality, which can undermine legitimacyofthe local procurement effort.They can also be
difficultto enforce, such as in Guinea's new Mining Code. Therefore, it may be more practical to set out
clear overall objectives within policy, and for mines to set targets and report on their progress against
these, based on a thorough demand and supply analysis, e.g. as part oftheir local procurement plans.
See Module 6for further information.

﻿Priority types       These priorities would reflect socio-economic priorities and the selected definitions. See Modules land 2
=           of suppliers         forfurther information.
Priority categories may include:
* Location
- Local participation: ownership (local/JV), management, and employment
* Value-addition
- Size of supplier, e.g. SME, large
- Sector
o           Transitional         Where stability or grandfather clauses exist that affect local procurement provisions, it would be helpful to
4a          arrangements          provide clarity on how alignment will be achieved overtime. In some cases, new regulation or guidelines
could clarify existing obligations.
Reporting             Examples of reporting requirements include submission of local procurement plans by mines. See Module 6
requirements         forfurther information.
W
0                                It is helpful to have clear guidelines on: structure, frequency of submission, feedback or sign-off processes
O
'J                       Whilst some countries have put in place penalties for non-submission, care needs to be taken that
O
usubmission and feedbacktimings are realistic forthe capacity of both mines and the regulato and that
any penalties encourage behaviour that supports ratherthan detracts from local procurement efforts.
LA
In some cases, regulations provide forms ortemplates for submission.
Local procurement requirements are often specified as "flowing throughto primary contractors; in such
0                                cases it would be helpful to clarify howthis obligation is dealt with in terms of reporting.
Nature of support!   These may include both supply-side measures (supporting suppliers to become more competitive,
support programmes   comply with minestechnical requirements, and upgrade skills and technology, includingthrough JVs)
and demand-side measures. (See Module 4for more detail). Demand-side measures include policies
and regulations to encouragethe choice of local suppliers" by the mining companies.
Incentives and       This may include alignment of existing incentives or creation of new incentives, e.g. supplier support
financial instruments  incentives, ring-fencing of a portion of royalties to support local procurement or supplier development
specifically, and/or creation oftargeted funds.
Institutional        This may include allocation of responsibilities to existing entities orcreation of new agencies, depending
arrangements         on availability of suitable capacity It may also include the creation of multi-stakeholder forums, task teams,
and roles            or working groups to further develop and implementthe local procurement approach. See Module 7for
more detail.
Note: not all ofthese items are covered in every country and this is not an exhaustive list. This is also not a recommendation ofthe
structure ofa law in anygiven country

﻿2. IF CUSTOMS INSTRUMENTS (E.G. MINING LISTS) ARE ALREADY IN PLACE OR ARE BEING CONSIDERED,
HOW CAN THESE BE ALIGNED TO OPTIMALLY SUPPORT LOCAL SUPPLIERS?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
* The approach will need to remain compliant with regional and international trade obligations (See fact boxes in previous section)
* Various definitions of local suppliers will have an impact on customs issues, e.g. a focus on locally value-adding suppliers or a focus
on use of local inputs or raw materials
1. If suppliers are likelyto be reliant on inputs that are not readily available locally, extension of miningtariff exemptions to local
suppliers can help to level the playingfield.
2. Where local manufacturing is prioritised and possible, consideration may be given to removing such items from the mining list to
avoid a disincentive to source locally Consultations with Commerce departments and industry associations can assist in assessing
available capacity; consultations with competition authorities (if present) can also assist in seeking approaches that do not have
unintended consequences for competitive practices.
* Consistency ofterminology and definition of items by HS Code can help to avoid ambiguity

3. HOW SHOULD THESE CHANGES BE SEQUENCED AND WHAT ARE THE LIKELY LEAD TIMES?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
* This will need to take into accountthe typical lead times reflected in the information questions in order to be realistic
* In addition, sequencing will need tofollowthe national legal process sequence, e.g. regulation follows law, which follows policy; initial
drafting, consultation, finalisation by state law advisors
* Experience in the region has shown that processes can take manyyears and some have not been finalised. Therefore, consideration may
o.          need to be given to use of processes with shorter lead times (e.g. practice or guidance notes) to provide clarity in the interim period

4. WHAT LEGACY ISSUES FROM EXISTING AGREEMENTS WILL REMAIN FOR THE LONGER TERM, AND HOW CAN
THESE BEST BE DEALT WITH?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Depending on the content and status of existing individual mining agreements, there maybe inconsistencies, e.g. in the nature
and timing of reporting:
- If the new provisions around local procurement are not substantively different, changes could also be considered as clarification
- Changes could potentially be addressed through mutual consent and written confirmation if needed, or waiting forthe next
review period
5. IF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO AMEND OR DEVELOP LEGAL DOCUMENTS, HOW COULD THESE
BESECURED?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
A scan of existing institutions and donors providing technical support and funding for policy, legal and regulatory work, and
drafting may reveal a shortlist of organisationsto approach
- GEEDR is hosting a global public-private partnershipthe Extractive Indlustryfor Local Content Development (EILCD).
The partnershipwill provide supportto practitioners in both public and private institutions and serve as a knowledge creator
and hubfor resources relateddto local content inmthe oil, gas, and mining industries
- For example, in Guinea, there are discussions between donors regarding the financing of local procurement activities

﻿6. IN EACH CASE, WHO CAN LEAD THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING AND AMENDING THE NECESSARY POLICY,
LEGISLATION, REGULATION ETC.?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
*Typically lead entities have included mining ministries, mining regulators/minerals commissions, concession management and
oversight bodies, and ministries of commerce/industry
*Champions of legislative reform ideally need to have an understanding of both the legislative processes and the implementation issues

﻿2. Learning from international experience
There are very few well developed local procurement plans in the mining sector globally Individual mining companies'
E      strategies and policies exist but these often lack detail in relation to specific actions steps, targets, and definitions, and
are not clearly integrated into day-to-day procurement operations. The box below provides an example of one of the more
comprehensive approaches.

Anglo American Local Procurement Strategy for Quellaveco site in Peru22
In 2010, Anglo American announced plans to develop a copper deposit in Quellaveco site in the Moquegua region of Peru.
M.. The site is in an area of Peru where communities have had negative experiences with mining companies in the past, so a
E        decision was made to develop a local procurement strategy for the mine to expand the developmental impact of Anglo
0
American's supply chains and help secure the mines'social license to operate.
The process was led by Selma Fernandes, a supply chain expert within the Anglo American group, with the support of
the senior management team who had also supported Selma's relocation to the site in order to better engage with
-        stakeholders, facilitate research and consultations, and develop an appropriate strategy The process drew on the tools set
%0       out in AngloAmerican's Socio-economic Assessment Toolkit (SEAT).
The focus of the local procurement strategy is on "localised" procurement, i.e. within the community affected by the mine.
0
As part of the engagement process, a series of workshops were facilitated in 2011 between potential suppliers and
community members. At these workshops both the opportunities available, and critical Anglo American requirements
around safety and competitiveness of suppliers were dialogued.
A template for the strategy was developed through various iterations, including:
* Business case
- Demand-side analysis
* Supply-side analysis
- Priority opportunities for local procurement and supplier development (gap analysis)
* How to ensure accessibility and visibility of priority opportunities
- Building local SME capability
* Building internal capacity (resources, procedures, processes and systems, KPIs)
* Risk assessment (to both host communities and the operation)
- Stakeholder engagement
* Exit strategy
A dedicated local procurement coordinator has been appointed to manage the implementation of the strategy
The coordinator's roles include;
suppliers identified)
* An intensive campaign to identify competent suppliers in the region (Over 1200 localised suppliers identified)
- Managing local supplier development programmes aimed at improving standards, security, and administrative
services, with results measured in terms of increased productivity and sales
* Development of a reporting framework, and management of monthly social reporting by contractors
- Convening a series of business networking events in partnership with the local Chamber of Commerce
* Development of a communication strategyto local suppliers, including radio and television spots
- Development and implementation of feedback mechanisms between mines and suppliers
The templates for the local procurement plan, along with lessons learned have been adapted and developed into a
'Local Procurement Toolkit'which is now being rolled out across the Anglo American group. The aim of the Local
Procurement Toolkit is to provide resources to implementation teams across various operations which will ensure
consistent delivery of high quality local procurement engagements.
The development of the mine is sti being considered, with further investigation of the economic case, as Anglo seeks
ways to lower its capital costs in light of the prevailing copper price, with potential start up in 2016.
There is little evidence of combined local procurement plans across mines within a country or region. One exception is
Ghana where, in response to new regulation, the Ghana Chamber of Mines produced a joint Local Procurement Plan for
the gold mining sector in 2013.This enabled identification of shared opportunities and support programmes. There has
been some subsequent discussion about individual mining company submissions.

﻿M       4. Answering the strategic questions
r_      Once the above information has been gathered, the following strategic questions need to be answered.
E       To completethis electronically, please download the Workbook  ,
2         1. AT WHICH LEVEL SHOULD LOCAL PROCUREMENT PLANS BE PREPARED (MINE, COUNTRY OFFICE, CHAMBER
-            OF MINES ETC.)?
.o        Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
The most appropriate level for the local procurement plan will depend on issues such as:
0..         The main level at which procurement is taking place, e.g. at the mine level or at the country office
E           The availability of suitable planning and implementation capacity, including whether there is any capacity in a Chamber of Mines
0
U *Any regulatory requirements, e.g. if mining agreement specifies mine-level reporting
2. WHO SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LEADING THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN, AND
WHO SHOULD BE CONSULTED?
%0
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
0         Experience has shown that the procurement division should be central to the development and implementation of the plan, with some
input from other divisions, e.g. finance, corporate social responsibility, and government liaison divisions.
Consultations with communities and suppliers (including primary contractors, current and potential local suppliers) can be valuable to
test out potential focus areas and support measures.
A motivated internal champion is keyto successful development and rollout, eitherfrom procurement management or more senior
company leadership.
3. WHAT SHOULD BE THE LOCAL PROCUREMENT PLAN DOCUMENT'S STRUCTURE?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
The WALPI process has developed a proposed template for a Local Procurement Plan, which is available for download as part of this
guide [ (See the summary of the proposed structure on the next page)
4. HOW OFTEN WILL IT BE UPDATED OR PROGRESS REPORTS SUBMITTED?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Reporting and updating cycles are likely to depend on:
* Any regulatory reporting cycle requirements e.g. annual or quarterly reporting
* Company reporting cycles e.g. annual reports to society, quarterly reporting on performance indicators
* Available capacityto prepare reports (limited capacity is likelyto necessitate less regular reporting, or more automated reporting systems).
5. WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES TO COMPLETING THE PLAN AND HOW CAN THEY BE OVERCOME?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Experience has shown that challenges often include:
* Availabletime of mining officialsto develop and roll out the plan
- Often local procurement is only one aspect ofthe procurement officers' responsibilities
Lack of experience of procurement officers in writing local procurement plans or similar plans
Lack of integration of systems and processes between units within the company, e.g. procurement vs. finance vs. CSI
Often there is a lack of clear guidance on the structure and process
Lack of readily available information on supplier capacity
6. HOW CAN CONSISTENCY BE ENSURED (GIVEN VARYING INDIVIDUAL COMPANY APPROACHES)?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
A common approach to developing local procurement plans among mining companies in a country will not only support collaboration
across mining companies, but will also provide regulators and wider stakeholders with a tool to facilitate collaboration on support
efforts, and to oversee and monitor progress.
Consistency can be generated by providing a clear framework for a local procurement plan - depending on the context in a country; this
could be through the Chamber of Mines (through agreed guidelines or joint planning) or the mining regulator (through practice notes,
guidelines, or regulation).
In some cases, multinational mining companies may have internal guidelines for local procurement plans or strategies.

﻿How can we work across multiple organisations to deliver
on the various aspects of our local procurement approach?
How do we ensure our organisations have the capacity
to implement the approach effectively?
A lack of corinto aross the key role players can create co nfusion,
mixed messages and' inffctive delivery of mining local procurement efforts.
In practice, coordination1has many challenges given multiple institutional
mandates, interests and ways of working. Insufficient and/or inappropriate
capacity to implement has often been the weakness of mining local
procurement approaches in the past, in particular in developing countries.

Coordinating implementation
and building institutional capacity
1. Key strategic questions to consider
Many institutions need to be involved to deliver on local procurement efforts. In order to begin coordinating
implementation and developing institutional capacity, the following questions should be addressed:
This module provides resources to help you answer the above strategic questions, by sharing international experiences
(Section 2), setting out information requirements (Section 3), and providing key considerations in relation to each question
(Section 4).

﻿2. Learning from international experience
Leadership and roles in implementation
Mining local procurement efforts to date have typically been led by either the extractive industries ministry or regulator
(e.g. Ghana, Brazil) or the ministry/department responsible for commerce and industry (e.g. Australia Local Content Units
in the Departments of Commerce nationally and at the state level). However, other entities that have been centrally involved
.45
or led specific programmes have included:
* Agencies promoting national competitiveness, technologytransfer and innovation (e.g. CORFO and regional development
.r        agencies in Chile)
* Extractive industry companies/Chamber of Mines (e.g. Sherritt in Madagascar, Mozal in Mozambique)
.o* Investment councils or commissions
Occasionally a specialist agency has been developed with the sole purpose of developing local content, for example
Kazakhstan's National Agency for Development of Local Content (NADLoC). In Trinidad and Tobago the Permanent Local
Content Committee (PLCC) is responsible for leading local procurement. It includes representatives from several private
sector organisations, includingthe South Chamber of Industry and Commerce (the representative bodyforthe energy
EJ     services sector.)
E
a      Where certification has been selected as an approach, this capacity is often located within the private sector, for example
E      Chile's Antofogasta industrial Association which has led certification of suppliers in Antofogasta. Certification also requires
on verification or accreditation agencies within government, e.g. Brazil's National Agency for Oil, Gas, and Biofuels; South Africa's
4-      new Local Content Verification Office (housed in the Bureau of Standards).
Other specialist roles may be required, e.g. supplier development, training, market linkages; depending on the institutional
o       landscape these have used existing institutions or created new ones e.g. Australian Industry Capability Networks at the state
level. The private sector, donors and NGOs also play a leading role here, for example the IFCs SME linkages programmes or
-       Building Markets (in Liberia).
Coordination mechanisms
0      In some cases, the body responsible for mining regulation acts as a coordinating mechanism across government stakeholders
relevant tothe mining sector For example in Ghana,the Minerals Commission plays the role of coordination across various
government departments involved in licensing or regulation ofthe mining sector.
In some countries, specialist coordination structures have been developed, such as multi-stakeholder local content
committees or cross-government local procurement boards (e.g. Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board,
Trinidad and Tobago's Permanent local content committee), whether for mining or across multiple sectors.
In other cases,the function of coordination has been allocated to a dedicated government agency or unit within a
department. The Chambers of Mines in some countries have played a key role in coordinating aspects of implementation
relating to mining companies, such as opportunity identification, access to information, and supplier development.
Multilateral organisations also play a coordinating role byfacilitating stakeholder discussions.
The institutional frameworkthat is developed is dependent on the policies, laws and regulations, which govern local content
requirements, as well as the institutional landscape and capacity within in a country.
Capacity building
A number of bodies responsible for supporting local procurement have developed significant capacity for implementation.
These include CORFO (which leads many programmes supporting private sector development and investment) and regional
Industrial Associations in Chile. Some of CORFO's successful capacity development has been attributed to its relative
autonomy, as decisions and recruiting are less subject to political influence.This means that it can attract professional staff
based on merit. In addition, ittargeted the development of strong stakeholder relationships within Chile and internationally

﻿4. Answering the strategic questions
U       Once the above information has been gathered, the following strategic questions need to be answered.

o
.45
.t         1. WHO SHOULD LEAD LOCAL PROCUREMENT EFFORTS - OVERALL AND FOR EACH ASPECT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Mining regulators often play a central role in designing, implementing and monitoring regulation relating to local procurement.
This means that they may be well-placed to lead local procurement efforts, in particular in terms of mine reporting (e.g. in Ghana).
However, WALPI research and benchmarking shows that it is key for mining companies to be strongly involved in supporting local
procurement efforts -with Chamber of Mines /individual mines often playing a leading role.
_         Also, in cases where the local procurement approach extends beyond mining to other sectors, it may be appropriate for the lead
0
to be taken by a commerce, industry or investment department, agency, or commission.
Typically mining regulators do not have suppliers development capacity Where the local procurement approach includes supplier
E         development, the lead entity for this aspect could be selected from existing enterprise development entities, whether public, private
E
e         or non-profit. Selection ofthe lead could take into account their resources, willingness and client base.
E
2. WHAT MECHANISMS SHOULD BE USED TO COORDINATE IMPLEMENTATION?
C
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
o         Potential mechanisms include:
0
* Multi-stakeholder committees -these can be informally orformally constituted, either with a single chair person or a rotating chair
person (depending on the selected format, the legal standing and enforcement authority would differ)
* An existing unit within government or a Chamber of Mines allocated the coordination responsibility (which would need to have
good relationships with other organisations involved in implementation)
* Creation of a new agency (which may not be preferred given the lead times and resources required)
0
3. GIVEN EXISTING ROLES AND CAPACITIES, WHAT ARE THE MOST CRITICAL GAPS TO ADDRESS?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Experience in West Africa has shown that the following are often where the most significant gaps lie:
* Inter-governmental and government-industry communication systems
* Information management and evaluation systems
* Supplier industry organisations
* Chambers of Mines'capacity relating to local procurement (with the exception of Ghana)
* Supplier development capacity at a level suitable for mining requirements, in particular in terms of private business
development services
When considering which gaps to prioritise, one factor may be whetherthese gaps will hinder achieving shorter-term objectives of
the local procurement approach. Often the capacity of the regulator and Chamber of Mines are considered highest priority, as supplier
development support can be dealt with in the shorterterm by donor-funded programmes.
4. WHAT ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS TO BUILD INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY (PEOPLE AND SYSTEMS)?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
There are a limited number of examples from international experience relating to building institutional capacity in local procurement.
However, drawing from available lessons from both within and outside ofthe sector, the following can be considered:
* Sharing experiences between countries, e.g. information exchanges
* Integration of capacity from the private sector, e.g. through multi-stakeholder committees, secondments
* Integration of capacity from civil society, e.g. in terms of information gathering, supplier development
* Locating implementation units in departments with strong influence, e.g. Office ofthe President
* Organisational development, systems development and training support from donors

﻿2. Learning from international experience
Very few countries have accurate information on their baseline before they start their local procurement approach, as there
is generally no agreed upon definition or consistent data gathering mechanism in place priorto the implementation ofthe
approach. Available information tends to be based on reports from mines, associations, or enterprise support agencies, which
a      may have inconsistent definitions and levels of information sharing. As a result, baseline local procurement estimates vary
significantly For example, findings from a 2014 survey of 15 World Gold Council members indicated that at least 80% of
procurement spend was in the country of operation (available at http://www.gold.org/gold-mining/economic-contribution/
value-distribution). In contrast, research on Newmont in Ghana showed that the "actual value-contributed"to the local
0      economy by the top 100 suppliers was 17% in 2010.
E
bB      Monitoring and evaluation approaches in the mining sector are evolving, overall and in terms of local procurement. In some
cases measuring may be limited to within targeted supplier development initiatives, for example in Mozambique and Chile.
South Africa provides an example of a more comprehensive system (although focused on Broad-based Black Economic
Empowerment ratherthan local procurement) where certification of suppliers based on a scorecard approach is used. In
Mongolia, civil society observers, who are part of a network established to monitor public procurement, have joined in public
procurement bid evaluation committees as observers, butthis does not seem to have been extended significantlytothe
monitoring of mining procurement.
Monitoring and evaluation has historically been more well-developed in oil and gas sectors. For example, strong data gathering
mechanisms have been in place for a while in Brazil's oil and gas sector, which uses certification of the level of local content for
specific inputs (goods and services). This approach shows the resource intensity of administering a highlyformal certification
approach. However, countries with recent oil and gas local content regulation also lag behind in monitoring and evaluation.
For example, in Nigeria, the monitoring and evaluation of local content in the oil sector has been criticised for lack oftransparency
(both in award of contracts to oil producers and to suppliers) and for a lack of clear definitions of local procurement.

Certification to support local content M&E
Brazil's oil production was 2.7m barrels per day in 2011, m aking it the world's twelfth l argest petrolIeum producer. It
also produces 438 bill Iion cubic feet of naturalI gas per day WhilIst it has a growing mining industry, localI content policies
currently focus on the oilI and gas sector. The NationalI Petroleum Agency, AN P, is the main fedleralI entity responsible for
regulating the oilI and gas industry, as wellI as negotiating and monitoring oilI and gas concessions.
Prior to 2003, AN P relied on concession contract provisions to support M&E. In 2003, AN P introduced specific rules
regarding the reporting and monitoring of locaI content (in Ordinance 180/2003). In 2007, ANP introduced the Loca
Content Certification System, which establIis hed localI content rules for all contracts signed since the 7th bidding round.
Currently, AN P carries out M&E through reporting by oilI and gas operators every 3 months, supported by the certification
system to valIidate l evels of localI content. As such, the AN P's role in monitoring localI content includes the following:
*Issuing of templates for certification and reporting
*Setting minimum requirements and criteria
*Accrediting, monitoring and auditing certification entities
*Monitoring concession agreements
*Monitoring and evaluating local content commitments
*Applying penalties in the case of non-compliance
*Monitoring trends in local content for each type of good and service
Certification
Under the certification system, ANP accredits private certification entities to certify levels of local content-there are
currently 21 ANP-accredited certification firms. By 2011, over 7,500 certificates were issued that stated the percentage of
ocal content in the particular good or service. These certificates were issued to 400 local providers, which is evidence of
over US$2 billion worth of investment in Brazil. The National Organisation of the Petroleum Industry (ONIP) is a leading
certifier and has developed a register of more than 2,000 qualified suppliers of goods and services across the oil and gas
production chain,

Measuring the employment impact of mining local procurement
E_ conomic growth and job creation are often key objectives of mining local procure me nt strategies. However, measuring
M   and monitoring the valIue-added and jobs created by procurement to the mining sector or to a particular mining company
.r-      is not a straightforward process.
o
.t One of the main reasons for this is that local suppliers "re-spend"the money they receive from orders placed by the mining
0 company when they pay their employees, buy inputs from local companies, and make investments in production capacity.
E   Suppliers'spending generates further production by their own suppliers, and further spending by both suppliers'suppliers
bB  and employees. In each round, further value is added (distributed as wages paid to workers, taxes paid to the government,
and corporate profits earned by owners), and further jobs are created.
(UAs such, the mining company has "direct," "indirect," and "induced" impacts. The "direct" impacts are those associated
2with the operation of the company, i.e. employees and purchases of the company The "indirect" effects are those resulting
- from the activities of the company's suppliers and, in turn, the suppliers'suppliers. The "induced" impacts are those
a0 stemnming from all the local employees (of the mining company, of its suppliers, of its suppliers'suppliers, etc.) spending
3their income.
gFrom an economy-wide viewpoint, the same principles can be applied to the mining sector as a whole. Procurement
expenditures made by the mining sector are sales to the procuring industries, and translate into wages, taxes, and
purchases of inputs from other enterprises- These sales then translate into wages, taxes, purchases of inputs, and so on.
In the end, the value added and the jobs created by the mining company (or mining sector) in the country, can be
expressed as a multiplier of the direct value added and employment of the mining company (or mining sector). Each time
there is a "leakage" outside of the country, in the form of procurement expenses, wages, or profits paid to foreign economic
agents, there is a reduction in the overall impact and consequently the multiplier. Therefore, leakages in the early rounds
have higher consequences than in later rounds.
At the mining company level, attempts to measure employment impact are generally limited to first round indirect
impact- Mining companies that have active local procurement or local supplier development programmes typically
collect information on the number of jobs created by their local suppliers or jobs associated with specific contracts
(e.g. Ambatovy in Madagascar).
Measuring the full indirect impacts and induced impacts is generally done using economic input-output modelling, but
requires the involvement of professional economists and the availability of detailed data from the mining company or
mining sector and countrywide economic data. For example in Ghana, a study conducted for over six months on the
"The Socio-Economic Impact of Newmont Ghana Gold Limited"" estimated a job multiplier of 3.8 in the direct value
chain of Newmont Ghana, and a total of nearly 50,000 jobs created, or a multiplier of 28 relative to Newmont's own
employment of 1700. The study consisted of a simulation using the cashflow statement of Newmont and a social
accounting matrix of Ghana, which is a statistical representation of the relationships between the economic actors
(i.e. transactions between industry sectors, households, government, and the foreign sector), to derive output per sector
It also used the employment intensities of the different sectors to derive impact on employment.
In another case, the total job multiplier at the Yanacocha gold mine in Peru has been estimated at l4 times; and a study
by the World Bank found that in Africa, the job multiplier is often in the region of 8-10 times.
A key factor that influences the potential job multiplier in West Africa is the existence of a large informal sector, which is
ess efficient and more labour-intensive. Mining companies tend to work directly with formal suppliers, but as one moves
into the informal sector,job creation is significaritly increased. The potential impact on society and poverty-reduction
is further compounded by the high ratio o the coverall population to th1e activel employed people; rnearning tha t each
worker supports a higher number oflpeople relative to othier parts of the world. Stakeholders sometimes perceive this
dynamic at theC "oloal level, as one hears often thait even asmal contract for the rnining companyt a0 local supplier
could rnean a big diffrence in the lives of rnry people in the cornmunity.
Focuslng alorie on the0 totld number ofjobs created as an indicator is urilikelyt be BCoptimal in the mnedium rn onrg termn.
For sustainable growth arid structural trarisformation to occur, higher productivity activities need to develop alongside,
or in replacement of, low-productivity, high-employment activities. Mleasuririg suppliers by their average wages, average
value-added, or the rnurnber ofjobs are options, but some may find the data colletion anid processinig requirements

﻿0 4. Answering the strategic questions /
Ti Once the above information has been gathered, the following strategic questions need to be answered.

No local participation             Pull local participation
The table below provides further detail on how two elements within the supplier aspect of the definition would play out into
measurement requirements.
Element             Implications for measurement requirements
Citizen participation  Information requirements:
levels in supplier     Official ownership registration e.g. shareholder certificates
company:               Verified actual current ownership
* Ownership            Management (as per definition, standardised agreed levels defined as management): organisation
* Management          chart and verified citizenship
* Employment           Employees on payroll and verified citizenship; payments to contract workers, records of their citizenship
Measurement process would need to cover:
*All businesses confirmed as supplying exploration and mining companies or primary contractors in the
cou ntry in a given yea r
Local value-add      Information requirements:
by suppliers:          Main products and services provided to the mining sector by each supplier
* Local inputs        In the case of products, to assess substantial transformation in the case where products have imported
* Substantial         components:
transformation       - For unprocessed products, wherethese are sourced
- Local service       - For processed products, value and source of inputs
delivery            In the case ofservices,the location ofwhere a service provider undertakes, manages, and controlsthe
majority of its services
The measurement process would need to cover all businesses confirmed as supplying exploration and
mining companies or primary contractors in the country in a given year.
82    | A practical guideto increasing mining local procurement in West Africa


﻿Based on the experience of the WALPI process, additional information (often already captured in mines' procurement systems)
would include:
- Nature of product and service
* Value of product / service provision to the mining sector
- Nature of demand to allow for tracking local procurement across different types of demand, e.g. exploration, mine development,
mine operation
- Date of supplyto allow fortracking over time
Alignment of data gathering and measurement with other initiatives in other sectors and public procurement may help to make data
gathering more efficient in the medium term. Alignment with data gathered in other countries also allows for comparison and learning.
2. WHAT ARE THE MAJOR DATA GAPS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Although data on companies' registered location is often readily available, there tends to be less publicly available and consolidated data
on the participation of citizens and even less on the level of value added locally
A phased approach to filling data gaps could be taken, for example:
*  Initially categorising spend / suppliers to assess levels of local procurement, and then measuring actual levels/quantities of local
procurement dimensions (e.g. "substantial transformation" vs. % value added)
- Measuring local procurement for the majority of procurement spend e.g. suppliers accounting for 90% of spend
In addition to local procurement tracking, M&F can also track progress in implementation and outcomes, and inform changes in
approach, relating to local procurement support initiatives. There are likely to be information gaps in many cases around programme
performance and impact.
3. WHAT ARE THE KEY M&E PRIORITIES, GIVEN THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES/CAPACITY? HOW DOES THIS PLAY
THROUGH INTO SPECIFIC INDICATORS?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Given capacity limitations and data gaps, M&E efforts could be prioritised based on:
* Highest priority socioeconomic objectives (see Module 1)
- Tracking highest priority product/service opportunities or largest areas of spend (see Module 3)
* Assessing impact of support efforts so as to inform changes
A priority in the short-term would also be to refine the baseline level of local procurement (see Module 2).
4. HOW BEST CAN M&E INFORM IMPROVEMENT OF SUPPORT?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Indicators related to implementation of support programmes can also be tracked and evaluated. An open approach to reflecting
on both successes and failures can support learning from implementation experience to refine the design and rollout of the approach
and specific programmes.

﻿0          5. WHAT INFORMATION WILL BE GATHERED FROM WHOM?
Conidraton, icldin eperene fomthe WALPI rjc
>Using information requirements of the WNALPI fra mework as a n example, the fol lowing information sources could be drawn on:
Element                 Potential information sources
Citizen participation     Ownership:
0          levels in supplier        - Business registration databases
company:                  - Vendor registries, registration processed and vendor validation/certification
o            Ownership               - Supplier questionnaires by support agencies
E             Management             - Details related to membership of industry organisations
b* Employment                        - Business owner identity documents and/or centralised citizenship databases
* Management and employment:
- Existing reporting by companies on local employment and management
- Payroll / employment contract details
- Organisational charts
- Managers'identity documents and/or centralised citizenship databases
- Work permit details (individual orthrough centralised systems)
Local value-add           Supplier surveys/reporting and potentially also verification reports, support documentation such
by suppliers:             as suppliers' purchase records
* Local inputs            Mines'procurement information and reporting system (in cases where value-add information
* Substantial            is captured)
transformation          National statistics bodies surveys of gross domestic product and local value add
* Local service delivery  Customs documentation
6. ON WHAT BASIS WILL REPORTING TAKE PLACE? FOR EXAMPLE:
*  SELF-REPORTING AND/OR INDEPENDENT CERTIFICATION OR VERIFICATION?
* HOW OFTEN?
* SOFT OR HARD COPY SUBMISSION?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Self-reporting and/or verification:
WALPI experiences show that self reporting by mines can overcome some of the capacity gaps in government regulators in terms of
conducting site visits or inspections. However, this approach requires effort and commitment by mining companies, trust between
mining companies and government, and the capacity within government to assess submissions. Ideally reporting could be integrated
into mines'vendor/procurement/purchase order systems to reduce administrative burden and increase accuracy This could be
complemented by validation through spot inspection or audits, which would require some oversight resources. Full certification and
verification, as used in some benchmarks, requires the most resources, but resources may be split between public and private sectors,
as well as non-government role players such as civil society observers or NGOs.
In many cases it will be necessary to adjust data gathering systems to capture the necessary information. This may include:
- Changing reporting requirements to the line ministry/regulator and, where relevant, FITI country office
- Mines incorporating the necessary information into supplier/vendor codes, and requiring equivalent data sharing in contracts with
their primary contractors
Collective data gathering through Chambers of Mines and/or mine supplier associations where these exist and have sufficient
capacity
If possible, aligning national enterprise survey questions and methodology
Reporting frequency:
- Annual reporting is likelyto be a more workable option in terms of capacity constraints and administrative burden for both mines
and regulators (see also Module 6)
Brief six-monthly or even quarterly progress reports might be appropriate where capacity is less of a constraint
Submission format:
- Hard copy submissions: this has a high administrative burden, can cause delays in processing, reduces transparency, and in some
countries there has been a history of regulators losing hard copies/not properly maintaining archives
Soft/online portal: this is often easier for mines to use, but requires initial investment in set-up (whether use of an existing platform
or custom design), and there are potentially challenges of maintaining technology, data security etc., as well as issues in terms of
reliability of internet access and limited use of e-government systems in some countries.

﻿7. HOW CAN MINING COMPANIES BEST BE ENCOURAGED TO SUPPORT M&E?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Provision of free or seconded resources to support reporting and measurement activity could increase compliance and willingness to
invest more in producing comprehensive reports, in particular where information is not readily available or centralised.
Greater visibility and informed public attention around local procurement could increase the value of effective reporting for mining
companies (as well as programmes to improve local procurement performance). Greater public attention on local procurement can
also encourage incorporation of good local procurement practices into corporate brand identity and marketing, which would need to be
supported by measurement and reporting.
Experience from benchmarks has shown that inclusion of reporting and monitoring requirements in concession agreements, if followed
up by oversight or penalties, can increase mining companies' active participation in both local procurement and M&E.
8. WHO SHOULD LEAD THE FOLLOWING?
* DATA GATHERING AND REPORTING
* MONITORING AND EVALUATION
* OVERSIGHT
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Data gathering and reporting
Drawing from WALPI experience, mines are best placed to gather and report information on their procurement spend and suppliers.
Mining companies are also able to adjust their vendor registration and validation processes to fill existing information gaps. As such,
Chambers of Mines may be best placed to gather and report this information, in particular where they also include mining sector
suppliers, from whom they can gather information. Organisations that engage and support local businesses may be well placed
for complementing this with further supplier information - in particular Chambers of Commerce and SME support initiatives.
Monitoring and evaluation
Options include:
* Mining industry regulator
- Commerce ministry
- Concession regulator
Based on WALPI experience, M&E systems are often under-resourced in terms of people and skills, vehicles, and information
management systems. However, experience has also shown that location within the entity responsible for mining licence issuing and
review is more likely to encourage compliance.
Oversight
Options include:
- Parliamentary committees
* EITI country offices
* Intergovernmental / multi-stakeholder groups
* International verification bodies such as Bureau Veritas
- NGOs such as Revenue Watch
Based on WALPI experience, in-country capacity for oversight may be limited in West African countries, in particular Least Developed
Countries, and regional or international support partnerships may therefore be appropriate to provide interim support and build
local capacity.
9. TO WHAT EXTENT WILLTHE RECEIVED INFORMATION BE MADE PUBLIC?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
WALPI experience shows that certain levels of transparency can help to increase both public awareness and accuracy of expectations of
levels of local spend and benefits, as well as support evaluation and oversight by civil society. For example, sharing aggregate demand
and local spend levels by supplier category and changes over time could be useful.
This, however, needs to be balanced by confidentiality of commercially sensitive information or information that may impact on
competition in the marketplace, e.g. avoiding publishing of individual supplier-mine transactions, average pricing on specific supply
items. There may be lessons from FIT in this regard around aggregated information and delays in public release.
10. WHERE WILL ADDITIONAL FUNDING BE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT M&E SYSTEMS? HOW CAN IT BE SECURED?
Considerations, including experience from the WALPI project
Options for funding of additional data gathering, monitoring and evaluation systems include:
- General government fiscus e.g. regulator, statistics authority or specialist local procurement verification agency budget
- Ring-fenced allocation fron nine royalty payments
* In-kind contribution by mines through changes to their reporting systems and/or through a Chamber of Mines
- Leveraging existing funding and support programmes that are relevant e.g. government capacity building, EITI, open contracting
and open data efforts, e-government systems development
- Additional donor contributions e.g. similarto multi-donor trust fund supporting EITI
