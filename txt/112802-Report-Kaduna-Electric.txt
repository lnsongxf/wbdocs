Preface

This Volume was produced under the Nigeria Electrification Access Program Development (NEAPD) Tech-
nical Assistance project for Kaduna Electric, which provides electricity services to the States of Kaduna, Keb-
bi, Sokoto and Zamfara in North West Nigeria. The Volume is combined by two reports: a GIS-based Least-
Cost Plan and a related Investment Prospectus. Together, they present a technically sound electrification and
investment plan for the achievement of universal access to electricity services in the Kaduna Electric service
area by 2030. Both the Geospatial Plan and the Investment Prospectus were produced in close collaboration
with Kaduna Electric, and the NEAPD project also strengthened the utility’s capacity through training for
the geospatial mapping of the electricity infrastructure and for distribution planning with GIS tools.
    The Least-Cost Plan provides a geospatial and quantitative frame for the design and detailing of a well-co-
ordinated and harmonized implementation program for grid and off-grid electrification over a fifteen-year
timeframe (2015–2030). Building on the findings of the geospatial plan and a rapid readiness assessment, the
Investment Prospectus proposes a year-by-year electrification program up to 2030 (including connections
for schools and clinics) and details the investment needs, financing gaps and possible sources of funding with
a focus on the first five years of implementation. The Prospectus also identifies key sector obstacles (related
to the policy, institutional and financing frameworks) for the implementation of an access rollout plan and
suggests possible areas requiring capacity strengthening through Technical Assistance.
    As demonstrated by best practices in international experience, investments alone will not be sufficient
to achieve universal access by 2030. They must be complemented by timely and effective enabling actions
on several other fronts, especially the establishment of an enabling policy, targeted fixes to the institutional
framework, and capacity strengthening of the key agents and institutions whose effective engagement is es-
sential. Besides Kaduna Electric, the Federal Government of Nigeria (Ministry of Power and of Finance, and
the Office of the Vice President), the Regulator, and several other key stakeholders have a key role to play if
electricity services are to be provided to over 80 million Nigerians currently living in the dark and ensure
shared well-being across the country.
    While the analysis and recommendations presented in this Volume reflect and respond to the operating
context and specific characteristics of Kaduna Electric utility, they also provide an input for the completion
of the bold sector reform launched by the Federal Government of Nigeria in 2010. While highlighting the
make or break challenges for scaling up access in the Kaduna Electric service area, the Volume also provides
a roadmap for expanding access across the country in an efficient, effective, and timely manner.

     This work could not have been possible without financial support from the Africa Renewable Energy and
     Access Program (AFREA), funded through the World Bank’s Energy Sector Management Assistance Pro-
     gram (ESMAP)—a global knowledge and technical assistance program that assists low- and middle-income
     countries to increase their know-how and institutional capacity to achieve environmentally sustainable en-
     ergy solutions for poverty reduction and economic growth. ESMAP is funded by Australia, Austria, Den-
     mark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Japan, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland,

     widen access to energy services in Sub-Saharan African countries in an environmentally responsible way.
     AFREA is funded by the Netherlands. The report also benefited from funding from the Sustainable Energy
     for All (SE4All) global initiative.
         Under the overall guidance of Rahul Kitchlu (Senior Energy Specialist), the Least Cost Geospatial Imple-
     mentation Plan for Grid and Off-Grid Rollout (2015–2030) for the Kaduna Electric Service Area was prepared
     by the Earth Institute at Columbia University School of Engineering and Applied Sciences whereas the In-
     vestment Prospectus for the electrification of the Kaduna Electric service area by Economic Consulting Associ-
     ates. Arun Sanghvi (Consultant) and Chiara Rogate (Consultant) supervised and coordinated the prepara-
     tion of this Volume.
         The team is grateful for the guidance provided by Rachid Benmessaoud (Country Director), Meike van

     Energy Specialist), Dana Rysankova (Senior Energy Specialist), and Yann Tanvez (Energy Specialist) for peer
     reviewing the reports and providing insightful comments, and to Jon Exel (Senior Energy Specialist) and

Note:
a
  Kaduna Electric reports 383,000 customers (2016); Nearly all will need smart meters (~US$275 per connection), numbers and costs were provided by Kaduna Electric in April
2016.
b
  Kaduna Electric estimates ~1.5M HHs (2016) consume power but do not pay; a geospatial analysis estimates ~1.7M; all will need meters & improved connections (~US400 each
for smart meter plus half the typical cost of a service drop)
c
  ~1.6M HHs are within range of the grid, but need a connection, meter, LV line, and short MV lines and/or equipment
d
  ~2.1M HHs are not within range of the existing grid, and so will need a significant MV line, transformer, LV line, meter and connection
e
  Note that the bulk of off-grid implementation (including mini-grids) is likely to occur under an interim access scheme, described in more detail in a later section of this report

Note:
a
  Kaduna Electric reports 383,000 customers (2016); Nearly all will need smart meters (~US$275 per connection), numbers and costs were provided by Kaduna Electric in April
2016.
b
  Kaduna Electric estimates ~1.5M HHs (2016) consume power but do not pay; a geospatial analysis estimates ~1.7M; all will need meters & improved connections (~US400 each
for smart meter plus half the typical cost of a service drop)
c
  ~1.6M HHs are within range of the grid, but need a connection, meter, LV line, and short MV lines and/or equipment
d
  ~2.1M HHs are not within range of the existing grid, and so will need a significant MV line, transformer, LV line, meter and connection

  Note that the bulk of off-grid implementation (including mini-grids) is likely to occur under an interim access scheme, described in more detail in a later section of this report.

  Note, the electrification rate declines between 2015 and 2018 because, despite some electrification in 2018, this has not kept pace with the growth in the number of households.
The same is not true of social institutions where the total number of institutions is assumed to be fixed (instead the size of the schools and clinics grow as the population grows).
