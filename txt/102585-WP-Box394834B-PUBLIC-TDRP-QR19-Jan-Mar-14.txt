1. Operational Activities and Technical Assistance
1.1     Regional Activities

African Union DDR Capacity Program (AU DDRCP)

The African Union Commission (AUC) launched the African Union Disarmament, Demobilization and
Reintegration Capacity Program 2013-2015 (AU DDRCP) in February 2013. A disarmament, demobilization
and reintegration (DDR) core team was set up within the Peace and Security Division (PSD) to facilitate AU
DDR implementation. AU DDRCP’s overall objective is to support and institutionalize DDR related capacities
within the AU in order to increase the AU’s effectiveness in performing in accordance with DDR related
goals of the 2006 Post-Conflict Reconstruction and Development (PCRD) and of the Africa Peace and
Security Architecture (APSA).

In order to achieve the overall objective, three mutually supportive components along with their
corresponding outputs have been identified: (i) Institutionalize AU capacity to support national and regional
DDR related initiatives; (ii) Establish an AU DDR Resource and Research Centre to document national DDR
experiences, best practices and develop DDR specific guidance resources; and (iii) AU Engagement in DDR
Activities of Member States.

The rationale for TDRP involvement in AU DDRCP is twofold. First, TDRP aims at consolidating in African
institutions, its own experience and that of its predecessor, the Multi-Country Demobilization and
Reintegration Program (MDRP). Second, the collaboration takes place in the context of the 2006 PCRD and
follows-up on AUC’s contribution to the World Development Report (WDR) 2011 on Conflict, Security and
Development.

Component One: Institutionalize AU Capacity to Support National & Regional DDR Related Initiatives:
Supporting the development of the AU DDR Operational Guidance Notes (OGNs)

The AU DDR Operational Guidelines will provide guidance to DDR practitioners on key issues pertaining to
DDR on the African continent. It will also provide guidance to the AU, AU Missions and the RECs and RMs
with regards to their role in supporting DDR efforts. Within this context, TDRP placed two consultants to
develop OGNs on DDR National Frameworks as well as one on Reintegration. As part of this year’s main
activities, the drafts of these five OGNs are finalized awaiting for final validation workshop review

Component Two: Establish AU DDR Resource and Research Centre to Document National DDR Experiences
and Best Practices and Develop DDR Specific Guidance Resources

AU DDR Resource and Research Center and the DDR Site

Efforts have been underway to support the establishment of the DDR Resource and Research Center in the
collection of books and relevant materials for ease access and reference. The program further envisages to
further advance the activities of referencing, cataloguing, development of web content, linking the DDR
site with useful links and install advanced search functions.

The first edition of the AU DDR Newsletter is published and released in February 2014. This issue features
the following key highlights; Overview of the AU DDR Capacity Program; AU DDR activities; AU-UN-WB DDR
Training and validation workshop; first and second steering Committee meeting; seminar on CAAC/UNSCR
1325; AU Support to Member states (South Sudan, CAR, Somalia and Comoros).

The AU DDR Capacity project has made efforts to engage in the processes of with the Peace and Security
Department’s Roster development. The Program will closely follow-up in its development to ensure the
inclusion of the DDR experts.

The African Union Youth Volunteer has been placed and deployed to the Defense and Security Division
expected to assume duty in April 2014. The primary duty of the volunteer is to develop the technical aspect
of the DDR site.

The AU DDR Capacity Project has made substantial progress in developing the AU DDR site framework as
well as the content of the website. The technical aspect of the web designing is expected to be finalized in
the upcoming quarter.

Support to strengthening AMISOM for DDR and Disengaged Combatants:

A draft project proposal has been prepared by the AU core team entitled AMISOM Support to the Federal
Government of Somalia National Programme for the Treatment and Handling Disengaged Combatants for
the consideration of potential donor support. The project is an activity by the DSD within the framework of
the AU DDRCP. The project aims to complement the ability of the government of Somalia to handle
disengaged combatants by strengthening the capacity of AMISOM in their role as the first receivers of
disengaged combatants. The project components are in line with actualizing the Somali National Program
on Disengaged Combatants, as well as the UN Security                            Outlook for the Next Quarter

1.2     Country Activities

Burundi

As part of TDRP support to the Republic of Burundi Commission Nationale charge de la Démobilisation, de
la Réinsertion et de la Réintégration des ex-combattants (CNDDR), TDRP held meetings with CNDDR in
Bujumbura in March 2014. The meetings in Bujumbura focused on follow-up of activities under Burundi’s
Emergency Demobilization and Transitional Reintegration Project (PDRT). PDRT is providing 150 severely
disabled ex-combatants with houses with access roads and pathways in a total of 12 locations. All sites will
have water harvesting facilities, main water connections at five locations where water supply are available,
and a new dedicated water supply will be provided in one location. Main power supply will be connected
at five sites where main power is available. Further, all houses will be provided with solar power facilities.
TDRP also visited a CNDDR project site in Burundi’s Cibitoke Province along with CNDDR staff as well as
representatives from the Embassy of Belgium and the Provincial Office.

The Karurama site in the Rugombo commune in Cibitoke is the largest of the 12 sites with 45 houses on the
plot. Each house includes a reception area, a living area, three bedrooms, and a utility area including a
kitchen and toilet. The team was pleased with the progress made on the construction of the houses in
Cibitoke which commenced eight weeks ago and with the quality of work in general. TDRP mission also held
focus groups with members of four economic associations to follow up on the impact of support received
through PDRT. PDRT provided in-kind support to 56 high performing associations as well as training and
organizational support to 734 economic associations. CNDDR has, through PDRT, demobilized members of
the National Liberation Forces (FNL) and the National Liberation Forces – dissidents (FNL-D), and continues
to provide socioeconomic reintegration support to said members following demobilization, as well as to
ex-combatants demobilized under the Emergency Demobilization, Reinsertion, and Reintegration Project,
with a particular focus on the provision of such support to female, child, and disabled ex-combatants. The
two projects have supported the demobilization and reintegration of 8,682 ex-combatants and child
soldiers in Burundi.

Democratic Republic of Congo

TDRP has been asked to provide technical assistance to the Government of Democratic Republic of Congo
DDR Phase III process. A series of missions took place between January and March 2014 where TDRP staff
and consultant carried out consultations and technical assistance meetings with international and local
partners. In this quarter, TDRP has worked on developing an action plan on joint TDRP-MONUSCO (United
Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC) technical support to Programme National de
Désarmement, Démobilisation et Réintégration (PNDDR) in preparing all manuals needed for the
implementation of PNDDR III and developing efficient and sustainable ways for the reintegration of ex-
combatants. A follow-up mission took place in March and TDRP worked on establishing working
mechanisms with MONUSCO and PNDDR on DDR and took part in the DDR Technical Working Group. In
this quarter, a roadmap for potential TDRP assistance to DDR III process was developed and follow-up
missions were planned. TDRP’s objective in DRC is to provide technical support to the coordination among
DDR partners in Kinshasa and installation of a technical unit. TDRP will continue providing technical
assistance in redrafting the national DDR strategy and required documents for DDR in the country.

Rwanda

TDRP was part of a World Bank mission that visited Rwanda in March, to conduct an Implementation
Support Mission as part of the Second Rwanda Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project.
Amongst other objectives, the mission was tasked with assessing progress made on demobilization,
reinsertion, social and economic reintegration, and mainstreaming of program activities. Specific focus was
placed on assessing progress made for support to vulnerable groups, including child soldiers, female ex-
combatants, dependents of ex-combatants and disabled ex-combatants.

The mission found that the demobilization component of the project is progressing well and all the demand
for demobilization has been met. Ongoing success was also noted in the field of economic and social
reintegration, particularly with regards to the cooperatives project. The project continues to support ex-
combatants who have fallen into poverty, has been very active with following up on child ex-combatants
and has been pro-active in setting up Integrated Rehabilitation and Production Workshops for disabled ex-
combatants who reside in purpose built housing on estates throughout the country. These workshops
provide economic opportunities for these ex-combatants. This scheme is certainly a first of its kind and one
that other DDR programs would do well to take into account. The Rwanda DDR work on SGBV and male
gender issues is also a novel and once completed could provide a template that can be used for replication
in other DDR programs. Likewise, the RDRP remains the only DDR program were significant work has been
undertaken on creating a psycho-social program, and of particular interest, is the manner whereby an
identification, referral and support network has been set-up throughout the country, that not only benefits
ex-combatants, but other persons who might have similar challenges.

The current DDR program is financed by IDA and the TDRP technical Assistance which has continued since
the end of direct support will also be ending with this mission. It should be noted however, that the program
is continuing beyond this interim period, for a further two years and will run through to mid-2016.

Somalia

As part of ongoing TDRP support to Somalia DDR process, TDRP prepared an initiative, together with the
African Union, a South-South Knowledge and Experience Exchange on DDR between Rwanda and Somalia.
It is expected that Somalia DDR team will obtain key insight into DDR affairs by interacting with their
Rwandese counterparts. Rwanda’s experience with DDR is widely considered as one of the best in Africa.
The South-South Exchange plan involves the Somali DDR department staff visiting Kigali to meet with
Rwanda DDR national program officials. The exchange will be in the form of discussions, presentations,
working groups and site visits. Rwanda DDR commission is very interested to receive the Somali colleagues
and share with them its DDR experience. TDRP is working closely with the World Bank’s South-South
Exchange Facility, which has financing and technical resources to prepare and implement effective
exchange and learning activities. It is expected that the exchange will take place for a duration of one week
in September – November 2014. The proposed exchange has been cleared by the World Bank AFTCS Sector
Manager, World Bank Somalia Country Director and World Bank Rwanda Country Manager.

South Sudan

TDRP’s work in South Sudan is continuing through technical assistance and collaboration with the South
Sudan National DDR Commission (NDDRC). A civil conflict began in the country on December 15th 2013
resulting in an opposition group splitting from the SPLA and forming the SPLA in Opposition (SPLA-IO) led

by former Vice President Riek Machar. While the scale of the fighting has diminished since December, the
events continue to have a significant impact on the country and the people.

From January to March of this year the World Bank office in South Sudan was closed due to security and
thus the TDRP remained in remote contact with NDDRC. In March, representatives from the World
Bank/TDRP, NDDRC and Bonn International Center for Conversion (BICC) met in a two-day workshop at the
World Bank offices in Nairobi, Kenya. World Bank staff from the South Sudan country office also
participated in the workshop's open sessions. Presentations by Mr. William Deng Deng, Chairperson of
NDDRC, Mr. Majur Mayur, Deputy Chairperson of NDDRC, Mr. Aki Stavrou, Sr. Conflict and Development
Specialist at the World Bank/TDRP, and Mr. Wolf Christian, Head of Section - Advisory Services at the BICC,
provided the audience with the partners' assessment of the current situation, lessons learned from the
Pilot DDR program and the areas that need attention in the next phase of DDR in South Sudan. The
participants underlined the existing partnership and close coordination between the partners as a key to
success in DDR.

The Pilot Reintegration Project completed Phase I in December 2013 and was to resume with Phase Two in
January 2014, with the project to close by May 2014. The primary objective of the pilot reintegration project
is to test the modalities of reintegration in South Sudan to inform and improve future DDR programmes in
the country. In addition the pilot is focused on capacity building to the NDDRC staff and systems. Phase II
of the project transfers additional service delivery responsibility to the NDDRC staff. This will begin with a
training of trainers on entrepreneurship, financial literacy and cooperatives for the Information, Counseling
and Referral Systems (ICRS) Caseworkers. Additionally, a training of trainers in agricultural business
methods will be provided to a group of Ministry of Agriculture Extension Workers who will work alongside
the ICRS caseworkers to provide follow-up visits to the ex-combatants that chose agricultural training. Both
Training-of-Trainers are planned for May 2014. Despite restricted movement of international staff, Phase
II follow-up trainings are designed to be conducted by NDDRC, thus, although slightly delayed, the field
based follow-up trainings will be provided in keeping with the initial design.

2. Knowledge Management
2.1     Studies

TDRP published one study during the first quarter of 2014 and continued work on two studies that will be
published in the next quarter. These studies are/will be published with TDRP’s new report and study format
in line with the program’s new communications and outreach strategy. TDRP studies are also available at
United Nations DDR Resource Centre (www.UNDDR.org).

Climate Change, Migration and Conflict: A Look at Youth in the Sahel Region

Climate change is one of the most pressing development issues of the 21st century. The negative
consequences of climate change are already observed in many countries and severely impacting the
livelihoods of millions of people but especially those of the poorest. In addition to the loss of livelihoods,
two of the most serious consequences of climate change include migration and conflict. This preliminary
exploration investigates the linkages between climate change and conflict, focusing on the youth cohort
living in the most vulnerable rural areas. In particular, it looks at the causal chain between climate change,
migration, and conflict. The study investigates this causal chain in the context of the Sahel region and
suggests policy options to prevent youth from engaging in conflict and crime.

Comparative DDR Study: Burundi, DRC, RoC, Rwanda and Uganda

TDRP has been working on finalizing a comparative study across five countries in the Great Lakes region:
Burundi, DRC, RoC, Rwanda, and Uganda. In this quarter, a team of TDRP staff worked on finalizing the
annexes and formatting the study for publication in the next quarter. The study which will include key data
across five countries will provide insight into the DDR processes. The study will be announced within the
World Bank and TDRP website.

Uganda: Children and DDR Study

The use of child soldiers and children associated with armed forces or armed groups (CAAF/G) is an
unacceptable practice that continues to this day, despite the devastating impact on the children, their
families, communities and countries. The purpose of this study was to capture lessons learned and key
challenges encountered in the provision of support targeted to CAAF/G in Uganda, in an effort to provide
better understanding for policy makers and service providers working on CAAF/G programming elsewhere.
Further, this study had the following specific objectives: (i) understand the effectiveness and efficiency of
D&R programs’ institutional arrangements with agencies working with child and youth ex-combatants, by
focusing on program implementation modalities between the Uganda Amnesty Commission and
implementing partners working with children in Reintegration programs, (ii) assess whether agencies
working with child and youth ex-combatants were sufficiently capacitated to efficiently undertake the
necessary activities both at an operational and administrative level; and (iii) document the experiences of
the implementing partners and agencies working with child and youth ex-combatants for the purposes of
using these learnings for future D&R Programming.

2.2     Conferences and Workshops
A key component of TDRP’s knowledge management activities is disseminating knowledge on conflict and
post-conflict issues through workshops and conferences. In this quarter, in addition to the activities carried
out under AU DDRCP, TDRP participated in the following knowledge and learning events:

Inter-Agency Working Group on DDR

TDRP is an active participant in the United Nations Inter-Agency Working Group (IAWG) on disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration (DDR). The group is co-chaired by the DDR units of the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). TDRP’s
participation reflects the importance and emphasis the World Bank, AFTCS and TDRP places on
coordination, best practices and information sharing among partners. Given the new contexts which DDR
and related operations are now conducted, the IAWG worked this quarter to chart an updated way forward
and work-plan for 2013-14 to build additional international support for the IAWG’s mission and approach
including hosting a multi-organizational high-level meeting to reaffirm the international commitment and
outline the updated work plan. As part of this renewed work, TDRP will be co-leading the IAWG’s
development of IDDRS modules on Communications, Monitoring & Evaluation and Dealing with Third
Country nationals (mercenaries) in DDR Operations.

2.3     Pilot Programs

Scoring for Peace Documentary

TDRP distributed DVDs of Scoring for Peace and a leaflet to all World Bank Country Offices in Africa and
Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regions as well as other countries that have experienced or are
currently experiencing conflict. Copies were also sent to the embassies of program donors and international
partners in tournament countries. For more information on the Great Lakes Peace Cup Tournament and
the documentary please visit Scoring for Peace website.

LOGiCA Family Study

TDRP assisted the Learning on Gender and Conflict in Africa (LOGiCA) trust fund with the initiation of an in-
depth qualitative study examining family dynamics during the process of reintegration of demobilized ex-
combatants in Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda. This family study investigates: (i) the impact of departure,
absence and return of ex-combatants on their families, with a particular focus on spouses, and (ii) the role
of the family in the social and economic reintegration of ex-combatants. It is rather different from previous
reintegration studies undertaken as it applies an anthropological approach to investigate the subject matter.
The research focus is on families of adult demobilized ex-combatants. The study officially launched in
September 2012 and the three reports from each of the participating countries, namely Burundi, Rwanda,
and Uganda were successfully completed in July 2013. Phase II of LOGiCA was launched in January with a
multi-country study that looks into the role and involvement of the family of ex-combatants during their
social and economic reintegration back into their communities, as well as the resulting impact on the family.
Phase II the study involves three quantitative surveys one each in Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda delivered
to the spouses or mothers of ex-combatants/Reporters and to one other family member who had an
important role in the return and reintegration of the ex-combatant and Reporter. Field teams were active
between January and February with data capture and analysis in February and March 2014. Guided by a
Senior Anthropologists, Phase I involved teams of field researchers carried out an in-depth anthropological
survey in Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda employing a variety of tools including family mapping exercises in
the form of genograms, multiple individual in-depth interviews with ex-combatants, spouses and other
identified relatives, and interviews with key respondents from the communities. The primary purpose of
Phase II is to test and validate findings while also exploring further (as feasible) some key issues or themes
that arose during the initial phase but that require additional investigation. The quantitative study targeted
a total of 200 families in Uganda, 400 in Burundi and 400 in Rwanda. Initial findings from the data analysis
will be discussed at a Paris working session in the first week of March 2014, with a follow-up meeting in
London in June 2014.

3. Program Management
3.1     Communications

Post-Conflict, Ex-Combatants and Development Facebook Page

PCCD was launched on 2 September 2013 with the aim to reach 5000 fans (users) over the three-month
period. The primary purpose was to use content relevant to the audience (as provided) to see what led to
the highest level on engagement. Interestingly, the aim was to target African post-conflict diaspora

                                                                                               January – March 2014



however, as seen in the result section; users in African cities were the most interested in the page. The
pilot page was administered by the Institute for Security Studies (ISS). TDRP provided the base content and
this content was repurposed for social media by ISS. An interesting finding at the end of the page’s three
month piloting period was that mostly positive interaction was observed with very little negative interaction.
TDRP initially planned to administer the PCCD as an official social platform dedicated to post-conflict and
DDR affairs. Given the existing presence of World Bank Africa in social media and the availability of
communication channels for TDRP’s use within the World Bank, however, PCCD represents an opportunity
for the outreach efforts as part of African Union DDR Capacity Program. Therefore, TDRP is planning to
migrate the page into AU DDRC Program, pending discussions and approval by the AU PSD. If approved, the
PCCD Facebook page will be integrated as an activity into the communications activities of the AU DDRCP.
When transferred to AU, the page will then be run by the AU PSD communications page as an African Union
social platform for discussing peacebuilding, peacekeeping, DDR and the wider conflict and security area.
Currently, the Page has an active follower base of 23,5K.

External and Internal Communications

In this quarter, TDRP continued to use ReliefWeb to feature TDRP studies, quarterly reports, and its work
focusing on field missions. A key component of TDRP’s new communication strategy is TDRP’s new
corporate website. The new look of TDRP’s corporate website is more dynamic with more news stories,
interesting content and up-to-date information about TDRP operations and knowledge products. The
website was launched in March 2014, replacing the old one.

3.2     Staffing
TDRP currently has seven staff members and 10 consultants who maintain constant contribution to TDRP.

            As it was under process during December 2013, two new contributions were received during the present
            quarter: (i) 5,000,000.00 NOK from the Government of Norway (US$826,000.00) and, (ii) 500,000 Euros
            from the Government of Finland (US$686,000.00). The total of contributions made to TDRP to date reached
            $34,687,775. The assessment being carried out by the Government of Sweden for a new contribution to
            the TDRP is still ongoing and is expected to be reported on in the next Quarterly Report.
