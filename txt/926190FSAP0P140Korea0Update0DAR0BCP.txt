SUMMARY, KEY FINDINGS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The Republic of Korea has a moderate level of compliance with the Basel Core Principles for
Effective Banking Supervision (BCP). Building upon the 2003 FSAP recommendations, the
authorities have taken resolute steps to strengthen the regulation and supervision of the banking
sector. However, the assessment identified gaps that need to be addressed and although the
Republic of Korea counts with a strong—albeit overly complex—regulatory framework and with
thorough supervisory practices, a number of areas require attention so that the Republic of Korea
can meet the highest standards of supervisory effectiveness. Those areas include: broader powers to
apply minimum capital requirements to individual banks; full implementation of Pillar 2 and ICAAP;
and a more comprehensive approach to conglomerates. The application of Basel II to Financial
Holding Companies (FHCs) would complement the transition to group supervision which began
through the introduction of the FHC Act.

Despite the deficiencies identified in the assessment, the current supervisory structure has
been reasonably effective and the overall vulnerability of the Korean banking system has
diminished since the 2008 crisis with stronger capitalization across the sector. Supervision of
the banks is structured around sound off-site supervision techniques and onsite inspections.
Strengths lie in sophisticated offsite monitoring capabilities and an extensive onsite capability. The
FSC-FSS collects and analyzes a broad suite of information including detailed financial and
management information. The supervisory approach relies heavily on off-site monitoring and
notifications of exceptions, which are supplemented by biannual full-scope on-site examinations.
The existence of multiple points of responsibility, where subject matter experts are responsible for
different areas of surveillance poses challenges of coordination and to derive an overall
understanding risk to an institution.

The Republic of Korea is one of the first countries to be assessed under the revised Basel Core
Principles (BCP) issued by the Basel Committee in September 2012. Like other countries being
assessed under the new methodology, the Republic of Korea has agreed to be assessed and rated
not only on the essential criteria but also on the additional criteria. It is important to note that since
last assessment, conducted in 2003, the bar of the standards has been raised twice by the BCBS (the
BCP methodology was revised in 2006 and again in 2012). This assessment, consequently, is not
comparable with the previous assessment and, as prescribed by its methodology, should not be
compared or across countries. Within the revised BCP methodology, more is expected of supervision
and regulation, and much of what was considered “desirable” is now considered essential, with the
lessons of crisis and evolution of financial markets and international standards. The assessment also
brings a new relevance to observed implementation and practices.

There is a need to further strengthen the independence of the FSC-FSS from the political
process to facilitate greater focus on promoting the safety and soundness of the banking
sector. The current supervisory and enforcement structure raises a number of concerns pertaining,
in particular, to its independence from political influence or the perception of it, multiple objectives




                                                                                                         5

that dilute the focus on the core supervisory mandate, and overlapping responsibilities and complex
processes requiring intense inter-agency communication.

The FSC-FSS has a broad range of powers, measures and tools available to address threats to
banks and the banking system however the length of time to communicate results of
supervisory activities needs to be enhanced. The process of providing recommendations to banks
based on on-site examinations, albeit recently improved, is still lengthy, which weakens its
effectiveness. The follow-up process has been recently been enhanced although there is still room
for improvement.

The authorities have put significant effort over the last few years towards implementing
consolidated supervision but further enhancements are still necessary. Several of Republic of
Korea’s main banks are large complex financial institutions with a diverse business model and a
variety business lines within the group. Offsite supervision of the group is conducted through a
dedicated team focusing principally on banking issues and liaises with subject matter experts. Given
such background, greater coordination between the teams responsible for offsite supervision to
identify exposures between group companies, and in particular, non-financial activities of a
conglomerate, is needed.

Implementation of the ICAAP will be an important stepping stone in achieving an integrated
approach to capital planning and higher standards of bank risk management. When fully
implemented, the ICAAP process will provide a framework for a comprehensive assessment of risk
and capital and will help to facilitate the transition to the full implementation of Pillar 2 of Basel II to
assign individual bank capital ratios. The extension of Basel II to bank Financial Holding Companies
(FHCs) will improve the consistency and comparability of the capital base for Korean banks. BII
applies to the commercial banks but has not yet been extended to FHCs where capital is calculated
using Basel I. The FSC-FSS plans to apply BII and BIII to FHCs by December 2013 which will
strengthen the quality of regulatory capital.

The regulatory framework for concentration risk is mostly focused on large exposures and
‘name risk’ and should be expanded to incorporate a broader definition. Currently the large
exposure regime is the main tool used by supervisors to monitor and identify concentration risk
which captures exposures to a single name or connected parties and does not sufficiently cover a
broad spectrum of concentration risk such as by industry, economic, geographic region and by
market (e.g., asset classes). In addition to a broader definition of concentration risk, the regulations
should explicitly require a delegation framework for the approval of large exposures.

While non-performing ratios for the domestic banks remain relatively low by international
standards, there are areas to improve provisioning practices, especially where loans are
reclassified as performing. Prudential regulations covering loan loss provisioning have been
strengthened since the last FSAP and in transitioning to IFRS; a reserve for Credit Loss was
introduced to prevent a decrease of banks’ loss absorbent capacity which has been effective. An
area of weakness in the provisioning framework is the criteria for exposures to return to performing
status. Regulations allow banks considerable discretion when reclassifying exposures as performing

                                                                                     REPUBLIC OF KOREA



without the borrower having proved repayment capacity under revised terms. A lack of conservatism
and prudence in reclassifying exposures as performing could negatively impact underlying quality of
the credit portfolio. While the FSS has increased its oversight of banks’ application of internal
policies for reclassification of assets, a greater amount of supervisory attention is required to ensure
banks’ apply appropriate risk management around this process, especially at this point in the cycle.
Since the financial crisis, government sponsored asset management companies (AMCs) have been
introduced to acquire delinquent loans in several sectors of the economy. The AMCs have continued
to operate as open-ended vehicles with a perception of permanency which might introduce the risk
of moral hazard into bank underwriting practices.

A regulatory and supervisory framework consistent with banks should be applied to the larger
NBFIs to strengthen their resilience to external shocks. The capital framework for NBFIs is a net
capital ratio of equity over total assets subtracting deductions and loan loss provisions. For those
NBFIs that accept deposits and are of an equivalent size to banks, the capital framework should be
strengthened and calculated using the Basel Accord. Equally, the definition of default for non-banks
is not consistent with the commercial banking sector creating potential for arbitrage. The definition
of default for commercial banks is 90 days, whereas for non-banks it is 180 days.

A. Introduction

1.      This assessment of the current state of the implementation of the BCP in the Republic
of Korea has been completed as part of an FSAP update undertaken by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) during 2013. It reflects the regulatory and
supervisory framework in place as of the date of the completion of the assessment. It is not
intended to represent an analysis of the state of the banking sector or crisis management
framework, which have been addressed in the broader FSAP exercise.

2.      An assessment of the effectiveness of banking supervision requires a review of the
legal framework, and detailed examination of the policies and practices of the institution(s)
responsible for banking regulation and supervision. In line with the BCP methodology, the
assessment focused on the FSC-FSS and did not cover the specificities of regulation and supervision
of other financial intermediaries, which are covered by other assessments conducted in this FSAP.

B. Information and Methodology Used for Assessment

3.      The Republic of Korea authorities agreed to be assessed according to the Revised Core
Principles (BCP) Methodology issued by the BCBS (Basel Committee of Banking Supervision)
in September 2012. This assessment was thus performed according to a significantly revised
content and methodological basis as compared with the previous BCP assessment carried out in
2003, which was conducted under the first BCP methodology. It is important to note, for
completeness’ sake, that this assessment cannot and should not be compared to the previous
undertaking, as the revised BCP have a heightened focus on risk management and its practice by
supervised institutions and its assessment by the supervisory authority, raising the bar to measure
the effectiveness of a supervisory framework (see box for more information on the Revised BCP).

4.       The Republic of Korea authorities also chose to be assessed and rated against the
Essential and Additional Criteria. In order to assess compliance, the BCP Methodology uses a set
of essential and additional assessment criteria for each principle. The essential criteria (EC) were
usually the only elements on which to gauge full compliance with a CP. The additional criteria (AC)
are recommended best practices against which the Korean authorities have agreed to be assessed
and rated. This option was not available to assessed countries before the 2012 Revised BCP; in fact,
Korea is one of the first countries being assessed under the current methodology and rated also
against ACs. The assessment of compliance with each principle is made on a qualitative basis. A
four-part grading system is used: compliant; largely compliant; materially noncompliant; and
noncompliant. This is explained below in the detailed assessment section. The assessment of
compliance with each CP is made on a qualitative basis to allow a judgment on whether the criteria
are fulfilled in practice. Effective application of relevant laws and regulations is essential to provide
indication that the criteria are met.

                                Box 1. The 2012 Revised Core Principles

 The revised BCPs reflect market and regulatory developments since the last revision, taking account
 of the lessons learnt from the financial crisis in 2008/2009. These have also been informed by the
 experiences gained from FSAP assessments as well as recommendations issued by the G-20 and FSB, and
 take into account the importance now attached to: (i) greater supervisory intensity and allocation of
 adequate resources to deal effectively with systemically important banks; (ii) application of a system-wide,
 macro perspective to the microprudential supervision of banks to assist in identifying, analyzing and taking
 pre-emptive action to address systemic risk; (iii) the increasing focus on effective crisis preparation and
 management, recovery and resolution measures for reducing both the probability and impact of a bank
 failure; and (iv) fostering robust market discipline through sound supervisory practices in the areas of
 corporate governance, disclosure and transparency.

 The revised BCPs strengthen the requirements for supervisors, the approaches to supervision and
 supervisors’ expectations of banks. The supervisors are now required to assess the risk profile of the
 banks not only in terms of the risks they run and the efficacy of their risk management, but also the risks
 they pose to the banking and the financial systems. In addition, supervisors need to consider how the
 macroeconomic environment, business trends, and the build-up and concentration of risk inside and outside
 the banking sector may affect the risk to which individual banks are exposed. While the BCP set out the
 powers that supervisors should have to address safety and soundness concerns, there is a heightened focus
 on the actual use of the powers, in a forward-looking approach through early intervention.

 The number of principles has increased from 25 to 29. The number of essential criteria has expanded
 from 196 to 231. This includes the amalgamation of previous criteria (which means the contents are the
 same), and the introduction of 35 new essential criteria. In addition, for countries that may choose to be
 assessed against the additional criteria, there are 16 additional criteria.

 While raising the bar for banking supervision, the Core Principles must be capable of application to a
 wide range of jurisdictions. The new methodology reinforces the concept of proportionality, both in terms
 of the expectations on supervisors and in terms of the standards that supervisors impose on banks. The
 proportionate approach allows assessments of banking supervision that are commensurate with the risk
 profile and systemic importance of a wide range of banks and banking systems.



5.      The assessment team reviewed the framework of laws, rules, and other materials
provided and held extensive meetings with officials of the FSC-FSS, and additional meetings
with auditing firms, and banking sector participants. The assessment was made by
Christopher Wilson, Monetary and Capital Markets Department, IMF, and Valeria Salomao Garcia,
the World Bank. The authorities provided a self-assessment of the CPs, as well as responses to
additional questionnaires, and provided access to supervisory documents and files, staff and
systems.

6.      The team appreciated the cooperation received from the authorities. The team extends
its thanks to staff of the authorities who provided cooperation, including provision of
documentation and access, at a time when staff was burdened by many initiatives related to the a
change in President, responsible Minister, Heads of FSC and global regulatory changes.

7.     The standards were evaluated in the context of the Republic of Korea financial
system’s structure and complexity. The CPs must be capable of application to a wide range of



                                                                                                                9

jurisdictions whose banking sectors will inevitably include a broad spectrum of banks. To
accommodate this breadth of application, according to the methodology, a proportionate approach
is adopted within the CP, both in terms of the expectations on supervisors for the discharge of their
own functions and in terms of the standards that supervisors impose on banks. An assessment of a
country against the CPs must, therefore, recognize that its supervisory practices should be
commensurate with the complexity, interconnectedness, size, and risk profile and cross-border
operation of the banks being supervised. In other words, the assessment must consider the context
in which the supervisory practices are applied. The concept of proportionality underpins all
assessment criteria. For these reasons, an assessment of one jurisdiction will not be directly
comparable to that of another.

8.      An assessment of compliance with the BCPs is not, and is not intended to be, an exact
science. Reaching conclusions required judgments by the assessment team. Nevertheless, by
adhering to a common, agreed methodology, the assessment should provide the South Korean
authorities with an internationally consistent measure of the quality of its banking supervision in
relation to the CPs, which are internationally acknowledged as minimum standards.

9.       To determine the observation of each principle, the assessment has made use of five
categories: compliant; largely compliant, materially noncompliant, noncompliant, and non-
applicable. An assessment of “compliant” is given when all EC and ACs are met without any
significant deficiencies, including instances where the principle has been achieved by other means. A
“largely compliant” assessment is given when there are only minor shortcomings, which do not raise
serious concerns about the authority’s ability to achieve the objective of the principle and there is
clear intent to achieve full compliance with the principle within a prescribed period of time (for
instance, the regulatory framework is agreed but has not yet been fully implemented). A principle is
considered to be “materially noncompliant” in case of severe shortcomings, despite the existence of
formal rules and procedures and there is evidence that supervision has clearly not been effective,
the practical implementation is weak or that the shortcomings are sufficient to raise doubts about
the authority’s ability to achieve compliance. A principle is assessed “noncompliant” if it is not
substantially implemented, several ECs are not complied with, or supervision is manifestly
ineffective. Finally, a category of “non-applicable” is reserved for those cases that the criteria would
not relate the country’s circumstances.

C. Institutional and Macroeconomic Setting and Market Structure—
Overview

Overview of the institutional setting and market structure

10.     The institutional setting in the Republic of Korea regarding banking supervision is
based on an integrated supervisory approach through the Financial Services Commission
(FSC) and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS). The FSC is in charge of financial policies and
supervision of financial industries, while the FSS regulates financial markets and institutions under
the direction and supervision of the FSC.

                                                                                    REPUBLIC OF KOREA



11.      The majority of non-bank deposit taking financial institutions are supervised by the
FSC-FSS and encompass mutual savings banks, credit unions and credit cooperatives, which
account for 20 percent of total deposits (credit cooperatives 14 percent). Other deposit taking
institutions include the community cooperatives and the Korea Post office, which are under the
supervision of the Ministry of Public Administration and Security and the Ministry of Knowledge and
Economy, respectively and respond for 8 percent of total deposits in Korea.

12.     The commercial banking sector, which dominates the financial sector, maintains
adequate buffers above minimum prudential capital adequacy requirements. As of end-2012
the BIS capital and Tier 1 capital ratios of commercial banks are at 14.3 percent and 11.1 percent
respectively. Non-performing loans are low, and the banks have retained a solid profit generation
capacity.

13.     The Korean financial system is dominated by twelve financial holding companies
(FHCs) that constitute about 50 percent of financial sector assets. The FHCs have steadily
increased their market share in total financial sector assets from about 39 percent at end 2010. The
FHCs have 87 percent of their consolidated assets in banking (accounting for about 70 percent of
the banking sector assets). Of the 18 commercial and specialized banks in Korea, 14 are operating
under bank 10 holding companies, which have a total of 275 subsidiaries. The financial companies
under the bank holding companies operate across a broad cross-section of the financial sector.

14.     Foreign financial institutions operating in Korea constitute roughly 11 percent of the
financial sector assets. In the banking sector, there are 41 foreign-owned banks from 16 countries
(two subsidiaries and remaining have branch presence) which make up about 14 percent of the
banking sector. In the insurance sector, 12 insurance companies’ subsidiaries from five countries
make up 10 percent of the domestic insurance sector. About six percent of the securities sector
assets are held by 20 foreign companies from eight countries. Korean banks operate 100 entities in
28 countries, 64 securities companies operate in 13 countries and 22 collective investment
companies (asset management) operate in 9 countries.

15.     There are 18 domestic banks consisting of 7 commercial banks, 6 regional banks, and 5
specialized banks. Specialized banks are owned by government and Standard Chartered bank and
Citibank are held by foreigners. The total assets of domestic banks come to W 1,827.9 trillion at the
end of 2012, which amounts to 143.7 of GDP. 41 foreign banks are operating 56 branches with total
assets approximately W 204.1 trillion at the end of 2012.

16.     Funding conditions of Korean banks have improved considerably since 2008. Most
notably, Korean banks’ large external short-term debt and dependence on wholesale funding that
were key vulnerabilities prior to the global financial crisis and have been reduced in recent years.

D. Preconditions for Effective Banking Supervision

17.    Korea’s growth moderated over the course of 2012 in the face of strong headwinds
from the global economy (table 3). Economic growth declined from 3½ percent in 2011 to 2


                                                                                                   11

percent in 2012 as a result of a sharp decline in exports that spread to a broad-based weakening of
domestic demand, particularly fixed investment. However, recent indicators suggest that the
economy has bottomed out and growth is projected to rebound to 2.8 percent in 2013 and
3.9 percent in 2014. Inflation has declined significantly to 1.4 percent at end 2012 as compared to
4.2 percent at end 2011, reflecting mostly slowing activity and the moderation of commodity prices.
With activity strengthening over the course of 2013, inflation is expected to pick up to 2½ percent,
the lower bound of the inflation target band.

18.      Against this background, the Government’s response has been timely and measured.
In June 2012, the Government announced two modest fiscal support packages within the confines of
the 2012 budget, and the Bank of Korea (BOK) cut its policy rate by 25 bps in July 2012 and another
25 bps in October 2012, ending the extended pause of about a year. In addition, the 2013 budget
entails reduction of the overall fiscal deficit (excluding social security funds) to 0.3 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP), a slight replacing of the fiscal consolidation compared to the previously
committed path which was more ambitious. The Government’s measured response to the
weakening growth outlook so far has been largely appropriate. The main short-term risks to the
outlook are a re-intensification of the euro area crisis and lingering concerns over U.S. fiscal policy.

19.     Reflecting swings in global risk appetite, capital flows into Korea have been highly
volatile. In the third quarter of 2012, portfolio flows strengthened and the currency appreciated as
risk appetite improved in the wake of further monetary easing in advanced economies. In addition,
the recent appreciation of won to a large extent reflects Korea’s larger-than-expected current
account surplus. Staff position so far has been that the won is still undervalued; therefore the
exchange rate should be allowed to appreciate further and followed by fine-tuning of the
macroeconomic policy mix. Against this background, the authorities view the existing
macroprudential measures as geared primarily towards limiting short-term external bank
borrowings. They are now considering capital flow management measures to insulate Korea from
surges in portfolio inflows, including a possible foreign exchange (FX) transaction tax.

20.      The mandates and powers related to financial stability in the Republic of Korea are
clearly allocated among five authorities: The Financial Services Commission (FSC), the Financial
Supervisory Service (FSS), the BoK, the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation (KDIC), and the Ministry
of Strategy and Finance (MoF). The relevant laws and their enforcement decrees have provided the
FSC-FSS, KDIC, and BoK with explicit mandates for financial stability. FSC and FSS are assigned with
the responsibility “to promote the advancement of the financial industry and the stability of financial
markets, establish sound credit order and fair financial transaction practices, and protect depositors,
investors, and other financial consumers.” KDIC is assigned with the responsibility “to contribute to
the protection of depositors and the maintenance of the stability of the financial system.” On top of
its price stability mandate, the BoK has been assigned with the responsibility to “pay attention to
financial stability in carrying out its monetary and credit policies.” The MoF develops and
coordinates economic and fiscal policies of the country, and serves on various decision-making
bodies of the financial regulators.

21.      The legal framework establishes a special resolution regime for distressed financial
institutions in Korea and identifies the roles and responsibilities of different authorities with
clear mandates. The Act on Structural Improvement of the Financial Industry (ASIFI) identifies the
FSC and KDIC as the resolution authorities, with the FSC acting as the lead resolution authority.
Although BoK is not a resolution authority, it has a role in providing financial assistance, through
participation in funding the KDIC or public funds. The special resolution regime for the financial
sector entities, under the ASIFI and the Deposit Protection Act (DPA) extends to banks (except the
specialized banks), the Industrial BoK, investment traders, brokers, collective investment business
entities, investment advisory business entities, discretionary investment business entities, insurance
companies, mutual savings banks, trust business entities, merchant banks, and financial holding
companies.

22.     A broad range of resolution tools are available to the resolution authorities. The
resolution options include merger and acquisition, purchase and assumption, bridge bank, funding
by government and other relevant authorities (including the KDIC), and liquidation. The FSC is
empowered to appoint an administrator (management supervisor) and direct the administrator to
undertake the necessary resolution process if the insolvent bank fails to comply with prompt
corrective actions. DPA mandates the application of the least cost test in the choice of a resolution
method by the KDIC, which has established the Korea Resolution and Collection as a separate entity
for the conduct of resolution proceedings.

      E. Summary Compliance with the Basel Core Principles

                 C—Compliant; LC—Largely Compliant; and MNC—Materially Non-Complaint
1. Responsibilities,         LC     Responsibilities, objectives and powers related to banking supervision are clearly
objectives and powers               defined although conflicting objectives and responsibilities might not concur with
                                    the objectives related to safety and soundness of the banking system.
                                    Responsibilities related particularly to fair financial transactions and consumer
                                    protection and the way they are being implemented through FSC and FSS can
                                    results in conflicts between “developmental” and safety and soundness objectives.

                                    The legal framework currently in place reasonably provide the necessary powers to
                                    authorize banks, conduct ongoing supervision, address compliance with laws and
                                    undertake corrective actions to address safety and soundness concerns.
                                    Limitations include the fact that the FSC-FSS does not have the power to increase
                                    the prudential requirements for individual banks and banking groups based on
                                    their risk profile and systemic importance.

2. Independence,            MNC     The legal status of the FSC within the Government structure as a Ministerial
accountability,                     agency can potentially grants the FSC additional means to exercise its
resourcing and legal                independence in comparison to structures were the supervisory agency is within
protection for                      the authority of the MoF. On the other hand, the direct subordination to the Prime
supervisors                         Minister can also potentially threat its independence.

                                    In principle there are some checks and balances processes in place including the
                                    FSC and the FSS internal audit, the BAI as well as the investigations conducted by
                                    the Assembly, in particular the role of the Assembly in inspecting the FSC-FSS
                                    activities.

                                    Nevertheless, the fact that the Commissioners encompass representatives from
                                    the MoF and the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry poses challenges in
                                    terms of conflicts of interest.

                                    In addition, legal protection for supervisors needs enhancements as the current
                                    setting can potentially jeopardize staff willingness to act and effectiveness of
                                    supervision.

5. Licensing criteria        LC     The FSC has the power to set licensing criteria and reject applications The FSC has
                                    the power to set licensing criteria and reject applications that do not meet such
                                    criteria. The FSC hasn’t licensed a bank in twenty years but does have a structured
                                    process in place encompassing guidance for new applicants.

                                    Limitations in the definition of large shareholders and related parties in the case of
                                    specialized and regional banks were not explored nor taken into consideration in
                                    the CP as the issue has been covered in other CPs.

                 C—Compliant; LC—Largely Compliant; and MNC—Materially Non-Complaint
                                     Given the fact that no new licenses have been granted in 20 years, the assessors
                                     did not have the chance to go through files and confirm licensing practices.

                                     Drivers for the rating included the fact that criteria to be assessed for licensing do
                                     not explicitly encompass elements relative to the detection and prevention of
                                     criminal activities or the oversight of proposed outsourced functions.

                                     Another shortcoming relates to the suitability assessment (including potential
                                     conflicts of interest) of large shareholders encompassing the ultimate beneficial
                                     owners.

                                     Regarding assessment criteria for Board members, the authorities informed that
                                     legislation on the ownership structure of financial companies submitted to the
                                     National Assembly and yet to be approved provides that the outside directors
                                     should be persons who possess hands-on experience in the financial sector or
                                     professional financial knowledge, or who hold hands-on experience in
                                     management, law, or accounting.

6. Transfer of significant    LC     The FSC has the power to review, reject and impose prudential conditions on
ownership                            proposals to transfer significant ownership or controlling interests held directly or
                                     indirectly to other parties. In practice though, transfer of significant ownership or
                                     controlling interest do not require approval in several cases.

                                     In addition, the definition of large shareholder provided by the Banking Act is too
                                     narrow, as it does not contemplate the possibility of shareholdings below 4
                                     percent resulting in “de facto” control or controlling interest, although in practice
                                     all commercial banks are subsidiaries of FHCs.

7. Major acquisitions         LC     Major acquisitions of non-financial companies are restricted in the Republic of
                                     Korea. Overall the authorities rely on reporting for dealing with and monitoring
                                     acquisitions of financial companies (as well as the establishment of overseas
                                     operations.

                                     The assessors understand that the current framework could result in acquisitions
                                     being made that might be not in the best interest of safety and soundness, as well
                                     as the settlement of subsidiaries in countries with a lax supervisory environment.

8. Supervisory approach       LC     The supervisory approach in place relies heavily on off-site monitoring and
                                     notifications of exceptions, as well as on a biannually full-scope on-site
                                     examination, with a robust and strong compliance foundation.

                                     The existence of multiple points of responsibility with various teams in charge of
                                     particular sub segments operating autonomously limits to a certain extent the
                                     ability of the FSS to maintain a thorough understanding of the overall risk profile
                                     of individual banks and banking groups, also potentially undermining the
                                     willingness to act and overall accountability regarding a bank or a banking group.
                                     The over reliance on a comprehensive and relatively homogeneous full-scope
                                     examination performed every two years as the major source for qualitative



                                                                                                                  15

                                   assessment of risk management limits the forward looking capability of its
                                   supervisory approach.

                                   Albeit the examinations conducted seem thorough, judgment considerations as
                                   part of the qualitative assessments have still a limited role in the overall process.

9. Supervisory              LC     The FSS uses a broad range of techniques and tools to implement its supervisory
techniques and tools               approach. It counts with comprehensive and detailed set of data requested,
                                   encompassing financials and management information, as well as its systems and
                                   dedicated staff, result in a robust off-site framework. On-site examinations are
                                   supported by check lists and guidance to ensure consistency in the supervisory
                                   process. Deployment of resources is based on the type of bank and total assets,
                                   which to a certain extent reflects banks’ risk profile.

                                   The authorities would benefit from intensifying engagement with banks’ senior
                                   management as part of the on-site examination processes, focusing partial
                                   examinations on core supervisory issues and risks, enhancing information sharing
                                   procedures within the FSS, formally requiring banks to immediately report on any
                                   material adverse developments.

10. Supervisory             LC     The FSC-FSS have powers to require banks to submit information on both a solo
reporting                          and a consolidated basis.

                                   In practice, the FSC-FSS maintains an integrated financial information analysis
                                   system to collect and manage data from the banks both on a monthly and a
                                   quarterly basis. The data collected ranges from banking operations to financials, to
                                   information related to regulatory compliance.

                                   Shortcomings in compliance with this CP relate to the lack of systematic
                                   procedures to ensure reliability of data provided by banks, quality control, lack of
                                   a systematic process to assess suitability of external experts, the use of third
                                   parties to perform supervisory work, the lack of a requirement that external
                                   experts bring to the FSS attention promptly any material shortcomings identified
                                   during the course of any work undertaken by them for supervisory purposes, as
                                   well as limitations regarding access to information from non-financial companies
                                   within a group.

11. Corrective and          LC     The FSC-FSS has a range of powers, measures and tools available to address
sanctioning powers of              threats to banks and the banking system. The process of providing
supervisors                        recommendations to banks based on on-site examinations, albeit recently
                                   improved, is still lengthy, which weakens its effectiveness. In addition, there are no
                                   provisions allowing the FSC to impose more stringent prudential limits and
                                   requirements, barring individuals from the banking sector, replacing or restricting
                                   the powers of Board members or controlling owners.

12. Consolidated            LC     The FSC-FSS has put significant effort over the last few years towards
supervision                        implementing consolidated supervision. The issuance of the FHC Act, as well as
                                   the implementation of the RFI for FHCs, has been key steps in that direction.

                                 Several of Republic of Korea’s large banks are conglomerates with a wide variety
                                 of entities within the banking group and banks part of wider non-bank groups.
                                 Given such background, the framework in place does not fully allow for an in

                                 regarding its internal controls for managing the various businesses.

                                 banking side, particularly through stand-alone supervision, given its relevance
                                 within the activities of the FHCs. The overall monitoring is based on consolidated
                                 financials and assessment of the FHC regarding its internal controls for managing
                                 the various businesses.

13. Home-host             LC     The FSC-FSS has put in place procedures to share information and cooperate for

                                 situations from a cross-border perspective, as well as group resolution plans are
                                 yet to be established.

                                 The FSC-FSS set up a task force that has been working on standards and rule
                                 changes for D-SIB and is looking to complete the task in the near future.

14. Corporate             LC     Regulations are generally sound, although lack specificity in some aspects to fully
governance                       satisfy the criteria, with scope for supervisory practices to be strengthened with
                                 specific minimum requirements for corporate governance. Greater intensity of
                                 supervision and inspection of corporate governance could be applied across the
                                 entire deposit taking sector which includes non-banks where the regulations and
                                 oversight by boards are generally less developed.

15. Risk management       LC     Minimum requirements within the regulations not sufficiently broad to extend
process                          across the entire banking group. Risk management and compliance obligations
                                 should be given greater attention by supervisors through more frequent onsite
                                 reviews.

16. Capital adequacy     MNC     Basel II has not been fully implemented to include FHCs which are internationally
                                 active and calculate regulatory capital according to Basel I.

                                 Pillar 2 of BII has not been fully implemented across the population of domestic
                                 banks (including - internationally active banks).

                                 While an annual validation of internal models is performed by banks, there is no
                                 requirement in the regulations for the results of the validation to be assessed by
                                 the FSS prior to the updating of estimates used in the calculation of risk-weighted
                                 assets to determine the capital adequacy ratio. Notification requirements to the
                                 FSS regarding the ongoing discriminatory ability of models should be
                                 strengthened to ensure that models used as inputs into the risk-weight calculation
                                 are robust and meet minimum expectations as set out at accreditation.

17. Credit risk             LC     Main factors driving the rating:

                                       More frequent onsite credit risk examinations for the larger systemic banks to
                                        accurately assess credit underwriting standards and identify adjustments in
                                        risk-taking behavior; and

                                       Greater verification of sound operation of collateral management systems.

                                   Credit risk is the most relevant risk in the banking system in South Korea. Current
                                   macroeconomic conditions are challenging in this part of the credit cycle with an
                                   upward trend in unemployment and past due loans, albeit off a low base and
                                   potentially vulnerable credits could exist in performing credit portfolios. As a
                                   result, compliance with this Principle is critical. The FSS are aware of the
                                   vulnerabilities that current developments on credit risk entail for the financial
                                   system, and monitors data carefully on a quarterly basis. Owing to the importance
                                   of effective credit risk management, the team believes greater attention to this
                                   area is warranted. The team recommends that the FSS increase its attention to on-
                                   site inspections of credit risk. More frequent onsite inspections will improve the
                                   ability to assess underwriting standards and forward looking indicators such as:
                                   exceptions and overrides to policy; changes in the application of credit risk
                                   policies; application of covenants for commercial lending and covenant
                                   monitoring by risk management – each of which might not be easily visible from
                                   offsite monitoring. Special attention onsite should be given to independent
                                   valuation of collateral management systems.

                                   Credit underwriting standards could be strengthened across the industry.
                                   Particular weaknesses in the unsecured segment which has led to increasing levels
                                   of total debt, and with limited capacity to repay. Stricter attention to capacity to
                                   repay at time of writing loan and monitoring exceptions to policy. Particular
                                   weaknesses in the non-bank sector in credit underwriting that impact competitive
                                   tensions for market share with the banking sector.

                                   The FSS does not meet EC9 as the regulations allow banks considerable discretion
18. Problem assets,        MNC
                                   when reclassifying exposures as performing. The regulations permit the
provisions, and reserves
                                   reclassification of loans to performing without the borrower having proved
                                   repayment capacity under revised terms. While the FSS has increased its oversight
                                   of banks’ application of internal politics for reclassification of assets, a greater
                                   amount of supervisory attention is required to ensure banks’ apply appropriate
                                   risk management around this process. Attention to this aspect of provisioning
                                   should be enhanced, especially in the current credit cycle.

                                 Supervisory oversight of collateral valuation practices for defaulted loans needs
                                 greater attention. While the FSS implemented thresholds in December 2011 for
                                 exposures to be individual assessed and managed, greater supervisory attention is
                                 needed to ensure banks are applying the thresholds appropriately. In practice,
                                 internal bank officers are predominantly responsible for valuing collateral. FSS
                                 processes to assess the application of policies and the robustness of risk
                                 management of collateral valuation was not uniform across the major banks
                                 leading to potential inconsistencies and weaknesses. Prudent collateral valuation
                                 processes are necessary to help ensure adequacy of provisions. For the mortgage
                                 portfolios of banks (particularly inner-city apartments), collateral is re-valued on a
                                 regular basis against a market index (where available). Regulations stipulate at
                                 least quarterly re-valuation of collateral, and industry practice is generally monthly.
                                 In a reducing asset price environment, more frequent valuations are prudent,
                                 however, in a rising asset price environment this practice will lower the average
                                 portfolio LTV and raise collateral coverage against provisions through no change
                                 in debt reduction or increase in provisions respectively.

                                 Contributing to the rating is a lack of consistency in the definition of default
                                 between the commercial banking sector and non-banks. The definition of default
                                 differs across deposit taking institutions (mainly the domestic banks and non-
                                 banks). For domestic banks it is 90 days past due whereas for non-banks it is 180
                                 days.

19. Concentration risk   MNC     This CP has been considerably expanded from the previous methodology, and the
and large exposure               focus has shifted from “large exposures” to “risk concentration”, which includes
limits                           not only name risk but by industry, economic sector, geographic region, and by
                                 market (for instance, when banks are exposed to particular asset classes, products,
                                 collateral, or currencies). South Korea, as most countries, has not yet established
                                 guidance covering the whole spectrum of concentration risk management and
                                 monitoring. It is acknowledged that at the time of this assessment, the revised
                                 guidance by the BCBS on concentration risk has not yet been published. The CP
                                 goes beyond large exposures and into management of concentration risk which
                                 requires more of a portfolio approach. LE is by its nature focused on single name
                                 exposure requirements (or connected parties). Whereas concentration risk can be
                                 built up within a portfolio to the same asset class even where there are no LEs. The
                                 ICAAP captures references to concentration risk which is about management of
                                 the risk, not about how to manage when it comes onto the book ex ante. Risk
                                 management standards are not sufficiently detailed (i.e. Board reporting,
                                 management information systems, etc). Regulations not clear about definition of
                                 connected counterparties or the instances where this might be considered. No
                                 requirement in the Regulations for a LE to be approved by Senior Management or
                                 the BoD.

20. Transactions with        LC     Related party regulations for transactions with related parties permit exclusions
related parties                     under certain thresholds (30 percent for companies and 50 percent for non-profit
                                    organizations). As a result, the definition might not be comprehensive to capture a
                                    sufficiently broad number of related party transactions. The current definition of
                                    related party transactions is heavily geared towards credit exposures which is
                                    reflected in the reporting obligations of banks and the offsite analysis performed
                                    by supervisors. Related party transactions such as lease contracts, derivatives, write
                                    offs etc are not included in the definition of credit extension and not captured by
                                    supervisory oversight. Equally, scope to further develop specific guidance for
                                    banks on enhanced governance required for related party exposures i.e. Board
                                    reporting and approval. Given a full scope onsite review is only performed every
                                    two years whereby related party transactions are assessed in detail, offsite
                                    surveillance processes need to be strengthened to identify risks.

21. Country and              LC     The regulations are general in nature without an explicit requirement for transfer
transfer risks                      risk which inhibits the effectiveness of oversight of this risk by supervisors.
                                    Supervisory processes are not well developed to fully identify and assess this risk
                                    across the larger more complex banking groups. For example, intra-group
                                    transactions not specified in the regulations. The reporting by banks does not
                                    sufficiently aggregate across different asset classes, exposures and types of risk to
                                    provide an accurate and timely presentation of country and transfer risk.

22. Market risk              LC     Regulations for market risk permit banks to exclude Trading Book (TB) exposures
                                    from the calculating of market risk regulatory capital under two conditions:
                                    (i) where the ratio of the TB to total assets on the consolidated balance sheet is
                                    less than 5 percent maximum per day; and (ii) A bank where the TB is less than
                                    W 100 billion maximum per day. De-minimis exclusions from market risk are not
                                    unknown, however, the current thresholds are considered excessive. Given the
                                    exclusions allowed in the regulations, supervisory processes should be
                                    strengthened to monitor and assess traded market risk where exemptions are
                                    applied.

23. Interest rate risk in     C     The regulations require quarterly measurement and in the case of large change in
the banking book                    risk, more frequent. In practice, banks calculate and measure IRR on a monthly
                                    basis.

24. Liquidity risk           LC     The regulations do not require banks to comply with the liquidity ratios on a
                                    continuous basis, only at end of month. The method of calculation does not
                                    necessarily reflect the potential volatility in the preceding month or
                                    expected/forward looking volatility in deposit outflows. The method of calculating
                                    the one month won liquidity mismatch does not encourage banks to term out
                                    issuance of wholesale funding in an effort to reduce potential roll over risk in a
                                    crisis. To maximize management efficiency of assets to meet the one month
                                    maturity mismatch, banks are encouraged to invest in assets that mature within 30
                                    days (which is actually the case in Korea where much of the wholesale money is
                                    short term). The requirements for liquidity stress tests are not prescriptive. As a
                                    result, the basis for stress tests will differ across institutions through bank
                                    discretion of inputs and parameters and the identification of outliers and peer

                                   comparison is not easily performed. For example, banks with similar liquidity
                                   profiles might be applying vastly different run off assumptions obfuscating
                                   inherent risk profile.

25. Operational risk        LC     Regulations in relation to disaster recovery and business continuity do not set
                                   expectations for frequency of testing and recovery and the reporting of test results
                                   to the FSS, especially in the instance where results are adverse. There is a lack of
                                   specificity in the regulations of minimum requirements for data security and
                                   outsourcing. Supervisory assessment for embedment of operational risk
                                   management systems as part of the onsite examination needs improvement in
                                   respect of assessing the extent of risk and the adequacy of operational risk capital.
                                   Inputs into offsite analysis of operational risk could be improved with more
                                   granular detail, mainly nature of internal loss data. Peer group benchmarking of
                                   loss data would enrich the benefits of this analysis. The analysis of operational risk
                                   loss data could be enhanced. Out-sourcing requirements are not well developed.
                                   DR BCP minimum expectations are not well developed.

26. Internal control and     C     The regulations pertaining to internal control and audit are generally
audit                              comprehensive. There is a strong focus on internal controls within the Regulations
                                   which is reflected in the extent of offsite analysis and data submitted by the bank
                                   to the FSS. The onsite examination also has a strong focus on the effectiveness of
                                   Internal Audit.

27. Financial reporting     LC     The regulations do not permit the FSS the power to establish the scope of external
  and external audit               audits and in practice the scope of onsite and offsite supervision does not
                                   incorporate results from external audit. If the supervisor considers a specific risk
                                   type of line of business to be higher risk, there is no provision within the
                                   regulations to commission the External Auditor to look at this issue as part of the
                                   external audit.

                                   The Act of External Audit for Stock Companies does not apply to all depository
                                   institutions leaving the minimum standards for non-banks materiality short of
                                   banks.

                                   The FSS does not have the power to reject and rescind the appointment of an
                                   external auditor, who is deemed to have inadequate expertise or independence, or
                                   is not subject to or does not adhere to established professional standards.
                                   Removal of external auditors is left to the audit profession. There have been no
                                   incidence where the FSS or FSC has taken action in this regard to dismiss an
                                   auditor.

                                   The regulations are not sufficiently comprehensive to require public disclosure of
   28. Disclosure and       LC     accounts on a solo basis and does not specify the circumstances where this would
     transparency                  be appropriate. The regulations do not refer to principles of transparency and
                                   comparability, relevance and reliability.

                                               Regulations that govern Pillar 3 disclosure are not well developed and industry
                                               practice exhibits a number of inconsistencies with insufficient detail specifically in
                                               relation to banks that have been accredited to use the internal models. There is
                                               room for the publicly available financial data to be used in the supervisory process.
                                               The FSS reviews the public data but the supervisory framework is not complete or
                                               comprehensive as to how to use this data and integrate into the SREP and CAMEL-
                                               R approach by performing analysis and comparison against prudential data.

      29. Abuse of financial        LC         The supervisory approach does not use a risk-based methodology for supervising
            services                           banks (although the FIU is exploring a methodology) whereby higher risk firms
                                               would receive greater intensity and frequency of oversight.

                                               Scope to expand oversight across the entire population of deposit taking
                                               institutions. At present attention has been focused on the domestic banks of which
                                               practices for AML are improving. FIU will transition its focus to strengthening
                                               practices in securities and insurance sectors and finally smaller non-banks where
                                               risk profile is comparatively higher but asset size is lower.

                                         Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

Principle 1                              Responsibilities, objectives and powers. An effective system of banking supervision has
                                         clear responsibilities and objectives for each authority involved in the supervision of banks
                                         and banking groups.1 A suitable legal framework for banking supervision is in place to
                                         provide each responsible authority with the necessary legal powers to authorize banks,
                                         conduct ongoing supervision, address compliance with laws and undertake timely
                                         corrective actions to address safety and soundness concerns.2

                                         authority is responsible for supervising the banking system, a credible and publicly available
                                         framework is in place to avoid regulatory and supervisory gaps.

          (including non-financial) entities, may also be relevant. This group-wide approach to supervision goes beyond

                                    Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

Description and findings regarding Banking supervision is conducted in Korea through the Financial Services Commission (FSC),
EC1                                which delegates some of its supervisory functions to the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS),
                                   fully subordinated to the FSC.

                                    The FSC is an integrated supervisory authority, encompassing banking, insurance and
                                    securities supervision.

                                    The overall objectives of the FSC and the FSS are clearly defined through the Act on the
                                    Establishment of the Financial Services Commission (Establishment Act), enacted with the
                                    purpose to contribute to the growth of the national economy of the Republic of Korea
                                    (Article 1 of the Establishment Act).

                                    Article 1 of the Establishment Act also lay out the purpose for establishing the FSC and the
                                    FSS as:

                                         To promote the advancement of the financial industry;

                                         To promote the stability of the financial markets;

                                         Establish sound credit activity and fair financial transaction practices; and

                                         To protect depositors, investors and other financial consumers.

                                    Article 2 of the Establishment Act states that the FSC and the FSS shall endeavor to keep
                                    fairness, ensure transparency and refrain from disturbing the autonomy of financial
                                    institutions in performing their affairs.

                                    The FSC website http://www.fsc.go.kr/eng/ab/ab0304.jsp lists FSC missions as follows:

                                         First mission—“Creative Finance” to create more job opportunities (i) create virtuous
                                          cycle of capital among entrepreneurs and investors; (ii) reform policy finance system';
                                          and (iii) promote the financial industry as the next growth driver;

                                         Second mission—“Financial Inclusion” to ensure financial consumers’ happiness and
                                          safety (i) manage household debt growth/establish the National Happiness Fund;
                                          (ii) strengthen financial consumer protection; and (iii) prevent computer network
                                          failure for e-finance; and

                                         Third mission—“Solid financial system” to ensure fairness and transparency and to
                                          prevent financial crises (i) facilitate corporate finance to business; (ii) improve
                                          corporate governance of financial institutions; and (iii) eradicate unfair financial
                                          practices).

                                    The FSC was established under Article 2 of the Government Organization Act, as a central
                                    administrative agency, with Ministry status under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister to
                                    perform affairs regarding financial policies, FX supervision and financial supervision (Article
                                    3(1) of the Establishment Act), independently performing the administrative affairs under its
                                    authority as a central administrative agency (Article 3(2)).

                    Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

                    Article 17 of the Establishment Act lays out the administrative affairs that are within the
                    jurisdiction of the FSC, encompassing, among others:

                          Finance-related policies and systems including proposing amendments to acts and
                           presidential decrees;

                          Supervision and enforcement against financial institutions;

                          Licensing and other authorizations, including mergers, transfers and acquisitions;

                          Issuing regulations;

                          Bilateral and multilateral negotiations and international cooperation in relation to
                           banking supervision; and

                          Other affairs specified by other acts and subordinate statutes as the jurisdictional
                           affairs.

                    The FSS was established to perform affairs relating to the inspection and supervision over
                    financial institutions under the instruction and supervision of the FSC (Article 24 of the
                    Establishment Act).

                    Article 18 expressly grants the FSC the powers to deliberate and resolve on matters related
                    to the approval and amendment to the articles of incorporation of the FSS, approval of the
                    budgets and the settlement of accounts of the FSS, as well as other matters as deemed
                    necessary to perform its duties of supervising and instructing.

                    The FSS is a non-capital special corporation, established in 1999 as a result of the merger of
                    four supervisory bodies: Banking Supervisory Authority, Securities Supervisory Board,
                    Insurance Supervisory Board and Non-Bank Supervisory Authority.

                    Article. 37 of the Establishment Act lays out the business affairs of the FSS, including:

                          Inspection of the business affairs and the financial status of banks;

                          Sanctions resulting from examinations;

                          Assistance to the FSC and the institutions affiliated with the FSC (SFC and KOFIU); and

                          Other business affairs.

                    Currently the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Korea Financial Intelligence
                    Unit (KOFIU) are the only institutions affiliated with the FSC.

                    From a broader perspective, the protection of the stability of the overall financial system is
                    shared among five organizations: the FSC and the FSS, as well as the Ministry of Strategy
                    and Finance (MoF), the BoK, and the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation (KDIC). While the
                    FSC is in charge of the supervision and regulation of the financial system with the support of
                    the FSS, the MoF is responsible for macroeconomic policies, international finance and FX
                    policies; the KDIC is in charge of deposit insurance and the BoK of monetary and credit

EC 2                               The primary objective of banking supervision is to promote the safety and soundness of
                                   banks and the banking system. If the banking supervisor is assigned broader responsibilities,
                                   these are subordinate to the primary objective and do not conflict with it.

Description and findings regarding The Establishment Act (Article 1) lays out the purpose for the establishment of the FSC and

                                         To promote the stability of the financial markets;

                                         Establish sound and credit order and fair financial transaction practices; and

                                         To protect depositors, investors and other financial consumers.

                                   Article 2 states that the FSC and the FSS shall endeavor to keep fairness, ensure
                                   transparency and refrain from disturbing the autonomy of financial institutions in
                                   performing their affairs.

                                   It is not clear that in practice the primary objective of banking supervision is to promote the
                                   safety and soundness of banks and the banking system. Although objectives do encompass
                                   the promotion of financial stability, there is no indication that such is effectively the primary
                                   objective.

                                   In fact, some of the FSC and FSS objectives (in particular. to promote the advancement of
                                   the financial industry and the requirement to refrain from disturbing the autonomy of
                                   financial institutions in performing their affairs) might conflict with the supervisory
                                   objectives.

                                   Moreover, responsibilities related to consumer protection, as well as FX controls, which are
                                   not clearly separated from banking supervision activities, might not only drain important
                                   resources from banking supervision but also result in safety and soundness of banks and
                                   banking systems not being the first and foremost focus of the FSC and the FSS on its
                                   activities related to banks and banking groups.

                                   While within the FSS, consumer protection affairs are the responsibility of the Financial
                                   Consumer Protection Bureau, while the FX Supervision Department is in charge of FX
                                   supervision. In practice though, examinations related to those topics are conducted by the
                                   examination departments, diverting resources and focus to non-core banking supervisory
                                   activities.

EC3                                Laws and regulations provide a framework for the supervisor to set and enforce minimum
                                   prudential standards for banks and banking groups. The supervisor has the power to

Description and findings regarding Article 34 of the Banking Act lays down instructions on safety and soundness for banks:
EC3
                                          Requiring banks to insure safety and soundness through solid capital and
                                           appropriate liquidity;

                                              Requiring banks to observe prudential standards determined by the FSC relative to
                                               capital, assets, liquidity and other necessary matters for ensuring safety and
                                               soundness of banks; and

                                              Allowing the FSC to request banks to take the necessary measures to comply with
                                               prudential requirements including ordering capital increases, restrictions on
                                               dividends, etc.

                                        Article 50 of the Financial Holding Companies (FHC) Act—Guidelines for Sound
                                        Management—requires FHCs to maintain equity capital in good faith, manage liabilities,
                                        cash flow, etc., as well as secure safety and soundness through proper management of its
                                        subsidiaries. It also requires FHCs to comply with prudential standards prescribed by the
                                        FSC, as well as other matters to secure its safety and soundness. The FHC Act empowers the
                                        FSC to order corrective measures if an FHC is deemed to significantly undermine its safety
                                        and soundness due to non-compliance with prudential standards. The FHC Act also
                                        empowers the FSC to require submission of an action plan for management improvement, a
                                        capital increase, restriction on distribution of profits, and disposal of stocks of any
                                        subsidiary.

                                         The legal framework does not explicitly grant the FSC or the FSS power to increase the
                                        prudential requirements for individual banks and banking groups based on their risk profile
                                        and systemic importance.

EC4                                     Banking laws, regulations and prudential standards are updated as necessary to ensure that
                                        they remain effective and relevant to changing industry and regulatory practices. These are
                                        subject to public consultation, as appropriate.

Description and findings regarding The legal and regulatory framework for banking supervision in place in the Republic of
EC4                                Korea has been updated often, with several amendments over the last years in Laws,

                                    Changes to the Banking Act and other financial laws can be proposed by the FSC (the
                                    government/executive body) or a member of the National Assembly and approved by the
                                    National Assembly (the legislature) after parliamentarian deliberation. The Banking Act was
                                    last updated in September 2011.

                                    The republic of Korea makes use of Presidential Decrees to issue enforcement rules relative
                                    to Acts. Presidential Decrees on Acts pertaining to its scope are drafted by the FSC and are
                                    also updated frequently, with the last update being issued as of February 2012.

                                    are regularly held regarding new regulations/detailed regulations. The FSS also issues
                                    guidelines, as needed.

                                    The Regulatory Reform Committee, under the line of authority of the President, reviews all
                                    Acts and Presidential Decrees. Regulations and detailed regulations are subject to review

                                   (and in the case of FHCs, as per Article 51 of the FHC Act, it also encompasses subsidiaries)
                                   or require board members, executives or staff to present an oral statement. In practice, the

                                   Article 34(4) of the Banking Act grants the FSC the power to request banks to take the
                                   necessary measures to insure compliance with prudential standards (including risk
                                   management and overall management), such as an increase of capital, restriction on
                                   dividends, etc.

                                   Article 53(1) of the Banking Act—Sanctions against Banks—grants the FSC power to issue a
                                   corrective order or to order a partial suspension of business for not more than six months.
                                   The measures are to be taken upon the recommendation of the Governor of the FSS.
                                   Alternatively, the FSC can require the Governor of the FSS to take appropriate measures
                                   (such as suspending the relevant violation, issuing warnings, etc.,—further elaborated under

                                   Article 53(2) grants the FSC the power to order a bank to suspend all of its business within a
                                   fixed period of at least six months or revoke authorization for banking business. Grounds for
                                   such measures include: obtaining a license under false or illegal means; violation of a
                                   condition or term of authorization; carrying out business during a suspension period; failure
                                   to execute a corrective order; interests of depositors or investors likely to be greatly
                                   undermined due to a violation.

                                    that shall be applied as a result of particular legal breaches.

                                    There are no legal provisions for cooperation and collaboration with relevant authorities to
                                    achieve an orderly resolution of a bank, including triggering resolution, where appropriate.
                                    Nevertheless, decisions related to banks’ resolution are taken by the FSC commissioners,
                                    which encompass representatives of all the relevant domestic authorities and are based on
                                    majority of those present. The commissioners encompass a Chairman, a Vice Chairman, the
                                    Vice Minister of the MoF, the Deputy Governor of the BoK, the President of the KDIC, the
                                    Governor of the FSS, as well as two members recommended by the Chairman of the FSC,
                                    and one recommended by the Chairman of the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

EC7                                 The supervisor has the power to review the activities of parent companies and of companies
                                    affiliated with parent companies to determine their impact on the safety and soundness of
                                    the bank and the banking group.

Description and findings regarding As detailed in previous ECs, The FSC-FSS does have the power to license and supervise
EC7                                FHCs. Powers do not go beyond the FHC to controlling interests and their affiliates with the
                                   exceptions of a few particular cases, including the possibility of illegal transactions (Article
                                   48–2 of the Banking Act and Article 51–2).

Assessment of Principle 1           LC

Comments                            Responsibilities, objectives and powers related to banking supervision are clearly defined in
                                    the Republic of Korea. Nevertheless, conflicting objectives and responsibilities might concur
                                    with the objectives related to safety and soundness of the banking system. Responsibilities
                                    related particularly to fair financial transactions and consumer protection and the way they
                                    are being implemented through FSC and FSS can results in conflicts between
                                    “developmental” and safety and soundness objectives. In addition, the objectives of the
                                    FSC-FSS are apparently, to a certain extent, tilted to the promotion of the financial industry.

                                    The legal framework currently in place reasonably provide the necessary powers to
                                    authorize the establishment of banks, conduct ongoing supervision, address compliance
                                    with laws and regulations, as well as undertake corrective actions to address safety and
                                    soundness concerns. Limitations include the fact that the FSC-FSS does not have the power
                                    to increase the prudential requirements for individual banks and banking groups based on
                                    their risk profile and systemic importance.

                                    The current legal limitations for access to affiliates and non-financial entities of banking
                                    groups were not factored in rating this CP as they were reflected under CP12.

                                    The authorities should consider:

                                        Clarify the primary importance and priority of safety and soundness duties;

                                        Clearly segregate its safety and soundness duties from the other assigned to the
                                         supervisory body; and
                                        Amend the legal framework in order to enable the supervisors to increase the
                                         prudential requirements for individual banks and banking groups based on their risk
                                         profile and systemic importance.

                                     Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

                                    In May 2013 two departments not directly related to banking supervision (the corporate
                                    credit department and the micro credit support department) were put directly under the FSS
                                    Senior Deputy Governor for banking and non-banking supervision.

Principle 2                         Independence, accountability, resourcing and legal protection for supervisors. The
                                    supervisor possesses operational independence, transparent processes, sound governance,
                                    budgetary processes that do not undermine autonomy and adequate resources, and is
                                    accountable for the discharge of its duties and use of its resources. The legal framework for
                                    banking supervision includes legal protection for the supervisor.

Essential Criteria

EC1                                 The operational independence, accountability and governance of the supervisor are
                                    prescribed in legislation and publicly disclosed. There is no government or industry
                                    interference that compromises the operational independence of the supervisor.

                                    The supervisor has full discretion to take any supervisory actions or decisions on banks and
                                    banking groups under its supervision.

Description and findings regarding The Establishment Act sets broad principles regarding independence and accountability as
EC1                                follows: Article 3(2) states that the FSC shall independently perform its duties under its
                                   authority as a central administrative agency, while Article 2 requires the FSC and the FSS to
                                   aim to ensure transparency.

                                    The FSC is a central administrative agency under the jurisdiction of the prime minister. It is
                                    composed of nine commissioners: a Chairperson, a Vice Chairperson, the Vice Minister of
                                    the MoF, the Deputy Governor of the BoK, the President of the KDIC, the Governor of the
                                    FSS, as well as two members recommended by the Chairman of the FSC, and one
                                    recommended by the Chairman of the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

                                    Article 11 of the Establishment Act rules on the functioning of the Commissioners’ meetings
                                    and provides, to a certain extent, on conflict of interest.

                                    Article 11(4) rules on the circumstances under which an FSC commissioner may be rescued
                                    or may not participate in the deliberation/resolution of matters in which: he has a direct
                                    interest; matters in which his/her spouse, his/her relative within the fourth degree of
                                    consanguinity, or his/her relative within the second degree of affinity, a corporation with
                                    which he/she is affiliated has an interest; a matter regarding budgeting, settlement of
                                    accounts, or amendment of articles of incorporation of the relevant institution related to the
                                    previous cases. Article 11(5) establishes that if a Commissioner has grounds to believe that it
                                    is difficult to expect his impartiality of a Commissioner in deliberation and resolution of a
                                    certain case, he may file a recusal request for the Chairperson to decide on the matter.
                                    Article 11(6) allows a Commissioner to voluntarily withdraw himself from deliberation and
                                    resolution on particular case.

                                    The FSC states that, as a general rule, FSC commissioners must be excused from any matter
                                    that raises the potential for conflict of interest. Meetings are to be held with a majority of
                                    commissioners (5 members) and decisions should be achieved through majority.

                                          are under the authority of the FSC and are subject to approval through a Commissioners’
                                          meeting. Given the current structure of commissioners, it is not clear how independence can
                                          be guaranteed.

EC2                                       The process for the appointment and removal of the head(s) of the supervisory authority
                                          and members of its governing body is transparent. The head(s) of the supervisory authority
                                          is (are) appointed for a minimum term and is removed from office during his/her term only
                                          for reasons specified in law or if (s)he is not physically or mentally capable of carrying out
                                          the role or has been found guilty of misconduct. The reason(s) for removal is publicly
                                          disclosed.

Description and findings regarding As per Article 4 of the Establishment Act, the Chairman of the FSC is appointed by the
EC2                                President, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. The Chairman has to undergo a
                                   non-deliberative confirmation hearing held by the National Assembly. The term of the
                                   Chairman is three years, renewable for one more term. Dismissals can occur based on
                                   mental or physical disability, breaches of any official obligation, bankruptcy, if the Chairman
                                   is found incompetent to perform his/her duties (Article 10), or if during its mandate fails to
                                   fulfill the qualification requirements to be appointed Commissioner, which would include
                                   being sentenced to prison or sentenced to a fine.

                                          There are no legal requirements for the reasons for dismissal to be publicly disclosed. The
                                          last three Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen resigned prior the end of their term.

                                          The Governor of the FSS is also appointed by the President upon the recommendation of
                                          the Chairman of the FSC, for a three-year term, also renewable for one further term (Article
                                          29). Reasons for dismissal include bankruptcy, criminal sentence, mental of physical
                                          disabilities or violation/breach of the Establishment Act or the articles of incorporation.
                                          According to the FSS/FSC of the three most recent FSS governors (excluding the
                                          incumbent), the two most recent governors served out their full three-year terms. The third
                                          governor resigned before the start of a new administration. A total of three senior deputy
                                          governors and seven deputy governors currently serve under the governor. Out of the ten,
                                          six are from within the FSS.

                                          It has been practice for Governors and Commissioners to resign once a new government
                                          term is initiated.

                                    encompass audits related to the accounts of the state. The BAI can also conduct
                                    discretionary inspections in cases it deems needed, or as a result of a Prime Minister

Description and findings EC4        The FSC was established through the merger of the financial policy function of the former
                                    Ministry of Finance and Economy, and the financial supervisory function of the former
                                    Financial Supervisory Commission. The FSC is the primary supervisory authority, enacting,

                                    encompassing rules for convening meetings, preparation of written resolutions (which are
                                    mandatory), consideration of opinions (it may consider opinions from Deputy Governors
                                    and other relevant experts), as well as emergency measures. Those emergency measures can
                                    be taken by the Chairperson in case of any internal or external trouble, a natural disaster or
                                    a grave financial or economic crisis and are required to be reported to the Commissioners
                                    afterwards, which can confirm, amend or suspend them. The FSC is supported by a
                                    secretariat.

                                    The executive officers of the FSS encompass the governor, senior deputy governor, deputy
                                    governors, and the auditor. The governor sets forth the duties for the executive officers
                                    (Articles of Incorporation, articles 7–11; Organization and Management Bylaws, article 33).

                                    For a discussion on conflicts of interest please refer to EC1 and EC5.

EC5                                The supervisor and its staff have credibility based on their professionalism and integrity.
                                   There are rules on how to avoid conflicts of interest and on the appropriate use of
                                   information obtained through work, with sanctions in place if these are not followed.
Description and findings regarding The Establishment Act sets out some rules aimed at avoiding conflict of interest. Appointed

      experts Commissioners cannot engage in for-profit business, be an executive or employee
      of a supervised institution, be a member of the National Assembly or the local council, or
      hold any office which entitles remuneration while holding such positions.

      The FSC is staffed by public officials and their conduct is governed by the State Public
      Officials Act. The Public Service Ethics Act (Article 2–2) requires public officials to avoid
      conflicts of interest. Article 60 of the State Public Officials Act also established that public
      officials are bound by confidentiality requirements.

      All employees of the FSS are subject to its Code of Conduct, in which Article 5 states the
      obligation to avoid any possible conflict of interest. Article 35 of the Establishment Act
      requires information received by FSS senior management and staff not to be disclosed or
      used for any purpose other than their duties. In addition, the Rules of Employment (Article
      8) clearly state the requirement of confidentiality of information. In case of any violations,
      the Ethical Committee may take punitive actions, in accordance with the rules of Personnel
      Management.

      The Governor, Deputy Governors, the Auditor, and also staff of the FSS are not allowed to
      engage in any affairs for profit other than their duties, or to hold any office without approval
      from the relevant appointing authority (Article 34 of the Establishment Act).

      Article 35 expressly forbidden the Governor, Deputy Governors, the Auditor and employees
      of the FSS to exercise influence over financial institutions, its executives and employees, in
      order to receive money, valuables or any other benefits, or the financial institution to grant
      a loan.

      Any person who divulges confidential information acquired in the course of performing his
      duties, or uses such information for any purpose other than for his duties, is subject to
      imprisonment up to three years and a fine up to W 20 million (Article 68 of the
      Establishment Act).

      Non-public official Commissioners, as well as executives and employees of the FSS are
      deemed public officials for the purpose of penal provisions under the Criminal Act or any
      other Act (Article 69 of the Establishment Act), which relates to bribes.

      In addition, violations of duties by public officials are subject to removal, dismissal,
      demotion, suspension from office, reduction of salary and reprimand (Article 78 of the State
      Public Officials Act). Interfering with examinations and engagement in political activities can
      result in imprisonment for up to a year and a fine of up to W 5 million.

      Overall, staff seemed diligent, dedicated and very thorough and professional in conducting
      tasks assigned to them.

EC6   The supervisor has adequate resources for the conduct of effective supervision and
      oversight. It is financed in a manner that does not undermine its autonomy or operational
      independence. This includes:

      (a)   A budget that provides for staff in sufficient numbers and with skills commensurate
            with the risk profile and systemic importance of the banks and banking groups
            supervised;

                                    (c)   The ability to commission external experts with the necessary professional skills and
                                          independence, and subject to necessary confidentiality restrictions to conduct
                                          supervisory tasks;

                                    (d)   A budget and program for the regular training of staff;
                                    (e)   A technology budget sufficient to equip its staff with the tools needed to supervise
                                          the banking industry and assess individual banks and banking groups; and
                                    (f)   A travel budget that allows appropriate on-site work, effective cross-border
                                          cooperation and participation in domestic and international meetings of significant
                                          relevance (e.g. supervisory colleges).

Description and findings regarding The FSC’s budget allocation and deliberation processes are equivalent of those of other
EC6                                government organizations and are reviewed and approved by the MoF and the National
                                   Assembly (Article 54 of the Constitution). The FSC follows the salary scale of the
                                   government’s civil servants. The FSC staff is composed by government officials who are
                                   selected based through a national exam, reported to be successful in attracting and
                                   retaining quality staff. FSC reported not to have, in practice, constraints in terms of budget
                                   that could limit its supervisory actions.

                                    The FSS is funded by fees charged to the regulated financial institutions and securities
                                    issuers (Article 47 of the Establishment Act). The fees charged to private financial institutions
                                    and securities issuers are levied in accordance with clear standards and fixed rates,
                                    calculated taking into account costs of supervision and asset size. The FSS budget is
                                    approved by the FSC (Article 45 of the Establishment Act) and so far has been sufficient to
                                    cover all expenditures planned. The Establishment Act also provides for the FSS to borrow
                                    funds upon approval of the FSC (Article 48), in case of need. Article 47 also lists the
                                    Government and the BoK as additional sources of funding.

                                    The FSS is required to set its budget in accordance with “The Guidelines for the budget
                                    compilation on Public Institutions and Quasi-Government Organizations” of the MoF.

                                    Currently, the major budget expenditures include the following:

                                      Salaries;

                                      Staff training;

                                      Consultation fees for external experts;

                                      Technology expenditure; and

                                      Budget for travel, on-site examination, and other field work.

                                    Authorities stated that the salary scale of the FSS is comparable to that of the BOK and also
                                    that the FSS looks into the salary scales of other comparable entities and industries for
                                    reference purposes. Staff stated that in practice the total compensation of the public
                                    servants under the FSC ends up being somewhat equivalent to the FSS compensation
                                    package.

                                     Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

                                    The FSS reported to carry out regular and ad-hoc staff rotation and reassignments to ensure
                                    efficient allocation of supervisory resources. Turn-over rate is believed to be low due to
                                    restrictions on financial sector employment for employees who leave the FSS. Managerial-
                                    level employees who leave the FSS are required to have a 2 year cooling off period from the
                                    date of the termination of employment with the FSS prior accepting employment in a
                                    private company that has had any contact or relationship with the FSS within the previous
                                    five years. Exceptions may be granted by the Government Officials Ethics Committee under
                                    special circumstances.

                                    The FSS reported to conduct wide-ranging training programs and run an examination
                                    academy, in order to enhance staff supervision and examination skills. The FSS also operates
                                    a training credit acquisition system, which requires employees to periodically take training
                                    and acquire the minimum credits. The entry-level associate employees receive training on
                                    financial supervision and regulation prior their job assignment and are tested for promotion
                                    to the next level.

EC7                                 As part of their annual resource planning exercise, supervisors regularly take stock of
                                    existing skills and projected requirements over the short- and medium-term, taking into
                                    account relevant emerging supervisory practices. Supervisors review and implement
                                    measures to bridge any gaps in numbers and/or skill-sets identified.

Description and findings regarding The FSS annual resource planning exercise, conducted at the end of each year, includes a
EC7                                review of the annual operations and an estimate of the staffing needs and the budget
                                   required for the following year. Recent revisions included the expansion of the division in
                                   charge of participating in global financial supervisory standard setters. Other actions
                                   included the expansion of divisions, staffing, as well as budget, to enhance financial
                                   consumer protection, in addition to small loans financing and IT security.

EC8                                 In determining supervisory programs and allocating resources, supervisors take into account
                                    the risk profile and systemic importance of individual banks and banking groups, and the
                                    different mitigation approaches available.

Description and findings regarding Supervisory programs and allocation of resources, within banking supervision, are largely
EC8                                determined by assets’ size. Risk profile and systemic importance of individual banks and
                                   banking groups are not explicitly taken into account when determining supervisory
                                   programs and allocating resources.

                                    Moreover, the current structure and allocation criteria for staff does not seem to adequately
                                    prioritize or segregate safety and soundness concerns for banks or the financial system
                                    relative to its other mandates. The deputy governors in charge of banking supervision are
                                    also in charge of other activities related to consumer protection. In practice, the number of
                                    staff directly allocated to banking supervision does not seem proportionate to the scope or
                                    relevance of their activities.

                                    The authorities state that the organizational structure and allocation of human resources of
                                    the FSS are flexibly adjusted in response to changes in the financial environment, as well as
                                    supervisory demands. The scope and workload of each supervision department is reviewed
                                    annually to determine the staffing needs. In addition, the authorities also stated that the FSS
                                    conducts extensive surveys of staff needs in each department and that results are reflected

                                   on the resource allocation decision. It was also stated that supervisors are assigned to the
                                   Banking Supervision and the Bank Examination departments based on such analysis, with
                                   due weight given to the importance of the banking system. In practice, nevertheless, staff,
                                   which is overall highly committed, seemed extremely overloaded in key areas.

EC9                                Laws provide protection to the supervisor and its staff against lawsuits for actions taken
                                   and/or omissions made while discharging their duties in good faith. The supervisor and its
                                   staff are adequately protected against the costs of defending their actions and/or omissions
                                   made while discharging their duties in good faith.

Description and findings regarding According to the Rules of the Board of Audit and Inspection of the Republic of Korea,
EC9                                actions taken and omissions made by bank supervisors, while discharging duties in good
                                   faith, are exempt from sanctions, provided that certain conditions of public interest,
                                   transparency, and validity are met.

                                   In practice, when civil or criminal lawsuits are brought against FSS employees, the FSS,
                                   through the decision of a Litigation Support Committee comprised of senior executives, can
                                   provides an internally employed counselor to assist with the lawsuit or financial support, to
                                   retain an outside counselor, or to cover the costs of defending employees’ actions or
                                   omissions made while discharging their duties in good faith (Regulation on Support for
                                   Employees facing lawsuits). The financial support is deemed to be adequate to cover 70
                                   percent of expenses.

                                   The FSC-FSS reported that there are currently a total of 87 cases of litigations and appeals
                                   involving the FSC, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), and the FSS and from those,
                                   4 relate to banking.

                                   Out of the 258 appeals and litigations that have been filed against the FSC, the SFC, and the
                                   FSS over the last five years—the large majority referred to non-banking cases the favorable
                                   rulings accounted for 93.1percent (202 out of 217 cases closed); a total of 14 cases were
                                   ruled unfavorably and one case was determined to have no relevance by the Prosecutor’s
                                   Office. During the past five years there has been no case in which the FSC or the SFC or the
                                   FSS has been required to compensate a third party for damages.

Comments                           The legal status of the FSC within the Government structure as a ministerial agency can
                                   potentially grant the FSC additional means to exercise its independence in comparison to
                                   structures were the supervisory agency is within the authority of the MoF. On the other
                                   hand, the direct subordination to the Prime Minister can also potentially threat its
                                   independence.

                                   In principle there are some checks and balances processes in place including the FSC and
                                   the FSS internal audit, the BAI, as well as the investigations conducted by the Assembly, in
                                   particular the role of the Assembly in inspecting the FSC-FSS activities.
                                   Nevertheless, the fact that the Commissioners encompass representatives from the MoF and
                                   the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry poses challenges in terms of conflicts of
                                   interest.

                                       potentially jeopardize staff willingness to act and effectiveness of supervision.

                                       The authorities should consider:

                                           Reviewing the current composition/functioning of the Commission in order to shield
                                            the Commission against conflicts of interest;

                                           Revising the legal protection framework in order to ensure that supervisors cannot be
                                            sued directly by market participants in cases of actions or omissions made in good
                                            faith; and

                                            order to allocate the appropriate volume of resources to safety and soundness and risk

Description and findings regarding In September 2009, a MoU was signed on information sharing and joint examination
EC1                                between the MoF, the FSC, the FSS and the KDIC) to minimize systemic risks by identifying
                                   risks early and responding to them jointly. In 2012, the MoU was updated to encompass
                                   into the scope of information sharing ad-hoc reports, in addition to the regular reports
                                   submitted by banks. Detailed information on examinations or internal reports produced by
                                   the FSS is not shared under the MoU.

                                       There are a few committees attended by domestic authorities that foster cooperation and
                                       information sharing. The Macroeconomic and Financial Committee is composed by the
                                       deputy-heads of the FSC, FSS, the MoF, the BOK, and the KDIC, which meet to discuss
                                       trends and risks in the economy and in the financial/FX markets. The Economic and Financial
                                       Council is composed by the heads of financial authorities and is conveyed to coordinate and
                                       decide on macroprudential policies. The Financial Condition Check Meeting is conducted
                                       between the FSC and the FSS to review and discuss the financial agenda on a monthly basis.

                                    The BOK and the KDIC can request the FSS to conduct an examination or carry out joint
                                    examinations for the purpose of carrying out monetary policies and protecting financial
                                    consumers, respectively (Articles 62 and 66, Establishment Act).

                                    sharing of information, and undertaking collaborative work, with relevant foreign
                                    supervisors of banks and banking groups. There is evidence that these arrangements work
                                    in practice, where necessary.

Description and findings regarding The authorities have signed information sharing MoUs with banking supervisors of 14
EC2                                countries including the U.S., China, Japan, France, and Germany bank supervisors, enabling
                                   the authorities to obtain supervisory information from relevant foreign authorities. In
                                   addition, the FSS exchanges bank supervisory information with foreign supervisors by
                                   participating in supervisory colleges held by the home supervisors; it also invites host
                                   supervisors from abroad to attend its own supervisory colleges.

EC3                                 The supervisor may provide confidential information to another domestic authority or
                                    foreign supervisor but must take reasonable steps to determine that any confidential
                                    information so released will be used only for bank-specific or system-wide supervisory
                                    purposes and will be treated as confidential by the receiving party.

Description and findings regarding The FSS regularly provides information obtained from financial institutions to other
EC3                                supervisory authorities including the BOK and the KDIC, based on a MoU, as described in
                                   EC1. The recipient authorities may use the information only to fulfill objectives unique to the
                                   authority under strict confidentiality, as per the MoU.

                                    Information exchange with foreign supervisory authorities usually take places under MoUs
                                    that limit the use of information to supervision purposes only, and requires prior consent
                                    before passing it on to a third party.

EC4                                 The supervisor receiving confidential information from other supervisors uses the
                                    confidential information for bank-specific or system-wide supervisory purposes only. The
                                    supervisor does not disclose confidential information received to third parties without the
                                    permission of the supervisor providing the information and is able to deny any demand
                                    (other than a court order or mandate from a legislative body) for confidential information in
                                    its possession. In the event that the supervisor is legally compelled to disclose confidential
                                    information it has received from another supervisor, the supervisor promptly notifies the
                                    originating supervisor, indicating what information it is compelled to release and the
                                    circumstances surrounding the release. Where consent to passing on confidential
                                    information is not given, the supervisor uses all reasonable means to resist such a demand
                                    or protect the confidentiality of the information.

Description and findings regarding Article 35 of the Establishment Act provides that information obtained by the FSS senior
EC4                                management and staff, or while performing official duties, must not be disclosed for any
                                   purpose other than for their duties.

                                    The MoU on information sharing was signed between the MoF, the BoK, the FSC, and the

                                    The authorities informed that the MoUs signed by the FSC with foreign supervisory
                                    authorities provide that no information may be passed on to a third party without prior
                                    consent of the originating authority. The MoUs made available to the assessors confirmed
                                    such practice.

EC5                                 Processes are in place for the supervisor to support resolution authorities (e.g. central banks
                                    and finance ministries as appropriate) to undertake recovery and resolution planning and
                                    actions.

Description and findings regarding The FSC is the resolution authorities in the Republic of Korea. The FSC is granted the power
EC5                                (Article 10 of the Structural Improvement of the Financial Industry Act—Structural
                                   Improvement Act) to impose corrective measures including as mergers and P&A. The FSC
                                   may entrust to the Governor of the FSS the authority governing timely corrective measures
                                   (Article 10 of the Structural Improvement Act).

                                    The FSC is also empowered to appoint special administrators to manage a bank on behalf of
                                    its executives, or recommend a general meeting of stockholders to dismiss its executives
                                    (Article 14 of the Structural Improvement Act).

                                    The authorities recently established a Macroeconomic Financial Committee, composed by
                                    representatives of the MoF, the BoK, the FSC, and the KDIC. In practice, the Committee does
                                    not have decision power (for a detailed discussion on the Macroeconomic Financial
                                    Committee, please refer to the Technical Note on Crisis Management).

Description and findings regarding Permissible activities of institutions that are licensed and subject to supervision as banks are
EC2                                defined under the Banking Act.

                                     Banks are allowed to operate banking business, services incidental to banking business, and
                                     services concurrent to banking business.

                                     Article 2(1(1) defines the term “banking business” as the business of lending funds raised by
                                     bearing debts from many unspecified persons through the receipt of deposits or through
                                     the issuance of securities and other banks.

                                     Article 3 of the Banking Act states that all banks in the Republic of Korea shall be operated
                                     under the Banking Act, the BoK Act, the Establishment Act and regulations and orders
                                     issued under those. Article 5, nevertheless, sets up a special case for the National Federation
                                     of Fisheries Cooperatives, stating that any credit operations of the National Federation of
                                     Fisheries Cooperatives shall be deemed as a bank. Article 6 states that insurers and
                                     companies exclusively engaged in savings bank business shall not be deemed as banks and
                                     are regulated through specific Acts.

                                     Article 27 of the Banking Act states that a bank may engage in all services in banking
                                     business, comprised of the following: receipt of deposits and saving deposits, and issuance
                                     of securities and other debentures; loans of funds or discount of notes; domestic and FX.

                                     If a bank is to engage in a new service incidental to banking business, it is required to report
                                     to the FSC. Article 27–2 allows banks to operate services incidental to banking services, in
                                     which case banks are required to file it at the FSC within seven days prior to the date in
                                     which it intends to start such services. Incidental services include: guarantee of debts or
                                     takeover notes; mutual savings, factoring; custody activities; execution of collection and
                                     payment as an agent; to be a credit depository of a local government as an agent; execution
                                     of payment related to electronic commercial transactions as an agent; sale and lease of
                                     computer systems and software related to banking business; training on finance and
                                     publication of books and periodicals on finance; investigations and research on finance;
                                     other incidental services to banking services prescribed by Presidential Decree. Article 18 of
                                     the Enforcement Decree of the Banking Act (EDBA) defines those other services as: lease of
                                     real estate for business purposes; sale of revenue stamps, lotteries, gift certificates, etc. as an
                                     agency; advertisement; other services determined and publicly announced by the FSC. The
                                     RSBB (Article 25) lays out those cases—sale on consignment of bullion coins, development
                                     and sale of gold related financial products, as well as other services such as the issue of
                                     electronic tax invoices for another person, etc.

                                     Banks are required to report incidental business seven days prior to the date in which they
                                     intend to initiate such services (Article 27–2). In cases where the FSC assess the incidental
                                     services to undermine soundness in the management of a bank, to hindrance the protection
                                     of bank users (e.g., depositors, etc.) or to threat the stability of financial markets, the FSC
                                     may order the restriction or correction of such incidental service (Article 27–2(5) of the
                                     Banking Act). Albeit the short notice, the FSC-FSS reported that in two cases limitations to
                                     those incidental business were imposed.
                                     Article 28 of the Banking Act allows banks to operate on “concurrent business” which are

                                         file a report with the FSC seven days prior commencing the new business.

                                    For those cases under Article 28, where authorization is not required, the FSC has the power
                                    to order a restriction or correction of the new business in deemed necessary.

         The Committee recognizes the presence in some countries of non-banking financial institutions that take deposits
        but may be regulated differently from banks. These institutions should be subject to a form of regulation
        commensurate to the type and size of their business and, collectively, should not hold a significant proportion of
        deposits in the financial system.

Assessment of Principle 4           C

Comments

Principle 5                         Licensing criteria. The licensing authority has the power to set criteria and reject
                                    applications for establishments that do not meet the criteria. At a minimum, the licensing
                                    process consists of an assessment of the ownership structure and governance (including the
                                    fitness and propriety of Board members and senior management)9 of the bank and its wider
                                    group, and its strategic and operating plan, internal controls, risk management and

                                    projected financial condition (including capital base). Where the proposed owner or parent
                                    organization is a foreign bank, the prior consent of its home supervisor is obtained.

Essential Criteria

EC1                                 The law identifies the authority responsible for granting and withdrawing a banking license.
                                    The licensing authority could be the banking supervisor or another competent authority. If
                                    the licensing authority and the supervisor are not the same, the supervisor has the right to
                                    have its views on each application considered, and its concerns addressed. In addition, the
                                    licensing authority provides the supervisor with any information that may be material to the
                                    supervision of the licensed bank. The supervisor imposes prudential conditions or
                                    limitations on the newly licensed bank, where appropriate.

Description and findings regarding Article 8(1) of the Banking Act states that any person who intends to engage in banking
EC1                                business is required to obtain authorization from the FSC.
                                   The Banking law also grants the FSC broad powers to revoke a license (Article 53(2)),
                                   including: cases where the authorization on banking business was obtained through false or

          This document refers to a governance structure composed of a board and senior management. The Committee
        recognizes that there are significant differences in the legislative and regulatory frameworks across countries
        regarding these functions. Some countries use a two-tier board structure, where the supervisory function of the
        board is performed by a separate entity known as a supervisory board, which has no executive functions. Other
        countries, in contrast, use a one-tier board structure in which the board has a broader role. Owing to these
        differences, this document does not advocate a specific board structure. Consequently, in this document, the terms
        “board” and “senior management” are only used as a way to refer to the oversight function and the management
        function in general and should be interpreted throughout the document in accordance with the applicable law within
        each jurisdiction.

                                   of the fulfillment of the requirements and submits a recommendation to the FSC on the
                                   matter. The decision regarding a new license is achieved through a Commissioners’
                                   meeting.

EC2                                Laws or regulations give the licensing authority the power to set criteria for licensing banks.
                                   If the criteria are not fulfilled or if the information provided is inadequate, the licensing
                                   authority has the power to reject an application. If the licensing authority or supervisor
                                   determines that the license was based on false information, the license can be revoked.

Description and findings regarding Criteria for licensing banks are prescribed through the Banking Act, the EDBA and the RSBB.
EC2
                                   Article 8(2) of the Banking Act sets the requirements to be met in order to obtain
                                   authorization for banking business. Articles 1–7 and Article 3 of the EDBA, together with
                                   Articles 5 and Annex 2–2 of the RSBB, further detail the necessary requirements and content
                                   of the application for authorization, and also grants the FSC power to set additional
                                   requirements and necessary information to be provided when applying for a banking
                                   license.

                                   Article 53 (2) of the Banking Act allows the FSC to suspend a bank’s business or revoke
                                   authorization for banking business if the authorization was based on false information.

                                   The authorities reported that no application has been filed (either from a domestic applicant
                                   or a foreign applicant) for a commercial or specialized banking license over the past 20
                                   years. No license has been revoked over the last five years.

                                   The FSC has the power to impose conditions when granting a license deemed to be
                                   necessary for the stability of financial markets, securing the soundness of banks and/or the
                                   protection of depositors. (Article 8(4).

                                   Over the last several years there have been no applications for licenses of new banks or
                                   subsidiaries of foreign banks although branches of foreign banks have been authorized to
                                   operate in the Republic of Korea. No case has been denied. In one particular case the
                                   authorities instructed the foreign entity to adjust their proposal prior the official submission.

EC3                                The criteria for issuing licenses are consistent with those applied in ongoing supervision.

Description and findings regarding Necessary requirements to be met while applying for a banking license are broadly
EC3                                consistent with those applied in ongoing supervision.

                                   Criteria include complying with shareholding limits; promoters and executives (which
                                   include Board members) to meet fit and proper criteria (Article 8 of the Banking Law—
                                   qualifications for executives); the entity to meet prudential standards, to have adequate

                                        appropriate, that these structures will not hinder effective implementation of corrective
                                        measures in the future.

Description and findings regarding Overall, banking license requirements in the Republic of Korea are extensive. There are no
EC4                                explicit references in the legal or regulatory framework, nevertheless, determining that the
                                   proposed legal, managerial, operational and ownership structures of the banks and its wider
                                   group will not hinder effective supervision on both a solo and consolidated basis but taking
                                   into account the overall assessment criteria provided under Appendix 2–2 of the RSBB it
                                   seems that it wouldn’t be possible to establish shell banks in the Republic of Korea.

                                        The RSBB, Appendix 2–2, lays out the examination standards for approval of banking
                                        business, encompassing minimum requirements on business feasibility assessments, as well

                                        Korea, there is a requirement to obtain approval from the home supervisor in cases where
                                        such approval is necessary (from a home supervisor perspective) for the establishment of
                                        entities overseas. Other requirements include solid and internationally acknowledged
                                        financial and management status of the parent, as well as that such financial institution is
                                        subject to consolidated supervision by the home supervisor.

EC5                                     The licensing authority identifies and determines the suitability of the bank’s major
                                        shareholders, including the ultimate beneficial owners, and others that may exert significant
                                        influence. It also assesses the transparency of the ownership structure, the sources of initial
                                        capital and the ability of shareholders to provide additional financial support, where needed.

Description and findings regarding A person or an entity seeking to hold shares of a bank as a major shareholder must have
EC5                                sufficient investment capabilities, sound financial conditions and social credibility (Article 8
                                   of the Banking Act).

                                        The FSC-FSS reviews, among others, information provided by the applicant on any sanctions
                                        received, as well as information from the KDIC and law enforcement authorities.

                                        Sources of initial capital have to be appropriate and it has to be possible to raise additional
                                        capital, if necessary (Appendix 2–2 of the RBB). There is no explicit reference within the
                                        legal/regulatory framework to transparency of the ownership structure.

                                        In the case of FHCs, shareholders exercising “de facto” control are required to have
                                        adequate investment capacity, financial soundness and social credibility. Article 2 (2–9) of
                                        the FHC Act provides the definition of a “large shareholder”, which consists of the largest
                                        shareholder and major (principal) shareholders. A major shareholder is defined as a
                                        shareholder that exerts “de facto” influence over the important management decisions of an
                                        FHC, its subsidiaries, and sub-subsidiaries through the appointment and/or dismissal of

                                          is considered a large shareholder in cases where the shareholder exerts de facto control
                                          over the FHC.

                                          In the Republic of Korea, all the commercial banks are currently subsidiaries of FHCs;
                                          therefore their large shareholders are subject to the FHC Act.

                                          It is not clear that the current assessment procedures regarding large shareholders in
                                          practice would encompass ultimate beneficial owners and others that would exert
                                          significant influence in the case of banks which are not under a FHC.

                                          In case of branches of foreign banks, the FSC-FSS reported that applicants are required to
                                          provide the group structure of the head office. Within the requirements there is no
                                          reference to information on affiliates and other related parties. Overall, the assessment is
                                          based on a letter of commitment from the parent and a no-objection letter from the parent
                                          supervisory authorities.

EC6                                       A minimum initial capital amount is stipulated for all banks.


Description and findings regarding The Banking Act (Article 8(2)) provides for a minimum capital of KRW 100 billion for a

EC7                                       The licensing authority, at authorization, evaluates the bank’s proposed Board members and
                                          senior management as to expertise and integrity (fit and proper test), and any potential for
                                          conflicts of interest. The fit and proper criteria include: (i) skills and experience in relevant
                                          financial operations commensurate with the intended activities of the bank; and (ii) no
                                          record of criminal activities or adverse regulatory judgments that make a person unfit to
                                          uphold important positions in a bank.11 The licensing authority determines whether the
                                          bank’s Board has collective sound knowledge of the material activities the bank intends to
                                          pursue, and the associated risks.

Description and findings regarding Licensing criteria does encompass a fit and proper test for banks’ executives (Article 8(2(6))
EC7                                in combination with Article 18 of the Banking Act).

                                          The EDBA (Article 12) defines an executive as those who are not directors but execute
                                          businesses of a bank, using a title which is deemed appropriate for the execution of
                                          businesses of the bank, such as honorary chairperson, chairperson, vice chairperson,

                                     home supervisor has been received. For cross-border banking operations in its country, the
                                     host supervisor determines whether the home supervisor practices global consolidated
                                     supervision.

Description and findings regarding Foreign financial companies aiming at establishing operations in the Republic of Korea (as
EC10                               described in EC4), are required to comply with requirements laid out in the RSBB.

                                   company) approval from the home supervisor is required in cases where such approval is
                                   necessary—from a home country perspective—for the establishment of foreign subsidiaries.
                                   Other requirements include that the parent is systemically (including subsidiary companies
                                   and offices) supervised by the home supervisor; solid and internationally acknowledged
                                   financial and management status of the parent; provision of sufficient information on the
                                   parent’s management and business activities.

                                     There is no explicit requirement for a no-objection from the home supervisors although in

                                     regulation (Appendix 25 of the RSBB) expressly requires approval from the home
                                     supervisors.

EC11                                 The licensing authority or supervisor has policies and processes to monitor the progress of

                                     supervisory requirements outlined in the license approval are being met.

Description and findings regarding New entrants are submitted to the same on and off site processes applied to those entities

                                     to go through files and confirm licensing practices.

                                     Drivers for the rating included the fact that criteria to be assessed for licensing do not
                                     explicitly encompass elements relative to the detection and prevention of criminal activities
                                     or the oversight of proposed outsourced functions.

                                     Another shortcoming related to the suitability assessment (including potential conflicts of
                                     interest) of large shareholders encompassing the ultimate beneficial owners.

                                     Regarding assessment criteria for Board members, the authorities informed that legislation
                                     on the ownership structure of financial companies submitted to the National Assembly and
                                     yet to be approved provides that the outside directors should be persons who possess
                                     hands-on experience in the financial sector or professional financial knowledge, or who hold
                                     hands-on experience in management, law, or accounting.

                                     In addition, the authorities should consider:
                                           Amending the banking and respective enforcement decree and regulation to ensure
                                            that suitability of shareholders encompass the ultimate beneficial owners;

                                           Amending the legal/regulatory framework to expressly require a no-objection from
                                            the home supervisor in all cases of establishment of subsidiaries of foreign banks in
                                            the Republic of Korea; and

                                           Amending the RSBB to explicitly include assessments regarding the detection and
                                            prevention of criminal activities and oversight of outsourced functions.

                                     The authorities informed their intention to revise the relevant regulations to enhance the
                                     transparency of the ownership structure of foreign bank branches, requiring further
                                     information on the group structure, including its affiliates and related parties, when they
                                     seek regulatory approval for a branch operation.

                                     The authorities also reported their intention to act to revise the licensing criteria to
                                     incorporate an evaluation of the proposed internal controls relative to the identification and
                                     prevention of criminal activities, the oversight of proposed outsourced functions, as well as
                                     to expressly include the requirement for a no-objection from the home supervisor.

Principle 6                          Transfer of significant ownership. The supervisor13 has the power to review, reject and
                                     impose prudential conditions on any proposals to transfer significant ownership or
                                     controlling interests held directly or indirectly in existing banks to other parties.

Essential Criteria

EC1                                  Laws or regulations contain clear definitions of “significant ownership” and “controlling
                                     interest.”

Description and findings regarding The definition of significant ownership in the Banking Act is based on percentage of

        13
           While the term “supervisor” is used throughout Principle 6, the Committee recognizes that in a few countries these
        issues might be addressed by a separate licensing authority.

                                    exercise influence).

                                    Article 2(1(10)) defines “large shareholder” as

                                          A shareholder of a bank where the shareholder and its related parties (as defined in
                                           Article 2(1(8))) hold more than 10 per cent (15 per cent of a bank which does not

                                          A shareholder of a bank where the shareholder and its related parties have holdings
                                           of more than 4 per cent (10 per cent for local banks) and exercises de facto influence

                                           dismissing its executives.

                                    Article 2(1(8)) defines the term “same person” as the principal and a person having a special
                                    relationship with the principal (a “specially related person”, i.e. related parties). Article 14 of
                                    the EDBA defines related parties as spouse, blood relatives in a second cousin relationship
                                    and relatives in a first cousin relationship, as well as companies where there is a
                                    shareholding over 30 percent, although certain exclusions apply.

                                    In practice, currently in the Republic of Korea, all commercial banks (nationwide and
                                    regional banks) are subsidiaries of bank holding companies; thus large bank shareholders
                                    are subject to the FHC Act.

                                    Article 2(19) of the FHC Act sets forth the definition of large shareholder of a bank holding
                                    company. Large shareholder is further divided into the largest shareholder and the major
                                    (principal) shareholder.

                                    Major shareholder is a shareholder that exercises material influence on the management of
                                    the FHC or the subsidiaries or the sub-subsidiaries of the FHC through representation in the
                                    board or the senior management; Article 33 of the Enforcement Decree of the FHC Act also
                                    defines it as a shareholder who exercises material influence (“de facto influence”).

EC2                                 There are requirements to obtain supervisory approval or provide immediate notification of
                                    proposed changes that would result in a change in ownership, including beneficial
                                    ownership, or the exercise of voting rights over a particular threshold or change in

                                   voting shares. Holdings beyond 10 percent can be authorized only if it is deemed to be
                                   necessary in view of the possibility to contribute to the efficiency and soundness of the

                                   Article 15 also requires reporting to the FSC cases where a shareholder and its related
                                   parties seek to hold shares in excess of four percent of the voting shares and become the
                                   bank’s largest shareholder; where they hold over four percent and become the largest
                                   shareholder; any one percent increments over four percent of the voting shares (i.e., 5, 6,
                                   and 7 percent etc.); when there is any change in partnership of a private equity fund holding
                                   over 4 percent; when there is change in shareholding or partnership in an special purpose
                                   company (SPC) which holds over four percent of the voting shares.

                                   Article 15–2 deals with “non-financial business operators” as banks’ shareholders, requiring
                                   approval from the FSC in cases where a shareholder (or potential) and its related parties
                                   intend to acquire voting shares in excess of four percent, or participate in the management
                                   by appointing or dismissing executives.

                                   In the case of FHCs, Article 61 of the FHC Act requires only reporting in cases of transfer of
                                   significant ownership (no approval required), with the exception of non-financial business
                                   operators.

                                   After the crisis in 1997 the Republic of Korea took measures to avoid having the main
                                   business groups in the country (the “Chaebols”) as banks’ large shareholders. For that
                                   purpose, the Banking Act (Article 2(9) defines a “non-financial business operator” as a
                                   company and its related parties with total assets over three trillion Won (Article 1–5(2) of
                                   the EDBA). Art 2(8) of the FHC Act defines a non-financial business operator in a similar
                                   manner.

EC3                                The supervisor has the power to reject any proposal for a change in significant ownership,
                                   including beneficial ownership, or controlling interest, or prevent the exercise of voting
                                   rights in respect of such investments to ensure that any change in significant ownership
                                   meets criteria comparable to those used for licensing banks. If the supervisor determines
                                   that the change in significant ownership was based on false information, the supervisor has
                                   the power to reject, modify or reverse the change in significant ownership.

Description and findings regarding In the case of banks, changes of ownership between four and ten percent require reporting
EC3                                to the FSC (Article 15(2)). Holdings over 10 percent require approval and are subject to
                                   several requirements, with the exception of the non-financial business operators, which are
                                   required to seek approval for holdings over four percent. In such cases where approval is
                                   required the supervisor.

                                   The FSC-FSS reported that over the past five years, a total of seven requests for transfer of
                                   significant ownership have been filed. All were approved without appeal or any special
                                   conditions.

                                   The legal framework does not explicitly give the authorities power to reject, modesty or
                                   reverse changes in significant ownership that were authorized based on false information.
                                   Nonetheless, hold.

EC4                                The supervisor obtains from banks, through periodic reporting or on-site examinations, the
                                   names and holdings of all significant shareholders or those that exert controlling influence,
                                   including the identities of beneficial owners of shares being held by nominees, custodians
                                   and through vehicles that might be used to disguise ownership.

Description and findings regarding Article 16–4 of the Banking Act requires the FSC to examine whether holdings of a bank’s
EC4                                stocks comply with the various limits and the necessary qualifications established through
                                   the Banking Act and the EDBA.

                                    Article. 11–4 of the EDBA requires the FSC, on a semiannual basis (and through ad-hoc
                                    examinations, if necessary), to verify whether qualifications for significant ownership are
                                    met.

                                    Article 10 of the DRSBB require banks to report to the Governor of the FSS the names and
                                    holdings of significant shareholders within one month prior the general meeting of
                                    shareholders.

                                    In case of FHCs, information major shareholders and their related parties is obtained
                                    quarterly.

                                    In addition, under Article 11–9 of the Regulation on Supervision of Financial Holding
                                    Companies (RSFHC), banks and bank holding companies are required to provide to the
                                    authorities an updated list of the 50 largest shareholders (including related parties) on an
                                    annual basis. In practice though, shareholdings below four percent are not monitored,
                                    irrespectively of considerations regarding exertion of influence.

EC5                                 The supervisor has the power to take appropriate action to modify, reverse or otherwise
                                    address a change of control that has taken place without the necessary notification to or
                                    approval from the supervisor.

Description and findings regarding According to Article 16 of the Banking Act and Article 10 of the FHC Act, in cases where the
EC5                                same person has holdings that exceed the limits without the proper authorization,
                                   shareholding rights cannot be exercised until approval is obtained, which should be sought
                                   promptly. In case of failing to seek approval, the FSC may order the disposal of those stocks.

Comments                            The FSC has the power to review, reject and impose prudential conditions on proposals to
                                    transfer significant ownership or controlling interests held directly or indirectly in existing
                                    banks to other parties. In practice though, transfer of significant ownership or controlling
                                    interest do not require approval in several cases.

                                    In addition, the definition of large shareholder provided by the Banking Act is too narrow, as
                                    it does not contemplate the possibility of shareholdings below 4 percent resulting in “de
                                    facto” control or controlling interest, although in practice all commercial banks are
                                    subsidiaries of FHCs.

                                    The authorities are recommended to:

                                          Require approval for transfers of ownership that can result in changes in effective
                                           control; and

                                          Amend the Banking Act in order to expand the definition of large shareholder.

Principle 7                         Major acquisitions. The supervisor has the power to approve or reject (or recommend to
                                    the responsible authority the approval or rejection of), and impose prudential conditions on,
                                    major acquisitions or investments by a bank, against prescribed criteria, including the
                                    establishment of cross-border operations, and to determine that corporate affiliations or
                                    structures do not expose the bank to undue risks or hinder effective supervision.

Essential Criteria

EC1                                 Laws or regulations clearly define:

                                    (a)   What types and amounts (absolute and/or in relation to a bank’s capital) of
                                          acquisitions and investments need prior supervisory approval; and

                                    (b)   Cases for which notification after the acquisition or investment is sufficient. Such cases
                                          are primarily activities closely related to banking and where the investment is small
                                          relative to the bank’s capital.

Description and findings regarding As a general rule, banks cannot hold more than 15 percent of a non-financial company, with
EC1                                the exception of corporate restructuring, which requires approval from the FSC (Article 37 of
                                   the Banking Act).

                                    Article 24 of the Improvement Act, requires banks to seek pre-approval from the FSC when
                                    a bank, including a banking group that owns a bank, intends to hold more than 20 percent
                                    of another company or 5 percent of another company and at the same time has a “de facto”
                                    control of the company.


                                    Article 49 of the RSBB lays down cases where banks are allowed to hold over 15 percent of
                                    certain companies, which broadly encompass either supervised institutions or finance-

stocks are issued through the capitalization of either capital reserves or asset-revaluation
reserves, or when are issued as profit dividends, those conditions do not need to apply.
Neither the Banking Act (Article 37) nor the RSBB (Article 49) refer to the need of
notification or approval for those exceptions. Article 47(7) of the Banking Act require in
general that capital injections into subsidiaries should be reported to the FSC.

EC2                                 Laws or regulations provide criteria by which to judge individual proposals.

Description and findings regarding Article 24(6) of the Improvement Act requires acquisitions to fulfill the following
EC2                                requirements:

                                           Type of business: financial institutions or activities auxiliary to financial services,
                                            companies linked to a special purpose corporation under the Rental Housing Act or
                                            finance-related companies, including credit information business;

                                           Not to restrict competition; and

                                           In the case of FHCs, criteria for approval (which can also be conditional) encompass
                                            assessment of business plan, safety and soundness of the FHC, as well as impact on
                                            competition pursuant to the Fair Trade Act (Article 17 of the FHC Act).

EC3                                 Consistent with the licensing requirements, among the objective criteria that the supervisor
                                    uses is that any new acquisitions and investments do not expose the bank to undue risks or
                                    hinder effective supervision. The supervisor also determines, where appropriate, that these
                                    new acquisitions and investments will not hinder effective implementation of corrective
                                    measures in the future.14 The supervisor can prohibit banks from making major acquisitions/
                                    investments (including the establishment of cross-border banking operations) in countries
                                    with laws or regulations prohibiting information flows deemed necessary for adequate
                                    consolidated supervision. The supervisor takes into consideration the effectiveness of
                                    supervision in the host country and its own ability to exercise supervision on a consolidated
                                    basis.



        14
          In the case of major acquisitions, this determination may take into account whether the acquisition or investment
        creates obstacles to the orderly resolution of the bank.

                                     Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

Description and findings re EC3     The establishment of cross-border operations, in principle, does not require prior
                                    authorization.

                                    Article 47(4) of the Banking Act requires banks to report (after the fact) establishment of
                                    cross-border operations, including overseas local corporations, branches or offices. Article
                                    3–3 of the EDB, in combination with Article 10 of the RSBB, lays out particular cases
                                    requiring prior reporting to the FSC, which include: banks with a regulatory capital ratio
                                    under eight percent and a CAMELR of 3 or higher; countries rated below B+ or with no
                                    credit rating; cases where the overseas corporation is planned to run business other than
                                    banking services, incidental services or concurrent business or business different from those
                                    that the bank is currently running; as well as in countries that do not have a friendly
                                    relationship with the Republic of Korea. Articles 16 and 18 of the FHC Act also provide that
                                    the takeover of a foreign financial firm with assets in excess of KRW100 billion must be
                                    approved by the FSC.

                                    Currently there are no legal or regulatory provisions in place that encompass among the
                                    objective criteria to be used within the approval process that any new acquisitions and
                                    investments do not expose the acquirer to undue risks or hinder effective supervision.

                                    There are also no provisions to enable the supervisor to prohibit banks from making major
                                    acquisitions/investments (including the establishment of cross-border banking operations)
                                    in countries with laws or regulations prohibiting information flows deemed necessary for
                                    adequate consolidated supervision. There are also no provisions to take into consideration
                                    the effectiveness of supervision in the host country and its own ability to exercise
                                    supervision on a consolidated basis.

                                    Where it is determined that the proposed investment is likely to undermine the bank’s
                                    safety and soundness or adversely affect the stability of the financial market, the FSC-FSS
                                    may impose restrictions or changes to the investment plan (Article 13(3) of the Banking Act).
                                    Supervisory actions may follow in the event of noncompliance (Article53 of the Banking
                                    Act).

EC4                                 The supervisor determines that the bank has, from the outset, adequate financial,
                                    managerial and organizational resources to handle the acquisition/investment.

Description and findings regarding Legal provisions, as described in EC 2, are set under Article 24(6) of the Improvement Act,
EC4                                which requires that potential acquisitions encompass only financial institutions or activities
                                   auxiliary to financial services, companies linked to a special purpose corporation under the
                                   Rental Housing Act (Article 51–2(1) 6 of the Corporate Tax Act) or finance-related
                                   companies, including credit information business. Those transactions are also required to
                                   not restrict competition.

                                    In practice, nevertheless, a case made available to the assessors indicated that the decision
                                    process encompasses, in addition to the legal requirements, considerations regarding the
                                    financial impact of the acquisition to the acquirer, as well as business purpose.

EC5                                 The supervisor is aware of the risks that non-banking activities can pose to a banking group
                                    and has the means to take action to mitigate those risks. The supervisor considers the ability
                                    of the bank to manage these risks prior to permitting investment in non-banking activities.

                                    For acquisitions over five percent, when there is effective control, approval must be
                                    obtained. Approval can be granted in the case of non-bank activities only if those activities
                                    are directed related to financial business.

Assessment of Principle 7           LC

Comments                            Major acquisitions of non-financial companies are restricted in the Republic of Korea.
                                    Overall the authorities rely on reporting for dealing with and monitoring acquisitions of
                                    financial companies.

                                    The assessors understand that the current framework could result in acquisitions being
                                    made that might be not in the best interest of safety and soundness, as well as the
                                    settlement of subsidiaries in countries with a lax supervisory environment.

                                    The authorities are recommended to amend the legal framework in order to:

                                         Require approval for major acquisitions or for the establishment of cross-border
                                          subsidiaries;

                                         Have legal basis to consider the impact on banks business in making approvals; and

                                         Establish criteria to be used within the approval process requiring that new acquisitions
                                          and investments do not expose the acquirer to undue risks or hinder effective
                                          supervision.

                                    The authorities reported that in order to ensure effective prior regulatory review for the
                                    establishment of cross-border banking, the FSC-FSS will take appropriate regulatory
                                    measures in order to assess whether the host country provides information flows necessary
                                    for satisfactory consolidated supervision and whether the host country has the ability to
                                    exercise effective supervision on a consolidated basis.

Principle 8                         Supervisory approach. An effective system of banking supervision requires the supervisor
                                    to develop and maintain a forward-looking assessment of the risk profile of individual banks
                                    and banking groups, proportionate to their systemic importance; identify, assess and
                                    address risks emanating from banks and the banking system as a whole; have a framework
                                    in place for early intervention; and have plans in place, in partnership with other relevant
                                    authorities, to take action to resolve banks in an orderly manner if they become non-viable.

Essential Criteria

EC1                                 The supervisor uses a methodology for determining and assessing on an ongoing basis the
                                    nature, impact and scope of the risks:

                                    (a)   Which banks or banking groups are exposed to, including risks posed by entities in
                                          the wider group; and

                                   Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

                                   (b)   Which banks or banking groups present to the safety and soundness of the banking
                                         system.

                                   The methodology addresses, among other things, the business focus, group structure, risk
                                   profile, internal control environment and the resolvability of banks, and permits relevant
                                   comparisons between banks. The frequency and intensity of supervision of banks and
                                   banking groups reflect the outcome of this analysis.

Description and findings regarding The FSC-FSS supervisory methodology encompasses the use of rating tools, as well as on
EC1                                and off-site monitoring. The use of ratings aims at enabling comparisons between banks
                                   and peer groups. Peer groups are split between large commercial banks, regional banks,
                                   specialized banks, and foreign branches.

                                   One of the cornerstones of the FSS approach to supervision of commercial banks is the
                                   CAMEL-R, a rating system comprising the assessment of Capital adequacy, Asset quality,
                                   Management, Earnings, Liquidity and Risk management. The CAMEL-R was recently
                                   introduced, replacing the CAMELS. Ratings are assigned to each component and combined
                                   into a composite rating.

                                   In case of branches of foreign banks operating in the Republic of Korea, as well as overseas
                                   branches of domestic banks, the FSS makes use of the ROCA (Risk management,

                                    Operational control, Compliance, and Asset quality), which is focused at monitoring
                                   controls of overseas operations, and factored into the CAMELR.

                                   The CAMELR is comprised of quantitative and qualitative components. The quantitative
                                   components derive from an off-site methodology (CAEL – Capital, Asset quality, Earnings
                                   and Liquidity) which is updated quarterly and enable the monitoring of trends and sudden
                                   movements. The qualitative component is updated every two years, through a full-scope
                                   examination.

                                   In the case of the ROCA, the quantitative component is derived from the AELS (Asset
                                   quality, Earnings, Liquidity and Support), which is updated quarterly. The strength of support
                                   from the parent is assessed based on their credit ratings (from internationally recognized
                                   credit rating providers). For overseas branches, the quantitative components of the ROCA
                                   are derived from the AEL, which is updated semiannually.

                                   The FSC-FSS also make use of a tool solely focused on risk management assessment –
                                   RADARS (Risk Assessment and Dynamic Assessment Rating System). The RADARS is
                                   conducted by using a risk matrix, splitting the activities of banks into 14 business lines,
                                   where each of them with a defined set of inherent risks, which are rated taking into account
                                   previously established indicators (quantitative component) as well as risk management level
                                   (qualitative component). Banks are assigned ratings (from 1 to 5) and directions, achieving
                                   13 levels of risk. The quantitative element of RADARS is updated semiannually, and its
                                   results are used as inputs to plan examinations for the following year. During the full scope
                                   examinations of banks, which occur every two years, the qualitative elements are assessed
                                   and fed into CAMELR (R component).

                                   The CAMELR is linked to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework (please refer to CP
                                   11) which hasn’t yet been triggered for banks.

                                  Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

                                  Currently the FSC-FSS supervisory approach focus mostly on the dominant entity within a
                                  group (measured by total assets). The extent of the assessment of business focus, group
                                  structure and overall risk profile, or resolvability of banks and groups is limited. Particularly
                                  regarding the FHCs, the supervisory approach focuses mostly on controls and management
                                  tools (please refer to CP 12).

                                  Full-scope on-site examinations are performed biannually for all banks, irrespectively of
                                  their risk profile. The authorities state that the reason for not differentiating the frequency of
                                  full-scope examinations is the perceived soundness of banks.

                                  The authorities also state that since asset size, portfolios, and business focus of the seven
                                  local private commercial banks are similar to each other, in addition to having similar
                                  systemic importance and as a consequence roughly same the number of supervisors
                                  assigned, the length, and the frequency of full-scope examinations are also similar. In
                                  addition, all seven banks have the same CAMEL-R rating. Regional banks and foreign bank
                                  branches are reported to be subject to shorter examinations—3 weeks and 2 weeks
                                  respectively—and inspection cycles might vary.

                                  Partial examinations are triggered by particular issued flagged by the off-site monitoring,
                                  the CAEL, or specific issues industry-wide, although in practice a significant portion of those
                                  partial examinations have been focused on non-core supervisory issues.

EC2                               The supervisor has processes to understand the risk profile of banks and banking groups
                                  and employs a well defined methodology to establish a forward-looking view of the profile.
                                  The nature of the supervisory work on each bank is based on the results of this analysis.

Description and findings re EC2   The process for understanding the risk profile of banks (encompassing its subsidiaries) is
                                  based on on-site examination and off-site surveillance, supported by the CAEL, CAMEL-R
                                  and RADARS as detailed in EC1. The RADARS, also as detailed in EC1, incorporate a direction
                                  component (decreasing, stable, and increasing).

                                  In practice, those monitoring tools do not seem to have embedded a forward-looking view
                                  of banks risk profile. It is also not clear that the nature of the supervisory work in each bank
                                  is based on the result of those analyses.

                                  The authorities state that the Republic of Korea commercial banks are similar to each other
                                  in terms of size and operation, resulting in examination processes being similar.

                                  Processes regarding FHCs are mostly focused on internal controls and management (please
                                  refer to CP12). Bank supervisors closely and thoroughly monitor the financials of banks and
                                  bank holding companies (i.e., capital adequacy, asset quality, liquidity, etc.), as well as how
                                  those entities manage risks. Periodic Business Reports, off-site surveillance and on-site
                                   examination are used to perform such monitoring. The results of the financial monitoring
                                  are incorporated into the supervision of banks, as well as the overall banking industry.

                                  Major risk indicators are made public on a regular basis.

EC3                               The supervisor assesses banks’ and banking groups’ compliance with prudential regulations

                                    Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

Description and findings regarding The FSC-FSS has a comprehensive process to assess banks and bank’s holding companies
EC3                                compliance with prudential regulations and other legal requirements. The process
                                   comprises the use of several tools encompassing off-site surveillance through the
                                   assessment of business reports (received on a quarterly basis), as well as on-site
                                   examinations. Prudential regulation and legal requirements assessments encompass: capital
                                   requirements, large exposures, connected lending, limits to shareholdings and to real estate
                                   investments, among others. The FSS receives a very broad and detailed set of information
                                   on a regular basis, which enables a robust process for checking compliance with limits and
                                   others. Qualitative assessments are mostly conducted on-site, through their full-scope
                                   examinations.

EC4                                 The supervisor takes the macroeconomic environment into account in its risk assessment of
                                    banks and banking groups. The supervisor also takes into account cross-sectoral
                                    developments, for example in non-bank financial institutions, through frequent contact with
                                    their regulators.

Description and findings regarding The FSS utilizes an early warning system, as well as stress testing, to assess the potential
EC4                                impact of macroeconomic changes on individual banks and the overall banking industry on
                                   an ongoing basis, encompassing also insurance, securities and other non-bank financial
                                   institutions.

                                    The early warning system is composed by “handy indicators” and early warning models. The
                                    “handy indicators”, are monitored through a report generated on a monthly basis (data is
                                    generated daily). Currently there is a set of seven indicators, encompassing asset quality,
                                    funding and risk-premium. Findings can trigger meetings and requirements for banks to
                                    take actions (e.g. submission of an improvement plan). The early warning models combine
                                    individual financials and other information from banks with macroeconomic data and focus
                                    on likelihood of changes in the capital ratio and bankruptcy, among others. It is produced
                                    on a quarterly basis by the Macroprudential Department.

                                    The FSS has robust information systems for sharing data and documents among the
                                    different areas in charge of banking, insurance and securities. In practice public data is freely
                                    available and in preparation for an examination, an inquiry is submitted to the various areas
                                    of FSS requesting input on areas or issues that should be covered by the examination to be
                                    initiated.

EC5                                 The supervisor, in conjunction with other relevant authorities identifies, monitors, and
                                    assesses the build-up of risks, and trends and concentrations within and across the banking
                                    system as a whole. This includes, among other things, banks’ problem assets and sources of
                                    liquidity (such as domestic and foreign currency funding conditions, and costs). The
                                    supervisor incorporates this analysis into its assessment of banks and banking groups and
                                    addresses proactively any serious threat to the stability of the banking system. The
                                    supervisor communicates any significant trends or emerging risks identified to banks and to
                                    other relevant authorities with responsibilities for financial system stability.

                                    The FSC-FSS monitor and assess the risk profiles of banks and the overall banking industry,
                                    by analyzing periodic Business Reports through the CAEL, which cover, among others, asset
                                    quality and liquidity (both local and foreign currency), as well as utilizing early warning
                                    models and “handy indicators”. Overall, industry-wide reports are also produced on an ad-
                                    hoc basis, triggered by detected trends or recent events.

EC6                                 Drawing on information provided by the bank and other national supervisors, the
                                    supervisor, in conjunction with the resolution authority, assesses the bank’s resolvability
                                    where appropriate, having regard to the bank’s risk profile and systemic importance. When
                                    bank-specific barriers to orderly resolution are identified, the supervisor requires, where
                                    necessary, banks to adopt appropriate measures, such as changes to business strategies,
                                    managerial, operational and ownership structures, and internal procedures. Any such
                                    measures take into account their effect on the soundness and stability of ongoing business.

Description and findings regarding The Republic of Korea is not required to introduce such plans under the ”Key attributes of
EC6                                Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions” as no domestic bank has been
                                   designated as a Global Systemically Important Financial Institution (G-SIFI). Authorities have
                                   informed to be drafting a regulation on Domestic SIFIs (D-SIFIs). After the regulation is
                                   finalized, the establishment of a recovery and resolution regime for D-SIFIs will be
                                   considered.

EC7                                 The supervisor has a clear framework or process for handling banks in times of stress, such
                                    that any decisions to require or undertake recovery or resolution actions are made in a
                                    timely manner.

Description and findings regarding The FSC also counts with a wide range of corrective measures, including a corrective action
EC7                                framework that enables action-taking in times of stress. Triggers include the capital ratio or
                                   CAMELR rating falling below a certain level, among others triggers (please refer to CP 11).

                                    Over the last years, there has not been any case of use of the corrective action framework.

                                    FSC decides on the resolution proceedings for a bank, particularly related to corrective
                                    actions, designation of a troubled bank, merger, transfer of contractual commitments to its
                                    customers to a stronger institution, and bankruptcy. The FSC is to decide on the resolution
                                    proceedings based on the plan submitted by the bank on improving its conditions.

EC8                                 Where the supervisor becomes aware of bank-like activities being performed fully or
                                    partially outside the regulatory perimeter, the supervisor takes appropriate steps to draw
                                    the matter to the attention of the responsible authority. Where the supervisor becomes
                                    aware of banks restructuring their activities to avoid the regulatory perimeter, the supervisor
                                    takes appropriate steps to address this.

Description and findings regarding Bank-like activities are regulated and defined by Acts and legally punishable (please refer to
EC8                                EC 4). Investigations are triggered in case of file of complaints, or information provided on
                                   potentially bank-like activities being performed fully or partially outside the regulatory
                                   perimeter. In case of need, findings are submitted to the responsible authority for further
                                   proper legal actions, including reporting to the prosecutor’s office. Non-authorized deposit
                                   taking is also subject to a fine of negligence up to 50 million won, to be applied by the FSC

                                     without permission.

Assessment of Principle 8            LC

Comments                             The supervisory approach in place relies heavily on off-site monitoring and notifications of
                                     exceptions, as well as on a biannually full-scope on-site examination, with a robust and
                                     strong compliance foundation.

                                     The existence of multiple points of responsibility with various teams in charge of particular
                                     sub segments, operating more or less autonomously, limits to a certain extent the ability of
                                     the FSS to maintain a thorough understanding of the overall risk profile of individual banks
                                     and banking groups., also potentially undermining the willingness to act and overall
                                     accountability regarding a bank or a banking group.

                                     The over reliance on a comprehensive and relatively homogeneous full-scope examination
                                     performed every two years as the major source for qualitative assessment of risk
                                     management limits the forward looking capability of its supervisory approach.

                                     Albeit the examinations conducted seem thorough, judgment considerations as part of the
                                     qualitative assessments have still a limited role in the overall process, with supervision
                                     focusing mostly on the dominant entity (from a total assets perspective) and a somewhat
                                     limited assessment of business focus, group structure and overall risk profile, or resolvability
                                     of banks and groups.

                                     The authorities should consider:

                                         Establishing a point of contact in charge of a particular banking/banking group,
                                          consolidating off and on site surveillance and any other information pertaining to a
                                          particular bank, including macroeconomic analyses;

                                         Conducting partial examinations or (maybe with a mix of off and on site activities) on
                                          particular risks;

                                         Developing capacity/procedures to allow a more in-depth and judgmental qualitative
                                          assessments; and

                                         Reviewing its overall assessment process and check lists in order to incorporate more
                                          in-depth judgmental qualitative procedures into the assessments.

Principle 9                          Supervisory techniques and tools. The supervisor uses an appropriate range of techniques
                                     and tools to implement the supervisory approach and deploys supervisory resources on a
                                     proportionate basis, taking into account the risk profile and systemic importance of banks.
Essential Criteria

EC1                                  The supervisor employs an appropriate mix of on-site15 and off-site16 supervision to
                                     evaluate the condition of banks and banking groups, their risk profile, internal control

                                      environment and the corrective measures necessary to address supervisory concerns. The
                                      specific mix between on-site and off-site supervision may be determined by the particular
                                      conditions and circumstances of the country and the bank. The supervisor regularly assesses
                                      the quality, effectiveness and integration of its on-site and off-site functions, and amends its
                                      approach, as needed.

Description and findings regarding The FSC-FSS employs a combination of off-site surveillance and on-site examination which
EC1                                build upon a series of tools, namely the CAEL, CAMEL-R, RADARS, ROCA, as well as
                                   industry-wide assessments, and thematic off-site surveillances.

                                      Full-scope examinations are performed biannually for all banks, and teams are composed of
                                      25 up to 30 staff, combining staff from various divisions within a department, encompassing
                                      staffs from the Risks team, which will focus on the R element of CAMELR, as well as
                                      specialists from other departments to cover FX operations, derivatives and IT. Full-scope on-
                                      site examinations provide the qualitative inputs to the CAMELR.

                                      The length of full-scope examinations or number of staff allocated to those examinations
                                      does not seem to depend on the risk profile or systemic importance of banks.

                                      The authorities state that since asset size, portfolios, and business focus of the seven local
                                      private commercial banks are similar to each other, in addition to having similar systemic
                                      importance, the number of supervisors assigned, the length, and the frequency of full-scope
                                      examinations are similar as well. In addition, all seven banks have the same CAMEL-R rating.
                                      Regional banks and foreign bank branches are subject to shorter examinations – 3 weeks
                                      and 2 weeks respectively.

                                      Partial examinations can be triggered by developments in the banking industry, as well as
                                      bank specific events. Length of examinations and staff allocation varies according to the
                                      issues to be examined. A good part of the partial examinations is dedicated to examining
                                      local branches of domestic banks, deal with complaints and other activities not necessarily
                                      related to the safety and soundness of banks.

                                      Off-site surveillance is performed through the CAEL and RADARS periodically for all banks
                                      and sudden changes in trends and other abnormal movements trigger further assessment,
                                      irrespectively of the bank’s risk-profile or systemically importance.

                                      The FSS counts with a division focused on quality control of examinations, dedicated to
                                      improving examination programs and practices but there is no systematic procedure for
                                      reviewing the quality, effectiveness and integration of its on-site and off-site functions.




        and its related companies needed for the assessment of the condition of the bank, monitor the bank’s follow-up on
        supervisory concerns, etc.

        16 Off-site work is used as a tool to regularly review and analyze the financial condition of banks, follow up on
        matters requiring further attention, identify and evaluate developing risks and help identify the priorities, scope of
        further off-site and on-site work, etc.

EC2                               The supervisor has a coherent process for planning and executing on-site and off-site
                                  activities. There are policies and processes to ensure that such activities are conducted on a
                                  thorough and consistent basis with clear responsibilities, objectives and outputs, and that
                                  there is effective coordination and information sharing between the on-site and off-site
                                  functions.

Description and findings regarding Bank supervision functions are spread among several departments within FSS, which can
EC2                                pose challenges to coordination and to achieve an overall view of banks and banking
                                   groups.

                                  The core banking supervisory functions are centralized in two deputy governors, which are
                                  in charge of both banking and non-banking supervision as follows:

                                      Deputy Governor 1—Banking Supervision Department, FX Supervision Department,
                                       Corporate Credit Department, Small Business Support Office, Cooperative, Finance and
                                       Loan Business Supervision Department, Microcredit Support Department; and

                                       Deputy Governor 2—Banking Examination Department 1, Banking Examination
                                        Department 2, Foreign Bank Branch Examination Office, Mutual Savings Department,
                                        Mutual Savings Bank Examination Department 1, Mutual Savings Bank Department 2,
                                        Cooperative Finance & Loan Business Examination Department.
                                  On-site examinations responsibilities and most off-site surveillance are split among the
                                  Examination Departments and the Foreign Bank Branch Examination Department. Banks are
                                  split between Examination Department 1 and 2, segregating commercial and regional banks
                                  from the specialized banks.

                                  The Supervision Department is in charge of: drafting detailed regulations, guidance and
                                  manuals; industry-wide assessments; internal model validations for regulatory purposes; as
                                  well as surveillance of stress-tests.

                                  Within each Examination Department, the FSS has a monitoring team dedicated to the off-
                                  site surveillance of banks. They produce the CAEL quarterly and gather and share with FSS
                                  on-site examiners further ad-hoc information on individual banks. The monitoring team
                                  engages with banks in order to clarify sudden variations on financials and can follow up on
                                  measures taken in case of need.

                                  The quality control and coordination team within the Supervision Department establishes
                                  policies and processes for standardized examination procedures. Other activities encompass
                                  updates of the examination manual, and quality assessment of examination reports.

                                  Information sharing is bound by serious security/confidentiality concerns. In preparation for
                                  a full-scope on-site examination the examination team circulates within the FSS a memo
                                  requesting relevant information on the bank to be examined. Files examined by the
                                  assessors indicated that the various areas do share information in the form of reports.

                                  Other departments involved in the supervisory process encompass the Enforcement Review
                                  Office, the Supervision Coordination Department and the Planning and Coordination

EC3                                      The supervisor uses a variety of information to regularly review and assess the safety and
                                         soundness of banks, the evaluation of material risks, and the identification of necessary
                                         corrective actions and supervisory actions. This includes information, such as prudential
                                         reports, statistical returns, information on a bank’s related entities, and publicly available
                                         information. The supervisor determines that information provided by banks is reliable17 and
                                         obtains, as necessary, additional information on the banks and their related entities.

Description and findings regarding Banks are required to provide the FSS with a wide range of data and information on a
EC3                                regular basis. All banks, banking groups, and the other regulated financial entities file
                                   prudential reports (e.g., composition of regulatory capital, RWAs, solvency ratios, large
                                   exposures) and statistical returns (e.g., balance sheet and income statement, credit quality,
                                   securities holdings, residual maturities, etc.), in accordance to the relevant regulations.

                                         CAEL reports are produced on a quarterly basis, containing information on capital adequacy,
                                         asset quality, earnings and liquidity, encompassing emerging trends, as well as peer analysis.
                                         Abnormalities are further investigated through the request of additional information or
                                         through meetings with banks, conducted by the off-site teams.

                                         There is no systematic procedure to check the reliability of information provided by banks.
                                         The authorities sustain that reliability of information is tested through the periodic issuance
                                         of CAEL reports, as well as the on-site examinations.

                                         Information on banks’ related entities beyond the scope of related party lending and large
                                         exposures are requested on a need basis.

                                         Public information is collected through various areas within the FSS (e.g., off-site team,
                                         examination team) and uploaded into a centralized database. The FSS also reviews public
                                         available data and meets with market participants as necessary.

                                         The FSS receives from banks detailed information on financial incidents and consumer
                                         complaints, and report that such information provides a useful input in overseeing the
                                         business conduct and internal controls of banks.

EC4                                      The supervisor uses a variety of tools to regularly review and assess the safety and

                                  The supervisor communicates its findings to the bank as appropriate and requires the bank
                                  to take action to mitigate any particular vulnerabilities that have the potential to affect its
                                  safety and soundness. The supervisor uses its analysis to determine follow-up work
                                  required, if any.

Description and findings regarding The CAEL report produced on a quarterly basis by the FSS encompasses the analysis of
EC4                                financial statements and accounts, as well as horizontal peer reviews. Business model
                                   analyses encompassing business plans and business strategy are conducted on an annual
                                   basis. Industry-wide assessments are also conducted on an annual basis.

                                  Reviews of the outcome of bottom-up stress tests are performed semiannually and
                                  encompass the assessment of risk parameters and methodologies, which are built on
                                  guidance issued by the FSS. Top-down stress tests are conducted annually by the banks
                                  based on parameters and criteria provided by the FSS. Analysis of corporate governance,
                                  risk management and internal control systems are mostly performed through the full-scope
                                  on-site examinations.

                                  Findings are communicated as appropriate, triggered by on-site, off-site or industry wide
                                  analysis, with requirements for actions to be taken to mitigate any particular vulnerabilities
                                  that have the potential to affect its safety and soundness, as needed.

EC5                               The supervisor, in conjunction with other relevant authorities, seeks to identify, assess and
                                  mitigate any emerging risks across banks and to the banking system as a whole, potentially
                                  including conducting supervisory stress tests (on individual banks or system-wide). The
                                  supervisor communicates its findings as appropriate to either banks or the industry and
                                  requires banks to take action to mitigate any particular vulnerabilities that have the
                                  potential to affect the stability of the banking system, where appropriate. The supervisor
                                  uses its analysis to determine follow-up work required, if any.

Description and findings regarding Surveillance of individual banks through the CAEL and CAMELR is complemented by macro-

                                  Reviews of the outcome of bottom-up stress tests are performed semiannually and
                                  encompass the assessment of risk parameters and methodologies, which are built on
                                  guidance issued by the FSS. Top-down stress tests are conducted annually by the banks
                                  based on parameters and criteria provided by the FSS. Industry-wide assessments are also
                                  produced on an ad-hoc basis focused on emerging issues and can trigger thematic
                                  examinations or recommendations to the market participants.

EC6                               The supervisor evaluates the work of the bank’s internal audit function, and determines

Description and findings regarding The FSS performs an overall assessment of the work of banks’ internal audit function in
EC6                                order to assess the effectiveness such work (please refer to CP 26 for further details).

                                    The CAMELR includes a “Management” component, which encompasses banks’ internal
                                    audit and internal controls. For the assessment of the internal audit function, bank
                                    supervisors take a close look at internal control policies and organizational resources and
                                    self-examination programs and functions to prevent financial incidents, so as to determine
                                    whether the bank is able to identify areas of potential risk and has effective internal controls
                                    to mitigate it.

                                    Currently the FSS does not rely on the internal auditor’s work to identify areas of potential
                                    risk.

EC7                                 The supervisor maintains sufficiently frequent contacts as appropriate with the bank’s Board,
                                    non-executive Board members and senior and middle management (including heads of
                                    individual business units and control functions) to develop an understanding of and assess
                                    matters such as strategy, group structure, corporate governance, performance, capital
                                    adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, risk management systems and internal controls. Where
                                    necessary, the supervisor challenges the bank’s Board and senior management on the
                                    assumptions made in setting strategies and business models.

Description and findings regarding The FSS senior management (i.e. deputy governor, director general, senior manager and
EC7                                head examiner) hold “partnership meeting” with banks’ senior management prior to the full-
                                   scope on-site examination to discuss current issues and vulnerable areas. Meetings with
                                   Board members are uncommon and information at that level is mostly gathered through
                                   reviewing Board resolutions, albeit meetings can be held and are commonly led by the
                                   deputy governor and the director general. The discussion of particular issues can also
                                   trigger meetings with banks’ CEO, CFO, CRO etc., with the FSS represented by the Director
                                   General and the Lead Examiner/Head of off-site depending on which area requested the
                                   meeting.

                                    A dedicated team reviews business plans, which are submitted by banks on an annual basis,
                                    which results in a consolidated report, comparing plans with time series and peers. The tea
                                    can also meet with banks if deems it necessary, inviting on and off-site representatives to
                                    those meetings.

EC8                                 The supervisor communicates to the bank the findings of its on- and off-site supervisory
                                    analyses in a timely manner by means of written reports or through discussions or meetings
                                    with the bank’s management. The supervisor meets with the bank’s senior management and
                                    the Board to discuss the results of supervisory examinations and the external audits, as
                                    appropriate. The supervisor also meets separately with the bank’s independent Board
                                    members, as necessary.

Description and findings regarding The FSS communicates to banks the overall findings of its on-site examination through a
EC8                                meeting with the bank’s senior management. The FSS reports that the chief of examination,
                                   on the last day of general examination, holds a management meeting with the senior
                                   management of the bank to deliver the CAMELR assessment results and key findings of

                                    legal issues. On average, a review process for a report that does not result in sanctions takes
                                    approximately five months for a general examination, and two to three months for thematic
                                    examinations.

                                    Results of the off-site surveillance, namely the CAEL and RADARS, are not communicated to
                                    the banks. Particular concerns resulting from off-site surveillance are usually further
                                    discussed with banks.

                                    Meetings with external auditors are rare. Meetings with board members are held collectively
                                    once the final examination report is completed. There is no practice of meeting separately
                                    with the bank’s independent Board members.

EC9                                 The supervisor undertakes appropriate and timely follow-up to check that banks have
                                    addressed supervisory concerns or implemented requirements communicated to them. This
                                    includes early escalation to the appropriate level of the supervisory authority and to the
                                    bank’s Board if action points are not addressed in an adequate or timely manner.

Description and findings regarding Article 14 of the RES requires the FSS Governor to notify examination results through an
EC9                                examination report. The Governor may take necessary measures or request the head of the
                                   financial institution to take such measures. Article 14 also requires the Governor oversight
                                   the measures taken by financial institutions regarding the supervisory concern. Banks
                                   submit progress reports and in practice the FSS reports that banks usually comply with the
                                   deadlines or that those are extended in exceptional circumstances, in particular related to
                                   more complex projects.

                                    Article 15 of the RES establishes clear time frames for banks to address supervisory concerns
                                    (except when there is a special reason to the contrary), namely six months for management
                                    matters requiring attention and three months for all other issues. In practice the FSS reports
                                    that banks respect deadlines.

                                    Bank supervisors require banks to implement requirements communicated to them and may
                                    require them to take additional measures if their implementation is not satisfactory. Bank
                                    supervisors may also impose sanctions on the executive officers and/or employees of the
                                    bank that hinder sufficient progress in the implementation of those requirements.
                                    The follow up process on recommendations has been recently enhanced. In 2012 a new
                                    framework was established requiring banks to report on action plans. Files made available
                                    to the assessors indicated that under the new process the authorities have been able to
                                    effectively and systematically follow up on recommendations.

                                    Currently the FSS seems to be following up on matters requiring management attention,
                                    although historically processes have been extremely lengthy, not ensuring that concerns
                                    would be addressed on a timely manner. Reports are shared with the banks several months
                                    (taking in some cases a year) after completion of examinations, encompassing
                                    recommendations and also sanctions.

EC10                                The supervisor requires banks to notify it in advance of any substantive changes in their
                                    activities, structure and overall condition, or as soon as they become aware of any material

                                     Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

Description and findings regarding The legal/regulatory framework does not encompass a general requirement for banks to
EC10                               notify in advance any substantive changes in their activities, structure and overall conditions,
                                   although Article 47 of the Banking Act, described below, cover some of the events that
                                   could fall into such category.

                                    Similarly, there are no overall requirements for banks to report, as soon as they become
                                    aware, of any material adverse developments, including breach of legal or prudential
                                    requirements. Articles 41 and 42 of the RES, also described below, encompass some of
                                    those adverse developments.

                                    Article 47 of the Banking Act requires banks to report to the FSC the following events:

                                         Amendment of its article of associations;

                                         Reduction of capital that does not require previous authorization;

                                         Relocation of the head office to another city;

                                         Establishment of an overseas local corporation, overseas branch that does not require
                                          prior authorization, when closes an overseas local corporation or branch or when
                                          opens or closes an overseas office;

                                         Change in trade name;

                                         Appointment or dismissal of executives;

                                         Injection of capital into a subsidiary (including cases approved by the FSC for the
                                          promotion of corporation restructuring);

                                         Provision of loans on the security of equity securities exceeding 20 percent of the
                                          equity securities of another company;

                                         Relocation of a branch or agency within the same city or when closing its office; and

                                         Whether it performs an act prescribed by Presidential Decree that could undermine the
                                          sound management of the bank or infringe on the interests of the bank users,
                                          including depositors, etc.

                                    Article 41 of the RES requires banks to promptly report to the FSS Governor financial
                                    incidents, i.e., cases where an illegal or improper act is committed by an officer or an
                                    employee or any other person causes a loss upon such financial institution or financial
                                    customers or disturbs financial order. In practice the authorities stated that banks do report
                                    most of those cases.

                                    Article 42 of the RES requires banks to report to the FSS Governor in case a civil suit has
                                    been decided against the bank without possibility of further appeal or a civil action with a
                                    claim exceeding one percent of equity (or one billion won, the higher of the two) or if a 10
                                    billion won lawsuit is filed against the has been raised against the bank. In practice banks
                                    report most of those cases.

EC11                                The supervisor may make use of independent third parties, such as auditors, provided there
                                    is a clear and detailed mandate for the work. However, the supervisor cannot outsource its
                                    prudential responsibilities to third parties. When using third parties, the supervisor assesses
                                    whether the output can be relied upon to the degree intended and takes into consideration
                                    the biases that may influence third parties.

Description and findings regarding Article 47–2 of the RES establishes that in cases where the Governor of the FSS delegates or
EC11                               consigns examination business to a third party institution pursuant to the relevant statutes,
                                   the Governor shall determine methods and procedures for the examination to be conducted
                                   by such institution, except for those cases as separately prescribed by the relevant statues
                                   and e regulations.

                                    In practice the FSS makes use of external auditing firms, derivatives experts and CPAs
                                    among others to perform specialized tasks when conducting full or partial examinations. In
                                    particular for accounting and derivatives, the FSS always count the third parties.

                                    The chief examiner is in charge of assessing whether the output produced by third parties
                                    can be re relied upon to the degree intended, although there is no standardized format or a
                                    formal requirement for such review.

                                    Article 3 of the DRES require all examiners (including hired third parties) to observe
                                    regulations related to service and examinations, as well as the Examiners Code of Conduct.

                                    Conflicts of interest, in the case of third parties, are avoided solely by not allowing the
                                    accounting firm currently in a contractual relationship or obligation (e.g. audit engagement
                                    or business consulting) with the subject to be selected as an outside specialist.

EC12                                The supervisor has an adequate information system which facilitates the processing,
                                    monitoring and analysis of prudential information. The system aids the identification of
                                    areas requiring follow-up action.

Description and findings regarding The FSS has in place a number of information systems to facilitate the monitoring of banks,
EC12                               namely the Financial Information Exchange System (FIES), the Integrated Financial
                                   Information System (IFIS), Examination Management System (EMS), and the Safety and
                                   Soundness Assessment System (SSAS). The monitoring of financial markets statistics,
                                   approval of bank’s credit risk models, monitoring of assets and investments, use of “handy
                                   indicators”, as well as examinations of foreign currency transactions are also supported by
                                   dedicated systems.

                                    The FIES and the IIFIS enable bank examiners to access and analyze bank’s Business Reports
                                    (including financial information).The EMS and the SSAS support on-site examinations and
                                    safety and soundness assessments.
Additional Criteria
AC1                                 The supervisor has a framework for periodic independent review, for example by an internal
                                    audit function or third party assessor, of the adequacy and effectiveness of the range of its
                                    available supervisory tools and their use, and makes changes as appropriate.

Description and findings regarding There is no systematic procedure in place to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the
AC1                                range of available supervisory tools and their use in order to make changes, as appropriate.
                                   Nonetheless, a series of bodies perform audits in the FSC and the FSS, including the internal
                                   audit, the BAI (under Article 24 of the Board of Audit and Inspection Act, although the scope
                                   of review dos not explicitly encompass the assessment of the effectiveness of the range of
                                   supervisory tools.

                                    In addition, the FSS counts with an advisory committee, consisting of independent external
                                    experts, who has over the years provided advice on specific issues of concern (e.g. credit
                                    unions).

Assessment of Principle 9           LC

Comments                            The FSS uses a broad range of techniques and tools to implement its supervisory approach.
                                    It counts with comprehensive and detailed set of data requested, encompassing financials
                                    and management information, as well as its systems and dedicated staff results in a robust
                                    off-site framework. On-site examinations are supported by check lists and guidance to
                                    ensure consistency in the supervisory process.

                                    Deployment of resources is based on the type of bank and total assets, which to a certain
                                    extent reflects banks’ risk profile.

                                    The authorities should consider:

                                        Reviewing the annual planning process regarding banking supervision in order to focus
                                         the partial examinations on core supervisory issues and risks;

                                        Reviewing its policies for information sharing within the FSS in order to provide a more
                                         comprehensive and easier access to information to the examination team;

                                        Intensifying engagement with senior management as part of the on-site examination
                                         processes beyond the partnership meetings;

                                        Developing standard rules for hiring third parties, as well as ensuring quality control, as
                                         well as develop more robust procedures to avoid the existence of conflicts of interest;

                                        Reviewing the distribution of activities within the FSS in order to better allocate
                                         resources into its core supervisory functions (please refer to CP 2); and
                                        Formally requiring banks to immediately report on any material adverse developments.

                                    The FSC-FSS has informed its intention to hold more meeting with outside directors.

                                    The FSC-FSS also reported that it will improve the post-examination process, by giving a
                                    separate notice on the CAMEL-R results, matters that require special attention and
                                    improvement, etc. before notifying the full examination results.

                                            independently verifies these reports through either on-site examinations or use of external
                                            experts.

Essential Criteria

EC1                                         The supervisor has the power19 to require banks to submit information, on both a solo and a
                                            consolidated basis, on their financial condition, performance, and risks, on demand and at
                                            regular intervals. These reports provide information such as on- and off-balance sheet
                                            assets and liabilities, profit and loss, capital adequacy, liquidity, large exposures, risk
                                            concentrations (including by economic sector, geography and currency), asset quality, loan
                                            loss provisioning, related party transactions, interest rate risk, and market risk.

Description and findings regarding Article 40 of the Establishment Act states that when deemed necessary by the FSS Governor
EC1                                any supervised institution might be required to submit a report or data, while the Banking
                                   Act require banks to submit on a monthly basis to the Governor of the FSS a “report stating
                                   details of business performed “(Article 43–2 of the Banking Act).

                                            The scope and periodicity of data requested by the authorities vary depending on whether
                                            it is requested on a solo or consolidated basis, as well as on the type of entity (bank, FHC).
                                            Overall, the FSS receives a broad and detailed set of data on a daily, monthly, quarterly,
                                            semiannually or annually basis, as well as ad-hoc reports.

                                            Information encompasses detailed financial information, as well as other types of
                                            information, necessary to check regulatory compliance. More specifically, submitted reports
                                            encompass information regarding on and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities, P&L,
                                            capital adequacy, liquidity, large exposure and risk concentrations, as well as asset quality,
                                            loan loss provisioning, related party transactions, interest rate risk and market risk, among
                                            others. In the case of related parties, information is requested on an ad-hoc basis.

                                            Information relative to supervised entities that are not part of the consolidated financial
                                            statements (e.g., insurance companies) is obtained on an unconsolidated basis.

                                            Currently there are no requirements in place for banks and financial holding companies to
                                            provide information/balance sheets on unregulated entities that are subordinated to
                                            regulated entities, albeit having the power to request information on financial statements.

EC2                                         The supervisor provides reporting instructions that clearly describe the accounting
                                            standards to be used in preparing supervisory reports. Such standards are based on
                                            accounting principles and rules that are widely accepted internationally.

Description and findings regarding Reporting standards follow the accounting standards for banks operating in the Republic of

                                    Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

EC2                                Article 32 of the RSBB requires banks to comply with the Korean International Financial
                                   Reporting Standards (KIFRS), laid down by adopting the international accounting standards
                                   of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). In case of certain items not covered
                                   by IFRS, banks are required to comply with specific guidelines issued by the FSS. Specific
                                   guidance on fair valuation in line with IFRS, calculation standards for foreign currency
                                   exposures, as well as on how to prepare Business Reports, have also been issued by the FSS.
                                   The National Agricultural Cooperative Federation and the National Federation of Fisheries
                                   Cooperatives are required to be compliant with the KIFRS for the fiscal year of 2014
                                   (beginning in January).

EC3                                The supervisor requires banks to have sound governance structures and control processes
                                   for methodologies that produce valuations. The measurement of fair values maximizes the
                                   use of relevant and reliable inputs and are consistently applied for risk management and
                                   reporting purposes. The valuation framework and control procedures are subject to
                                   adequate independent validation and verification, either internally or by an external expert.
                                   The supervisor assesses whether the valuation used for regulatory purposes is reliable and
                                   prudent. Where the supervisor determines that valuations are not sufficiently prudent, the
                                   supervisor requires the bank to make adjustments to its reporting for capital adequacy or
                                   regulatory reporting purposes.

Description and findings regarding Article 2–2—Operation of Internal Accounting Management System – of the Act on External
EC3                                Audit of Stock Companies (Act on External Audit), require companies with total assets over
                                   100 billion won to have an internal accounting management system for the preparation of
                                   accounting information, encompassing methods of discrimination, mensuration,
                                   classification, recording and reporting of accounting information. The system should also
                                   encompass matters concerning the method of controlling and revising errors, methods for
                                   internal inspection and adjustment, among others.

                                   The FSS provides guidance on valuation through Appendix 4 of the DRSBB. The supervisory
                                   assessment of adequacy of valuations is conducted during on-site examinations. In case the
                                   FSS determines that valuations are not sufficiently prudent, banks are required to make
                                   adjustments.

EC4                                The supervisor collects and analyses information from banks at a frequency commensurate
                                   with the nature of the information requested, and the risk profile and systemic importance
                                   of the bank.

Description and findings regarding The FSC-FSS maintains an integrated financial information analysis system to collect and
EC4                                manage data from the banks both on a monthly and a quarterly basis. The data collected
                                   ranges from banking operations to financials, to regulatory compliance.

                                   The quantity and the types of the data collected from the commercial banks, the specialized
                                   banks, and foreign bank branches reflect differences in the rules and regulations that apply
                                   to each of those groups. All commercial banks have to submit an extensive set of
                                   information within the same frequency. Information submitted by banks is analyzed on a
                                   regular basis through the CAEL, irrespective of the risk profile and systemic importance of
                                   each bank. Specialized banks, regional banks and branches of foreign banks operating in
                                   the Republic of Korea, as well as branches of domestic banks operating abroad are required
                                   to submit a smaller, although relatively comprehensive, set of information.

                                   periods. Financial holding companies are required to slightly different set of requirements.

                                          Banks are required to provide data on a consolidated basis and individual data on banks is
                                          also submitted, enabling comparisons and analysis.

EC6                                       The supervisor has the power to request and receive any relevant information from banks,
                                          as well as any entities in the wider group, irrespective of their activities, where the supervisor
                                          believes that it is material to the condition of the bank or banking group, or to the

                                   responsibilities, including the scope of work, as well as conflicts of interest and liability and
                                   damages are detailed in standard contracts signed by those consultants. There are no

Description and findings regarding There is no explicit requirement that external experts promptly bring to the FSS attention
EC11                               any material shortcomings identified during the course of any work undertaken by them for
                                   supervisory purposes. The authorities stated, although without providing supporting
                                   evidence, that third parties hired to perform examination functions are subject to rules and
                                   responsibilities equivalent to those applicable to bank examiners.

                                    Article 47–2 of the RES has a general statement regarding delegation or consignment of
                                    examination functions to third party institutions (not making reference to individuals),
                                    delegating to the FSS Governor to determine methods and procedures for conducting
                                    examinations.

EC12                                The supervisor has a process in place to periodically review the information collected to
                                    determine that it satisfies a supervisory need.

Description and findings regarding There is no systematic process in place for reviewing the information collected, to determine
EC12                               that it satisfies the FSS needs. Nevertheless, as already discussed, the FSS receives a very
                                   detailed set of information and reported that changes to the scope of information that
                                   banks are required to file with the FSS are performed, as needed.

Assessment of Principle 10          LC

Comments                            The FSC-FSS have powers to require banks to submit information on both a solo and a
                                    consolidated basis.

                                    In practice, the FSC-FSS maintains an integrated financial information analysis system to
                                    collect and manage data from the banks both on a monthly and a quarterly basis. The data
                                    collected ranges from banking operations to financials, to information related to regulatory
                                    compliance.

                                    Shortcomings in compliance with this CP relate to the lack of systematic procedures to
                                    ensure reliability of data provided by banks, quality control, lack of a systematic process to
                                    assess suitability of external experts, the use of third parties to perform supervisory work,
                                    lack of a requirement that external experts bring to the FSS attention promptly any material
                                    shortcomings identified during the course of any work undertaken by them for supervisory
                                    purposes, as well as limitations regarding access to information from non-financial
                                    companies within a group. The latter has not been taken into account in granting the rating
                                    since it has been addressed through CP 12.

                                    The authorities should consider amending the legal framework in order to be able to have
                                    access to all relevant data and information from non-financial entities within a bank or
                                    banking group.

                                    The FSC-FSS should consider:

                                        Requiring external auditors (as mandated by banks) to review the quality of regular
                                         reports submitted to the FSS; and

                                        Enhancing rules and guidance for hiring third parties to perform supervisory work.

Principle 11                       Corrective and sanctioning powers of supervisors. The supervisor acts at an early stage
                                   to address unsafe and unsound practices or activities that could pose risks to banks or to
                                   the banking system. The supervisor has at its disposal an adequate range of supervisory
                                   tools to bring about timely corrective actions. This includes the ability to revoke the banking
                                   license or to recommend its revocation.

Essential Criteria

EC1                                The supervisor raises supervisory concerns with the bank’s management or, where
                                   appropriate, the bank’s Board, at an early stage, and requires that these concerns be
                                   addressed in a timely manner. Where the supervisor requires the bank to take significant
                                   corrective actions, these are addressed in a written document to the bank’s Board. The
                                   supervisor requires the bank to submit regular written progress reports and checks that
                                   corrective actions are completed satisfactorily. The supervisor follows through conclusively
                                   and in a timely manner on matters that are identified.

Description and findings regarding Article 14 of the RES—Notification of and Measures upon Examination Results – requires the
EC1                                FSS Governor to notify banks of examination results through an examination report. The
                                   Governor may take the necessary measures to request the head of the financial institution
                                   to take the necessary measures to address issues of concern. The report covers matters
                                   requiring management attention, as well as those requiring sanction or correction, which
                                   include disciplinary matters.

                                   Article 14(3) requires the FSS Governor to supervise banks’ implementation of the necessary
                                   measures, which responsibility rests with banks’ head of internal audit or the banks’ CEO.

                                   Article 15 of the RES require banks to report on the corrective actions taken to the FSS
                                   Governor within an objective timeframe , except in cases of special circumstances, as
                                   follows:

                                       Matters requiring attention—6 months; and

                                       Matters requiring sanction or correction range from 2 to 3 months.

                                   In case the Governor determines that the corrective actions were poorly or improperly
                                   implemented due to negligence or incompetence of officers or employees, he is granted
                                   the power to apply sanctions.

                                   Article 20–2 allows the authorities to enter into MoUs with banks, which allow more
                                   flexibility in terms of committing to timeframes, in particular regarding grave matters.

                                   There are no requirements in place for the banks’ Board to be notified in case banks are
                                   required to take significant corrective actions.

                                   The FSS follows-up on matters requiring management attention, although historically
                                   processes have been extremely lengthy, not ensuring that concerns would be addressed on
                                   a timely manner. Reports are shared with the banks several months (taking in some cases a
                                   year) after completion of examinations, encompassing recommendations and also
                                   sanctions. Notwithstanding, the follow up process on recommendations has been recently

                                            enhanced. In 2012 a new framework was established requiring banks to provide an action
                                            plan for addressing the recommendations, report progress and provide evidence of
                                            implementation of the action plan. Files made available to the assessors indicated that
                                            under the new process the authorities have been able to effectively and systematically
                                            follow up on recommendations.

EC2                                         The supervisor has available23 an appropriate range of supervisory tools for use when, in the
                                            supervisor’s judgment, a bank is not complying with laws, regulations or supervisory actions,
                                            is engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or in activities that could pose risks to the bank
                                            or the banking system, or when the interests of depositors are otherwise threatened.

Description and findings regarding The FSC-FSS counts with a range of supervisory tools for dealing with non-compliance with
EC2                                laws and regulations and for addressing safety and soundness issues.

                                            Article 53(1) of the Banking Act empowers the FSC to issue warnings, impose corrective
                                            actions, or partially suspend business for no more than 6 months in cases of threats to
                                            banks’ safety and soundness through violations of the Banking Act or its regulations. Article
                                            53(2) grants the FSC the power to order a bank to suspend all of its business for a fixed
                                            period of at least six months or revoke authorization for banking business. Grounds for such
                                            measures include: obtaining a license by false or illegal means; violating a condition or term
                                            of authorization; carrying out a business during a suspension period; failing to execute a
                                            corrective order; the fact that interests of depositors or investors are likely to be greatly
                                            undermined due to a violation; or any orders or dispositions issued or taken under the
                                            Banking Act.Article 17 of the RES details the types and reasons for sanctions to be applied
                                            against banks, encompassing: revocation of license; suspension of business in whole or in
                                            part; closing of business office or a full or partial suspension of business office; stoppage of
                                            the illegal or improper acts and warnings; among others.

                                            Willful violations of the Banking Act or its rules, orders or instructions or actions that greatly
                                            undermine a bank’s soundness by banks’ executives or employees, are subject to sanctions.
                                            Article 54(1) of the Banking Act—Sanctions against Senior Management and Employees—
                                            grants the FSC the power, upon recommendation of the Governor of the FSS, to order the
                                            suspension of the execution of its functions, recommend the general meeting of
                                            stockholders to dismiss the executive and also to have the Governor of the FSS to take an
                                            appropriate measure (e.g., issuance of warnings) In addition, the FSC has the power to
                                            request the Governor of the FSS to take other disciplinary measures such as dismissal,

Description and findings regarding The Banking Act (Article 34) require banks to comply with regulatory requirements including
EC3                                capital adequacy, asset quality and liquidity, and empowers the FSC to take the necessary
                                   measures (including ordering an increase in capital, restriction on dividends, among others)
                                   in cases where it is deemed that a bank is likely to “greatly undermine” its soundness by
                                   failing to comply with those regulatory requirements.

                                    In addition, Article 46 of the Banking Act grants the FSC the power to restrict a bank from
                                    taking deposits or granting credit, suspend deposit payments or take other necessary
                                    measures in case it deems that a bank could seriously harm the interests of its depositors,
                                    such as the fear of bankruptcy or insolvency.

                                    Article 26(3) of the RSBB grants powers to the FSS Governor to required banks to submit a
                                    correction plan or an agreement for improvement in cases where minimum regulatory ratios
                                    are deemed to deteriorate or when it is judged (through examinations) to have
                                    vulnerabilities in management.

                                    Article 10 of the Improvement Act reinforces those powers and also encompasses the
                                    situation where it is deemed evident the non-compliance with the standards due to the
                                    occurrence of any major financial scandal or deterioration of the loan portfolio.

EC4                                 The supervisor has available a broad range of possible measures to address, at an early
                                    stage, such scenarios as described in essential criterion 2 above. These measures include the
                                    ability to require a bank to take timely corrective action or to impose sanctions
                                    expeditiously. In practice, the range of measures is applied in accordance with the gravity of
                                    a situation. The supervisor provides clear prudential objectives or sets out the actions to be
                                    taken, which may include restricting the current activities of the bank, imposing more
                                    stringent prudential limits and requirements, withholding approval of new activities or
                                    acquisitions, restricting or suspending payments to shareholders or share repurchases,
                                    restricting asset transfers, barring individuals from the banking sector, replacing or
                                    restricting the powers of managers, Board members or controlling owners, facilitating a

                                    takeover by or merger with a healthier institution, providing for the interim management of
                                    the bank, and revoking or recommending the revocation of the banking license.

Description and findings regarding The FSC has a range of measures available to address concerns regarding banks’ capital
EC4                                ratios (as detailed in EC3), as well as deterioration of banks’ CAMELR ratings due to
                                   deterioration of the loan portfolio or due to the occurrence of serious financial accidents
                                   (Article 34 and 35 of the RBB).

                                   In the case of CAMELR ratings, for composite ratings of 1, 2 or 3, where the rating for asset
                                   quality or capital adequacy is 4 or 5, the FSC is required to recommend actions, while in
                                   cases where the composite rating is 4 or 5 the FSC is required to require actions (please
                                   refer to EC3 for further details on the actions).

                                   Specific actions that bank supervisors may order the bank to implement to improve its
                                   conditions include: personnel and organizational changes; cost savings; more efficient
                                   management of branches; restrictions on new business or investment; disposal of distressed

                                   executive officers or the appointment of an administrator; transfer of all or part of business;
                                   suspension of business up to six months; and transfer of all or part of contractual
                                   commitments to customers to a stronger institution.

                                   There are no provisions allowing the FSC to impose more stringent prudential limits and
                                   requirements, barring individuals from the banking sector, replacing or restricting the
                                   powers of, Board members or controlling owners.

                                   In practice the authorities reported that there has been no need to use the corrective action
                                   framework since the Asian Crisis.

EC5                                The supervisor applies sanctions not only to the bank but, when and if necessary, also to
                                   management and/or the Board, or individuals therein.

Description and findings regarding Article 54 of the Banking Act—Sanctions against Senior Management and Employees—
EC5                                grants the FSC the power, upon recommendation of the Governor of the FSS, to order the
                                   suspension of its functions, recommend the general meeting of stockholders to dismiss the
                                   executive, and also to have the Governor of the FSS to take an appropriate measure (e.g.
                                   issuance of warning). The FSC has also the power to request the Governor of the FSS to take
                                   other disciplinary measures such as dismissal, suspension, deduction of salary and
                                   reprimand, etc.

                                   There are no provisions within the legal and regulatory framework that enables the FSC-FSS
                                   to apply sanctions to the Board collectively.

                                   In practice the FSC makes regular use of fines, with XX fines imposed over the last 5 years. In
                                   case of sanctions to banks would also apply sanctions to the executives. The authorities
                                   reported that appeals to sanctions to management are not common.

EC6                                The supervisor has the power to take corrective actions, including ring-fencing of the bank
                                   from the actions of parent companies, subsidiaries, parallel-owned banking structures and
                                   other related entities in matters that could impair the safety and soundness of the bank or
                                   the banking system.

Description and findings regarding As described in previous ECs, the FSC-FSS has the power to take corrective actions

                                     Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

                                    There is no explicit legal/regulatory framework in place, granting power to the FSC-FSS to
                                    ring-fence a bank from the actions of parent companies, subsidiaries, parallel-owned
                                    banking structures and other related entities in matters that could impair the safety and
                                    soundness of the bank or the banking system.

EC7                                 The supervisor cooperates and collaborates with relevant authorities in deciding when and
                                    how to effect the orderly resolution of a problem bank situation (which could include
                                    closure, or assisting in restructuring, or merger with a stronger institution).

Description and findings regarding The FSC-FSS is the resolution authority in the Republic of Korea. The decision on when and
EC7                                how to effect an orderly resolution of a problem bank is made through a Commissioners’
                                   meeting. Meetings are to be held with the attendance of a majority of all incumbent
                                   Commissioners and adopt a resolution by majority of votes. As detailed in CP1, the roster of
                                   commissioners encompass representatives from the other relevant authorities operating in
                                   Korea, namely the BoK, MoF and KDIC. The KDIC can take part in the process by arranging
                                   banks’ mergers, transfer contracts and establishing a financial resolution institution, as well
                                   as providing financial support for distressed banks, if needed be.
Additional Criteria

AC1                                 Laws or regulations guard against the supervisor unduly delaying appropriate corrective
                                    actions.

Description and findings regarding As already detailed in previous ECs, the corrective framework in place in the Republic of
AC1                                Korea is laid down through Articles 34, 35, and 36 of the RBB. Article 37 allows for
                                   postponing the requirement of such measures in cases where the bank is judged to be
                                   unable to meet the required standards in a short period of time due to capital increase,
                                   disposal of assets, or similar.

                                    Banks are required to submit action plans regarding recommended and required
                                    management actions within two months (Article 39 of the RBB). The FSC is required to
                                    decide whether to approve the plan within one month (and in exceptional cases 45 days) of
                                    submission. Action plans are required to be revised by a Management Evaluation
                                    Committee comprised of outside professionals.

                                    Recommended actions related to management improvements are to be implemented
                                    within a year from the approval date; required actions, 18 months (Article 40 of the RBB).
                                    Banks are required to submit quarterly reports (Article 39(7)). Based on the quarterly reports,
                                    implementing periods can be exceeded in cases where the FSS Governor deems that the

                                    result of the plan is insufficient or inadequate, for no more than one year or 18 months,
                                    respectively (Article 40 of the RBB).

                                    Overall, the legal/regulatory framework seems to reasonably guard against the FSC-FSS
                                    unduly delaying appropriate corrective actions. Provisions related to Article 37 in particular,
                                    nevertheless, can potentially result in unduly delaying appropriate corrective actions. In
                                    practice such measures have been used since the Asian crisis.

AC2                                 When taking formal corrective action in relation to a bank, the supervisor informs the
                                    supervisor of non-bank related financial entities of its actions and, where appropriate,
                                    coordinates its actions with them.

                                         Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

Description and findings re AC2         The FSC-FSS is in charge of supervising both bank and non-bank financial entities. There has
                                        been no need to take corrective action since the Asian crisis.

Assessment re principle 11              LC

Comments                                The FSC-FSS has a range of powers, measures and tools available to address threats to
                                        banks and the banking system. The process of providing recommendations to banks based
                                        on on-site examinations, albeit recently improved, is still lengthy, which weakens its
                                        effectiveness. In addition, there are no provisions allowing the FSC to impose more stringent
                                        prudential limits and requirements beyond certain particular cases, barring individuals from
                                        the banking sector, replacing or restricting the powers of Board members or controlling
                                        owners.

                                        The authorities are recommended to:

                                            Further enhance its process of providing recommendations and sanctions in order to
                                             increase its effectiveness; and

                                            Amend the legal/regulatory framework in order to be able to impose more stringent
                                             prudential limits and requirements to individual banks, bar individuals from the
                                             banking sector and to replace and restrict the powers of Board members or controlling
                                             owners.

                                        The authorities reported to be planning to improve the post-examination process by giving
                                        a separate notice on the management status evaluation results, matters that require special
                                        attention and improvement, etc.

                                        The FSC-FSS has set up a task force that has been working on standards and rule changes
                                        for D-SIB and is looking to complete the task in the near future with more stringent
                                        prudential limits and requirements.

Principle 12                            Consolidated supervision. An essential element of banking supervision is that the
                                        supervisor supervises the banking group on a consolidated basis, adequately monitoring
                                        and, as appropriate, applying prudential standards to all aspects of the business conducted
                                        by the banking group worldwide.24

Essential Criteria

EC1                                     The supervisor understands the overall structure of the banking group and is familiar with
                                        all the material activities (including non-banking activities) conducted by entities in the

                                        how group-wide risks are managed and takes action when risks arising from the banking
                                        group and other entities in the wider group, in particular contagion and reputation risks,
                                        may jeopardize the safety and soundness of the bank and the banking system.

Description and findings regarding The FSC-FSS seems to have an understanding of the overall structure of banking groups but
EC1                                there is no evidence that the FSC-FSS is familiar with all the material activities (including
                                   non-banking activities) conducted by entities in the wider group, both domestic and cross-
                                   border.

                                    The FSC-FSS monitors how group-wide consolidated risks are managed from an internal
                                    controls and operational management perspective. In addition, surveillance of the
                                    consolidated balance sheet of banks is performed through the use of the CAEL, to the
                                    extent that refers to consolidated entities. Full-scope examinations of the large banks, which
                                    are conducted every two years, encompass a module related to the FHC, resulting in an RFI
                                    (Risk management, Financial Condition and Potential Impact).

                                    There are currently no procedures in place for overall monitoring/assessing relative to
                                    contagion and reputation risk that may jeopardize the safety and soundness of the bank
                                    and the banking system. The FSC-FSS has placed limitations on credit extension within the
                                    group and does not allow subsidiaries to own shares in the FHC (Article 48 of the FHC Act).

EC2                                 The supervisor imposes prudential standards and collects and analyses financial and other
                                    information on a consolidated basis for the banking group, covering areas such as capital
                                    adequacy, liquidity, large exposures, and exposures to related parties, lending limits and
                                    group structure.

Description and findings regarding Banks and FHCs are required to consolidate their subsidiaries for reporting and regulatory
EC2                                purposes (Article 54 of the FHC). Non-financial entities and insurance companies are not
                                   required to be consolidated and those investments are deducted from the FHC.

                                    Specific prudential standards are applied on a consolidated basis to FHCs (Article 45 and
                                    45–2 of the FHC Act), encompassing capital adequacy (eight percent, based on the 1988
                                    Accord), large exposures (25 percent), and lending to major shareholders (25 percent). As
                                    already discussed in previous CPs, banks are also required to apply prudential standards on
                                    a consolidated basis.

                                    Exceptions to large exposures and related parties lending limits encompass situations where
                                    it might be necessary to do so due to national economy reasons, as well as situations of
                                    reductions in capital of the FHCs (for the latter the FHC will have a year to comply with the
                                    limit).

                                    Lending over one percent or five billion won up to 25 percent of regulatory capital can be
                                    granted upon unanimous approval of the Board of Directors, followed by communication to
                                    the FSC.

                                    Business reports are required to be submitted on the same consolidated basis, covering
                                    information on capital adequacy, liquidity, single borrower exposures, and credit exposures
                                    to major shareholders.

EC3                                 The supervisor reviews whether the oversight of a bank’s foreign operations by
                                    management (of the parent bank or head office and, where relevant, the holding company)
                                    is adequate having regard to their risk profile and systemic importance and there is no
                                    hindrance in host countries for the parent bank to have access to all the material

                                    information from their foreign branches and subsidiaries. The supervisor also determines
                                    that banks’ policies and processes require the local management of any cross-border
                                    operations to have the necessary expertise to manage those operations in a safe and sound
                                    manner, and in compliance with supervisory and regulatory requirements. The home
                                    supervisor takes into account the effectiveness of supervision conducted in the host
                                    countries in which its banks have material operations.

Description and findings regarding CAMELR and ROCA are applied, respectively, for subsidiaries and branches operating
EC3                                overseas as part of on and off-site examination procedures. In addition, FHCs are required
                                   to report financial incidents or sanctions of overseas subsidiaries and to fulfill detailed
                                   requirements regarding internal controls, which encompass overseas operations regarding
                                   proper coordination and management.

                                    The authorities indicated that effectiveness of supervision conducted in host countries is not
                                    relevant within their supervisory processes, in view of the relative small exposures of Korean
                                    banks operating overseas albeit meeting with the host supervisor when performing on-site
                                    examinations overseas.

                                    The FSS reported that full scope on-site examinations of the parent encompass reviewing
                                    the procedures for appointing employees including, overseas subsidiaries. Authorities also
                                    reported that when performing on-site examinations overseas, senior management of
                                    branches and subsidiaries are interviewed and meeting minutes reviewed, adding that in
                                    practice, senior management appointed to those positions have had some direct/indirect
                                    experiences in dealing with operations in that particular country before becoming a
                                    manager.

EC4                                 The home supervisor visits the foreign offices periodically, the location and frequency being
                                    determined by the risk profile and systemic importance of the foreign operation. The
                                    supervisor meets the host supervisors during these visits. The supervisor has a policy for
                                    assessing whether it needs to conduct on-site examinations of a bank’s foreign operations,
                                    or require additional reporting, and has the power and resources to take those steps as and
                                    when appropriate.

Description and findings regarding The FSS performs periodic examination in subsidiaries and branches overseas and usually
EC4                                meet the host supervisor during those visits. Korean banks had a total of 100 branches and
                                   subsidiaries overseas as of March/2012, standing for 4 percent of total assets of banks.

                                    The FSS currently receives a full set of information on a quarterly basis and also has the
                                    power to require additional data and reports, as needed.

                                    Criteria for assessing the need to conduct on-site examinations of foreign branches and
                                    subsidiaries encompass asset size, date of last examination, as well as increase in assets or
                                    non-performing loans, in addition to issues related to internal controls (financial incidents).

                                    The FSS annual plan encompasses on-site examination of foreign branches and subsidiaries
                                    they wish to undertake (branches or subsidiaries indistinctly). Over the last few years, the
                                    FSS has managed to perform on-site examinations of foreign operations every year. The
                                    annual budget encompasses the examinations that the FSS wishes to undertake.

                                    Prior performing an on-site examination overseas, the teams usually meet with the head
                                    office department to gather information used by the bank to oversee those operations. In


                                                                                                                        83

                                    addition, the FSS examiners reported to usually meet with the host supervisor during those
                                    oversees on-site examinations.

EC5                                 The supervisor reviews the main activities of parent companies, and of companies affiliated
                                    with the parent companies, that have a material impact on the safety and soundness of the
                                    bank and the banking group, and takes appropriate supervisory action.

Description and findings regarding Most groups in the Republic of Korea operate under a FHC framework. FHCs are subject to
EC5                                periodic monitoring (every two years) through RFI (Risk management, Financial Condition
                                   and Potential Impact).

                                    The monitoring of activities of affiliate companies seems to be limited mostly to reviewing
                                    financial information. Where insurance groups and other nonbanking entities are
                                    subsidiaries of a FHC, the FSC-FSS require them to submit financial information (profitability,
                                    asset soundness, credit extension limit, capital adequacy, insider trading, etc.) on a solo-
                                    basis for monitoring purposes.

                                    In the case of a bank which is not under an FHC structure (all commercial banks are under
                                    FHCs); there is no evidence that activities of parent/affiliate companies were monitored. In
                                    practice, as groups consolidated assets are predominantly within the banking business,
                                    focus has been put on banks.

EC6                                 The supervisor limits the range of activities the consolidated group may conduct and the
                                         locations in which activities can be conducted (including the closing of foreign offices)
                                         if it determines that:

                                    (a)   The safety and soundness of the bank and banking group is compromised because
                                          the activities expose the bank or banking group to excessive risk and/or are not
                                          properly managed;

                                    (b)   The supervision by other supervisors is not adequate relative to the risks the activities
                                          present; and/or

                                    (c)   The exercise of effective supervision on a consolidated basis is hindered.

Description and findings regarding Article 13(3) of the Banking Act require that banks pre-submit plans for establishing an
EC6                                overseas corporation in cases where:

                                         The bank regulatory capital ratio is below 10 percent or the bank has a CAMELR of 3 or
                                          higher;

                                         the bank plans to establish an overseas corporation through a merger with a
                                          corporation rated B+ or lower;

                                         Intends to engage in business other than banking, incidental or concurrent services or
                                          business different from what it runs domestically; and

                                         Intends to establish the business in countries rated B+ or lower or that have no
                                          diplomatic relations with the Republic of Korea.

                                          Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

                                          The legal framework in place in the Republic of Korea restricts the types of
                                          activities that the consolidated group may conduct to financial activities or
                                          financial related activities. There are no restrictions, nonetheless, based on the
                                          quality of host supervisors or if the exercise of effective supervision on a
                                          consolidated basis is hindered.
EC7                                      In addition to supervising on a consolidated basis, the responsible supervisor supervises
                                         individual banks in the group. The responsible supervisor supervises each bank on a stand-
                                         alone basis and understands its relationship with other members of the group.25

Description and findings regarding The FSC-FSS does supervise individual banks in the banking group on a stand-alone basis,
EC7                                as per the Banking Act and other applicable regulations. Understanding the relationships
                                   between entities within a group seems limited to the extent that information on
                                   transactions among subsidiaries is periodically reported to the FSC.

Additional Criteria

AC1                                      For countries which allow corporate ownership of banks, the supervisor has the power to
                                         establish and enforce fit and proper standards for owners and senior management of parent
                                         companies.

Description and findings regarding The FSC-FSS require a fit and proper test for the promoters of a bank under the licensing
AC1                                process (please refer to CP5) but not for all large shareholders and not for senior
                                   management of parent companies.

                                         During the authorization process, Article 4(3) of the FHC Act requires the largest

                                         parties, as well as shareholder(s) deemed to exercise “de facto” influence” to have “adequate
                                         investment capacity, financial soundness and social credibility”. There is no requirement
                                         regarding senior management of parent companies.

Assessment of Principle 12               Materially Non-Compliant

Comments                                 The FSC-FSS has put significant effort over the last few years towards implementing
                                         consolidated supervision. The issuance of the FHC Act, as well as the implementation of the
                                         RFI for FHCs, has been key steps in that direction. Nevertheless, Several of Republic of
                                         Korea’s large banks are conglomerates with a wide variety of entities within the banking
                                         group and banks part of wider non-bank groups. Given such background, the framework in
                                         place does not fully allow for an in depth understanding and forward looking analysis, as it
                                         would be expected. Group-wide supervision is based on consolidated financials and
                                         assessments regarding its internal controls for managing the various businesses.

                                         Group monitoring is conducted through a dedicated team and focuses mostly on the
                                         banking side, particularly through stand-alone supervision, given its relevance within the
                                         activities of the FHCs. The overall monitoring is based on consolidated financials and
                                         assessment of the FHC regarding its internal controls for managing the various businesses.

                                    Going forward, the authorities should consider:

                                        Developing a framework in order to systematically assess the risks of the non-financial
                                         business within the group;

                                        Enhance its qualitative assessment regarding overall groups’ strategy and risk appetite;

                                        Seeking and incorporating in a systematic way information provided by other
                                         departments regarding non-bank financial entities supervised by the FSS;

                                        Expanding the scope of its fit and proper test to encompass related parties of all large
                                         shareholders; and

                                        Eliminating the possibility of exceeding the related parties lending limit based on
                                         Board approval.

Principle 13                        Home-host relationships. Home and host supervisors of cross-border banking groups
                                    share information and cooperate for effective supervision of the group and group entities,
                                    and effective handling of crisis situations. Supervisors require the local operations of foreign
                                    banks to be conducted to the same standards as those required of domestic banks.

Essential Criteria

EC1                                 The home supervisor establishes bank-specific supervisory colleges for banking groups with
                                    material cross-border operations to enhance its effective oversight, taking into account the
                                    risk profile and systemic importance of the banking group and the corresponding needs of
                                    its supervisors. In its broadest sense, the host supervisor who has a relevant subsidiary or a
                                    significant branch in its jurisdiction and who, therefore, has a shared interest in the effective
                                    supervisory oversight of the banking group, is included in the college. The structure of the
                                    college reflects the nature of the banking group and the needs of its supervisors.

Description and findings regarding FSC-FSS has started bank-specific supervisory colleges for two of the largest banks
EC1                                operating in the Republic of Korea. So far, it has held two colleges, one for Shinhan Bank in
                                   November 2011, and another for Woori Bank, in November 2012. The authorities plan to
                                   hold one college every year. The decision to establish colleges for those particular banks
                                   was based in total assets booked abroad (excluding Hana Group, which major shareholder is
                                   the National Pension Plan). At this stage there are no plans to establish colleges for other
                                   Korean banks operating overseas.

                                    All jurisdictions where those banks had subsidiaries or branches were invited to the
                                    supervisory colleges and around five jurisdictions attended per meeting. The colleges
                                    presented an overview of the FSS and the Korean supervisory approach (including informing
                                    the composite rating CAMELR), as well as overall remarks regarding the operations of the
                                    banks. Host supervisors have had also a session dedicated to further discuss cooperation
                                    among supervisory authorities. So far colleges have been focusing on banking issues.

                                    The FSS has been also participating in colleges as a host supervisor for Deutsche Bank,
                                    HSBC, ICBC, Bank of China, ING Bank, China Construction Bank Corporation, Bank of
                                    Communication, and SC Bank since 2009. Currently the largest subsidiaries of foreign banks
                                    are Standard Chartered and Citibank. While the FSS has been able to participate in the

                                    home supervisor to participate in the colleges for Citibank with no success.

EC2                                 Home and host supervisors share appropriate information on a timely basis in line with their
                                    respective roles and responsibilities, both bilaterally and through colleges. This includes
                                    information both on the material risks and risk management practices of the banking
                                    group26 and on the supervisors’ assessments of the safety and soundness of the relevant
                                    entity under their jurisdiction. Informal or formal arrangements (such as memoranda of
                                    understanding) are in place to enable the exchange of confidential information.

Description and findings regarding The FSC-FSS has signed MoUs with foreign banking supervisory authorities in 14 countries.
EC2                                Information is shared upon request and so far has focused on fit and proper analysis related
                                   to executives of subsidiaries, as well as violations of laws and regulations. Authorities
                                   reported that they may consider providing further information upon request.

                                    Currently the FSC-FSS shares information on an ad-hoc basis but informed to have plans to
                                    establish a process for more regular exchanges of information regarding Shinhan and Woori
                                    bank.

                                    The FSS reported that so far has been able to request and receive necessary information
                                    relative to foreign bank branches from home supervisors, in particular history of violations
                                    of laws/regulations by executives and employees and whether or not they were granted a
                                    banking license. For further information on colleges please refer to EC1.

EC3                                 Home and host supervisors coordinate and plan supervisory activities or undertake
                                    collaborative work if common areas of interest are identified in order to improve the
                                    effectiveness and efficiency of supervision of cross-border banking groups.

Description and findings regarding The FSS has informed that in some instances host supervisors have requested the FSS to
EC3                                perform inspections, to which they agreed.

                                    Up to now there has been no need to coordinate and plan supervisory activities or
                                    undertake collaborative work, such as joint inspections. The FSS understands that its current
                                    supervisory processes regarding cross-border exposures of Korean banks are adequate.

                                    Authorities reported that in case a foreign supervisor was to ask for them to perform a joint
                                    examination, they might consider it.

EC4                                 The home supervisor develops an agreed communication strategy with the relevant host
                                    supervisors. The scope and nature of the strategy reflects the risk profile and systemic
                                    importance of the cross-border operations of the bank or banking group. Home and host
                                    supervisors also agree on the communication of views and outcomes of joint activities and
                                    college meetings to banks, where appropriate, to ensure consistency of messages on group-

                                    develops a group resolution plan. The relevant authorities share any information necessary
                                    for the development and maintenance of a credible resolution plan. Supervisors also alert
                                    and consult relevant authorities and supervisors (both home and host) promptly when
                                    taking any recovery and resolution measures.

Description and findings regarding The Republic of Korea does not have any G-SIFI and has been working on a methodology
EC6                                for determining D-SIFIs. As a result, the FSC, Korea’s resolution authority, has not prepared
                                   resolution plans for local banks in cooperation with overseas supervisory authorities.

                                    The FSC, FSS, BOK and the Korea Banking Institute have launched a joint task force to
                                    introduce a D-SIB regulatory framework in the Republic of Korea. The joint task force held
                                    its first meeting on January 3, 2013 and was also attended by seven commercial banks and
                                    the Korea Federation of Banks. The authorities expect the draft for the new rules and

                                    regulations on D-SIB, including the assessment methodology, to be ready sometime in 2013

                                   2012, covering six banks.

                                    The FSS reported to inform in advance host supervisors of its examination plans. Examiners
                                    also meet with the host supervisor as part of the on-site examination program.

                                    The authorities reported to have never being denied access to branches and subsidiaries
                                    located overseas with only one exception, and to have never denied a foreign supervisor
                                    access to a branch or subsidiary of a foreign bank.

EC9                                 The host supervisor supervises booking offices in a manner consistent with internationally
                                    agreed standards. The supervisor does not permit shell banks or the continued operation of
                                    shell banks.

Description and findings regarding Banking license applications encompass a review of a wide range of elements such as: fit-
EC9                                and-proper tests for the executives and shareholders, personnel, business facilities, IT
                                   systems, and business plans, among others (please refer to CP 5 for further information on
                                   the licensing process). After being licensed, all banks are subject to regular off site
                                   monitoring and on site examinations. In that sense, shell banks are not permitted to operate
                                   in the Republic of Korea.

EC10                                A supervisor that takes consequential action on the basis of information received from
                                    another supervisor consults with that supervisor, to the extent possible, before taking such
                                    action.

Description and findings regarding The authorities reported that so far, there has been no case of information received by the
EC10                               FSS that would require the FSC-FSS to entail enforcement actions. The authorities state that
                                   they may take actions, if necessary, on the basis of information received from other
                                   supervisor when illegal or inappropriate conducts were identified during examination.

Assessment of Principle 13          LC

Comments                            The FSC-FSS has put in place procedures to share information and cooperate for
                                    supervisory purposes. Overall, exchanges of substantial information with foreign supervisors

                                         Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

                                        are not yet fully in place. From a proportionality perspective, given the current limited scale
                                        of foreign operations by Korean banks, as well as Korean operations of foreign banks, the
                                        assessors understand that the current arrangements, albeit needing further improvements,
                                        were reflected in the rating.

                                        Mechanisms for effective handling of crisis situations from a cross-border perspective, as
                                        well as group resolution plans are yet to be established. The FSC-FSS set up a task force that
                                        has been working on standards and rule changes for D-SIB and is looking to complete the
                                        task in the near future. The FSC-FSS should expedite its process for establishing criteria for
                                        determining D-SIFIs and consequently developing mechanisms for cross-border crisis
                                        cooperation and group resolution plans.

PRUDENTIAL REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS

Principle 14                            Corporate governance. The supervisor determines that banks and banking groups have
                                        robust corporate governance policies and processes covering, for example, strategic
                                        direction, group and organizational structure, control environment, responsibilities of the
                                        banks’ Boards and senior management,27 and compensation. These policies and processes
                                        are commensurate with the risk profile and systemic importance of the bank.

Essential Criteria

EC1                                     Laws, regulations or the supervisor establish the responsibilities of a bank’s Board and
                                        senior management with respect to corporate governance to ensure there is effective
                                        control over the bank’s entire business. The supervisor provides guidance to banks and
                                        banking groups on expectations for sound corporate governance.

Description and findings regarding The Commercial Act and the Banking Act provides for the responsibilities of a bank’s Board
EC1                                and senior management. Bank corporate governance standards (including composition of
                                   the Board, the Audit Committee, the standard of internal control etc) are provided in the
                                   related laws such as the Banking Act. (Article 18–25, Banking Act).

                                        Article 18 of the Banking Act sets out the qualifications and other expectations for bank
                                        executives which includes a number of exclusions such as a person that has been dismissed
                                        or removed from office by disciplinary punishment (paragraph 6) or a person that was
                                        previously an executive of a financial institution that was subject to timely correct measures
                                        by the FSC etc. Paragraph 9(2) sets out expectations for bank executives, such as: a
                                        minimum level of experience and knowledge of finance, who are unlikely to impede the
                                        public interest, sound management and order of credit to the bank. In an effort to
                                        encourage higher levels of corporate governance, the Banking Act (Article 22) was amended
                                        for the Board of Directors to comprise a majority of outside directors (independent
                                        directors). Articles 12 and 13 of the Enforcement Decree of the Banking Act also covers
                                        expectations for qualification requirements for executives. Overall, the regulations establish
                                        a set of minimum requirements for executives and directors in terms of qualifications and
                                        experience and certain prohibitions.

                                    Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

                                   In addition, the FSS has published guidance to banks and banking groups on expectations
                                   of sound corporate governance (e.g., Model Compensation Guidelines for Banking
                                   Institutions, Model Guidelines for Banks’ Independent External Directors etc). The specific
                                   responsibilities for senior management and Boards are established in bank supervisors’
                                   examination manuals and routinely verified through the onsite examinations. Governance is
                                   also included in the partial examination where appropriate, for example: in 2011 a thematic
                                   review focused on adequacy of senior management across a sample of large systemic
                                   banks.

                                   The relevant regulations governing FHCs is derived from FHC Act 38–41.5 Enforcement
                                   Decree Art 17–20, Regulations Supervision FHC 13–13, 14, 15,16, detailed regulation Article
                                   5–9, and 10. While generally comprehensive, there is one particular omission in the FHC
                                   regulations that is particularly relevant for good corporate governance in complex group,
                                   and that is the requirement for subsidiaries within a group that are regulated by the FSS to
                                   have a majority of independent outside directors to protect the interests of their relevant
                                   stakeholders, such as in the case of insurance subsidiaries under a bank FHC.

EC2                                 The supervisor regularly assesses a bank’s corporate governance policies and practices, and
                                    their implementation, and determines that the bank has robust corporate governance
                                    policies and processes commensurate with its risk profile and systemic importance. The
                                    supervisor requires banks and banking groups to correct deficiencies in a timely manner.

Description and findings regarding Article 23–j4 of the Banking Act, stipulates that banks will have internal regulations on
EC2                                controlling structures observed by the BoD. Paragraph 2 reflects the detail of the
                                   requirements in relation to composition of the BoD and establishment of Board committees.
                                   Article 20–24 of the Regulations establishes the expectations for corporate governance
                                   across a number of criteria, including: qualifications of executives, operation of the BoD,
                                   dismissal of compliance officers (internal auditors) and internal standards of corporate
                                   governance.

                                   Appendix 5 of the Regulations set out the areas to be assessed as part of the CAMELR onsite
                                   risk assessment. The management category assesses the following in relation to corporate
                                   governance for head office banks and subsidiary banks:

                                       Adequacy of management structure and establishment and enforcement of
                                        management policy;

                                       Actual status of promotion of management efficiency and management improvement;

                                       Subsidiaries management status and operating results;

                                       Risk management system and operation status;

                                       Internal control system and status; and

                                       Enforcement status of laws and regulations, policies and matters pointed out as a
                                        result of examination.

                                   The items for evaluation listed in the bank examination manual governing onsite
                                   examinations refers to a review of ‘management status’ evaluation in Chapter 5. The onsite

                                      Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

                                     supervisory process for assessing corporate governance consists mainly of verifying
                                     documentation such as Board resolutions, Board agendas and meeting minutes, and
                                     adequacy of management structure. A meeting with the Permanent and independent
                                     (Outside) Directors might be conducted in exceptional circumstances but is not typically
                                     part of the onsite examination. The assessment did not appear to extend to subsidiary
                                     boards.

                                     While the self assessment states that banks are required to develop and disclose to the
                                     public their corporate governance policies there is no regulation supporting this assertion. A
                                     sample of the annual reports for the larger banks reviewed (typically listed on the exchange)
                                     do summarize their corporate governance arrangements in their annual reports. Industry
                                     practice for smaller banks not listed on the exchange will not be required to disclose details
                                     of their corporate governance arrangements.

                                     The assessment of corporate governance is primarily through the full scope onsite CAMELR
                                     examination performed every two years. Within that two year period, the assessment of
                                     corporate governance is not conducted systematically for the domestic banks and while
                                     partial examinations might include a topic on governance (as demonstrated in 2011), the
                                     depth of analysis and frequency is variable. In the case of FHCs, the complexity of the group
                                     warrants heightened corporate governance processes, and a more continuous assessment.

                                     A separate list of items for evaluation are required for foreign bank branches compared to
                                     commercial banks. In addition, a separate examination process is carried out for state
                                     owned banks. The examination manuals for Korea Asset Management Corporation and
                                     Korea Housing Finance Corporation do not include a review of management or corporate
                                     governance (see FSS Examination Manual). As these two banks are government owned, an
                                     onsite review is only permitted when the FSC approves an examination to be performed and
                                     the onsite examination will not include an assessment of corporate governance. (The only
                                     examination of these Specialized banks was in 2008). Assessment procedures for EXIM Bank
                                     (also a specialized bank), are unique as the FSS will report the outcome of its assessment to
                                     the Ministry of Strategy and Finance which has the ultimate authority for supervising EXIM
                                     Bank.

EC3                                  The supervisor determines that governance structures and processes for nominating and
                                     appointing Board members are appropriate for the bank and across the banking group.
                                     Board membership includes experienced non-executive members, where appropriate.
                                     Commensurate with the risk profile and systemic importance, Board structures include audit,
                                     risk oversight and remuneration committees with experienced non-executive members.

Description and findings regarding The Banking Act (Article 18–22) provides clear guidance regarding the election procedures
EC3                                for directors and the criteria for selection of directors which is extensive. The Article sets out
                                   prohibitions for directors that are not fit and proper. The regulations require that more than
                                   half of the Board should comprise of independent non-executive directors “outside
                                   directors”. Board members should satisfy certain experience and expertise criteria so that
                                   they do not threaten public interests or the bank’s prudential soundness.

                                     Article 23–2 of the banking Act sets out the requirements for a bank to establish an Audit
                                     Committee (AC). The Article stipulates the requirements for an AC to be composed of at

Description and findings regarding The Commercial Act requires Board members to exercise their “duty of care”and“duty of

EC5                                  The supervisor determines that the bank’s Board approves and oversees implementation of
                                     the bank’s strategic direction, risk appetite29 and strategy, and related policies, establishes
                                     and communicates corporate culture and values (e.g., through a code of conduct), and
                                     establishes conflicts of interest policies and a strong control environment.

Description and findings regarding The Board is required to evaluate and approve the bank’s key organizational and

                                   management, and internal controls (including conflicts of interest policies). Article 23(1) of
                                   the Banking Act prescribes the matters that will be decided by the Board which includes:

                                         Matters on management objectives;

                                         Mattes on amendments of the Articles of incorporation;

                                         Matters on the budget and settlement of accounts, including the remuneration of
                                          executives and employees;

                                         Matters on major organizational change, such as dissolution, business transfer, merger
                                          etc; and

                                         Matters on internal control standards under Article 23–3.

          The OECD (OECD glossary of corporate governance-related terms in “Experiences from the Regional Corporate
        Governance Roundtables”, 2003, defines “duty of care” as “The duty of a board member to act on an informed and
        prudent basis in decisions with respect to the company. Often interpreted as requiring the board member to
        Approach the affairs of the company in the same way that a ’prudent man’ would approach their own affairs. Liability
        under the duty of care is frequently mitigated by the business judgment rule.” The OECD defines “duty of loyalty” as
        “the duty of the board member to act in the interest of the company and shareholders. The duty of loyalty should
        prevent individual board members from acting in their own interest, or the interest of another individual or group, at
        the expense of the company and all shareholders.”

        29
           “Risk appetite” reflects the level of aggregate risk that the bank’s Board is willing to assume and manage in the
        pursuit of the bank’s business objectives. Risk appetite may include both quantitative and qualitative elements, as
        appropriate, and encompass a range of measures. For the purposes of this document, the terms “risk appetite” and
        “risk tolerance” are treated synonymously.

                                    Article 31 of the RSBB sets out the responsibilities of the BoD in relation to risk management
                                    and risk tolerances, specifically Article 31(1)(1) and (2) “Establishment of basic policy on risk
                                    management consistent with the management strategy; determination of risk levels which
                                    the bank can bear.”

                                    As part of the examination process, the FSS will verify the bank’s plans, risk tolerances, risk
                                    management strategies and policies, and conflicts of interest and other internal control
                                    policies, as part of the assessment of management.

                                    The regulations are not specific in relation to a requirement for a bank’s Board to regularly
                                    review and approve all material policies and procedures on a frequent basis. While this is
                                    the expectation of the FSS and is observed as industry practice, it is not stipulated in the
                                    Regulations.

EC6                                 The supervisor determines that the bank’s Board, except where required otherwise by laws
                                    or regulations, has established fit and proper standards in selecting senior management,
                                    maintains plans for succession, and actively and critically oversees senior management’s
                                    execution of Board strategies, including monitoring senior management’s performance
                                    against standards established for them.

Description and findings regarding Article 23–2, Banking Act; Article 23–4, requires banks to formulate and disclose to the
EC6                                public internal corporate governance policies that would encompass, among others, the
                                   qualification criteria and appointment procedures for Board members and senior
                                   management and the development of plans for succession. Bank supervisors assess whether
                                   the bank’s Board has in place appropriate qualification criteria and appointment procedures
                                   for senior management and plans for succession.

EC7                                 The supervisor determines that the bank’s Board actively oversees the design and operation
                                    of the bank’s and banking group’s compensation system, and that it has appropriate
                                    incentives, which are aligned with prudent risk taking. The compensation system, and
                                    related performance standards, are consistent with long-term objectives and financial
                                    soundness of the bank and is rectified if there are deficiencies.

Description and findings re EC7     In line with the Financial Stability Board’s Principles for Sound Compensation Practices, the
                                    FSS developed a ‘Model Compensation Guidelines for Banking Institutions’ circulated to
                                    banks in January 2010. However, the compensation principles have not been translated into
                                    law or regulations governing banks. In files reviewed, there was evidence that banks have
                                    commenced transitioning to compliance with the FSS guidelines, however, extent of focus
                                    by supervisors through onsite and offsite activities is not well developed, for example:
                                    conducting meetings with Board Compensation Committees to assess how they are
                                    discharging their role and key drivers of remuneration, identification of material risk takers
                                    within a bank or group, confirmation that a compensation packages are risk-adjusted etc,.

EC8                                 The supervisor determines that the bank’s Board and senior management know and
                                    understand the bank’s and banking group’s operational structure and its risks, including
                                    those arising from the use of structures that impede transparency (e.g. special-purpose or
                                    related structures). The supervisor determines that risks are effectively managed and
                                    mitigated, where appropriate.

Description and findings regarding The main supervisory activity used by the supervisor to assess that the Board adequately
                                   understands the bank’s risk and operational structure is through a review of verification of

                                    with the CEO/Chair, meetings with the full BoD are not typical and would only occur in
                                    exceptional incidences (the FSS was not able to provide an example where this had
                                    occurred).

EC9                                 The supervisor has the power to require changes in the composition of the bank’s Board if it
                                    believes that any individuals are not fulfilling their duties related to the satisfaction of these
                                    criteria.

Description and findings regarding Article 54(1) and (2) of the Banking Act gives the FSS the power to (i) suspend the executive;
EC9                                (ii) recommend that the general meeting of stockholders dismiss the executive; or
                                   (iii)request that the bank take appropriate action and dismiss the executive. However, the
                                   Act does not give the FSS direct unilateral power to act to dismiss or make changes in the
                                   BoD. Bank supervisors may recommend changes in the composition of the bank’s Board
                                   (i.e., the dismissal or replacement of Board members), if any of its Board members violate
                                   laws, regulations, or supervisory actions or engage in activities that threaten the soundness
                                   of the bank. As such, the supervisor may require a bank to replace Board members, if they
                                   do not comply with the Banking Act, the Regulation on Supervision of Banking Business,
                                   supervisory guidelines, or the Model Corporate Governance Guidelines.

                                    No evidence whereby the FSS-FSC had dismissed or removed a Board member or senior
                                    manager after not complying with the examination manual.

Additional Criteria

AC1                                  Laws, regulations or the supervisor require banks to notify the supervisor as soon as they
                                     become aware of any material and bona fide information that may negatively affect the
                                     fitness and propriety of a bank’s Board member or a member of the senior management.

Description and findings regarding Banks must report to bank supervisors information on transactions with related parties such

                                   outside of the bank. As such, any material information that may negatively affect the fitness
                                   and propriety of the bank’s Board members and senior management must be reported to
                                   bank supervisors. Bank supervisors may also require banks to submit certain information on
                                   the fitness and propriety of their Board members and senior management (Article 47,
                                   Banking Act; Articles 15 and 99, Detailed Regulations).

Assessment of Principle 14          LC

Comments                            Two key drivers of this rating: (i) gaps in regulations for corporate governance; and (ii)
                                    greater range of supervision practices required to effectively test corporate governance.
                                    Regulations are not sufficiently detailed to encourage sound corporate governance across
                                    the range of responsibilities of the Board of Directors. In some instances, powers are not
                                    sufficiently formalized into the Regulations but remain as ‘guidance’ which is a lower level of
                                    enforcement. Specifically:

                                        FSS lacks authority to remove directors and has not exercised this power;

                                        Sound compensation principles have not been transposed into regulations (currently
                                         guidance for banks);


                                                                                                                         95

                                           No regulations for policies and procedures to be reviewed and approved by the Board
                                            of Directors on a minimum frequency;

                                           No requirement in the regulations for the regulated subsidiary board to be composed
                                            of independent directors; and

                                           No reference in the regulations for a conflict of interest policy.

                                      FSS oversight of corporate governance and the inputs into the risk rating could be further
                                      developed, particularly in relation to FHCs given the added complexity and scale of their
                                      organizational structure and inter-related transactions. There is no separate FHC
                                      examination manual which would provide a methodology for an assessment of corporate
                                      governance reflecting their complexity and need for greater intensity of inspection. The FSS
                                      does not assess the corporate governance of the Specialized banks.

Principle 15                          Risk management process. The supervisor determines that banks30 have a comprehensive
                                      risk management process (including effective Board and senior management oversight) to
                                      identify, measure, evaluate, monitor, report and control or mitigate31 all material risks on a
                                      timely basis and to assess the adequacy of their capital and liquidity in relation to their risk
                                      profile and market and macroeconomic conditions. This extends to development and review
                                      of contingency arrangements (including robust and credible recovery plans where
                                      warranted) that take into account the specific circumstances of the bank. The risk
                                      management process is commensurate with the risk profile and systemic importance of the
                                      bank.32

Essential Criteria

EC1                                   The supervisor determines that banks have appropriate risk management strategies that
                                      have been approved by the banks’ Boards and that the Boards set a suitable risk appetite to
                                      define the level of risk the banks are willing to assume or tolerate. The supervisor also
                                      determines that the Board ensures that:

                                      (a)   A sound risk management culture is established throughout the bank;



        30
           For the purposes of assessing risk management by banks in the context of Principles 15 to 25, a bank’s risk
        management framework should take an integrated “bank-wide” perspective of the bank’s risk exposure,
        encompassing the bank’s individual business lines and business units. Where a bank is a member of a group of
        companies, the risk management framework should in addition cover the risk exposure across and within the
        “banking group” (see footnote 19 under Principle 1) and should also take account of risks posed to the bank or
        members of the banking group through other entities in the wider group.

        31
          To some extent the precise requirements may vary from risk type to risk type (Principles 15–25) as reflected by the
        underlying reference documents.

        32
          It should be noted that while, in this and other Principles, the supervisor is required to determine that banks’ risk
        management policies and processes are being adhered to, the responsibility for ensuring adherence remains with a
        bank’s Board and senior management.

Description and findings regarding Under Article 31 of the Regulations, the BoD must determine the following: key risk
EC1                                management processes; the level of risks to be tolerated; appropriate level of investment
                                   exposures and acceptable losses; and, internal risk processes commensurate with the bank’s
                                   business and management strategies.

                                   Article 31 clearly sets out the responsibilities of the Board in setting risk appetite of the
                                   bank. The Board is required to: (i) establish basic policy on risk management consistent with
                                   the management strategy; (ii) determine risk levels which the bank can bear; (iii) approve
                                   limits; and (iv) revise regulations on risk management.

                                   Article 30 of the Regulations (paragraphs 1 and 2) states that “a bank shall establish a
                                   system for ensuring a timely recognition, assessment, monitoring, and control of various
                                   risks arising in all kinds of transactions and for evaluating and managing appropriateness of
                                   its inside capital.” For efficient risk management, a bank shall set up and operate an
                                   adequate risk-bearing limit and transaction limit by department, transaction or person in
                                   charge. According to the Regulations, a bank shall comprehensively recognize and monitor
                                   any significant change in risks in connection with its subsidiaries, etc. The Article also sets
                                   out requirements for the organization of risk management for comprehensive management
                                   of risks (paragraph 2). Paragraph 3 discusses the independence of the risk management
                                   function.

                                   The FSS assesses the soundness of the bank’s risk decision processes (the Board and senior
                                   management) through the onsite CAMEL-R examination. Through the on-site supervision
                                   the FSS assesses risk management systems of banks. While the FSS performs frequent
                                   offsite monitoring of data submitted through the bank’s quarterly Business Reports, this is
                                   mainly quantitative and a thorough review of risk management is typically only conducted
                                   within the full scope examination. For example, banks will not submit risk management
                                   strategies for review of the FSS outside of the full scope examination. While onsite
                                   examination schedules can be adjusted depending on the profile of risk management, a
                                   more frequent onsite assessment of risk management was exceptional. In the event limit
                                   breaches are reported or other types of data, the FSS will actively consider the
                                   appropriateness of their supervision approach.

EC2                                The supervisor requires banks to have comprehensive risk management policies and
                                   processes to identify, measure, evaluate, monitor, report and control or mitigate all material
                                   risks. The supervisor determines that these processes are adequate:




                                                                                                                      97

                                      (a)   To provide a comprehensive “bank-wide” view of risk across all material risk types;

                                      (b)   For the risk profile and systemic importance of the bank; and

                                            which the bank operates and to incorporate such assessments into the bank’s risk
                                            management process.

Description and findings regarding Article 30, paragraph 3 of the regulations require banks to have comprehensive risk
EC2                                management policies and processes to mitigate all material risks. The Article specifies the
                                   following risk types as examples: credit risk, operational risk, market risk, interest rate risk in
                                   the banking book, and liquidity risk. The Article also requires banks to take into
                                   consideration risk of strategy and reputation and other various risks which may occur in
                                   transactions for each type. The regulations satisfy the criteria.

                                      In addition to Article 30, the ICAAP requirements also establish a thorough set of minimum
                                      expectations for banks to consider its risk profile and capital adequacy. Importantly, there is
                                      an obligation for the bank to evaluate its risk profile and capital against changes in the
                                      external environment on a regular basis. The ICAAP is at an early stage of implementation
                                      for domestic banks, and FHCs are yet to prepare and submit an ICAAP for a full assessment
                                      cycle. Guidance for FHC’s to produce an ICAAP was circulated to industry in 2012 and 2013
                                      will be the first year receiving ICAAPs for the FHCs.

EC3                                   The supervisor determines that risk management strategies, policies, processes and limits
                                      are:
                                      (a)   Properly documented;

                                      (b)   Regularly reviewed and appropriately adjusted to reflect changing risk appetites, risk
                                            profiles and market and macroeconomic conditions; and
                                      (c)   Communicated within the bank.

                                      The supervisor determines that exceptions to established policies, processes and limits
                                      receive the prompt attention of, and authorization by, the appropriate level of management
                                      and the bank’s Board where necessary.

Description and findings re EC3       Article 30 in RSBB is the relevant section for risk management strategies and Paragraph 2
                                      gives a specific reference to risk limits (see EC1 & 2). The FSS ensures through the CAMEL-R
                                      assessments that a bank’s risk strategy, policy, processes, and limits are appropriately
                                      executed and documented. Banks are required to submit details regarding compliance with
                                      risk limits on regular basis and is overseen by offsite supervision. A change in risk limits or
                                      breaches will trigger a supervisory response.

                                      Banks are required to establish formal risk management policies and to approve changes,
                                      however the requirement for Board’s to review and approve policies and limits in line with
                                      risk appetite is not prescribed by the Regulations. The onsite examination will include an
                                      evaluation of risk management and a focus on the effective oversight by the Board which
                                      includes review and approval of policies and limits. Banks accredited to use internal models
                                      for calculating Pillar 1 capital are required to perform regular stress testing and report
                                      results to the Board and the Regulations pertaining to ICAAP also enforce the Board’s role.

EC4                                 The supervisor determines that the bank’s Board and senior management obtain sufficient
                                    information on, and understand the nature and level of risk being taken by the bank and
                                    how this risk relates to adequate levels of capital and liquidity. The supervisor also
                                    determines that the Board and senior management regularly review and understand the
                                    implications and limitations (including the risk measurement uncertainties) of the risk
                                    management information that they receive.

Description and findings regarding Article 31 of the regulations establishes the need for the Board to perform effective
EC4                                oversight of the risk management framework that consists of an independent risk
                                   management unit. Regulations are less clear about Board reporting requirements and
                                   management information requirements.

                                    As a minimum, the FSS will perform the full onsite examination on a two year frequency.
                                    While a review of Board papers is a core element of the onsite review, the process to
                                    confirm that a Board and senior management remain effectively engaged and informed of
                                    the changing risk profile of the bank was not well developed. In regards of offsite
                                    surveillance, an assessment of the quality and nature of Board reporting was not part of
                                    normal procedures. Consultation with the Board and the senior management to ensure they
                                    understand and are kept abreast of the bank’s risk management activities (e.g.,
                                    identification, measurement, monitoring, and controls) was typically through the full scope
                                    but processes were not intrusive at questioning Board’s understanding and oversight of
                                    risks and risk management.

EC5                                 The supervisor determines that banks have an appropriate internal process for assessing
                                    their overall capital and liquidity adequacy in relation to their risk appetite and risk profile.
                                    The supervisor reviews and evaluates banks’ internal capital and liquidity adequacy
                                    assessments and strategies.

Description and findings regarding The FSS makes use of CAMEL-R and RADARS to assess whether the bank’s internal controls
EC5                                are functioning effectively to maintain appropriate levels of capital and liquidity in a manner
                                   commensurate with the bank’s risk appetite and profile. Banks also have to regularly carry
                                   out stress tests in order to assess the impact of negative events on the liquidity risk
                                   exposure and quantitative and qualitative liquidity buffers adequacy. As per the Regulations,
                                   the liquidity risk management system must be consistent with the characteristics, size and
                                   complexity of the banks’ operations and includes: the capacity to identify the risk factors;
                                   measure the risk exposure, and identify mitigation tools. Roles and responsibilities within
                                   the liquidity risk management process must be clearly defined and the liquidity risk
                                   management system has to periodically be revised to check its validity over time
                                   (Regulations for ICAAP, Annex 3). The FSS will receive capital projections for banks at the
                                   start of the calendar year and offsite analysis will track trends in capital adequacy on a
                                   quarterly basis.

                                    Outside of the respective requirements for capital and liquidity, banks are required to
                                    establish and submit to the FSS an ICAAP which will include a robust analysis of all material
                                    risks. The review of bank’s ICAAP is in the early stages of implementation. Further time is
                                    needed to be fully embedded in the supervision framework as well as development of
                                    guidance material for supervisors to benchmark and assess the ICAAP (see CP 16).

EC6                                    Where banks use models to measure components of risk, the supervisor determines that:

                                       (a)   Banks comply with supervisory standards on their use;

                                       The supervisor assesses whether the model outputs appear reasonable as a reflection of the
                                       risks assumed.

Description and findings regarding Oversight by the BoD is established in the Regulations for IRB, AMA and market risk to

                                       is provided with reports attesting to the performance of models. BoD’s set thresholds for
                                       model performance and validation reports are submitted to Boards on a regular basis.

EC7                                    The supervisor determines that banks have information systems that are adequate (both
                                       under normal circumstances and in periods of stress) for measuring, assessing and reporting
                                       on the size, composition and quality of exposures on a bank-wide basis across all risk types,
                                       products and counterparties. The supervisor also determines that these reports reflect the
                                       bank’s risk profile and capital and liquidity needs, and are provided on a timely basis to the
                                       bank’s Board and senior management in a form suitable for their use.

Description and findings regarding Banks must operate with information systems supported by a dedicated risk management
EC7                                unit that measures, assesses, and reports risks in relation to the types, products, and
                                   counterparties. Reporting to the board and the senior management is a key feature of the
                                   risk information system.

EC8                                    The supervisor determines that banks have adequate policies and processes to ensure that
                                       the banks’ Boards and senior management understand the risks inherent in new products,33
                                       material modifications to existing products, and major management initiatives (such as
                                       changes in systems, processes, business model and major acquisitions). The supervisor
                                       determines that the Boards and senior management are able to monitor and manage these
                                       risks on an ongoing basis. The supervisor also determines that the bank’s policies and
                                       processes require the undertaking of any major activities of this nature to be approved by
                                       their Board or a specific committee of the Board.

Description and findings regarding When conducting analysis using the RADARS framework, the FSS assesses whether the roles
                                   and responsibilities assumed by the board and senior management are consistent and

        33

EC8                                 commensurate with the bank’s risk management system and processes. The key areas of
                                    interest to bank supervisors are: (i) whether the board of directors appropriately receives all
                                    the material risk-related reports and deliberates on them; (ii) whether the management
                                    makes earnest effort to improve the reliability of risk measurements; and (iii) whether the
                                    board of directors and the management understand the methods, tools, and approaches
                                    taken to manage risk; and (iv) whether the composition and activities of the risk committee
                                    are appropriate.

                                    In terms of new strategic directions, there is no requirement in the regulations to require
                                    banks to notify the FSS of a new acquisition of a financial or non-financial business. The FSS
                                    does not review the strategic plan of the bank on an annual cycle and strategy is not a
                                    feature of CAMELR or RADAR. No specific obligation within regulations regarding new
                                    product approval process.

EC9                                 The supervisor determines that banks have risk management functions covering all material
                                    risks with sufficient resources, independence, authority and access to the banks’ Boards to
                                    perform their duties effectively. The supervisor determines that their duties are clearly
                                    segregated from risk-taking functions in the bank and that they report on risk exposures
                                    directly to the Board and senior management. The supervisor also determines that the risk
                                    management function is subject to regular review by the internal audit function.

Description and findings regarding Under Article 31 of the Regulations, banks must operate with a dedicated risk management
EC9                                unit that oversees bank risks and supports the senior management and the board of
                                   directors. Such a dedicated unit must be segregated from, and independent of, the bank’s
                                   risk-taking activities. Other activities of the risk management unit may include monitoring
                                   adherence to risk parameters, managing the risk information system, and providing timely
                                   risk information to the senior management. Paragraph 2 of Article 31 addresses the
                                   comprehensiveness of all risks a bank faces and supports the Board i.e. a bank shall set up a
                                   risk management unit for comprehensive management of the risks which may occur in its
                                   business and support of the board of directors (including the committee) and the
                                   management.

                                    As per paragraph 3 of the same Article, the risk management unit shall be independent of
                                    other business departments and perform the duties under any of the following
                                    subparagraphs: Article 31 does not, however, mention the requirement for the risk
                                    management function to be subject to regular review by the IA function referred to in this
                                    EC.

EC10                                The supervisor requires larger and more complex banks to have a dedicated risk
                                    management unit overseen by a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) or equivalent function. If the CRO
                                    of a bank is removed from his/her position for any reason, this should be done with the
                                    prior approval of the Board and generally should be disclosed publicly. The bank should
                                    also discuss the reasons for such removal with its supervisor.

Description and findings regarding All banks must maintain a dedicated risk management unit irrespective of their size or
EC10                               complexity (Article 31 of the Regulations). Proposals to amend the provisions on the
                                   governance of financial institutions has been put forth to the National Assembly, and the
                                   FSS has been working on guidelines on the Chief Risk Officer for banks, and it is expected to
                                   be completed and take effect during the first half of 2013. While the regulations do not
                                   currently stipulate a CRO function, in practice each of the domestic banks maintains a CRO



                                                                                                                      101

                                    function. The removal of a CRO is therefore not stipulated as an action which would require
                                    FSS engagement, but will occur as a matter of course.

EC11                                The supervisor issues standards related to, in particular, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk,
                                    interest rate risk in the banking book and operational risk.

Description and findings regarding The supervisory regulations provide detailed standards for measuring credit risk, market
EC11                               risk, and operational risk for use in capital adequacy calculations. In addition, the
                                   supervisory regulations also contain specific rules on risk calculations for liquidity risk and
                                   interest rate risk. Regulations establish requirements and standards that banks must comply
                                   with respect to measurement, management and oversight of all those risks. Also, the
                                   supervisory manuals provide guidance for supervisors both in the off-site and in the on-site
                                   analysis, on the evaluation of risk management and organizational safeguards with respect
                                   to each main risk type.

EC12                                The supervisor requires banks to have appropriate contingency arrangements, as an integral
                                    part of their risk management process, to address risks that may materialize and actions to
                                    be taken in stress conditions (including those that will pose a serious risk to their viability). If
                                    warranted by its risk profile and systemic importance, the contingency arrangements include
                                    robust and credible recovery plans that take into account the specific circumstances of the
                                    bank. The supervisor, working with resolution authorities as appropriate, assesses the
                                    adequacy of banks’ contingency arrangements in the light of their risk profile and systemic
                                    importance (including reviewing any recovery plans) and their likely feasibility during
                                    periods of stress. The supervisor seeks improvements if deficiencies are identified.

Description and findings regarding Contingency plans are required under the relevant regulations covering liquidity and capital,
EC12                               as well as IT etc (see EC16, 24 and 25 respectively). Banks are also required to include
                                   contingency plans based on stress tests in the bank’s capital decisions, but not for other
                                   material risks. Korea is not required to introduce the resolution plan for G-SIFI because no
                                   domestic bank has been designated as a G-SIFI. Under the law—e.g., Act on the Structural
                                   Improvement of the Financial Industry, Depositor Protection Act, Banking Act, etc.—bank
                                   supervisors can demand submission of resolution plan only to troubled banks. However,
                                   when regulation on D-SIFI is confirmed, establishment of recovery plans for D-SIFI will be
                                   reviewed.

EC13                                The supervisor requires banks to have forward-looking stress testing programs,
                                    commensurate with their risk profile and systemic importance, as an integral part of their
                                    risk management process. The supervisor regularly assesses a bank’s stress testing program
                                    and determines that it captures material sources of risk and adopts plausible adverse
                                    scenarios. The supervisor also determines that the bank integrates the results into its
                                    decision-making, risk management processes (including contingency arrangements) and the
                                    assessment of its capital and liquidity levels. Where appropriate, the scope of the
                                    supervisor’s assessment includes the extent to which the stress testing program:

                                    (a)   Promotes risk identification and control, on a bank-wide basis;

                                    (b)   Adopts suitably severe assumptions and seeks to address feedback effects and
                                          system-wide interaction between risks;

                                    The supervisor requires corrective action if material deficiencies are identified in a bank’s
                                    stress testing program or if the results of stress tests are not adequately taken into
                                    consideration in the bank’s decision-making process.

Description and findings regarding The FSS has published guidance on stress testing by banks ‘Model Guidelines for Stress
EC13                               Testing’. As per the guidelines, banks should conduct stress testing of their risk mitigation
                                   and control systems and, where necessary, the adequacy of their internal capital. Through
                                   this exercise, banks will evaluate their vulnerability in the case of various scenarios.

EC14                                The supervisor assesses whether banks appropriately account for risks (including liquidity
                                    impacts) in their internal pricing, performance measurement and new product approval
                                    process for all significant business activities.

Description and findings regarding The main supervisory tools (RADARS & CAMELR) are used to assess banks’ use of risk
EC14                               measurements in setting interest rates and service fees, allowance for loan losses, capital
                                   allocation, and performance measurement. Banks are obliged to improve the reliability of
                                   their risk measurements. For this, the FSS monitors and verifies the following: (i) whether risk
                                   considerations are taken into account in a new product, interest rate decisions, capital
                                   allocation, and allowance for loan losses; (ii) whether there is an effective reporting system
                                   providing timely information to the senior management; and (iii) whether the bank operates
                                   with effective risk-adjusted performance measurement (RAPM) systems. For example, the
                                   market risk management function is responsible for both the validation of the new product
                                   pricing models and of the periodic estimation of the parameters underlying the model
                                   (correlations, volatilities). In addition, the new product procedures should define the
                                   interaction mechanisms among the bank’s functions involved in the introduction of new
                                   products, markets or activities, ensuring a correct management of risks, an accurate
                                   accounting representation and price adequacy.

Additional Criteria

AC1                                 The supervisor requires banks to have appropriate policies and processes for assessing
                                    other material risks not directly addressed in the subsequent Principles, such as reputational
                                    and strategic risks.

Description and findings regarding Annex 3 of the Detailed Regulations provides that banks must maintain appropriate internal
AC1                                capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) as set by the FSS. When assessing bank
                                   ICAAP, all bank risks—pillar 2 risks in addition to pillar 1 risks—must be taken into
                                   consideration.

Principle 16                         Capital adequacy.34 The supervisor sets prudent and appropriate capital adequacy
                                     requirements for banks that reflect the risks undertaken by, and presented by, a bank in the
                                     context of the markets and macroeconomic conditions in which it operates. The supervisor
                                     defines the components of capital, bearing in mind their ability to absorb losses. At least for
                                     internationally active banks, capital requirements are not less than the applicable Basel
                                     standards.

Essential Criteria

EC 1                                 Laws, regulations, or the supervisor require banks to calculate and consistently observe
                                     prescribed capital requirements, including thresholds by reference to which a bank might be
                                     subject to supervisory action. Laws, regulations or the supervisor define the qualifying
                                     components of capital, ensuring that emphasis is given to those elements of capital
                                     permanently available to absorb losses on a going concern basis.

Description and findings regarding The Banking Act (Article 34(2) and the Enforcement Decree (Article 1–2) provides for banks’
EC1                                capital adequacy. The Banking Act stipulates that banks will maintain soundness in their
                                   management of matters concerning proprietary capital. Under the Act, the FSC will enforce
                                   the minimum capital requirements of 8 percent risk-weighted assets and implement
                                   corrective action as per the framework described in CP11.



        34
          The Core Principles do not require a jurisdiction to comply with the capital adequacy regimes of Basel I, Basel II
        and/or Basel III. The Committee does not consider implementation of the Basel-based framework a prerequisite for
        compliance with the Core Principles, and compliance with one of the regimes is only required of those jurisdictions
        that have declared that they have voluntarily implemented it.

                                      Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

                                     The Enforcement Decree defines the components of the capital base for domestic banks.
                                     Core capital is the sum of amounts of capital, capital surplus and earned surplus, which
                                     incurs from the issuance of common stocks and equity securities that have been issued. The
                                     definition clearly refers to the ability for the capital instruments to absorb losses.
                                     Supplementary capital is defined as subordinated to core capital and available for losses
                                     incurred where a bank is liquidated.

                                     The minimum legal capital requirement is W 100 billion for a nation-wide commercial bank
                                     and 25 billion won for a regional bank. The FSS maintains consolidated and risk-adjusted
                                     capital standards as recommended by the BCBS (referred to the BIS ratio in the regulations
                                     and Article 26(2)). Korea adopted the first Basle Accord at the end of 1995 and the market
                                     risk amendment was implemented January 1, 2002. For the 18 domestic banks, the FSS uses
                                     the BII framework to calculate regulatory capital which was introduced in 2008. For the non-
                                     bank sector the FSS applies BI. The FSS also applies BI to bank Financial Holding Companies
                                     (hereafter FHCs). Each category of bank will be governed by an individual Act. For the
                                     commercial banks, the FSS adopted the Basel II.5 amendments for market risk in 2010 (with
                                     implementation in 2012).

                                     For the commercial banks the minimum capital requirement is 8 percent risk-weighted
                                     assets (RWAs). Tier 2 capital can be no more than 100 percent core equity capital which
                                     equates to a minimum of 4 percent, and there is no minimum common equity T1
                                     requirement. The average CIS ratio for the domestic banks as at December 2012 was
                                     14.30 percent.


                                     Foreign Bank Branches must have core operational funds of at least three billion won at the
                                     time of establishment. Branches must also keep a minimum 8 percent of capital ratio
                                     against risk weighted assets and a 10 percent reserve rule also applies (discussed later in the
                                     CP).

                                     How often banks need to calculate capital is uncertain within the regulations as there is no
                                     stipulation. In practice banks report capital quarterly as part of their prudential reporting
                                     obligations.

EC2                                  At least for internationally active banks,35 the definition of capital, the risk coverage, the
                                     method of calculation and thresholds for the prescribed requirements are not lower than
                                     those established in the applicable Basel standards.

Description and findings regarding The Regulations (Appendix 1) sets out the components of capital. Tier 1 Capital consists of:
EC2                                (i) capital (except cumulative preferred stocks and redeemable preferred stocks); (ii) capital
                                   surplus (excluding revaluation reserve); (iii) earned surplus (excluding cumulative amount of
                                   unrealized gain or loss of financial debt due to changes in credit risk of banks; (iv) exchange

        35
          The Basel Capital Accord was designed to apply to internationally active banks, which must calculate and apply
        capital adequacy ratios on a consolidated basis, including subsidiaries undertaking banking and financial business.
        Jurisdictions adopting the Basel II and Basel III capital adequacy frameworks would apply such ratios on a fully
        consolidated basis to all internationally active banks and their holding companies; in addition, supervisors must test
        that banks are adequately capitalized on a stand-alone basis.

                    from capital adjustment account; and (vi) hybrid bonds.

                    Tier 2 is composed of: (i) amount equivalent to 70 percent of the amount for which
                    dividend distribution is restricted due to the resolution of the board of directors, general
                    meeting of stockholders; (ii) revaluation reserve under the asset revaluation approach;
                    (iii) An amount equivalent to 45 percent of gains on valuation of securities available for sale
                    and gain on valuation of investment securities by the equity method and an amount

                    subordinated bond with maturity of 5 years or more and term subordinated loan with
                    maturity of 5 years or more.

                    Deductions consist of: (i) equivalent amount of goodwill, deferred income tax assets,
                    discount on stock issuance, evaluation loss; (from AOCI) of securities available for sale,
                    negative changes in equity accounted for by equity method and treasury stocks (deducted
                    from T1 capital); (ii) fund raised by stock cross held with other banks in order to enhance
                    equity capital ratio, debt capital instruments or term subordinated bond with maturity of 5
                    years or more (deducted from T1 capital); (iii) subordinated claim against financial
                    institutions determined by the Governor; and (iv) asset or capital item not appropriated for
                    loss of bank, determined by the Governor.

                    The method of deducting from capital for banks subject to the Basel II framework appeared
                    consistent with Basel II, that is, 100 percent from T1 capital for items such s goodwill etc. For
                    the FHCs that are subject to Basel I, the FSS has instructed the banks to deduct from T2 until
                    exhausted and then from T1. Guarantees under 10 percent of capital do not need to be
                    deducted from the capital base. The amortization schedule for T2 instruments with a
                    maturity of less than five years is 20 percent per year.

                    Capital is composed of the sum of Tier 1 and Supplementary Capital. Supplementary Capital
                    is limited to 100 percent of Tier 1 capital. As per the Detailed Regulations, Supplementary
                    capital and T3 capital appropriated for market risk cannot exceed 250 percent of the core
                    capital appropriated for market risk. Composed of T2 and T3 cannot be more than 250
                    percent of equity capital (Appendix 3–2, paragraph 6.B. (2)). The exact amount of T3 capital
                    was not able to be confirmed during the mission.

                    The inclusion of hybrid securities in T1 capital is limited to a maximum of 30 percent (or 15
                    percent if subject to a condition of raising interest rate) of equity capital (after subtracting
                    deductions). Hybrid securities exceeding the ceiling maybe included in the higher tier
                    supplementary (T2) capital (Appendix 1, Detailed Regulations, paragraph 6). Maximum
                    allowance for credit losses included in supplementary capital is 1.25 percent for
                    standardized banks and for an IRB bank maximum is 0.6 percent of RWAs if eligible credit
                    losses exceed expected loss (EP>EL).

                    Banks are required to notify the FSS prior to redeeming term subordinated debt (Appendix
                    1, paragraph 9) and will consult with the FSS prior to issuing capital instruments that will be
                    included in the definition of regulatory capital.

      Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

       To assess capital adequacy as part of the CAMELR methodology, the FSS uses a ratings
      schedule consisting of 15 grades from +1 to +5 (i.e., -1, 1 +1) with established benchmarks
      for comparison across the industry. For example, to assign a +1 CAMELR rating for capital
      total capital will need to exceed 12 percent RWAs. In practice, the ratings will not lead to a
      materially different supervisory approach by the FSS for oversight of capital. In arriving at
      the assessment of capital the supervisor takes into consideration a range of individual
      indicators and cohort analysis.

      The Regulations do not require the submission of a detailed capital management plan to
      the FSS, although if there is a need as a result of offsite analysis and concerns about the
      level of capital, the FSS will request capital plans. Banks report on a quarterly basis their
      capital ratios as part of the Business Reports with earnings information etc.

      Analysis of banks’ capital management plans was not systematic process and one which
      evaluated capital projections with consideration of all the underlying drivers and
      assumptions, for example: expected credit growth, RWAs, profitability, provision levels,
      dividend payments by subsidiaries etc.

      Offsite analysis includes detailed information regarding a bank’s capital adequacy which is
      compared across the peer group and through trend analysis. In terms of the quarterly
      analysis, they receive detailed information for the main Pillar 1 risks (operational, credit and
      market risks). The responsibility for conducting offsite analysis is distributed into several
      subject matter experts within the FSS, for example, separate teams will consider IRRBB,
      country and transfer risk, credit concentration and stress testing results etc. In practice, the
      process for incorporating the results into a single view of the sufficiency of capital is not as
      well developed.

       The requirement for banks to continuously monitor their capital adequacy ratios was not
      stipulated in the Regulations. Article 17(2) of the Detailed Regulations states that banks shall
      calculate the capital to risk-weighted assets ratio based on the numerical value as of the
      provisional settlement date or final settlement date. The lack of a requirement to calculate
      capital adequacy on a more frequent basis and continuously comply weakens the
      robustness of the capital framework.

      One unique exception to the definition of capital exists: The capital base for National
      Fisheries is a fund that technically is contributed from the central association and can be
      withdrawn. As a result, the capital base does not meet the perpetuity characteristic of capital
      as per the Basel guidelines.

      The FSS applies BII to the commercial banks, however, has not extended BII to FHCs which
      have commercial bank subsidiaries. At the FHC level, BI is applied to the FHCs. The Core
      Principles methodology requires internationally active banks in jurisdictions that are
      adopting BII to apply it to the bank and extend this treatment of calculating capital
      adequacy consistently to its holding company. The authorities plan to apply BII and BIII to
      FHC’s by 1 December 2013.

EC3   The supervisor has the power to impose a specific capital charge and/or limits on all
      material risk exposures, if warranted, including in respect of risks that the supervisor
      considers not to have been adequately transferred or mitigated through transactions (e.g.,



                                                                                         107

Description and findings regarding Pillar 2 of Basel II has not been fully implemented and all banks operate with a minimum
EC3                                capital ratio of 8 percent RWAs. Typically the FSS will encourage banks to establish capital
                                   buffers usually through a written letter, although the FSS does not have the power to set
                                   minimum capital ratios above the Basel 8 percent RWAs and all banks’ minimum capital
                                   ratio is 8 percent notwithstanding their risk profile. In this respect, the ability to enforce
                                   prudent capital buffers and triggers above the minimum is undermined. In addition,
                                   supervisory processes for assessing ICAAPs are only in an early stage of implementation
                                   (ICAAPs have not been received for FHCs).

                                      While all banks operate with a minimum of 8 percent capital, the FSS has attempted to
                                      encourage banks to operate with prudent capital buffers.

EC4                                   The prescribed capital requirements reflect the risk profile and systemic importance of
                                      banks37 in the context of the markets and macroeconomic conditions in which they operate
                                      and constrain the build-up of leverage in banks and the banking sector. Laws and
                                      regulations in a particular jurisdiction may set higher overall capital adequacy standards
                                      than the applicable Basel requirements.

Description and findings regarding The regulatory level of capital is not higher than the minimum Basel requirement, but banks’
EC4                                capital adequacy is verified with reference to both regulatory capital and internal capital,
                                   taking into account the composition and the level of own funds.

                                      A requirement with approbation of net profit earned in a business year calls for banks to
                                      credit at least 10 percent of net profit to a legal reserve until it accumulates to a level equal
                                      to the total paid-in capital. This legal reserve requirement compels banks to grow the core
                                      capital composition of the capital base. In addition, the FSS recommends banks which have
                                      an equity to assets ratio less than 5.5 percent to reserve 10 percent of net profit. Both
                                      mechanisms help to encourage organic growth in the capital base.

                                      In relation to domestic systemically important banks, currently no formal framework to
                                      identify D-SIBs exists and capital requirements do not reflect systemic characteristics of
                                      banking groups. However, the FSS plans to implement the D-SIB framework as promulgated
                                      by the BCBS commencing 2016.

          In assessing the adequacy of a bank’s capital levels in light of its risk profile, the supervisor critically focuses,
        among other things, on (a) the potential loss absorbency of the instruments included in the bank’s capital base; (b)
        the appropriateness of risk weights as a proxy for the risk profile of its exposures; (c) the adequacy of provisions and
        reserves to cover loss expected on its exposures; and (d) the quality of its risk management and controls.
        Consequently, capital requirements may vary from bank to bank to ensure that each bank is operating with the
        appropriate level of capital to support the risks it is running and the risks it poses.

Description and findings regarding The current framework offers both Standardized and Advanced model approaches for
EC5                                credit, market and operational risk. The various approaches are available to different
                                   institutions, considering their size, sophistication and systemic importance. In terms of the
                                   advanced approaches, 7 banks have been authorized to use internal models for market risk,
                                   11 banks authorized to use IRB, 5 authorized to use AMA.

                                    The Regulations stipulate the minimum expectations and qualifying criteria for
                                    accreditation. For IRB as an example, banks applying for the advanced approach to IRB will
                                    need to submit a suite of documents including: current status of the bank; implementation
                                    plan; an internal audit report; self assessment of compliance with the criteria; and other
                                    associated material (Detailed Regulations Appendix 1, paragraph 106). A two year parallel
                                    run will be performed by the bank and submitted to the FSS with associated analysis. Similar
                                    qualifying criteria is replicated for AMA and market risk.

                                    Processes within the FSS to verify on a continuous basis banks’ compliance with the
                                    minimum criteria is not well established. The responsibility for approving AMA models rests
                                    within the BCBS team, however, changes to internal models is the responsibility of the Bank
                                    Examination Team. For credit and market risk the decision is centralized within the BCBS
                                    team.

                                    No examples where the FSS imposes additional conditions with reference to some aspects
                                    of the process or model not perfectly coherent with the complexity and the risk profile of
                                    the bank. In the event banks are assessed not to have met the minimum criteria, the FSS can
                                    revoke accreditation.

                                    Validation is an important aspect of the FSS’s controls on the integrity of estimates
                                    produced by internal models users. Validation is required to be performed by an
                                    independent unit within the bank and is submitted to the FSS three months after the end of
                                    financial year. However, the refresh of the new estimates, model parameters and risk factors

EC6                                       The supervisor has the power to require banks to adopt a forward-looking approach to
                                          capital management (including the conduct of appropriate stress testing).38 The supervisor
                                          has the power to require banks:

                                          (a)   To set capital levels and manage available capital in anticipation of possible events or
                                                changes in market conditions that could have an adverse effect; and
                                          (b)   To have in place feasible contingency arrangements to maintain or strengthen capital
                                                positions in times of stress, as appropriate in the light of the risk profile and systemic
                                                importance of the bank.

Description and findings regarding Banks submit the results of stress tests semi annually to a centralized team within the BCBS
EC6                                team in the Bank & Non-Banking Supervision Division. The BCBS team will receive only the
                                   annual plan but also the six monthly stress test reports. Stress testing guidelines have been
                                   circulated to industry based on the BCBS guidance. A checklist is used to verify compliance
                                   and capital numbers are verified. In practice, the FSS encourages banks to apply a forward
                                   looking approach to capital management where stress testing informs the adequacy of
                                   capital. The FSS has also performed specific stress testing exercises where the external
                                   environment has deteriorated. While the FSS has the power to require banks to perform
                                   stress testing, the outcomes of the periodic stress test exercises are not linked to the FSS

AC1                                       For non-internationally active banks, capital requirements, including the definition of capital,
                                          the risk coverage, the method of calculation, the scope of application and the capital
                                          required, are broadly consistent with the principles of the applicable Basel standards
                                          relevant to internationally active banks.

Essential Criteria

EC1                                     Laws, regulations or the supervisor require banks to have appropriate credit risk
                                        management processes that provide a comprehensive bank-wide view of credit risk
                                        exposures. The supervisor determines that the processes are consistent with the risk
                                        appetite, risk profile, systemic importance and capital strength of the bank, take into
                                        account market and macroeconomic conditions and result in prudent standards of credit
                                        underwriting, evaluation, administration and monitoring.

Description and findings regarding Banks are required to have in place appropriate tools to identify, measure, monitor, and
EC1                                control credit risk and manage capital adequacy (Article 30, Regulations). The FSS assesses
                                   the adequacy of banks’ internal assessments of risks and capital and reflects the results of
                                   these assessments in its supervision of banks.

                                      measuring, evaluating, monitoring, reporting and controlling or mitigating credit risk
                                      (including counterparty credit risk and associated potential future exposure) and that these
                                      are consistent with the risk appetite set by the Board. The supervisor also determines that

                                      senior management implements the credit risk strategy approved by the Board and
                                      develops the aforementioned policies and processes.

Description and findings regarding Article 30 of the Regulations establishes the minimum expectations for banks to implement
EC2                                a risk management system for the timely recognition, assessment, monitoring and control
                                   of various risks in all kinds of transactions and for evaluating and managing these risks
                                   against capital. Under Article 31, the Board of Directors is responsible for: (i) establishing a
                                   basic policy on risk management consistent with management strategy; (ii) determination of
                                   risk levels; (iii) approval of risk limits and thresholds; and (iv) establishment and revision of
                                   regulations on risk management. While the Board is responsible for establishing the policies
                                   and procedures for credit risk, the continuous oversight is not mandated.

                                       In regards to IRB accredited banks, the Detailed Regulations provide for a complete list of
                                      minimum expectations for the credit risk management framework. All critical aspects of a
                                      comprehensive framework are prescribed by the Regulations including: validation of credit
                                      management system; maintenance of management data; integrity of rating procedure;
                                      documentation and design of the credit assessment system, use of the model and stress
                                      testing. However, Board approval of policies in relation to the framework is not stipulated.
                                      The onsite examination will review the full suite of Board resolutions over a two year period
                                      to assess whether policies and procedures have been approved by the Board.

EC3                                   The supervisor requires, and regularly determines, that such policies and processes establish
                                      an appropriate and properly controlled credit risk environment, including:

                                      (a)    A well documented and effectively implemented strategy and sound policies and
                                             processes for assuming credit risk, without undue reliance on external credit
                                             assessments;

                                      (b)    Well defined criteria and policies and processes for approving new exposures
                                             (including prudent underwriting standards) as well as for renewing and refinancing


        43
          “Assuming” includes the assumption of all types of risk that give rise to credit risk, including credit risk or
        counterparty risk associated with various financial instruments.

Description and findings regarding The FSS has in place effective policies and procedures to assess credit risks of banks
EC3                                through the onsite examination CAMELR regime and through quarterly monitoring of a
                                   bank’s Business Reports with detailed submission of credit risk information.

                                   In conducting the onsite review, FSS staff will review Board Minutes and minutes of the
                                   Board Risk Committee. Information about credit extended by the bank will be used to
                                   identify loans for file reviews where staff will assess various aspects of the credit risk
                                   framework. Staff will assess risk budgeting for all relevant departments to determine how
                                   banks have set return hurdles and risk thresholds. Observance with credit limits will be
                                   assessed and whether risk management has performed an effective tertiary oversight.
                                   Overrides and exceptions will be assessed for compliance with credit standards.

                                   To evaluate risk governance, staff will examine risk reports (typically monthly) circulated
                                   through senior management. If risk settings have been changed, staff will assess whether
                                   the changes to credit underwriting standards is within acceptable limits set by the Board.
                                   When sampling credit files, staff will pay particular attention to reviewing the capacity to
                                   repay assessment and the valuation. The Regulations prescribe Loan-To-Value and Debt-To-
                                   Income ratios and other restrictions on granting housing loans (Article 29–2) and FSS staff
                                   will examine compliance with these ratios.

                                   The size of the file sample for full scope onsite examinations will cover approximately 20– 30
                                   percent of total loans (by asset size) and include a review of 80–90 borrowers (FSS
                                   examiners are onsite for approximately 20 days).

                                    Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

                                    The FSS will verify the ability of the information management system to provide adequate
                                    reporting to senior management that includes portfolio metrics of asset soundness and
                                    forward looking metrics of vintage analysis.

EC4                                 The supervisor determines that banks have policies and processes to monitor the total
                                    indebtedness of entities to which they extend credit and any risk factors that may result in
                                    default including significant unhedged FX risk.

Description and findings re EC4     The Detailed Regulations set out the minimum expectations for bank’s internal
                                    management systems to continuously monitor changes in risk status of borrowers (Article
                                    48 (2)). In practice, banks are expected to have in place lending limits for different borrower
                                    classes and to maintain lending administration systems that can easily aggregate a
                                    borrowers total indebtedness for a comprehensive loan assessment which would include
                                    direct credit exposures as well as FX, derivatives and contingent loans (such as guarantees).
                                    Supervisors will assess the accuracy and limit compliance as part of the onsite examination.

EC5                                 The supervisor requires that banks make credit decisions free of conflicts of interest and on
                                    an arm’s length basis.

Description and findings regarding Clear guidance in the Banking Act (paragraph 34-2(8) provides for ensuring credit decisions
EC5                                are free from conflicts of interest and extended on an arm’s length basis in relation to
                                   shareholders, but more generally in relation to all other credits, the Regulations are not
                                   prescriptive. Conflicts can arise from a variety of sources, one of which is granting
                                   shareholders credit. There is no provision in the rules for banks to define internal
                                   procedures for director loans, or other related party loans and ensure that appropriate risk
                                   management like segregation of approval, escalation and reporting is applied. In practice,
                                   the full scope onsite review is a thorough exercise reviewing loan files and obtaining
                                   detailed data of credits extended by banks.

EC6                                 The supervisor requires that the credit policy prescribes that major credit risk exposures
                                    exceeding a certain amount or percentage of the bank’s capital are to be decided by the
                                    bank’s Board or senior management. The same applies to credit risk exposures that are
                                    especially risky or otherwise not in line with the mainstream of the bank’s activities.

Description and findings regarding As per Article 35–2 of the Banking Act, where a bank intends to extend its large
EC6                                stockholders credit of not less than 0.1 percent of equity capital or W 5 billion, it shall
                                   undergo resolution thereon by the board of directors, in advance. In such cases, the
                                   resolution shall be passed by an affirmative vote of all incumbent members of the board of
                                   directors.

                                    In terms of Large Exposures, Article 35 of the Banking Act sets the limit on single borrower
                                    credit exposures for banks, but it does not explicitly require Board approval. For large
                                    credits that do not reach the LE threshold, the Regulations do not have a requirement for
                                    banks to establish a delegations register and that the register is being adhered to. In this
                                    respect, the role of the Board and senior management to oversee this aspect of credit risk is
                                    not prescribed.

                                   bank is extensive and based on this information; files will be selected for review.

EC7                                The supervisor has full access to information in the credit and investment portfolios and to
                                   the bank officers involved in assuming, managing, controlling and reporting on credit risk.

Description and findings regarding Article 48, of the Banking Act allows Bank supervisors the legal authority to request
EC7                                information on a bank’s operation and assets, and to question and interview bank officers.
                                   Prior to the full scope CAMELR onsite examination, the FSS receives a broad range of data
                                   across all portfolios of the banking book and investment portfolios broken down into sub
                                   portfolios and with detailed information for each portfolio such as: borrowers name, type of
                                   loan, length of loan, amount, collateral value, name of external appraisal, LTV, DTI etc.
                                   Access to data is unfettered.

EC8                                The supervisor requires banks to include their credit risk exposures into their stress testing
                                   programs for risk management purposes.

Description and findings re EC8    For banks that are accredited as IRB, there is an obligation to conduct regular stress tests in
                                   a conservative manner, considering a mild recession scenario, for credit exposures to assess
                                   impacts on the required equity capital under the IRB approach (Detailed Regulations,
                                   paragraphs 166 and 167, Annex 3). For banks that are not IRB accredited the requirement to
                                   perform a regular stress test is not prescriptive. Of course banks do need to perform a stress
                                   test as part of the ICAAP. The FSS has issued a guideline on Stress Testing which
                                   recommends banks to conduct stress testing to assess capital adequacy by taking into
                                   account incidents or changes in the future economic conditions that can have adverse effect
                                   on its credit risks.

Assessment of Principle 17         LC

Comment                            Main factors driving the rating:

                                           Greater focus on independent valuations; and

                                           More frequent onsite credit risk examinations for the larger systemic banks to
                                            accurately assess credit underwriting standards and identify adjustments in risk-
                                            taking behavior.

                                   As in most banking systems, credit risk is the most relevant risk in the banking system in
                                   South Korea. Moreover, current macroeconomic conditions are somewhat challenging in
                                   this part of the credit cycle with an upward trend in unemployment and past due loans,
                                   albeit off a low base. Potentially vulnerable credits could exist in performing credit
                                   portfolios. As a result, compliance with this Principle is critical. The FSS appears fully aware
                                   of the vulnerabilities that current developments on credit risk entail for the financial system,
                                   and monitors data carefully on a quarterly basis. Owing to the importance of effective credit
                                   risk management, the team believes greater attention to this area is warranted.

                                   The team recommends that the FSS increase its attention to on-site inspections of credit

Essential Criteria

EC1                                  Laws, regulations or the supervisor require banks to formulate policies and processes for
                                     identifying and managing problem assets. In addition, laws, regulations or the supervisor
                                     require regular review by banks of their problem assets (at an individual level or at a
                                     portfolio level for assets with homogenous characteristics) and asset classification,
                                     provisioning and write-offs.

Description and findings regarding Under Article 27 of the Regulations banks shall categorize all loans into five categories
EC1                                (normal, precautionary, substandard, doubtful and presumed loss) based on borrower’s
                                   debt servicing ability and credit history. The regulations explicitly provide for the FSS to
                                   require banks to write-off bad assets if needed, and oversee adequacy of asset classification,
                                   provisioning and write-off through bank examinations which is a strong feature of the
                                   regulations. The Regulations do not, however, contain a comprehensive set of provisions for
                                   the identification and management of problem loans. Importantly, expectations for
                                   continuous credit risk monitoring and valuation of collateral needs to be developed further.

                                     In terms of the management of problem assets, the Regulations require banks to operate an
                                     internal control system that is independently operated by a credit review function and to
                                     maintain a suitable early write-off policy for assets classified as “doubtful” and “presumed
                                     loss.”

                                     The Regulations prescribe assets that are subject to asset classification for the purpose of
                                     provisioning, including: (i) claims such as loans, advance for payments on guarantees etc;
                                     (ii) payment guarantee, the principal liability of which is fixed; (iii) securities; (iv) lease assets;
                                     and (v) suspense received or amount receivable; (vi) interest receivable; and (vii) other assets
                                     recognized by a bank to be in need of forward looking criteria (Article 28).




        44
          Principle 17 covers the evaluation of assets in greater detail; Principle 18 covers the management of problem
        assets.
        45
          Reserves for the purposes of this Principle are “below the line” non-distributable appropriations of profit required
        by a supervisor in addition to provisions (“above the line” charges to profit).

                                    Article 29 stipulates the calculation of allowance for credit loss based on the five categories
                                    for loans by the type of asset class. The schedule for loan loss provisioning is as follows:

                                        0.85/100 for normal loans (0.9/100 for construction loans; wholesale and retail trade;
                                         hotels and restaurants and rental businesses);

                                        7/100 precautionary; and

                                        20/100 substandard;

                                        50/100 doubtful; and

                                        100/100 presumed loss.

                                    A slightly more conservative approach is applied to residential mortgage loans which
                                    increase the credit loss provisioning for normal to 1/100 and doubtful to 55/100 reflecting a
                                    more conservative approach and potential greater volatility in the asset prices realized in a
                                    forced sale. Credit cards also have a bespoke schedule for provisions which is more
                                    conservative: Normal (1.1/100); Precautionary (40/100); Substandard (60/100); Doubtful
                                    (75/100); and Presumed loss 100/100. Cash advances and revolving credit have an even
                                    more conservative schedule.

                                    For assets that are guaranteed by the Government or directly extended to the Government,
                                    a 0 percent for Normal is applied.

                                    In transitioning to IFRS, a reserve for Credit Loss was introduced to prevent a decrease of
                                    banks’ loss absorbent capacity caused by the change of loan loss reserve standard
                                    according to KIFRS. The reserve for credit loss is calculated by deducting accounting
                                    reserves from regulatory reserves. Regulatory reserves are determined based on the level of
                                    the larger of the minimum regulatory ratios or the expected loss under IRB approach.
                                    The definition of default differs between the domestic banks and non-banks. For domestic
                                    banks (and FHCs) the default is 90 days past due whereas for non-banks it is 180 days past
                                    due. The FSS plans to reconcile this difference with the non-bank definition to be
                                    harmonized by 2017. (Article 172 of the Detailed Regulations provides for a comprehensive
                                    definition of default for banks).

EC2                                 The supervisor determines the adequacy of a bank’s policies and processes for grading and
                                    classifying its assets and establishing appropriate and robust provisioning levels. The
                                    reviews supporting the supervisor’s opinion may be conducted by external experts, with the
                                    supervisor reviewing the work of the external experts to determine the adequacy of the
                                    bank’s policies and processes

Description and findings regarding Banks must establish internal rules on asset classification, provisioning, credit rating model
EC2                                consistent with the banking laws. Asset classification must take into account borrower’s debt
                                   servicing ability. Bank supervisors determine the adequacy of asset classification,
                                   provisioning and bad-debt write-offs and takes supervisory actions if weaknesses are
                                   identified. Through CAMEL-R ratings, the FSS determines the objectivity and adequacy of
                                   internal rules and internal controls necessary for an independent inspection of bank lending
                                   activities.

                                      Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

                                     Establishing prudent provisioning levels requires a robust classification system of assets
                                     (portfolio or individual) timely recognition of default—definitions and characteristics, sound
                                     collateral management processes to ascribe collateral to loans correctly, value collateral
                                     (including the sound and prudent valuation of security); etc,. When the FSS introduced the
                                     forward looking criteria for credit losses in 1999 thematic examinations were performed
                                     throughout 2000. Since that time, the main focus of surveillance has been through
                                     individual bank examinations and offsite surveillance. The approach for FHCs is to
                                     concentrate on the asset profile of the major banking subsidiaries and banks. Specific focus
                                     on bank’s collateral management systems was not a feature of the onsite examination,
                                     offsite surveillance or thematic reviews and the assessor was unable to determine the
                                     integrity of banks systems to assign and identify collateral that has previously been pledged
                                     for other facilities. Bank internal controls could not be confirmed.

                                     During full scope onsite examinations, FSS staff assesses a large cross section of files of a
                                     significantly large sample of individual loans, including the highest risk exposures. In
                                     particular, loans are selected on the basis of judgmental criteria and/or by means of
                                     statistical sampling. The sample size is related to the risk exposure, the reliability of bank’s
                                     data and quality of internal controls. The analysis aims to verify whether the bank’s
                                     classification and valuation decisions comply with the legislative framework in force as well
                                     as internal regulation.

                                     To assess valuations, FSS staff will evaluate market indices used by banks for valuation
                                     purposes and if they detect a material difference from other benchmarks, the matter will be
                                     investigated. It was explained that banks put in much effort to put in fair value for collateral
                                     —they use the housing price survey price by Kumin Bank. For commercial property, the
                                     valuation will be a mix of indices and independent appraisal.

                                     As part of offsite monitoring, staff assess trends in measures and ratios related to problem
                                     assets and provisions, also through comparisons among banks with similar organizational
                                     and risk profiles. This analysis heavily leverages on detailed information of peer benchmarks
                                     and loss history.

EC3                                  The supervisor determines that the bank’s system for classification and provisioning takes
                                     into account off-balance sheet exposures.46

Description and findings regarding Under the Regulations, the credit loss schedule prescribed by the FSS is applied to the
EC3                                unused commitment of various facilities as of the settlement date (Article 28, paragraph 6).
                                   Thus, banks are required to classify off-balance sheet exposures, including outstanding
                                   guarantees, under the same standards applied to regular loans and to establish provisioning
                                   for those items by applying credit conversion factor.

                                     For off-balance sheet exposures, the method to calculate the value of the exposure is by
                                     multiplying a credit conversion factor plus the provision required under Article 29 of the


        46
          It is recognized that there are two different types of off-balance sheet exposures: those that can be unilaterally
        cancelled by the bank (based on contractual arrangements and therefore may not be subject to provisioning), and
        those that cannot be unilaterally cancelled.

                                    Regulations. For securitized assets the FSS categorizes these as commitments or guarantees,
                                    applying a 50 percent CCF. For project financing related exposures that have ABCP they
                                    apply 100 percent CCF (this guidance has not been included in Regulations per se, but
                                    issued a guidance note to banks 8 March 2010). Note, it was advised that this guidance was
                                    classified as Administrative Guidance Note which has the force of the Regulations and will
                                    trigger the same level of sanctions if breached as in banking Act etc.

EC4                                 The supervisor determines that banks have appropriate policies and processes to ensure
                                    that provisions and write-offs are timely and reflect realistic repayment and recovery
                                    expectations, taking into account market and macroeconomic conditions.

Description and findings regarding Where events with an adverse effect on bank credit risk or deterioration of economic
EC4                                conditions require additional loss absorbing capacity, the FSC can make amendments to the
                                   Regulations to adjust standards on asset classification and supervisory provisioning to
                                   reflect changes in the market and economic conditions. For instance, an amendment to
                                   credit loss schedule which is prescribed by the FSS in the Regulations. Based on recent
                                   evidence, this process would not be protracted. The FSS has the power to require banks to
                                   revise the adequacy of asset classification, provisioning and bad-debt write-offs and takes
                                   supervisory actions if weaknesses are identified (Regulations, Articles 28 and 29).

                                    In the most recent example of the problems experienced in the Mutual Savings bank sector
                                    in 2010, FSS staff assessed the asset quality of banks through a rigorous process and
                                    involved instructing MSBs to reclassify loans from performing status (Normal and
                                    precautionary to substandard). FSS performed their own valuation of collateral for large
                                    assets (many of which were project financing and construction loans where the economic
                                    feasibility of the project was considered uneconomic against the debt profile).

                                    Asset soundness is an integral component of the CAMELR onsite examination. Through on-
                                    site examinations FSS examiners will verify that policies and procedures on provisioning and
                                    write-offs are designed in such a way so as to encompass and to take into account all
                                    relevant factors. In analyzing the selected sample of individual loans, staff will assess
                                    whether banks have appropriate policies and procedures to ensure that loan-loss provisions
                                    and write-offs reflect realistic repayment expectations.

EC5                                 The supervisor determines that banks have appropriate policies and processes, and
                                    organizational resources for the early identification of deteriorating assets, for ongoing
                                    oversight of problem assets, and for collecting on past due obligations. For portfolios of
                                    credit exposures with homogeneous characteristics, the exposures are classified when
                                    payments are contractually in arrears for a minimum number of days (e.g. 30, 60, 90 days).
                                    The supervisor tests banks’ treatment of assets with a view to identifying any material
                                    circumvention of the classification and provisioning standards (e.g. rescheduling, refinancing
                                    or reclassification of loans).

Description and findings regarding Article 48 of the Detailed Regulations sets out the requirements for banks to have an
EC5                                adequate management of credit risks, a loan administration framework which includes the
                                   following components: (i) on-going monitoring of changes in borrower credit risk; (ii) credit
                                   rating system for regular adjustments of borrower credit score and appropriate follow-up
                                   actions; (iii) early warning system for management of at-risk borrowers; (iv) audits to

                                     insolvent companies. The process to test banks’ treatment of assets to identify examples of
                                     mis-classification is mainly through the full scope examination which occurs every two years.

EC6                                  The supervisor obtains information on a regular basis, and in relevant detail, or has full
                                     access to information concerning the classification of assets and provisioning. The
                                     supervisor requires banks to have adequate documentation to support their classification
                                     and provisioning levels.

Description and findings regarding Articles 18 of the Regulations require banks to submit on a regular basis (quarterly) Business
EC6                                Reports on asset classification and provisioning and to have adequate documentation on
                                   asset classification and provisioning standards. Data submitted by the banks is both
                                   comprehensive and detailed and include a number of different metrics to support the
                                   classification such as repayment capacity and value of collateral.

                                     Policies and procedures are reviewed as part of the full scope onsite examination performed
                                     every two years. Outside of the onsite, limited examples of qualitative information received
                                     by the supervisor to assess adequacy of documentation, application of policies and
                                     processes by the bank such as internal audit reports etc.

EC7                                  The supervisor assesses whether the classification of the assets and the provisioning is
                                     adequate for prudential purposes. If asset classifications are inaccurate or provisions are
                                     deemed to be inadequate for prudential purposes (e.g. if the supervisor considers existing
                                     or anticipated deterioration in asset quality to be of concern or if the provisions do not fully
                                     reflect losses expected to be incurred), the supervisor has the power to require the bank to
                                     adjust its classifications of individual assets, increase its levels of provisioning, reserves or
                                     capital and, if necessary, impose other remedial measures.

Description and findings regarding FSS examiners conduct off-site monitoring and on-site examination to assess whether asset
EC7                                classifications and provisioning are adequate. In case the classification is not adequate for
                                   certain assets, bank supervisors may order the bank to reclassify the assets and make
                                   additional provisioning. The Regulations are sufficiently prescriptive for the supervisor to
                                   ensure banks fully reflect losses in the amount of provisions. The experience of the MSBs in
                                   2010 demonstrates that the FSS is willing and capable to exercise this discretion.

EC8                                  The supervisor requires banks to have appropriate mechanisms in place for regularly
                                     assessing the value of risk mitigants, including guarantees, credit derivatives and collateral.
                                     The valuation of collateral reflects the net realizable value, taking into account prevailing
                                     market conditions.

Description and findings regarding Risk mitigants including bank guarantees, credit derivatives and collateral can be taken into
EC8                                account in the calculation of risk-weighted assets only when they meet certain qualification
                                   criteria (Annex 3, chapter 6 Detailed Regulations). Collateral value is defined as the fair value
                                   of the collateral less applicable haircut rate determined by factoring in price volatilities.
                                   Collateral value must be monitored at least once a year. Financial guarantees are permitted
                                   under the Regulations and there is no guidance regarding the frequency of revaluation. In
                                   practice, the FSS only allows financial guarantees that are domestic government bonds.

                                          reason to believe that all amounts due, including principal and interest, will not be
                                          collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement); and

                                    (b)   Reclassified as performing (e.g. a loan is reclassified as performing when all arrears
                                          have been cleared and the loan has been brought fully current, repayments have been
                                          made in a timely manner over a continuous repayment period and continued
                                          collection, in accordance with the contractual terms, is expected).

Description and findings regarding Banks are required to classify a loan as non-performing if it finds reasonable grounds to
EC9                                believe that the principal and interest will not be collected according to contract terms
                                   based on banks’ assessment of borrower’s future debt servicing ability. A bank’s credit
                                   rating model must take into account factors that affect debt servicing ability such as
                                   counterparty’s industry risk, management risk, financial soundness, and cash flow.

                                    The Regulations allow banks considerable flexibility when returning exposures from
                                    restructured to performing status. Appendix 13 of the Detailed Regulations allows
                                    restructuring of loans back to performing without the borrower having proved repayment
                                    capacity under revised terms. On this issue, the FSS issued an ‘Administrative Note’ to
                                    industry in 2009 to clarify expectations. Under the Regulations, banks will decide whether to
                                    classify a loan as normal based on their own internal policies. For example, one of the
                                    criteria allows a customer to return to performing status if they are considered able to pay
                                    the principal and interest because his/her ability to repay debts has been improved
                                    considering their business performance or financial status and future cash flow. In this
                                    circumstance, the borrower has not demonstrated an ability to meet agreed repayment
                                    amounts but the loan has been re-aged and classified as ‘Normal’.

EC10                                The supervisor determines that the bank’s Board obtains timely and appropriate information
                                    on the condition of the bank’s asset portfolio, including classification of assets, the level of
                                    provisions and reserves and major problem assets. The information includes, at a minimum,
                                    summary results of the latest asset review process, comparative trends in the overall quality
                                    of problem assets, and measurements of existing or anticipated deterioration in asset
                                    quality and losses expected to be incurred.

Description and findings re EC10    Banks are required to report to the Board matters that are in relation to a range of activities
                                    under the bank’s control i.e. transfer, mergers, internal control standards (Article 23–2) of
                                    the Banking Act. Article 34 of the Act is more prescriptive and stipulates that banks shall
                                    observe sound management of “soundness in assets”. Articles 29, 30, and 31 of the
                                    Regulations establish the Board’s role in the overall risk management system. However, the
                                    Act and Regulations do not provide guidance as to minimum reporting to the Board
                                    regarding loan loss provisions, asset classification or reserves.

EC11                                The supervisor requires that valuation, classification and provisioning, at least for significant
                                    exposures, are conducted on an individual item basis. For this purpose, supervisors require
                                    banks to set an appropriate threshold for the purpose of identifying significant exposures
                                    and to regularly review the level of the threshold.

EC11                                billion won depending on bank sizes). The FSS has provided guidance to banks in December
                                    2011 to categorize loans which are impaired to be individually assessed. Through this
                                    exercise, banks were grouped into four categories:

                                    Group 1: Hana, KB, Woori Shinhan, KEB;

                                    Group 2: Citi Bank, Standard Chartered, KB;

                                    Group 3: National Fisheries, Industrial Bank, Industrial Credit Cooperative, Import Export,
                                    KDB; and

                                    Group 4: All others banks.

                                    The FSS applied various thresholds to each group and any exposure which exceeded the
                                    threshold would require the amount to be individually assessed.

                                    To accurately calculate loan loss provisions, an independent valuation of collateral
                                    supporting the exposure when default occurs (classified as substandard) is critical. Where
                                    this does not occur, there is a risk that actual loan loss provisions is not based on actual
                                    realizable value.

EC12                                The supervisor regularly assesses any trends and concentrations in risk and risk build-up
                                    across the banking sector in relation to banks’ problem assets and takes into account any
                                    observed concentration in the risk mitigation strategies adopted by banks and the potential
                                    effect on the efficacy of the mitigant in reducing loss. The supervisor considers the
                                    adequacy of provisions and reserves at the bank and banking system level in the light of this
                                    assessment.

Description and findings regarding The FSS regularly analyzes banks’ delinquency rate on a monthly basis and non-performing
EC12                               loans on a quarterly frequency. In the case of retail mortgage exposures, there is a culture of
                                   assisting borrowers to return to performing status. In the case of medium to large
                                   borrowers where exposures are syndicated, banks will participate in evaluating the ability to
                                   rehabilitate the borrower and enter a work-out arrangement. If banks have to take residual
                                   risks after the sale of a problem asset, banks are required to include this in the computation
                                   of their BIS capital ratios.

Assessment of Principle 18          MNC

Comments                            The FSS does not meet EC9 as the regulations allow banks considerable discretion when
                                    reclassifying exposures as performing. The regulations permit the reclassification of loans to
                                    performing without the borrower having proved repayment capacity under revised terms.
                                    While the FSS has increased its oversight of banks’ application of internal politics for
                                    reclassification of assets, a greater amount of supervisory attention is required to ensure
                                    banks’ apply appropriate risk management around this process. Attention to this aspect of
                                    provisioning should be enhanced, especially in the current credit cycle.

                                    Supervisory oversight of collateral valuation practices for defaulted loans needs greater
                                    attention. While the FSS implemented thresholds in December 2011 for exposures to be
                                    individual assessed and managed, greater supervisory attention is needed to ensure banks
                                    are applying the thresholds appropriately. In practice, internal bank officers are

                                     across the major banks leading to potential inconsistencies and weaknesses. Prudent
                                     collateral valuation processes are necessary to help ensure adequacy of provisions. For the
                                     mortgage portfolios of banks (particularly inner-city apartments), collateral is re-valued on a
                                     regular basis against a market index (where available). Regulations stipulate at least
                                     quarterly re-valuation of collateral, and industry practice is generally monthly. In a reducing
                                     asset price environment, more frequent valuations are prudent, however, in a rising asset
                                     price environment this practice will lower the average portfolio LTV and raise collateral
                                     coverage against provisions through no change in debt reduction or increase in provisions
                                     respectively.

                                     Contributing to the rating is a lack of consistency in the definition of default between the
                                     commercial banking sector and non-banks. The definition of default differs across deposit
                                     taking institutions (mainly the domestic banks and non-banks). For domestic banks it is 90
                                     days past due whereas for non-banks it is 180 days.

Principle 19                         Concentration risk and large exposure limits. The supervisor determines that banks have
                                     adequate policies and processes to identify, measure, evaluate, monitor, report and control
                                     or mitigate concentrations of risk on a timely basis. Supervisors set prudential limits to
                                     restrict bank exposures to single counterparties or groups of connected counterparties.47

Essential Criteria

EC1                                  Laws, regulations or the supervisor require banks to have policies and processes that
                                     provide a comprehensive bank-wide view of significant sources of concentration risk.48
                                     Exposures arising from off-balance sheet as well as on-balance sheet items and from
                                     contingent liabilities are captured.

Description and findings regarding The requirements for banks to have policies and processes for extending large credit
EC1                                exposures exists under the Regulation of Banking (Article 76). In addition to principles for
                                   credit risk management (contained within Article 78, paragraph 5 of the Regulations) banks
                                   are required to prevent loan concentration of credit extension by industries and customer
                                   groups. As part of bank ICAAP, banks are required to identify credit concentration risks
                                   (paragraph 260 of the Detailed Regulations).

                                     Banks are required to establish internal guidelines for management and control of large
                                     credit extensions (RSBB Art 76 paragraph 2) including:


        47
          Connected counterparties may include natural persons as well as a group of companies related financially or by
        common ownership, management or any combination thereof.
        48
           This includes credit concentrations through exposure to: single counterparties and groups of connected
        counterparties both direct and indirect (such as through exposure to collateral or to credit protection provided by a
        single counterparty), counterparties in the same industry, economic sector or geographic region and counterparties
        whose financial performance is dependent on the same activity or commodity as well as off-balance sheet exposures
        (including guarantees and other commitments) and also market and other risk concentrations where a bank is overly
        exposed to particular asset classes, products, collateral, or currencies.




                                                                                                                        123

                        An automated management information system to monitor the LE at all times; and

                        A system to detect LEs to control and prevent LE being extended.

                    A large exposure is defined as 10 per cent of the relevant bank’s equity capital (Banking Act,
                    Article 35(4)). In terms of monitoring, banks are required to assess its Large Exposures (LEs)
                    based on the balance at the end of every month and will submit a report to the FSS every
                    quarter.

                    For single name concentration, Article 35(1)–(4) of the Banking Act sets the limit on
                    borrower credit exposures for banks:

                        Single name (individual or connected individuals) credit exposures must not exceed 20
                         percent of bank me (individual); and

                        Credit exposures to a single enterprise (an enterprise group) must not exceed
                         25 percent of bank’s capital.

                    The treatment of connected counterparties is defined under the Fair Trade Act where banks
                    will obtain guidance for whether exposures to separate individuals or customers should be
                    aggregated for the purpose of calculating LEs. The definition of borrower refers to (the
                    same individual, corporation or person) categorized as “same borrowers”. For corporate
                    exposures to be classified as connected there are a number of criteria, including: need to
                    meet or exceed a 30 percent threshold of voting stock, ability to appoint a Board member
                    or provide a guarantee.

                    To complement the individual large exposure limits, the FSS applies an aggregate limit of all
                    large exposures to five times the bank’s equity capital (Banking Act, Article 35,(4)).

                    There are several exceptions to the Large Exposure requirements in the circumstances where
                    (i) it is necessary for the national economy or for a bank to promote effectiveness in
                    securing claims; and (ii) where a bank exceeds the limit referred due to changes in its equity
                    capital or changes in the composition of the same borrowers although it did not extend
                    further credit (Article 35, paragraphs 1–4 of the Banking Act). In these instances, the
                    exemptions are prescribed by Presidential Decree.

                    In the second case, the FSS will offer a bank one year to comply with the LE limits. In terms
                    of experience with examples where the FSS has agreed to increases in the LE limits, the most
                    recent was in 2008 where a bank had exposure to a counterparty with high FX volatility.

                    Outside of the large exposure limits, management and monitoring of other sources of risk is
                    not standardized/systematic, and is supervised on a case by case basis through on and off
                    site supervision. Concentration other than name concentration is not considered in the
                    quantitative measure. Credit concentration risk does not appear to include on- and off-
                    balance sheet items.

                    Appendix 2 of the Regulations sets out the credit items that will be included in the
                    definition of credit extension. It also denotes a number of exclusions to the calculation of
                    large exposures, including types of exposures such as receivable spot exchange and tender

                                     guarantees. Exclusions are also applied to certain types of counterparties, such as: credit
                                     extensions to central government or central bank, banks in a country of risk weight 0
                                     percent and credit extensions guaranteed by said bank; credit to an investment trader or
                                     broker subject to regulation at the level such as banks. While some items that are excluded
                                     from the LE calculation will not be large, the dimensions of these exposures are not visible
                                     to the FSS and the impact on the overall concentration exposure of individual banks or the
                                     sector. The existence of an extensive list of exceptions to the calculation undermines the
                                     integrity of the LE regime and potentially hidden concentration risks could build up.

EC2                                  The supervisor determines that a bank’s information systems identify and aggregate on a
                                     timely basis, and facilitate active management of, exposures creating risk concentrations
                                     and large exposure49 to single counterparties or groups of connected counterparties.

Description and findings regarding Banks are required to implement internal guidelines for management and control of large
EC2                                credit extensions in terms of a computerized system to monitor present conditions and a
                                   self screening system which enables control and prevention of occurrence of large
                                   exposures (Article 76, paragraph 2, Detailed Regulations).

                                     The requirements for banks to measure the LE at month’s end and not continuously is a
                                     weakness in the way the regulations are drafted. The regulations are not broad as to require
                                     timely monitoring of concentration risk. Given the unique risks presented by LEs, there is
                                     benefit in having greater specificity in the monitoring expectations for banks on an
                                     individual single name basis and a portfolio and bank-wide basis. There is no specific
                                     requirement for identification and aggregation of exposures creating risk concentration
                                     (such as on a same industry, economic sector or geographic region or in market and other
                                     risks when the bank is exposed to particular asset classes, products, collateral, or currencies).
                                     In practice, the analysis of concentration other than name risk is conducted by on and off
                                     site supervision on a case by case basis.

EC3                                  The supervisor determines that a bank’s risk management policies and processes establish
                                     thresholds for acceptable concentrations of risk, reflecting the bank’s risk appetite, risk
                                     profile and capital strength, which are understood by, and regularly communicated to,
                                     relevant staff. The supervisor also determines that the bank’s policies and processes require
                                     all material concentrations to be regularly reviewed and reported to the bank’s Board.




        49
           The measure of credit exposure, in the context of large exposures to single counterparties and groups of
        connected counterparties, should reflect the maximum possible loss from their failure (i.e. it should encompass actual
        claims and potential claims as well as contingent liabilities). The risk weighting concept adopted in the Basel capital
        standards should not be used in measuring credit exposure for this purpose as the relevant risk weights were devised
        as a measure of credit risk on a basket basis and their use for measuring credit concentrations could significantly
        underestimate potential losses (see “Measuring and controlling large credit exposures, January 1991).

                                     Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

Description and findings regarding Banks are required to have in place adequate internal systems to identify, monitor and
EC3                                report LEs. As per Article 76(2) of the Regulations, banks are required to implement internal
                                   guidelines for management and control of large credit extension. Credit concentration risk is
                                   also measured and managed through the bank’s ICAAP: Article 260 of the Detailed
                                   Regulations, paragraphs A &B, requires all material risks to be identified specifically
                                   referring to concentration risk.

                                    While the ICAAP clearly establishes the requirement for concentration risk to be included in
                                    the assessment of a bank’s risk profile and evaluated against capital adequacy, specific risk
                                    management policies for LEs is not contained within the regulations. During the full scope
                                    examination, the FSS will verify risk management policies and processes for managing
                                    concentration risk. There was not a robust process to integrate the results from the
                                    assessment of concentration risk with the assessment of capital adequacy in the calculation
                                    of the CAMELR composite rating. In addition, while the ICAAP rules have been implemented,
                                    the FSS has not yet fully implemented the ICAAP and will need time to mature and be fully
                                    embedded. Equally, the implementation of Pillar 2 to allocate higher minimum capital ratios
                                    is a work in progress. As a result, capital add-ons have not been used in the process to set
                                    minimum capital ratios for banks (see CP16).

                                    In the analysis of concentration risk, there was not a sense of an agreed set of industry
                                    benchmarks or tolerances used by the FSS to consistently assess and evaluate concentration
                                    risk.

EC4                                 The supervisor regularly obtains information that enables concentrations within a bank’s
                                    portfolio, including sectoral, geographical, and currency exposures to be reviewed.

Description and findings regarding Specific reporting obligations in relation to concentration risk and large exposures limits are
EC4                                not explicitly defined in the regulations. Banks will however, submit a quarterly Business
                                   Report with a full suite of financial information. In practice, the FSS receives a broad range
                                   of concentration risk related information. Through the submission of the quarterly Business
                                   Report, a specialist team within the Corporate Credit Department will assess LE and
                                   concentration risk data. The centralized structure enables systematic monitoring of LE data
                                   across the banking sector. FSS uses the information available to conduct analysis of the
                                   material risks in the banking sector, including by industry, economic sector or geographic
                                   region or in market and other risks when the bank is exposed to particular asset classes,
                                   products, collateral, or currencies.

                                    The data submitted by banks will include: name of the borrower, exposure value, ratio of the
                                    LE to capital, and usage of the limit. A report is produced quarterly and submitted to the
                                    Deputy Governor responsible for Banking and Non-Banking Supervision. Banks are required
                                    to report on the level of credit concentration risk by borrower class, economic sector,
                                    industry, country, and the like on a quarterly basis.

                                    In the event offsite analysis identifies a specific issue or considers concentration risk to be
                                    excessive, meetings will be held with the individual bank to obtain a greater understanding
                                    of the exposure.

                                    In addition to regular quarterly offsite monitoring, the assessment of concentration risk is
                                    part of the full scope onsite examination which is performed every two years and includes
                                    quantitative and qualitative analysis.

                                   which belongs to “enterprise group” under Article 2 of the Monopoly Regulation and Fair
                                   Trade Act. It also includes a person with economic substance in or actual control over the
                                   firm.”

                                      The regulations do not provide for the FSS to apply discretion over the interpretation of
                                      connected counterparties.

EC6                                   Laws, regulations or the supervisor set prudent and appropriate50 requirements to control
                                      and constrain large credit exposures to a single counterparty or a group of connected
                                      counterparties. “Exposures” for this purpose include all claims and transactions (including
                                      those giving rise to counterparty credit risk exposure), on-balance sheet as well as off-
                                      balance sheet. The supervisor determines that senior management monitors these limits
                                      and that they are not exceeded on a solo or consolidated basis.

Description and findings regarding The Banking Act sets clear limits on credit extension to single borrowers (see EC1). The
EC6                                definition of credit extensions includes all on- and off-balance sheet exposures that can
                                   trigger credit risks (Appendix 2 Regulations).

                                      Banks must calculate LEs to a single counterparty or group of connected counterparties on a
                                      monthly basis and report quarterly to the FSS.
                                      The expectations for reporting concentration risk and Large Exposures to senior
                                      management or the Board is not prescribed by the regulations. In practice, however, banks
                                      have robust delegation frameworks in place which are assessed as part of the full scope
                                      onsite examination.

EC7                                   The supervisor requires banks to include the impact of significant risk concentrations into
                                      their stress testing programs for risk management purposes.

                                   and by different groups. Guideline on Stress Testing issued by the FSS encourage banks to
                                   conduct firm-wide stress testing which encompasses all identifiable risks including market,
                                   credit, operational, interest rate, and liquidity risks. For commercial real estate still, the FSS
                                   uses downturn LGDs from data during the Asian crisis (1998).

Additional Criteria

           Such requirements should, at least for internationally active banks, reflect the applicable Basel standards. As of
         September 2012, a new Basel standard on large exposures is still under consideration.

AC1                               In respect of credit exposure to single counterparties or groups of connected
                                  counterparties, banks are required to adhere to the following:

                                  (a)   Ten per cent or more of a bank’s capital is defined as a large exposure; and

                                  (b)   Twenty-five per cent of a bank’s capital is the limit for an individual large exposure to
                                        A private sector non-bank counterparty or a group of connected counterparties.

                                  Minor deviations from these limits may be acceptable, especially if explicitly temporary or
                                  related to very small or specialized banks.

Description and findings re AC1   The FSS has adopted LE limits of 20 percent for single name and 25 percent for an
                                  enterprise group pursuant to article 35 of the Banking Act. Over and above these single
                                  name limits, the sum of large credit exposures exceeding 10 percent of bank’s capital must
                                  not exceed five times the bank’s capital. If changes in bank’s capital or changes in the
                                  composition of single borrowers caused the sum to exceed the maximum limit, the bank
                                  must bring it into compliance within one year.

Assessment of Principle 19         MNC

Comments                          Key factor driving this rating include:

                                       Governance and reporting obligations in relation to Large Exposures should be
                                        developed further to ensure appropriate level of oversight and risk management
                                        applied to LEs and a full risk assessment (using the definition of LE as exposures
                                        greater than 10 percent). Given their unique risks, LEs should be reported and
                                        approved by at least senior management and preferably by the Board of directors. In
                                        practice, the FSS should be more active at assessing LEs prior to settlement to adjust its
                                        supervisory settings in the event the exposure creates an undesirable level of
                                        concentration risk. Absence of a notification or approval requirement outside of normal
                                        reporting obligations weakens LE regime;

                                       Several exceptions to the limits which could allow banks to circumvent, either
                                        intentionally or otherwise, and build up concentration risks. The treatment for
                                        connected counterparties to calculate LE compliance is defined under the Fair Trade
                                        Act and not the specific regulations for banks. The treatment includes a number of
                                        exclusions and is not really bank specific to capture unique prudential risks; and

                                       The requirements for banks to have policies and processes in place to manage and
                                        monitor concentration risk, especially on a bank-wide basis could be developed further
                                        to include a greater range of sources of concentration risk in addition to risks from
                                        Large Exposure.

                                  This CP has been considerably expanded from the previous methodology, and the focus has
                                  shifted from “large exposures” to “risk concentration”, which includes not only name risk but
                                  by industry, economic sector, geographic region, and by market (for instance, when banks
                                  are exposed to particular asset classes, products, collateral, or currencies). South Korea, as
                                  most countries, has not yet established guidance covering the whole spectrum of

                                       to enter into any transactions with related parties52 on an arm’s length basis; to monitor

                                       exposures to related parties in accordance with standard policies and processes.

Essential Criteria

EC1                                    Laws or regulations provide, or the supervisor has the power to prescribe, a comprehensive
                                       definition of “related parties”. This considers the parties identified in the footnote to the
                                       Principle. The supervisor may exercise discretion in applying this definition on a case by case
                                       basis.

Description and findings regarding A related party is defined in the Banking Act (Article 2.(1) 8) and means the principal and a
EC1                                person having a special relationship prescribed by Presidential Decree with the principal
                                   (also referred to as “special related person”). The scope of a related party is set out in Article
                                   1–4(1) of the Enforcement Decree and includes the following:

                                            A relative;

                                            Non-profit organization where the principal has a majority;

                                            A company where the principal has more than 30 percent issued voting stock;

                                            A person employed by the principal;

                                            A company in which the principal owns not less than 30 percent;

                                            A company that belongs to the group; and

                                            A person that exercises voting rights against voting stocks.

                                       Article 1–4(2) of the Enforcement Decree contains three explicit exclusions to transactions
                                       classified as related party: (i) where a private equity fund acquires stocks of other companies


         51
            Related parties can include, among other things, the bank’s subsidiaries, affiliates, and any party (including their
         subsidiaries, affiliates and special purpose entities) that the bank exerts control over or that exerts control over the
         bank, the bank’s major shareholders, Board members, senior management and key staff, their direct and related
         interests, and their close family members as well as corresponding persons in affiliated companies.
         52
            Related party transactions include on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet credit exposures and claims, as well as,
         dealings such as service contracts, asset purchases and sales, construction contracts, lease agreements, derivative
         transactions, borrowings, and write-offs. The term transaction should be interpreted broadly to incorporate not only
         transactions that are entered into with related parties but also situations in which an unrelated party (with whom a
         bank has an existing exposure) subsequently becomes a related party.

                          for the purpose of raising the value of the company it has invested (paragraph 3); (ii) where
                          the bank provides funds to Public-Private Partnerships for infrastructure projects; and (iii)
                          where a bank acquires stocks of other companies by conversion of investment for corporate
                          restructuring under the Corporate Restructuring Promotion Act and the Debtor
                          Rehabilitation and Bankruptcy Act.

                          In addition to the explicit exclusions above, if a transaction with a company where the
                          principal does not meet the 30 percent threshold, the exposure will not be treated as a
                          related party transaction. A threshold exemption to the definition is also applied to non-
                          profit organizations with a 50 percent threshold. Given the explicit exclusions to the related
                          party definition and a relatively high threshold for investment in companies and non-profit
                          organizations (30 percent and 50 percent respectively), there is some question about
                          whether the definition and application will capture a comprehensive set of related parties as
                          intended by the criteria. Related party exposures carry a unique set of risks where the
                          exceptions to policies and definitions should be limited with high hurdles.

                          In the instance where a bank wants to exercise a debt for equity swap, it will be subject to
                          The Corporate Restructuring Promotion Act and the Bankruptcy Act. The objective of this
                          exclusion is to enable resolution of distressed companies through the restructure of debt i.e.
                          lower the interest rate, extend term etc.

                          The Regulations include a detailed list of transactions to be included in the scope of credit
                          extension (Regulations, Appendix 2) and include on and off-balance sheet credit exposures.
                          The expanded nature of related party transactions articulated in the criteria is broader than
                          that detailed in the Regulations. For example, construction contracts, lease arrangements,
                          derivative transactions and write offs.

                          For related party transactions, banks are obliged to report exposures to the FSS on a
                          monthly basis. Credits that will be reported include Large Exposures, credits that are in
                          excess of 0.1 percent of paid in capital or $5 billion won (lesser of the two).

                          Offsite monitoring of related party exposures of banks is performed by a specialized unit
                          within the Corporate Credit Department. The reports are routinely checked to identify any
                          potential breaches of related party rules. In the case of large individual credits, the team will
                          investigate through direct engagement with the bank. The data that is submitted for related
                          party transactions include: date of the loan; interest rate; value of exposure; the borrower,
                          collateral etc. The team produces reports based on this material covering related party
                          transactions for three groups (i) shareholders, executives and employees; (ii) subsidiaries
                          and; (iii) other related parties. In practice, the number of breaches that have been identified
                          has been negligible.

                          The full scope examination will verify policies and processes associated with related party
                          exposures and effectiveness of compliance controls.

                           The Banking Act contains a number of provisions limiting the exercise of influence over the
                          bank by ‘Large Stockholders’ (see Article 35–2 to 35–b5). However, related party exposures
                          can apply to a broader class of exposures.

EC2                       Laws, regulations or the supervisor require that transactions with related parties are not
                          undertaken on more favorable terms (e.g., in credit assessment, tenor, interest rates, fees,

                                   under substantially favorable conditions compared with ordinary terms and conditions”. In
                                   this regard the prohibitions on related party transactions are clear.

EC3                                  The supervisor requires that transactions with related parties and the write-off of related-
                                     party exposures exceeding specified amounts or otherwise posing special risks are subject
                                     to prior approval by the bank’s Board. The supervisor requires that Board members with
                                     conflicts of interest are excluded from the approval process of granting and managing
                                     related party transactions.

Description and findings regarding There are no specific provisions within the regulations that require transactions with related
EC3                                parties and write-offs of related party exposures exceeding a specified amount to be subject
                                   to prior approval by the Bank’s Board.

                                     The Commercial Act, does however, contain provisions for Board responsibility in relation to
                                     disposition and transfer of important properties, borrowings of large scale assets,
                                     appointment or dismissal of managers, and management affairs shall be made by the
                                     resolution of the Board of Directors (Article 393). However, the scope of the provisions in
                                     the Commercial Act are not sufficiently broad to include write offs of related party
                                     exposures. The Commercial Act (Article 368(4) does require Board members with conflicts of
                                     interest to exclude themselves from the approval process.

EC4                                  The supervisor determines that banks have policies and processes to prevent persons
                                     benefiting from the transaction and/or persons related to such a person from being part of
                                     the process of granting and managing the transaction.

Description and findings regarding The Regulations require policies and processes in relation to Large Stockholders (Paragraph
EC4                                8, Article 35–2 (9) Banking Act & 35–4), which extends to related parties as defined within
                                   the Enforcement Decree. There did not appear to be a requirement that staff declare
                                   material interests in an exposure before making an input into the assessment. There is no
                                   general requirement in the Regulations that persons who are to benefit from the transaction
                                   (or persons related to such a person) should not be part of granting and managing the
                                   transaction.

EC5                                  Laws or regulations set, or the supervisor has the power to set on a general or case by case
                                     basis, limits for exposures to related parties, to deduct such exposures from capital when
                                     assessing capital adequacy, or to require collateralization of such exposures. When limits are
                                     set on aggregate exposures to related parties, those are at least as strict as those for single
                                     counterparties or groups of connected counterparties.

          An exception may be appropriate for beneficial terms that are part of overall remuneration packages (e.g., staff
        receiving credit at favorable rates).

Description and findings regarding The regulations contain a limit on credit extensions to borrowers at 20 percent in the case of
EC5                                a single counterparty and 25 percent in the case of a group counterparty exposure
                                   (paragraph 1, Article 35–2, Banking Act), however these two limits are for all borrowers and
                                   not specific to related party transactions. Article 35–2 also does not include a broad
                                   definition of transactions (i.e., lease arrangements, service contracts, derivatives etc).

                                      Within the FHC Act, there are restrictions on Intra-group single borrower credit exposure
                                     should be secured by appropriate collateral. There is no scope within the regulations for
                                     supervisors to deduct related party exposures from capital if the exposure was assessed to
                                     be problematic.

EC6                                  The supervisor determines that banks have policies and processes to identify individual
                                     exposures to and transactions with related parties as well as the total amount of exposures,
                                     and to monitor and report on them through an independent credit review or audit process.
                                     The supervisor determines that exceptions to policies, processes and limits are reported to
                                     the appropriate level of the bank’s senior management and, if necessary, to the Board, for
                                     timely action. The supervisor also determines that senior management monitors related
                                     party transactions on an ongoing basis, and that the Board also provides oversight of these
                                     transactions.

Description and findings regarding In general, banks are required to adhere to strict internal control limits. It is the expectation
EC6                                that related party transactions are monitored by appropriate policies and procedures and
                                   governance such as senior management and Board of Directors. The regulations are not
                                   prescriptive in this regard however. As a general rule, any credit exposure to related parties
                                   which exceed the current limit of the lower of 0.1 percent of bank’s capital or W 5 billion
                                   must obtain the approval of the bank’s Board made by a unanimous decision.

EC7                                  The supervisor obtains and reviews information on aggregate exposures to related parties.

Description and findings regarding Bank supervisors monitor information on aggregate exposures to related parties and
EC7                                compliance of the limit on exposures to related parties through monthly Business Report
                                   submitted by banks.

Assessment of Principle 20           LC

Comments                             FSS’s regulations on a bank’s transactions with related parties provides for exclusions to
                                     various counterparties below certain thresholds (30 percent for companies and 50 percent
                                     for non-profit organizations). As a result, the definition might not be comprehensive to
                                     capture a sufficiently broad number of related party transactions.

                                     The current definition is geared towards credit exposures and is reflected in the reporting
                                     obligations of banks and the offsite analysis performed by supervisors. I.e. lease contracts,
                                     derivatives, write offs etc are not included in the definition of credit extension and not
                                     captured by supervisory oversight. Equally, scope to further develop specific guidance for
                                     banks on enhanced governance required for related party exposures i.e. Board reporting
                                     and approval.

Principle 21                         Country and transfer risks. The supervisor determines that banks have adequate policies

Essential Criteria

EC1                                  The supervisor determines that a bank’s policies and processes give due regard to the
                                     identification, measurement, evaluation, monitoring, reporting and control or mitigation of
                                     country risk and transfer risk. The supervisor also determines that the processes are
                                     consistent with the risk profile, systemic importance and risk appetite of the bank, take into
                                     account market and macroeconomic conditions and provide a comprehensive bank-wide
                                     view of country and transfer risk exposure. Exposures (including, where relevant, intra-group
                                     exposures) are identified, monitored and managed on a regional and an individual country
                                     basis (in addition to the end-borrower/end-counterparty basis). Banks are required to
                                     monitor and evaluate developments in country risk and in transfer risk and apply
                                     appropriate countermeasures.

Description and findings regarding Under the regulations, banks that deal with FX affairs are required to set up and operate
EC1                                their own internal management standards for risks arising from FX transactions which will
                                   encompass risks such as: country risk, large credit risk, foreign currency liquidity risk, market
                                   risk and others (Article 67(1), Regulation on Supervision). In practice, the FSS manages
                                   transfer risk as a subset of country risk (country risk is the overarching risk), although the
                                   regulations are couched in terms of FX risk. The specific reference in the Regulations (Article
                                   67) is to country risk through FX transactions which may not fully capture the totality of the
                                   risk contained within this Principle.

                                      Article 41 of the Detailed Regulations requires banks that deal in FX to establish and
                                     implement risk management standards for FX and country risk as contained in Article 67 of
                                     the Regulations and further elaborated in the Appendix 15 of the Detailed Regulations. In
                                     terms of FX risks, the Regulations require certain disclosures by banks in the following
                                     categories (Article 72 of the Regulations on Supervision):
                                     (1)   The current status of assets and liabilities in foreign currency and
                                           liquidity ratio in foreign currency by remaining maturity as of the end
                                           of each month;

                                     (2)   The current status of maturity of borrowings in foreign currency as of the end of each
                                           month;

                                     (3)   The current status of financing and operation of funds in foreign
                                           currency as of the end of each month;


        54
           Country risk is the risk of exposure to loss caused by events in a foreign country. The concept is broader than
        sovereign risk as all forms of lending or investment activity whether to/with individuals, corporates, banks, or
        governments are covered.
        55
          Transfer risk is the risk that a borrower will not be able to convert local currency into FX and so will be unable to
        make debt service payments in foreign currency. The risk normally arises from exchange restrictions imposed by the
        government in the borrower’s country. (Reference document: IMF paper on External Debt Statistic—Guide for
        compilers and users, 2003).

                    (4)   The current status of riskless assets held in foreign currency as of the
                          end of each quarter; and

                    (5)   Other matters determined by the Governor for the soundness of institutions to deal
                          with FXs affairs.

                    To perform offsite supervision, banks will report data as part of their quarterly Business
                    Reports, such as: amount of credit extended, payment securities by country and for large
                    borrowers. The Foreign Exchange Supervision Department (FXSD) is responsible for
                    performing offsite analysis across the commercial banks. In assessing these risks FSS staff
                    will focus on three areas: (i) whether banks set appropriate limits for FX; (ii) whether banks
                    are adequately assessing country risk; and (iii) whether banks have sufficient reserves
                    against that country risk. As a centralized unit, the FXSD aggregates the information into a
                    report for each regulated entity within the FSS.

                    In the case of credit exposures to a non-resident corporate borrower that operates outside
                    Korea, the creditor bank is expected to classify the loan with due consideration given to the
                    FX risk of the borrower in addition to the debt-servicing ability of the borrower. The FXSD
                    will specifically be assessing whether the bank has performed this function by verifying FX
                    rates, compliance with statutory limits etc. Offsite monitoring will look at the flow of country
                    credit and the distribution of country ratings and attempt to identify potential
                    concentrations below investment grade. Asset quality will also be assessed and whether
                    banks are maintaining statutory minimum FX reserves.

                    As part of offsite monitoring, the Bank Supervision Department will be responsible for
                    assessing the adequacy of loan loss provisioning and FX reserves, with the FXSD responsible
                    for overall country and transfer risk monitoring. The responsibility for coordinating analysis
                    of country and transfer risk between the teams was not well defined.

                    There is no basis in the Regulations for the data to be consolidated, however, in practice the
                    data is submitted on a consolidated basis. In the instance where the regulated entity is a
                    bank, the data would include the bank and its subsidiaries, and in the instance of an
                    insurance entity, the data would be the insurance company and its subsidiaries. The FXSD
                    will perform offsite analysis for all subsidiaries regulated by the FSS.

                    Supervision practices for country and transfer risk are skewed towards transfer risk.
                    Furthermore, ongoing monitoring of country and transfer risk focused on offsite analysis of
                    quantitative information. Qualitative data on the application and effectiveness of risk
                    management insufficient to make an ongoing assessment that policies and procedures are
                    appropriate to risk profile.

                    Assessment of policies and procedures will typically only occur during the full scope onsite
                    examination every two years.

                    Currently there is no framework to comprehensively assess country and transfer risk within
                    the financial holding company across all entities (regulated and unregulated). In this case,
                    bank-wide analysis is not performed across the bank and the affiliate companies under a
                    bank FHC.

EC2                                country and transfer risk, it is required to refer the matter to its internal risk management
                                   committee for a resolution (Article 67(2) of the Regulations). However, the regulations do
                                   not stipulate that this risk committee regularly approve and oversee management to ensure
                                   that the policies and processes are implemented effectively and fully integrated into the
                                   bank’s overall risk management. Furthermore, it is ambiguous whether the internal risk
                                   committee is required to be a subcommittee of the Board or a management committee.

                                    In addition to normal offsite supervision, when conditions warrant, the FSS will make an ad
                                    hoc request. For example, during the heightened awareness of risks within the Eurozone the
                                    FXSD requested details from the major banks on their exposure to the PIGS countries
                                    (Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain). The FSS requested exposure data by country per
                                    loans, payment guarantees etc. At the end of 2010, the banks’ exposure to PIGS countries
                                    was $3 billion, dropping to $2 billion in 2011 and at the end of 2012 the exposure was
                                    $2.5 billion. However, offsite surveillance will not typically include qualitative inputs such as
                                    reports on risk management, updates to policies and procedures, internal audit findings,
                                    compliance reports, changes in risk appetite, strategy etc,.

                                    In terms of onsite analysis which is performed as part of the full scope examination through
                                    CAMELR, the Bank Examination Department is responsible for assessing compliance with
                                    risk management and adherence to compliance for foreign currency-related risks—such as
                                    country risk, large credit risk, and foreign currency liquidity risk—according to the risk type
                                    and manage the risks.. Banks have their own risk management and compliance schedules
                                    and put in place limits on an individual country basis. The onsite examination will examine
                                    whether banks went through an appropriate process for amending limits etc.

EC3                                 The supervisor determines that banks have information systems, risk management systems
                                    and internal control systems that accurately aggregate, monitor and report country
                                    exposures on a timely basis; and ensure adherence to established country exposure limits.

Description and findings regarding Bank’s information management systems will be assessed as part of the full scope onsite
EC3                                examination. Within the review, all aspects of a bank’s internal control processes and
                                   systems will be evaluated, including an assessment of aggregation procedures. However,
                                   between the full scope examinations which occur on a two year frequency, the supervisor
                                   will not assess the integrity of information systems, risk management systems and internal
                                   control systems, unless in exceptional circumstances.

                                    When data has been submitted by banks as part of their periodic submissions (Business
                                    Reports etc), the FSS will perform reconciliations i.e. matching FX loan balances and FX loans
                                    extended to resident and non-resident.

EC4                                 There is supervisory oversight of the setting of appropriate provisions against country risk
                                    and transfer risk. There are different international practices that are all acceptable as long as
                                    they lead to risk-based results. These include:

                                    (a)   The supervisor (or some other official authority) decides on appropriate minimum
                                          provisioning by regularly setting fixed percentages for exposures to each country
                                          taking into account prevailing conditions. The supervisor reviews minimum
                                          provisioning levels where appropriate;

                                    (b)   The supervisor (or some other official authority) regularly sets percentage ranges for
                                          each country, taking into account prevailing conditions and the banks may decide,
                                          within these ranges, which provisioning to apply for the individual exposures. The
                                          supervisor reviews percentage ranges for provisioning purposes where appropriate;
                                          and

                                    (c)   The bank itself (or some other body such as the national bankers association) sets
                                          percentages or guidelines or even decides for each individual loan on the appropriate
                                          provisioning. The adequacy of the provisioning will then be judged by the external
                                          auditor and/or by the supervisor.

Description and findings re EC4     Under the Regulations (paragraph g, Annex 3), in cases of loans to a non-resident
                                    enterprise, soundness shall be classified in consideration of the country risk where the
                                    relevant company is located in addition to such enterprise’s ability to repay debts. When
                                    classifying credit exposure to non-resident foreign corporate borrowers, banks must give
                                    due weight to the borrower’s country risk in addition to the borrower’s debt-servicing ability
                                    and set the provisions accordingly. During on-site examination, supervisors will verify
                                    whether provisioning takes into account country risk.

                                    The FSS has not developed consistent benchmarks for assessing whether the provisions
                                    applied by banks are conservative or accurate, instead expert judgment is applied by
                                    supervisors.

EC5                                 The supervisor requires banks to include appropriate scenarios into their stress testing
                                    programs to reflect country and transfer risk analysis for risk management purposes.

Description and findings re EC5     While banks are required to perform stress testing generally, there is no specific stipulation
                                    in the Regulations for banks to formally consider country and transfer risks as part of their
                                    stress testing programs. Under the Regulations, banks will perform stress tests on their
                                    sources of offshore funding. Supervisory practice and oversight was not well developed in
                                    terms of examination manuals and extent of attention devoted to this risk. The ICAAP
                                    requirements in the Detailed Regulations require banks to perform stress testing and
                                    include all material risks (paragraph 262). A similar stress testing requirement is contained
                                    within Detailed Regulations for credit risk (Appendix 3–1). Country exposure for the
                                    domestic banks is less than 3 percent of total capital and that at least half of that is
                                    allocated into developed countries where the systemic risk is considered low.

EC6                                 The supervisor regularly obtains and reviews sufficient information on a timely basis on the
                                    country risk and transfer risk of banks. The supervisor also has the power to obtain
                                    additional information, as needed (e.g. in crisis situations).

Description and findings regarding The Regulations (Article 72) stipulate the reporting requirements of banks in relation to
EC6                                foreign affairs transactions. The exposure status report contains information pertaining to
                                   FX risks. This information is submitted to the FSS on a quarterly basis and reviewed and
                                   assessed by the FXSD.

                                   Banks set management criteria and any changes for country risks (e.g., credit extension limit
                                   for a country) and credit extension in foreign currency above the established limits must be
                                   approved through the internal risk management processes. Bank supervisors will assess the
                                   effectiveness of internal risk controls and management (including the role and functions of
                                   the board members and the management) during on-site examinations. Offsite surveillance
                                   will assess credit as well as FX and will look at credit and loans on an individual country
                                   basis. They will examine trends to identify risks as well as changes in international financial
                                   markets.

                                   The processes to integrate the qualitative assessment of risks with the results of quantitative
                                   analysis was not well developed. The sharing of information between the FXSD and Bank
                                   Supervision Teams and ultimate accountability for supervision of the risks could be better
                                   coordinated.

Assessment of Principle 21         LC

Comments                           In the case of FHCs, group-wide analysis is not consistently performed across each
                                   regulated entity (and unregulated) to form a comprehensive view of risk. South Korean
                                   banks are active in exposures abroad and the FSS reviews country risk in depth for the large
                                   internationally active banks. The regulations should be strengthened for data to be
                                   consolidated. While banks are required to perform stress testing generally, there is no
                                   specific stipulation in the Regulations for banks to formally consider country and transfer
                                   risks as part of their stress testing programs.

Principle 22                       Market risk. The supervisor determines that banks have an adequate market risk
                                   management process that takes into account their risk appetite, risk profile, and market and
                                   macroeconomic conditions and the risk of a significant deterioration in market liquidity. This
                                   includes prudent policies and processes to identify, measure, evaluate, monitor, report and
                                   control or mitigate market risks on a timely basis.

Essential Criteria

EC1                                Laws, regulations or the supervisor require banks to have appropriate market risk
                                   management processes that provide a comprehensive bank-wide view of market risk
                                   exposure. The supervisor determines that these processes are consistent with the risk
                                   appetite, risk profile, systemic importance and capital strength of the bank; take into
                                   account market and macroeconomic conditions and the risk of a significant deterioration in
                                   market liquidity; and clearly articulate the roles and responsibilities for identification,
                                   measuring, monitoring and control of market risk.

Description and findings regarding Banks are required to articulate the slotting criteria for its trading book with internal
EC1                                guidelines and the trading book (TB) needs to be managed separately by a separate trading
                                   department. TB positions are managed in accordance with a trading strategy and limits on
                                   positions are established. Reporting to senior management is principles based with TB
                                   positions reported to senior management on a regular basis, though not prescribed
                                   (Detailed Regulations, Appendix 3–2 and paragraph 3).

                                   Banks are required to value positions on a daily basis and calculate market risk equity

                                mark-to-market models not explicitly required by the Detailed Regulations, although this
                                has been recommended to banks through the good practice guide (Market Risk
                                Management Guideline final revision Nov 2009). It is understood that this Guideline will be
                                translated into the rules when the ICAAP rules are revised.

                                The Detailed Regulations (Appendix 3–2, paragraph 1A) permit banks to exclude TB
                                exposures from the calculating of market risk regulatory capital under two conditions: (i)
                                where the ratio of the Trading Book (TB) to total assets on the consolidated balance sheet is
                                less than 5 percent maximum per day; and (ii) where the TB is less than w 100 billion
                                maximum per day. De minimus exclusions from market risk are not unknown, however, in
                                order to remain risk based and in conformity with the principles the threshold exclusion
                                would need an additional limitation in terms of the size of the bank. The current threshold is
                                considered excessive.

                                In practice, 17 of the 18 commercial banks are subject to the calculation of market risk
                                equity capital for TB exposures. One commercial bank is excluded which has a limited
                                traded market risk exposure and one Specialized Bank is also exempt from calculating
                                market risk-weighted assets (National Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives is also exempt
                                from IFRS and the ratio of Market Risk to total capital is 0.39 percent as at the end 2012).

                                To monitor compliance with the threshold exclusions allowed under the Regulations, banks
                                need to report daily trading positions. TB assets as a percentage of total assets for the
                                commercial banks is on average less than 5 percent, although the results are skewed as
                                several of the regional banks have very small TB assets (for example, 6 regional banks
                                between 1–2 percent). On the other hand, the ratio for one domestic bank is as high as
                                11 percent.

                                Regarding Korean banks’ trading positions subject to calculation of market risk (as of end of
                                June 2012), 52.7 percent was OTC derivatives trading and 42.9 percent was securities
                                trading. Most of OTC derivative transactions are interest rate and FX related derivatives
                                transactions for the purpose of short-term capital gains whereas most of securities trading

                                         Other instruments that are similar to TB.

                                    This is an exhaustive list. In terms of the first item of short term financial instrument, the FSS
                                    relies upon banks to define this in terms of their own internal controls and trading book
                                    policies. In effect, banks will have the discretion to define the duration of short term and will
                                    differ from bank to bank. Typical definitions of short term range 180 days, although there
                                    was no definitive data available. Assets in the TB attract a concessional risk weighting and
                                    require robust risk management by banks internally and by external verification. The risk is
                                    that assets that are not actually intended for trading be classified in the TB. To monitor this
                                    risk banks are required to have risk management over sighting the TB and the FSS will
                                    assess compliance with the TB policy statement as part of the onsite review.

                                    In the case of exotic instruments like structured products, each risk factor is calculated
                                    separately to calculate market risk-weighted assets. Most instruments traded in Korea are
                                    traditional (IRS, FX, commodity, stock, call option etc,) and new products are expected to go
                                    through a new product approval process.

                                    The Regulations permit banks to hold T3 capital against market risk exposures (Detailed
                                    Regulations Appendix 3–2, paragraph 2.C). When BIII is implemented these instruments will
                                    be excluded, which at the time of the assessment has not been announced.

EC2                                 The supervisor determines that banks’ strategies, policies and processes for the
                                    management of market risk have been approved by the banks’ Boards and that the Boards
                                    oversee management in a way that ensures that these policies and processes are
                                    implemented effectively and fully integrated into the banks’ overall risk management
                                    process.

Description and findings regarding Guidelines issued by the FSS recommends that banks advise the FSS if a change to its
EC2                                internal rules on market risk and trading has occurred. However, there is no specific
                                   requirement in either the guidelines or the Regulations that Board approval is required for a
                                   change in strategy or TB policy. Furthermore, Board’s are not required to review and
                                   approve market risk policies on a regular basis. In practice, banks are expected to inform the
                                   Board of a change in policy through normal reporting. When conducting the onsite
                                   examination, the FSS will request and analyze a large sample of TB assets and perform
                                   sample tests to assess compliance and evaluate risk management.

                                    Where a bank has been approved to use an internal model to calculate its market risk equity
                                    capital, the qualitative requirements in the Detailed Regulations clearly establish the role of
                                    the Board in governance of market risk (Appendix 3–2, paragraph 22). Senior management
                                    and the Board are required to take part in the risk control process positively and recognize
                                    the risk control as an essential aspect of management which needs sufficient input of
                                    resources (paragraph C). The internal model also needs to be integrated with the daily
                                    control process of a bank to measure the daily risk control process.

                                    Of the 18 commercial banks, 7 have been accredited to calculate market risk equity capital
                                    using internal models and the remainder calculate market risk using the Standard approach.

Description and findings regarding According to the Detailed Regulations (Annex 3, paragraph 248) banks are required to
EC3                                obtain regulatory approval for the internal trading guidelines, which must stipulate the key
                                   functions of the trading divisions, the basic requirements for trading, the range of trading
                                   positions to be taken, internal controls for the classification and management of trading
                                   positions, valuation of the trading positions, and internal audit lists. Extensive criteria for
                                   market risk management is prescribed in the ‘Qualitative Standards’ for internal model users
                                   (see Annex 3, paragraph 22), such as: independent front office that reports to senior
                                   management and takes responsibility for the design and management of the risk
                                   management system; preparation of daily risk reports based on the result of risk
                                   measurement by the internal model including the value of measurement of the amount of
                                   exposure to risk and appraisal on the relationship between transaction limits and report to
                                   senior management; and daily back testing.

                                    Through offsite supervision, bank supervisors monitor data submitted by the bank for limit
                                    breaches, and volume of TB transactions. Examiners will request complete transaction
                                    reports from the bank during an onsite examination by portfolio and sub-portfolio with a
                                    breakdown of products, limits, risk metrics etc. Internal controls and data systems for market
                                    risk management are also evaluated during the full scope onsite examination as are risk
                                    reports submitted through the Board Risk Committee.

EC4                                 The supervisor determines that there are systems and controls to ensure that banks’
                                    marked-to-market positions are revalued frequently. The supervisor also determines that all
                                    transactions are captured on a timely basis and that the valuation process uses consistent
                                    and prudent practices, and reliable market data verified by a function independent of the
                                    relevant risk-taking business units (or, in the absence of market prices, internal or industry-
                                    accepted models). To the extent that the bank relies on modeling for the purposes of
                                    valuation, the bank is required to ensure that the model is validated by a function
                                    independent of the relevant risk-taking businesses units. The supervisor requires banks to
                                    establish and maintain policies and processes for considering valuation adjustments for
                                    positions that otherwise cannot be prudently valued, including concentrated, less liquid, and
                                    stale positions.

Description and findings re EC4     Banks are required to value all relevant positions in the TB on a daily basis (Annex 3–2,
                                    Detailed Regulations). The FSS has issued a guideline to banks describing expectations for
                                    valuation practices for TB exposures as the Regulations are not specific in terms of prudent
                                    valuation methods.

                                    According to the guidelines, valuation of TB exposures should be validated by an
                                    independent and technically qualified division within the bank. The valuation guidelines
                                    contain the following guidance: instruments should be valued by the market in which the
                                    instrument is traded within; if no such market, banks can use a proxy price for alternative
                                    instruments; or if not possible they would do a valuation on the instrument by using a price
                                    agreed by bond assessment company or brokers. (Appendix 2–3, paragraph 5).

                                    For exposures that are marked-to-model, the governance requirements are not sufficiently
                                    developed in the Detailed Regulations for: (i) the bank to identify the material risks of the
                                    exposure; and (ii) to derive reliable estimates for the key assumptions and parameters used
                                    in the model.

                                    When the FSS performs an onsite examination, the examination manual suggests a number
                                    of areas are reviewed: verify valuation processes, responsibilities, and the reliability of the
                                    market information used and the independence of the revaluation process from risk-taking
                                    units. For example, testing of limits on all types of trading, type of risk limits, record of
                                    approval or changes made to the limits, banks frequency of monitoring etc.

EC5                                 The supervisor determines that banks hold appropriate levels of capital against unexpected
                                    losses and make appropriate valuation adjustments for uncertainties in determining the fair
                                    value of assets and liabilities.

Description and findings regarding FSS guidelines recommend that assets including stocks, bonds, and derivatives must be
EC5                                valued according to IFRS. Any adjustment needed must be separately determined and
                                   reflected in the income statement. For expected losses, adjustments for liquidity risk and
                                   counterparty risk must be made as an expense in the income statement. For unexpected
                                   losses, adjustments for the first day are made. The impact (sensitivity) of difficult-to-
                                   estimate variables on asset valuation must be disclosed.

                                    During the onsite examination, the FSS conducts an assessment of their capital adequacy,
                                    taking into account all risk sources. For market risk, specific attention is devoted to banks
                                    using internal models for calculating capital requirements. At the end of the validating
                                    process or in the course of monitoring the FSS may impose specific add-on when
                                    deficiencies are spotted in the model and in its use, which generate doubts on the adequacy
                                    of calculation performed by the bank.

                                    The FSS adopted the market risk amendments to Basel II in 2011 with the exception of
                                    correlation trading portfolios (of which domestic banks have no exposure). Standards for
                                    incremental risk charge and counterparty valuation adjustment is covered in appendix 3–2.

EC6                                 The supervisor requires banks to include market risk exposure into their stress testing
                                    programs for risk management purposes.

Description and findings re EC6     Banks must conduct stress tests involving market risk on a regular basis (more frequently in

                                      Where a bank identifies critical risks (including market risk), the bank must stress tests for
                                      each risk type along with integrated stress tests. For internal model users, the results of
                                      stress tests must be reported quarterly to the FSS.

                                      For those banks that calculate market risk–weighted assets using the Standardized method
                                      the Regulations do not require submission of stress testing results outside of stress testing
                                      performed as part of the ICAAP process.

                                      While the Regulations are not comprehensive in terms of stress testing requirements,
                                      guidelines issued by the FSS provide greater certainty to banks on expectations.

Assessment of Principle 22            LC


Comments                              The Detailed Regulations (Appendix 3-2, paragraph 1A) permit banks to exclude TB
                                      exposures from the calculating of market risk regulatory capital under two conditions: (i)
                                      where the ratio of the Trading Book (TB) to total assets on the consolidated balance sheet is
                                      less than 5 percent maximum per day; and (ii) A bank where the TB is less than 100bn Won
                                      maximum per day. De minimis exclusions from market risk are not unknown, however, in
                                      order to remain risk based and in conformity with the principles would need an additional
                                      limitation in terms of the size of the bank. The current threshold is considered excessive
                                      (EC1).

                                      While the FSS has issued guidance material to prudent valuation for TB exposures, this
                                      guidance is not part of the Regulations.

Principle 23                          Interest rate risk in the banking book. The supervisor determines that banks have
                                      adequate systems to identify, measure, evaluate, monitor, report and control or mitigate
                                      interest rate risk57 in the banking book on a timely basis. These systems take into account
                                      the bank’s risk appetite, risk profile and market and macroeconomic conditions.

Essential Criteria


EC1                                   Laws, regulations or the supervisor require banks to have an appropriate interest rate risk
                                      strategy and interest rate risk management framework that provides a comprehensive bank-
                                      wide view of interest rate risk. This includes policies and processes to identify, measure,
                                      evaluate, monitor, report and control, or mitigate material sources of interest rate risk. The
                                      supervisor determines that the bank’s strategy, policies and processes are consistent with
                                      the risk appetite, risk profile and systemic importance of the bank, take into account market
                                      and macroeconomic conditions, and are regularly reviewed and appropriately adjusted,
                                      where necessary, with the bank’s changing risk profile and market developments.

        57
          Wherever “interest rate risk” is used in this Principle the term refers to interest rate risk in the banking book.
        Interest rate risk in the trading book is covered under Principle 22.

                                     Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

Description and findings regarding Article 30 of the Regulations establishes the overall expectations of risk management
EC1                                frameworks to effectively identify, measure, monitor, and control risks, which includes
                                   interest rate risk in the banking book. In addition, the requirements on banks to consider all
                                   material risks as part of the ICAAP include measurement and consideration of IRR.

                                    The more detailed requirements are contained within Appendix 9 of the Detailed
                                    Regulations. IRR is calculated on non-trading positions on a consolidated basis (Appendix
                                    9–1, paragraph 2.A). IRR is comprised of interest rate change risk, yield curve risk, basis risk
                                    and option risk. The Regulations prescribe that IRR recognizes fluctuations in net inertest
                                    profits accruing from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet transactions according to
                                    fluctuation in interest rates and also measured against future cash flow risk. Interest rate risk
                                    is measured in two ways: (i) interest rate Earnings at Risk (EaR) and (ii) interest rate Value at
                                    Risk (VaR). Interest rate risk of a bank is measured on a consolidated basis and for
                                    subsidiaries.

                                    Banks are expected to measure their IRR on at least a monthly basis in normal times, and to
                                    report quarterly (the regulations do however only specify at least quarterly paragraph 24.B).
                                    Although in the case of a big change in interest rates, banks are expected to have a system
                                    that can measure more frequently.

                                    The periodicity of Board reporting for IRR in practice is monthly, yet not stipulated as part of
                                    the regulations. The larger banks are all reporting on a monthly basis.

                                    In the CAMELR rating schedule, if a bank is rated 4 (5 being the worst), the FSS will intervene
                                    through discussions with senior management and requesting adjustments to risk through
                                    available hedging etc. At the end of December 2012, the combined EaR for the domestic
                                    banks was 1.6 trillion Won or 1 percent of capital. The banks’ exposure is to a decreasing
                                    interest rate environment. Historically the structure of Korean banks deposits were fixed and
                                    loans were floating rate, over time however banks have restructured to move to fixed rate
                                    loans and EaR has considerably reduced so even if rates are going down the earnings loss is
                                    small.

EC2                                 The supervisor determines that a bank’s strategy, policies and processes for the
                                    management of interest rate risk have been approved, and are regularly reviewed, by the
                                    bank’s Board. The supervisor also determines that senior management ensures that the
                                    strategy, policies and processes are developed and implemented effectively.

Description and findings regarding The BoD is required to approve strategies and policies on IRR management and ascertain
EC2                                whether management monitors and controls risk consistent with approved strategies and
                                   policies (Detailed Regulations, Appendix 9–1, and paragraph 23). The Board can delegate
                                   responsibility for oversight of IRR to a Board risk management committee to examine
                                   whether IRR is within tolerances.

                                    Offsite monitoring is performed quarterly by a centralized team within the Prudential
                                    Supervision Team, in the Bank and Non-Bank Supervision Division. The centralized team is
                                    able to systematically compare and contrast the quarterly reports for each of the 18
                                    commercial banks to identify outliers and perform trend analysis. The data is submitted as
                                    part of the normal Business Reports by banks and includes information on interest rate risk
                                    including rate gap, interest rate EaR and interest rate VaR, all of which are calculated using a

                                  standard method. Measurement of IRR is performed by applying a 200bp parallel shift in
                                  the yield curve.

                                  The FSS will assess the appropriateness of banks’ risk management through the onsite full
                                  scope examination conducted every two years. During this review, FSS staff will verify
                                  management strategies, board reporting, limit compliance and a variety of activities to
                                  check adequacy of policies and procedures. The onsite review will also involve a meeting
                                  with the bank Treasurer. The onsite will evaluate three key areas for IRR: (i) risk government
                                  and risk management; (ii) risk controls and procedures; and (iii) risk measurement
                                  assessment. In terms of risk governance, FSS staff will determine whether the risk
                                  department has adequate independence and expertise and is reporting to Board or ALCO;
                                  In terms of risk controls, the FSS will assess whether reporting frequency is adequate and
                                  monitoring properly against agreed tolerances and in terms of risk measurement, they will
                                  assess the adequacy of data integrity in source systems.

                                  The FSS require a bank’s board to play roles and responsibility attributed by the regulation,
                                  and through on site examinations assesses that boards overall role and awareness of IRR
                                  limits and tolerances. Banks are only required to submit policies regarding IRR when IRRBB
                                  exceeds 20 percent of equity capital, but not on a frequency such as annually. However, the
                                  policies are verified when the CAMELR onsite is performed.

                                  There is no requirement for banks to have an Assets-Liability Committee ALCO and the
                                  practice differs from bank to bank. Equally there is no requirement for a Treasurer, though
                                  all banks do have a designated treasury function that reports through to either the CFO or
                                  the CEO and then through the ALCO and Risk Committee.

EC3                               The supervisor determines that banks’ policies and processes establish an appropriate and
                                  properly controlled interest rate risk environment including:
                                  (a) Comprehensive and appropriate interest rate risk measurement systems;

                                  (b)   Regular review, and independent (internal or external) validation, of any models used
                                        by the functions tasked with managing interest rate risk (including review of key
                                        model assumptions);

                                  (c)   Appropriate limits, approved by the banks’ Boards and senior management, that
                                        reflect the banks’ risk appetite, risk profile and capital strength, and are understood
                                        by, and regularly communicated to, relevant staff;
                                  (d)   Effective exception tracking and reporting processes which ensure prompt action at
                                        the appropriate level of the banks’ senior management or Boards where necessary;
                                        and

                                  (e)   Effective information systems for accurate and timely identification, aggregation,
                                        monitoring and reporting of interest rate risk exposure to the banks’ Boards and
                                        senior management.

Description and findings re EC3   Within the Detailed Regulations (paragraphs 24 and 25 of Annex 9–1), banks are required to
                                  maintain an interest rate risk framework that identifies key underlying risks and provides a
                                  measure of likely interest rate scenarios. For this purpose, banks estimate interest rate risk
                                  beyond one quarter and operate with appropriate interest rate risk guidelines and

                                     procedures. To ensure interest rate risk stays within the acceptable range, banks must set
                                     the appropriate parameters and criteria. The risk management unit within the bank must
                                     periodically review the ex-ante and ex-post interest rate risks and report the findings to the
                                     senior management and the BoD. Annex 9 requires banks to set up organizational
                                     arrangements adequate to the materiality of IRR exposures and to the complexity of the
                                     related activities.

                                     Through onsite reviews, the FSS verifies that internal control systems are adequate to ensure
                                     that any breach would be communicated in a timely manner to an appropriate level within
                                     the organization. During its general on-site examinations, the FSS assesses adequacy of a
                                     bank’s interest rate risks and the bank’s risks management system by carrying out CAMEL-R
                                     and RADARS.

                                     Where required, the FSS monitors those interest rate risks through thematic examinations.
                                     The FSS carries out off-site examinations by receiving regular business reports on interest
                                     rate risk from banks.

EC4                                  The supervisor requires banks to include appropriate scenarios into their stress testing
                                     programs to measure their vulnerability to loss under adverse interest rate movements.

Description and findings regarding The Detailed Regulations establish expectations for banks to perform regular stress testing
EC4                                (Appendix 9–2, paragraph). Under times of stress, it is expected that the frequency of stress
                                   testing will increase commensurate with the severity of the event. Results from the stress
                                   tests should be adequately reflected in the bank’s risk parameters and policy adjustments.
                                   Stress tests for interest rate risks must incorporate the following: (i) interest rate shock well
                                   beyond the typical levels; (ii) yield curve twisting, inversion, and other yield curve risks;
                                   (iii) basis risk; and (iv) sharply deteriorating liquidity conditions in systemically important
                                   institutions and the variability of market interest rates.

                                     The threshold for total IRR calculated by VaR is 20 per cent of equity capital. Banks are
                                     required to reduce this risk through hedging or position adjustment or such or take
                                     measures on additional holding of equity capital (paragraph 27.B).

                                     The FSS assesses adequacy of those measures through on-site and off-site examinations.
                                     The FSS carries out assessments on a bank’s interest rate risk measurement method, risk
                                     allowance and management method through the full scope examination every two years.
                                     The FSS monitors the risk level by receiving outputs of a bank’s interest rate risk
                                     management activities including interest rate gap, interest rate EaR and interest rate VaR, all
                                     of which are calculated by using the standard method.

AC2                                 The supervisor assesses whether the internal capital measurement systems of banks
                                    adequately capture interest rate risk in the banking book.

Description and findings regarding Banks must evaluate at least once on a quarterly basis capital adequacy under the
AC2                                assumptions of normal scenarios and stress scenarios. If the total interest rate risk
                                   measurements exceed 20 percent of the bank’s capital, the bank must file a report to the
                                   FSS on the causes for the increase and corrective steps to be taken (Para 27 of Annex 9-1,
                                   Detailed Regulations).

Assessment of Principle 23          C

Comments                            The regulations require quarterly measurement and in the case of large change in risk, more
                                    frequent. In practice, banks calculate and measure IRR on a monthly basis.

Principle 24                        Liquidity risk. The supervisor sets prudent and appropriate liquidity requirements (which
                                    can include either quantitative or qualitative requirements or both) for banks that reflect the
                                    liquidity needs of the bank. The supervisor determines that banks have a strategy that
                                    enables prudent management of liquidity risk and compliance with liquidity requirements.
                                    The strategy takes into account the bank’s risk profile as well as market and macroeconomic
                                    conditions and includes prudent policies and processes, consistent with the bank’s risk
                                    appetite, to identify, measure, evaluate, monitor, report and control or mitigate liquidity risk
                                    over an appropriate set of time horizons. At least for internationally active banks, liquidity
                                    requirements are not lower than the applicable Basel standards.

Essential Criteria

EC1                                 Laws, regulations or the supervisor require banks to consistently observe prescribed liquidity
                                    requirements including thresholds by reference to which a bank is subject to supervisory
                                    action. At least for internationally active banks, the prescribed requirements are not lower
                                    than, and the supervisor uses a range of liquidity monitoring tools no less extensive than,
                                    those prescribed in the applicable Basel standards.

Description and findings regarding There is a separate regime for domestic Won liquidity and FX liquidity (the FX being
EC1                                dominated by USD). Domestic liquidity requirements for banks are twofold: a liquidity ratio
                                   for Korean Won and a loan to deposit ratio, with both ratios a minimum one to one (Article
                                   26(1) of the Regulations):

                                        The ratio of current assets in won currency to current liabilities in Won to be 1:1 or
                                         more ( liquidity (the FX being dominated by; and

                                        Ratio of loans in won to deposits received in won (excluding the certificate of deposits)
                                         to be 1:1 or more (liquidity the FX being do).

                                    The Korean Won liquidity ratio is based on the numerical value as of the end of every
                                    month, and the loan to deposit ratio is based on the monthly average balance respectively
                                    from among business guidance ratios.

                                    The calibration of the foreign liquidity requirements are more conservative: in respect of
                                    foreign-currency liquidity risk; (i) the minimum is 85 percent for A/L with maturity of less

than 3 month; (ii) for A/L with maturity of less than 7 days, the maturity mismatch ratio for L
in excess of A must be less than 3 percent; and (iii) for A/L with maturity of less than a
month, the maturity mismatch ratio for L in excess of A must be less than 10 percent (Article
64 of the Regulations). The FX liquidity ratios are calculated by multiplying the value of each
asset by liquidation weights prescribed by the FSS as follows (see Appendix 7 of the
Regulations):

    FX currency and deposits, FX call loans FX bills: 100 percent;

    Loans between banks, demand funds for o/s, syndicated loans and FX equivalents; 90
     percent;

    Working capital and loans in FX: 80;

    Government bonds A-AAA: 100;

    Government bonds BBB- A: 90;

    Government Bonds below BBB: 60;

    Corporate Bonds A-AAA: 90;

    Corporate bonds BBB—A: 85;

    Corporate Bonds below BBB: 50;

    Securities publicly traded: 55;

    Securities not publicly traded: 35;

    Futures: 85; and

    Others: 100.

For banks to deal in FX, they are required to confirm on a daily basis that they meet the limit
on overbought and oversold FX amounts. When in violation of the limit, the bank will report
to the Governor of the FSS three business days after the date of the breach.
The standards for liquidity risk management are contained within the Detailed Regulations
(Appendix 9–2). Chapter 2 sets out the requirement for banks to establish a liquidity
management strategy including: the management target; management policies and internal
control systems for liquidity risk. Banks must also maintain liquidity risk management
strategies and contingency funding mechanisms.

Article 39 of the DRSBB relates to the methods for calculating liquidity ratios of foreign
currency. The classification methods of remaining maturities, the scope of assets and
liabilities and the methods are covered under this paragraph. It is not stipulated in the
Banking Act or the Regulations, that liquidity the ratios need to be calculated and measured
and complied with on a solo and consolidated basis.

Appendix 3–4 of the DRSBB sets out in more detail the liquidity requirements:




                                                                                 147

                                   In principle, all the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and those with remaining
                                   maturity of one month or less related to transactions in off-balance sheet derivatives shall
                                   be subject to the calculation. Unclear whether all derivatives are included.

                                   Korea’s exposure to foreign banks on the funding side is among the highest in Asia.
                                   Reliance on foreign currency denominated short-term funding could raise the possibility of
                                   rollover difficulties, particularly when external shocks cause a simultaneous short term
                                   funding squeeze and currency depreciation, as happened in 2008. Worsening conditions in
                                   parent banks’ jurisdictions may also lead to funding problems in foreign bank branches.

                                   There is a requirement for banks to hold sufficient assets of good quality (HQLA) with no
                                   limits on disposal which can be liquidated in a crisis (Appendix 9–2 Detailed Regulations,
                                   paragraph 6). However, there is no specific definition of HQLA. The regulations do provide
                                   several criteria:

                                       Liquidation is possible without excessive loss;

                                       Immediate availability without restrictions on disposal;

                                       Transparency in the risk structure and characteristics;

                                       Easiness of the valuation;

                                       Meeting the requirements for qualified security possible to offer to the central bank;
                                        and

                                       Existence of trading markets.

                                   While there is a requirement for banks to have HQLA, there is no definition of HQLA outside
                                   of the general characteristics and no quantitative limit. In terms of the composition of
                                   current assets to meet the Won liquidity ratio,—approximately 60 percent consist of loans
                                   with duration less than 30 days. The remaining 40 percent comprises of 20 percent
                                   securities, 10 percent FX loans and 10 percent other. In terms of the securities, these need to
                                   meet a test of being investment grade (Appendix 3–4, paragraph 1.5.(b)).

                                   There are a number of exclusions in terms of what assets will be included in the calculation
                                   as per the Appendix 3–4, for example: any securities regardless of maturity for collateral will
                                   be excluded.

                                   The FSS has published guidance to banks on the introduction of the LCR as part of the BIII
                                   reforms. Korea intends to adopt the first phase in the LCR commencing in 2015 and
                                   monitors LCR data submitted by banks on a quarterly basis. The FSS indicated that banks’
                                   average LCR was approximately 130 percent.

                                   The prescribed liquidity requirements reflect the liquidity risk profile of banks (including on-
                                   and off-balance sheet risks) in the context of the markets and macroeconomic conditions in
                                   which they operate.

EC2                                 items will be included in the calculation. For example, contingent liabilities are omitted (see
                                    Detailed Regulations Appendix 3–4 for an exhaustive list of off-balance sheet items).

                                    With respect to foreign currency-denominated A/L that are used to compute liquidity and
                                    maturity mismatch ratios (in foreign currencies), the A/L include (i) on-balance sheet foreign
                                    currency-denominated A/L; (ii) forward contracts outstanding from currency swap
                                    arrangements; (iii) forward contracts outstanding, including NDFs; (iv) currency futures; and
                                    (v) 20 percent of any outstanding off-balance sheet acceptances and guarantee, foreign
                                    currency-denominated acceptances and guarantees, and acceptances involving foreign
                                    counterparties.

                                    The calculation methods of the various ratios are not necessarily fully reflective of the
                                    current liquidity positions and even less as forward looking tools. For example,
                                    measurement of the Won liquidity ratio is calculated on the numerical value as of the end of
                                    month (Article 17 of the Detailed Regulations). While the regulations only stipulates end of
                                    month compliance, in practice, banks are expected to comply intra-month. In theory, there
                                    is scope for banks to smooth their Won liquidity ratio at end-of-month and not intra-
                                    month. In terms of the loan to deposit ratio it is based on the monthly average balance
                                    respectively from among business guidance ratios. Banks with historically lower volatility in
                                    their core deposits will, as a result, typically have a higher loan to deposit ratio under the
                                    methodology. The method of calculation does not necessarily reflect the potential volatility
                                    in the preceding month or expected/forward looking volatility in deposit outflows.

                                    In terms of the FX ratio, the calculation of the weights is based on a prescribed liquidity
                                    weighting set by the FSS and not reflective of market value. However, the weightings do
                                    closely reflect the haircuts applied by the BoK—but the BoK has discretion to set haircuts.

EC3                                 The supervisor determines that banks have a robust liquidity management framework that
                                    requires the banks to maintain sufficient liquidity to withstand a range of stress events, and
                                    includes appropriate policies and processes for managing liquidity risk that have been
                                    approved by the banks’ Boards. The supervisor also determines that these policies and
                                    processes provide a comprehensive bank-wide view of liquidity risk and are consistent with
                                    the banks’ risk profile and systemic importance.

Description and findings regarding Banks must operate with an effective liquidity risk framework that facilitates liquidity risk
EC3                                management, liquidity policy execution, and internal controls, the details of which are
                                   explained in the Detailed Regulations (Appendix 2, Chapter II, paragraphs 4–13)) . The
                                   liquidity risk framework must also incorporate the maximum risk to be permitted, early
                                   distress warnings, analysis of stress tests and contingency funding plans, and actions aimed
                                   at diversifying funding sources and avoiding maturity concentration.

                                    Banks are required to conduct a stress test and assess the impact on the bank’s liquidity
                                    position. When deciding the scope and cycle of the stress test, a bank shall consider a scale
                                    of the relevant liquidity risk exposure. The results of the stress test, the scenario and
                                    assumptions and measures for improvements of deficient factors will be reported to the
                                    BoD (Appendix 9–2, Chapter 3, paragraph 12.H). While the FSS does not prescribe the
                                    frequency, the severity or the survival horizon, it does stipulate certain aspects regarding the
                                    design of the scenario. The scenario must consider both an idiosyncratic and whole of
                                    market crisis. The frequency of Board reporting of liquidity stress test results is not
                                    prescribed and left to bank discretion (Detailed Regulation 9–2, paragraph 7.D).

                                     The FSS also provides a number of examples of assumptions to be used, such as: shortage
                                     of liquidity in the money market; secession of retail deposits; decline in wholesale funding;
                                     incidental cash flow from off-balance sheet items. There is scope to strengthen the

                                     Given that each bank applies a different set of assumptions for the liquidity stress test, the
                                     ease of identifying outliers and detecting weakness in a particular bank is made more
                                     difficult requiring more intensive analysis by the supervisor into the inputs. Also, there is no
                                     requirement for the results of the stress test to be submitted to the FSS, although in practice
                                     banks submit the results of stress testing at least annually.

                                     The analysis of bank’s practices typically occurs through the full scope onsite examination
                                     performed as part of the CAMELR assessment which will occur every two years. During this
                                     examination, a thorough review of liquidity risk management is performed verifying all
                                     aspects of liquidity risk management and measurement and compliance with limits etc.
                                     However, outside of the examination, there is no requirement for banks to submit
                                     qualitative data such as policies and processes, results of stress testing etc to the FSS. The
                                     FSS will receive quantitative data on a quarterly and often more frequent basis for liquidity.
                                     The data will not include information on risk management.

EC4                                  The supervisor determines that banks’ liquidity strategy, policies and processes establish an
                                     appropriate and properly controlled liquidity risk environment including:

                                     (a)   Clear articulation of an overall liquidity risk appetite that is appropriate for the banks’
                                           business and their role in the financial system and that is approved by the banks’
                                           Boards;

                                     (b)   Sound day-to-day, and where appropriate intraday, liquidity risk management
                                           practices;

                                     (c)   Effective information systems to enable active identification, aggregation, monitoring
                                           and control of liquidity risk exposures and funding needs (including active
                                           management of collateral positions) bank-wide;

                                     (d)   Adequate oversight by the banks’ Boards in ensuring that management effectively
                                           implements policies and processes for the management of liquidity risk in a manner
                                           consistent with the banks’ liquidity risk appetite; and

                                     (e)   Regular review by the banks’ Boards (at least annually) and appropriate adjustment of
                                           the banks’ strategy, policies and processes for the management of liquidity risk in the
                                           light of the banks’ changing risk profile and external developments in the markets and
                                           macroeconomic conditions in which they operate.

Description and findings regarding The BoD or the risk committee within the Board must establish the bank’s liquidity
EC4                                framework that supports the bank’s liquidity management strategy. Their responsibilities

                                    least annually. Such reporting includes summary assessment of the liquidity conditions,
                                    liquidity risk relative to the maximum to be tolerated, analysis of short- and longer-term
                                    liquidity outlook, the annual amount of debt issues, results of stress tests, assessment of
                                    early distress warning indicators, the ability to secure funding with bank assets, and any
                                    other material issues of concern to the board.

                                    Management must also promptly alert the board and take appropriate actions in the event
                                    of a sharp increase in funding costs, continuing funding shortages, general drying up of
                                    liquidity, increased concentration of funding sources, and any significant liquidity risk above
                                    the established levels. The information system for liquidity risk management must function
                                    effectively to generate meaningful information to the management and to the board
                                    (Articles 30 and 31, Regulation on of Banking Supervision; Article 29, Annex 9-2, Detailed
                                    Regulation on Supervision of Banking Business).

                                    The frequency of Board review of liquidity management is not stipulated in the regulations
                                    and does not meet the criteria of at least annually. The requirement for managing liquidity
                                    is not explicitly articulated in the Regulations, although there are more general
                                    requirements to manage liquidity as the need arises.

EC5                                 The supervisor requires banks to establish, and regularly review, funding strategies and
                                    policies and processes for the ongoing measurement and monitoring of funding
                                    requirements and the effective management of funding risk. The policies and processes
                                    include consideration of how other risks (e.g. credit, market, operational and reputation risk)
                                    may impact the bank’s overall liquidity strategy, and include:

                                    (a)   An analysis of funding requirements under alternative scenarios;

                                    (b)   The maintenance of a cushion of high quality, unencumbered, liquid assets that can
                                          be used, without impediment, to obtain funding in times of stress;

                                    (c)   Diversification in the sources (including counterparties, instruments, currencies and
                                          markets) and tenor of funding, and regular review of concentration limits;

                                    (d)   Regular efforts to establish and maintain relationships with liability holders; and

                                    (e)   Regular assessment of the capacity to sell assets.

Description and findings regarding Banks must maintain high-quality liquid assets. The general characteristics for HQLA include:
EC5                                liquidated without significant loss, can be used immediately as collateral without any
                                   restriction, easily qualify as safe assets to the central bank, and can be unloaded to the mark
                                   (Annex 9–2, Detailed Regulations). There is, however, no prescribed definition of HQLA or
                                   minimum holdings as for example calculated under the LCR.

                                    When formulating management strategies of liquidity risk, banks are required to specify
                                    concentration limits and sources of funding across different maturities to be reflected in
                                    short term, medium term and long term funding plans (paragraph 7, Detailed Regulations).
                                    For banks that have a heavy reliance on wholesale funding, they are expected to regularly
                                    consider the adequacy of their holdings of HQLA together with diversification strategies.
                                    Equally, banks that deal in multiple foreign currencies must take steps to diversify funding

                                    for each currency as a precaution against crisis situations that render ready currency
                                    conversion difficult.

                                    Banks are required to formulate a contingency funding plan by incorporating the results of
                                    stress tests under a variety of different scenarios. The Regulations provide guidance to
                                    banks on the possible scenarios (Detailed Regulations, paragraph 14). As part of the
                                    assessment of ongoing funding plans and measuring liquidity risk, banks are required to
                                    continually reassess underlying assumptions and inputs in the measurement of liquidity i.e.,
                                    stickiness of principal funding vehicles; changes in behavior of trade partners; influence of
                                    offering services (e.g., trust settlement etc). This expectation for ongoing reassessment
                                    applies to the bank’s HQLA.

                                    To maintain confidence in a crisis situation, banks must keep their customers and creditors
                                    informed of their liquidity conditions and provide credible and meaningful information.
                                    When setting up the contingency funding plan, banks must take into account the impact of
                                    the crisis on asset disposition and securitization and any secondary impact (e.g., on the
                                    bank’s reputation) with the execution of the funding plan.

EC6                                 The supervisor determines that banks have robust liquidity contingency funding plans to
                                    handle liquidity problems. The supervisor determines that the bank’s contingency funding
                                    plan is formally articulated, adequately documented and sets out the bank’s strategy for
                                    addressing liquidity shortfalls in a range of stress environments without placing reliance on
                                    lender of last resort support. The supervisor also determines that the bank’s contingency
                                    funding plan establishes clear lines of responsibility, includes clear communication plans
                                    (including communication with the supervisor) and is regularly tested and updated to
                                    ensure it is operationally robust. The supervisor assesses whether, in the light of the bank’s
                                    risk profile and systemic importance, the bank’s contingency funding plan is feasible and
                                    requires the bank to address any deficiencies.

Description and findings regarding Contingency funding plans must be prepared with due consideration given to the range of
EC6                                possible scenarios and analyses of stress environments. The feasibility of the funding plan
                                   must be regularly evaluated and validated and renewed at least once a year by the bank’s
                                   board (Annex 9–2, Detailed Regulations). Moreover, the contingency funding plan must
                                   provide step-by-step actions to be taken to secure funding and specify the composition,
                                   functions, and the responsibilities of the bank’s stress management team. The plan must
                                   also unambiguously stipulate how the stress management team is to operate, how distress
                                   is to be dealt with, and the how much funding is to be secured. Due considerations must be
                                   given to the potential effect of the stress and loss of funding on asset disposition and
                                   securitization. All potential secondary effect from the execution of the funding plan (e.g., on
                                   the bank’s reputation) must be taken into account.

                                    The range of funding actions to be taken in a stress environment must include, in addition
                                    to central bank credit, repurchase agreements (RP), asset disposition, securing more
                                    deposits, restriction on the acquisition of non-current assets, and communication with the
                                    supervisors, the central bank, the credit-rating providers, and the news media.

EC7                                 The supervisor requires banks to include a variety of short-term and protracted bank-
                                    specific and market-wide liquidity stress scenarios (individually and in combination), using
                                    conservative and regularly reviewed assumptions, into their stress testing programs for risk

                                    management purposes. The supervisor determines that the results of the stress tests are
                                    used by the bank to adjust its liquidity risk management strategies, policies and positions
                                    and to develop effective contingency funding plans.

Description and findings regarding Banks must conduct stress tests to evaluate the impact of a stress on liquidity risk. The
EC7                                results of the stress tests should be used to decide liquidity risk management strategy,
                                   recalibrate the maximum liquidity risk to be tolerated, adjust the holdings of high quality
                                   liquid assets, and set a contingency funding plan (Annex 9–2, Regulation on Supervision of
                                   Banking Supervision).

                                    The stress scenarios that banks design must incorporate the bank’s unique business
                                    characteristics and vulnerabilities so that the key liquidity risks can be adequately taken into
                                    account. The stress tests must also give due weight to stress scenarios that incorporate the
                                    bank’s unique stress conditions, the market-wide stress conditions, and the self-reinforcing
                                    stress cycle.

EC8                                 The supervisor identifies those banks carrying out significant foreign currency liquidity
                                    transformation. Where a bank’s foreign currency business is significant, or the bank has
                                    significant exposure in a given currency, the supervisor requires the bank to undertake
                                    separate analysis of its strategy and monitor its liquidity needs separately for each such
                                    significant currency. This includes the use of stress testing to determine the appropriateness
                                    of mismatches in that currency and, where appropriate, the setting and regular review of
                                    limits on the size of its cash flow mismatches for foreign currencies in aggregate and for
                                    each significant currency individually. In such cases, the supervisor also monitors the bank’s
                                    liquidity needs in each significant currency, and evaluates the bank’s ability to transfer
                                    liquidity from one currency to another across jurisdictions and legal entities.

Description and findings regarding Banks with significant foreign currency business must consider exchange rate and market
EC8                                volatility and access to the FX markets in a stress environment. Theses consideration should
                                   be appropriately incorporated in the bank’s liquidity risk management strategy for each
                                   currency. (Annex 9, Regulation on Supervision of Banking Business).

                                    For the currency with large-size activities, the permissible currency mismatch boundary
                                    should be set. Where liquidity risk in a currency is particularly high, alternative funding and
                                    other follow-up actions should be sought. For banks dealing in diverse foreign currencies,
                                    more diversified funding sources for each currency should be secured in anticipation of
                                    stress situations that may make currency conversion difficult.

Additional Criteria

AC1                                 The supervisor determines that banks’ levels of encumbered balance-sheet assets are
                                    managed within acceptable limits to mitigate the risks posed by excessive levels of
                                    encumbrance in terms of the impact on the banks’ cost of funding and the implications for
                                    the sustainability of their long-term liquidity position. The supervisor requires banks to
                                    commit to adequate disclosure and to set appropriate limits to mitigate identified risks.

Description and findings regarding Banks manage their encumbered asset positions by separating encumbered assets from
AC1                                assets with no restrictions and qualified as collateral to the central bank. Banks must also
                                   continually monitor whether their assets qualify as collateral to the central bank and in the
                                   funding market.

Assessment of Principle 24           LC

Comments                             The key drivers of the rating include:

                                         The regulations do not require banks to comply with the liquidity ratios on a
                                          continuous basis, only at end of month. The method of calculation does not necessarily
                                          reflect the potential volatility in the preceding month or expected/forward looking
                                          volatility in deposit outflows;

                                         The Regulations are not clear that all off-balance sheet assets and liabilities are
                                          included in the mismatch liquidity ratios. For example, contingent assets (such as credit
                                          lines in Won and FX that would often be drawn down in a crisis) and contingent
                                          liabilities such as overdrafts, revolving facilities held by customers that can be drawn
                                          down with short notice; and

                                         The method of calculating the one month Won liquidity mismatch does not encourage
                                          banks to term out issuance of wholesale funding in an effort to reduce potential roll
                                          over risk in a crisis. To maximize management efficiency of assets to meet the one
                                          month maturity mismatch, banks are encouraged to invest in assets that mature within
                                          30 days (which is actually the case in Korea where much of the wholesale money is
                                          short term).

                                     Other factors include:

                                     While banks are required to perform a liquidity stress tests, the FSS does not prescribe
                                     severity, survival horizon, or that the results need to be reported to the BoD or the FSS on a
                                     minimum frequency. The requirements for liquidity stress tests are general and not
                                     prescriptive. The inputs and parameters of liquidity stress testing are not prescribed which
                                     will mean that the basis for stress tests will differ across institutions. The result is that banks
                                     have applied a wide variation in assumptions in the stress tests they perform and report to
                                     supervisors. As a result, comparison and supervision intensity is not easily performed,
                                     inhibiting identification of outliers and need for prompt action. Without a consistent basis
                                     for inputs and parameters into stress tests, the assumptions will differ widely, the basis for
                                     comparison becomes difficult requiring intensive inspection of models, assumptions,
                                     parameters and back testing. For example, banks with similar liquidity profiles might be
                                     applying vastly different run off assumptions obfuscating inherent risk profile.

Principle 25                         Operational risk. The supervisor determines that banks have an adequate operational risk
                                     management framework that takes into account their risk appetite, risk profile and market
                                     and macroeconomic conditions. This includes prudent policies and processes to identify,
                                     assess, evaluate, monitor, report and control or mitigate operational risk58 on a timely basis.

Essential Criteria


        58
          The Committee has defined operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal
        processes, people and systems or from external events. The definition includes legal risk but excludes strategic and
        reputational risk.

EC1                                 Law, regulations or the supervisor require banks to have appropriate operational risk
                                    management strategies, policies and processes to identify, assess, evaluate, monitor, report
                                    and control or mitigate operational risk. The supervisor determines that the bank’s strategy,
                                    policies and processes are consistent with the bank’s risk profile, systemic importance, risk
                                    appetite and capital strength, take into account market and macroeconomic conditions, and
                                    address all major aspects of operational risk prevalent in the businesses of the bank on a
                                    bank-wide basis (including periods when operational risk could increase).

Description and findings regarding Banks are required to establish risk management systems for ensuring a timely recognition,
EC1                                assessment, monitoring and control of various risks, including operational risk (Article 30,
                                   Regulations). Banks are also required to consider operational risk as part of their ICAAP
                                   assessment (paragraph 260 Detailed Regulations). Specific requirements for operational risk
                                   measurement and management are outlined in the Detailed Regulations (paragraph 248(A))
                                   for banks to establish a control structure with well defined responsibilities for major
                                   functions related to operational risk. In particular, banks that use the AMA approach must
                                   have an operational risk management function responsible for designing, developing and
                                   maintaining the operational risk management and measurement systems and for calculating
                                   the capital requirement. For these banks, an internal validation process is required to verify
                                   the overall quality of these systems and their continued compliance with regulatory
                                   requirements, business needs and developments in the relevant market.

                                    In AMA banks, the measurement system must be closely integrated into decision-making
                                    and risk management processes. An additional minimum requirement regarding collecting
                                    and processing operational risk data such as internal loss data and external loss data is
                                    described in paragraph 250, of the Detailed Regulations.

                                    The BCBS team within the FSS is responsible for establishing the operational risk framework
                                    and other policy related work. This team is responsible for approving AMA models and
                                    proposed changes to those models will be assessed and approved by the Bank Examination
                                    Department. Offsite supervision of operational risk is also the responsibility of the Bank
                                    Examination Teams on ongoing basis. Both teams share findings from their respective
                                    analysis. During the onsite examination, bank supervisors evaluate a bank’s operational risk
                                    management framework through the full scope examination and consideration of the
                                    adequacy of capital against internal loss data, the results of scenario analysis and quality of
                                    internal control. From the review of supervisory files, the extent of operational risk analysis
                                    was limited.

                                    The application of operational risk management across the operations of the bank FHCs was
                                    seen as problematic.

EC2                                 The supervisor requires banks’ strategies, policies and processes for the management of
                                    operational risk (including the banks’ risk appetite for operational risk) to be approved and
                                    regularly reviewed by the banks’ Boards. The supervisor also requires that the Board
                                    oversees management in ensuring that these policies and processes are implemented
                                    effectively.

                                   management is also required to take responsibility to implement the operational risk
                                   management system and develop policies and processes. Responsibility for operational risk
                                   management is then delegated to an independent operational risk unit that implements a
                                   firm-wide operational risk management system.

                                   No formal requirement for risk management policies to be assessed, reviewed and
                                   approved by the Board on a regular basis. The Detailed Regulations (paragraph 248)
                                   stipulates the responsibility of the Board in taking final responsibility and in general banks
                                   do report through the Board Risk Committee on risk management status, and to the Board.

                                   The FSS assesses the appropriateness of the role of the Board and the risk committee in the
                                   bank’s CAMEL-R. The review of Board papers and minutes and reporting was thorough,
                                   though the amount of attention dedicated to operation risk was limited.

EC3                                The supervisor determines that the approved strategy and significant policies and processes
                                   for the management of operational risk are implemented effectively by management and
                                   fully integrated into the bank’s overall risk management process.

Description and findings regarding The FSS utilizes CAMEL-R and RADARS to assess how effectively the management leads the
EC3                                Board-approved risk management system. As a minimum for operational risk measurement,
                                   the management must ensure the board-approved operational risk management system
                                   functions effectively and takes any follow-up steps to improve or strengthen the bank’s risk
                                   policy or procedures (Paragraph 248(Annex 3), Detailed Regulations). The qualitative
                                   assessment occurs in practice only once every two years as part of the full scope
                                   examination. Offsite monitoring does not consist of multiple qualitative inputs to form a
                                   comprehensive and accurate assessment of risk management. Important inputs into the
                                   assessment of whether the operational risk system is fully integrated into a bank’s overall
                                   risk management process are not considered outside of the full scope onsite. The partial
                                   onsite will not typically test this level of detail.

                                   Five banks have been accredited to use the AMA approach to calculate operational risk
                                   regulatory capital. The modeling approach differs between each bank and each actively
                                   considers the four basic inputs: ILD, ELD, BEICFs and scenario analysis. Of the five banks,
                                   three rely upon scenarios for the majority of model estimates of loss. The other two AMA
                                   banks use a mix of scenarios and ELD. AMA banks actively access ELD from a local data
                                   consortia— KOREC. The level of maturity in reporting operational risk losses to the FSS was
                                   considered as relatively basic and did not typically map to the Basel categories of loss. On
                                   the other hand, reporting of financial incidence was well established.

EC4                                The supervisor reviews the quality and comprehensiveness of the bank’s disaster recovery
                                   and business continuity plans to assess their feasibility in scenarios of severe business
                                   disruption which might plausibly affect the bank. In so doing, the supervisor determines that
                                   the bank is able to operate as a going concern and minimize losses, including those that
                                   may arise from disturbances to payment and settlement systems, in the event of severe
                                   business disruption.

Description and findings regarding Banks are not required in the Regulations to develop and implement a comprehensive
EC4                                disaster recovery plan. The FSS issued a guideline in 2006 on BCP which banks are expected
                                   to implement (though not legally enforceable).

                                  Standardized Approach would have less emphasis. Internal FSS benchmarks for acceptable
                                  DR testing and BCP capability was not well developed. More attention could be paid to this
                                  area of operational risk.

EC5                               The supervisor determines that banks have established appropriate information technology
                                  policies and processes to identify, assess, monitor and manage technology risks. The
                                  supervisor also determines that banks have appropriate and sound information technology
                                  infrastructure to meet their current and projected business requirements (under normal
                                  circumstances and in periods of stress), which ensures data and system integrity, security
                                  and availability and supports integrated and comprehensive risk management.

Description and findings re EC5   To ensure banks operate with appropriate information technology, banks must maintain
                                  information technology infrastructure, including various contingency plans. Bank supervisors
                                  periodically assess bank information technology infrastructure to ensure safety and
                                  soundness. The Regulations do not stipulate requirements for sound information
                                  technology. Alternatively, the FSC has issued a document that provides guidance for banks –
                                  ‘Regulation of Supervision of Electronic financial transaction’.

EC6                               The supervisor determines that banks have appropriate and effective information systems
                                  to:

                                  (a)   Monitor operational risk;

                                  (b)   Compile and analyze operational risk data; and

                                  (c)   Facilitate appropriate reporting mechanisms at the banks’ Boards, senior management
                                        and business line levels that support proactive management of operational risk.

Description and findings regarding For the purpose of operational risk measurement, banks must maintain an effective
EC6                                information system that regularly assesses the bank’s operational risk processes and
                                   framework. The Bank Examination Team will assess a bank’s operational risk management
                                   framework during the full scope onsite examination as part of the CAMELR. The examination
                                   will include a checklist of governance items, management and measurement, including how
                                   data is verified and reported through the operational risk unit to the BoD.

                                  For AMA banks, scrutiny of how internal loss data is managed in a consistent and bank-wide
                                  fashion is critical for the bank’s internal models to produce accurate estimates. Supervisory
                                  processes for verifying the input of operational risk losses into the operational risk system
                                  was not well developed. Importantly the Regulations permit the exclusion of credit related
                                  operational risk losses from inclusion in statistical models, even when the losses are caused
                                  by fraud (external and internal). This has the potential to minimize operational risk loss data
                                  history.

EC7                               The supervisor requires that banks have appropriate reporting mechanisms to keep the
                                  supervisor apprised of developments affecting operational risk at banks in their jurisdictions.

                                     Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

Description and findings regarding Banks must maintain management systems that identify and measure operational risk and
EC7                                facilitates data collection on operational activities. An evaluation mechanism for operational
                                   risk management must also be maintained. In addition, banks must take steps to keep bank
                                   supervisors apprised of operational risk performance and records each quarter. While banks
                                   are required to report changes to operational risk management systems or where an event
                                   occurs that makes it unable to satisfy the minimum requirements of the operational risk
                                   framework, there is no compulsion in the Regulations, for the bank to keep the FSS apprised
                                   of developments affecting operational risk at banks on a continuous basis. That is,
                                   immediately if an incident occurs. The expectations for reporting of financial irregularities is
                                   well established within the banking system and appears to be highly efficient. For
                                   operational risk events that do not satisfy the ‘financial irregularity definition, the reporting
                                   protocol is not well developed.

EC8                                  The supervisor determines that banks have established appropriate policies and processes
                                     to assess, manage and monitor outsourced activities. The outsourcing risk management
                                     program covers:

                                     (a)   Conducting appropriate due diligence for selecting potential service providers;

                                     (b)   Structuring the outsourcing arrangement;

                                     (c)   Managing and monitoring the risks associated with the outsourcing arrangement;

                                     (d)   Ensuring an effective control environment; and

                                     (e)   Establishing viable contingency planning.


                                     Outsourcing policies and processes require the bank to have comprehensive contracts
                                     and/or service level agreements with a clear allocation of responsibilities between the
                                     outsourcing provider and the bank.

Description and findings regarding The assessor could not confirm the regulations for out-sourcing. This will be followed up in
EC8                                due course.

Additional Criteria

AC1                                  The supervisor regularly identifies any common points of exposure to operational risk or
                                     potential vulnerability (e.g. outsourcing of key operations by many banks to a common
                                     service provider or disruption to outsourcing providers of payment and settlement
                                     activities).

Description and findings regarding The bank regulations do not stipulate any requirements for outsourcing. There are however
AC1                                ancillary regulations for electronic banking that set general standards—[Article 60,
                                   Regulation on Business Delegation of Financial Institutions; Annex 3(260), Detailed
                                   Regulation on Business Delegation of Financial Institutions]. For outsourcing on electronic
                                   banking, banks must provide for contingency plans for disruption, protection of the backup
                                   data and the backup system.

                                     Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

                                    It was not clear that the FSS had mapped the providers of outsourced services to the
                                    domestic banks and identified whether common points of vulnerability or concentration
                                    existed.

Assessment of Principle 25          LC


Comments                            Regulations are generally comprehensive regarding the responsibilities for the
                                    measurement and management of operational risk. There are however, gaps in relation to
                                    expectations of minimum standards associated with business continuity and disaster
                                    recovery. There is an absence of notification requirements that would alert supervisors
                                    promptly if weaknesses were identified i.e. failure of a BCP or DR test.

                                    Inputs into offsite analysis of operational risk could be improved with more granular detail,
                                    mainly detail regarding nature of internal loss data i.e. high value – low frequency or low
                                    frequency—high value etc. Currently, qualitative loss data from banks as an input to offsite
                                    analysis does not allow for (i) comparison between banks to identify emerging trends or
                                    outliers; and (ii) lack of detail about the individual loss. In this regard, peer group
                                    benchmarking of loss data would enrich the benefits of this analysis.

                                    Processes concerning validation and monitoring of internal models needs improvement.
                                    Currently, models are not validated independently and is not a requirement within the
                                    regulations. Typically validation is performed by members associated with development of
                                    internal models which could create a conflict of interest. Validation of model outputs is an
                                    important component of the risk management and governance framework and the
                                    requirement strengthens the robustness of the process.

Principle 26                        Internal control and audit. The supervisor determines that banks have adequate internal
                                    control frameworks to establish and maintain a properly controlled operating environment
                                    for the conduct of their business taking into account their risk profile. These include clear
                                    arrangements for delegating authority and responsibility; separation of the functions that
                                    involve committing the bank, paying away its funds, and accounting for its assets and
                                    liabilities; reconciliation of these processes; safeguarding the bank’s assets; and appropriate
                                    independent59 internal audit and compliance functions to test adherence to these controls
                                    as well as applicable laws and regulations.

Essential Criteria

EC1                                 Laws, regulations or the supervisor require banks to have internal control frameworks that
                                    are adequate to establish a properly controlled operating environment for the conduct of
                                    their business, taking into account their risk profile. These controls are the responsibility of
                                    the bank’s Board and/or senior management and deal with organizational structure,
                                    accounting policies and processes, checks and balances, and the safeguarding of assets and

        59
           In assessing independence, supervisors give due regard to the control systems designed to avoid conflicts of
        interest in the performance measurement of staff in the compliance, control and internal audit functions. For
        example, the remuneration of such staff should be determined independently of the business lines that they oversee.

Description and findings regarding Bank internal control and audit requirements are addressed in Article 23-3 of the Banking
EC1                                Act and Article 17–2 of the Enforcement Decree.

                                   The Act defines internal controls as a set of fundamental standards to ensure sound
                                   management, and to protect a banks’ stockholders, depositors etc (Article 23–3), and
                                   requires at least one person (referred to as ‘compliance officer’) assigned to monitor
                                   whether the internal control standards are observed and to investigate and report any
                                   violation to the Audit Committee. The reference to the compliance officer in the Article
                                   means, in practice, an Internal Auditor.

                                   Article 23–2 sets out the requirements for banks to establish an Audit Committee (AC)
                                   including the requirement for the AC to be comprised of at least two-thirds ‘outside
                                   directors’ (independent directors). In addition, the Article requires at least one member of
                                   the AC to be an accounting or financial specialist. Article 17 of the Enforcement Decree of
                                   the Banking Act sets out more details regarding what is meant by a ‘financial specialist’ in
                                   Article 23–3 of the Banking Act, i.e., qualified CPA etc.

                                   Article 17–2 establishes what matters shall be contained within banks’ internal control
                                   standards as prescribed by Article 23–3 of the Banking Act, including: division of duties and
                                   organizational structure, procedures for internal control standards, management
                                   information systems etc. Annex 8-2 of the Detailed Regulations sets out the individual items
                                   to be included in the scope of work performed by the Internal Audit function, including:

                                        Appropriateness of internal control standards;

                                        Appropriateness of organization for internal control;

      Each of the above topics are broken down further into specific areas.

      The FSS oversees bank’s compliance with internal controls through various supervisory
      tools. The information that is required to be submitted to the FSS regarding IA is governed
      by Articles 41–42 of the RSBB which covers any major financial deficiencies. In addition to
      exceptional reporting, the regulations require banks to submit to the FSS results of IA
      reports, the IA annual plan and how the IA function is tracking against the audit plan. In the
      event the FSS has been advised of any financial irregularities, the FSS is obliged to verify the
      incident as per Article 41 of the Regulations. Based on the report, the FSS will investigate as
      part of the onsite review.

      A review of internal controls and the Internal Audit function is required as part of the full
      scope examination that is performed every two years, but not required as part of the partial
      examination which is thematic based. In preparing for the onsite examination, supervisors
      will take into consideration a variety of material such as:

          Financial reports;

          Any reports of financial irregularities;

          The results from specific internal audit reports;

          An evaluation of the internal audit plan;

          Audit Committee papers;

          IA policies and procedures; and

          Structure diagrams of BoD.

      The onsite examination will involve interviews with staff and sample testing of IA reports.
      The FSS examination team will typically meet with several levels of relevant IA and
      compliance staff. Typically, a meeting with the Chair of the AC will be conducted via the
      Deputy Governor or Head of Banking and Non-Banking Supervision. However, the
      examination team will not meet directly with the AC.

      Findings from the examination of internal control and audit will be included in a report to
      the bank and the risk assessment will be updated in the management section of the
      CAMELR rating.

EC2   The supervisor determines that there is an appropriate balance in the skills and resources of
      the back office, control functions and operational management relative to the business
      origination units. The supervisor also determines that the staff of the back office and control
      functions have sufficient expertise and authority within the organization (and, where
      appropriate, in the case of control functions, sufficient access to the bank’s Board) to be an
      effective check and balance to the business origination units.

                                      Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

Description and findings regarding Article 23–3 of the Banking Act, paragraph 4 sets out the minimum requirements for the
EC2                                Compliance Officer (Head of IA) which must meet a number of criteria, including experience
                                   i.e. at least ten years at an institution that has been subject to inspection etc. Article 17–4 of
                                   the Enforcement Decree prescribes the powers of the compliance officer to request material
                                   from bank executives and officers.

                                     As per the FSS Bank Examination Manual, the adequacy of expertise and authority of IA and
                                     compliance is assessed as part of CAMEL-R via the onsite examination. For the larger
                                     systemic banks, this process is performed every two years as part of the full scope
                                     examination. The FSS assesses a bank’s organizational structure as part of this process to
                                     assess independence of the control functions.

                                     Greater linkage of the banks’ risk profile is warranted to be risk-based rather than
                                     compliance based. The FSS uses both interviews and sample testing of IA files to verify the
                                     adequacy of the IA and compliance function.

                                     In order to assess the expertise and integrity of control functions and back office staff within
                                     the organization, the FSS carries out onsite inspections aimed at verifying whether:

                                         The staff assigned to control functions have skills and competences adequate to their
                                          responsibilities and to the degree of specializations of the tasks that they carry out;
                                          there are proper and dedicate recruitment procedures;

                                         The tasks and the resources assigned to the control functions are coherent with the
                                          dimensions and features of the business;

                                         There are training programs for the staff and investments to strengthen the internal
                                          control framework; and

                                         There is adequate job rotation within each control function and proper tutorial
                                          program for new staff.

EC3                                  The supervisor determines that banks have an adequately staffed, permanent and
                                     independent compliance function60 that assists senior management in managing effectively
                                     the compliance risks faced by the bank. The supervisor determines that staff within the
                                     compliance function are suitably trained, have relevant experience and have sufficient
                                     authority within the bank to perform their role effectively. The supervisor determines that
                                     the bank’s Board exercises oversight of the management of the compliance function.

EC3                                  resourcing for internal control staff, determines that staff within the compliance function are
                                     suitably trained, have relevant experience and have sufficient authority within the bank to
                                     perform their role effectively. The supervisor determines that the bank’s Board exercises
                                     oversight of the management of the compliance function. Minutes of the Audit Committee
                                     and Board resolutions are examined.

                                     Banks are typically structured with separate compliance functions and IA with individual
                                     reporting lines, in some cases compliance directly through to the Risk Committee. In most
                                     cases, Internal Audit reported directly to the AC.

EC4                                  The supervisor determines that banks have an independent, permanent and effective
                                     internal audit function62 charged with:

                                     (a)   Assessing whether existing policies, processes and internal controls (including risk
                                           management, compliance and corporate governance processes) are effective,
                                           appropriate and remain sufficient for the bank’s business; and

                                     (b)   Ensuring that policies and processes are complied with.

Description and findings regarding Through on-site examinations of the CAMEL-R, the FSS assesses whether the bank’s Board
EC4                                or senior management adequately oversees the effectiveness of bank’s internal control
                                   framework on an ongoing basis, and complies with necessary procedures to establish or
                                   change internal controls. The examinations will verify the existence of bank’s policies,
                                   procedures and internal controls. The degree of testing and depth of examination could be
                                   enhanced.

                                     The audit plan is submitted by the bank to the FSS on an annual basis. FSS staff will assess
                                     the plan against their own view of risk and compliance. Through the onsite examination,
                                     staff will review the execution of the plan and will analyze audit findings and how audit
                                     issues have been closed.

EC5                                  The supervisor determines that the internal audit function:

                                     (a)   Has sufficient resources, and staff that are suitably trained and have relevant
                                           experience to understand and evaluate the business they are auditing;

                                     (b)   Has appropriate independence with reporting lines to the bank’s Board or to an audit
                                           committee of the Board, and has status within the bank to ensure that senior
                                           management reacts to and acts upon its recommendations;

                                     (c)   Is kept informed in a timely manner of any material changes made to the bank’s risk
                                           management strategy, policies or processes;


        management, provided such staff also have a reporting line through to the head of compliance who should be
        independent from business lines.
        62
          The term “internal audit function” does not necessarily denote an organizational unit. Some countries allow small
        banks to implement a system of independent reviews, e.g., conducted by external experts, of key internal controls as
        an alternative.

                                     The regulations do not refer to the minimum expectations in regards to outsourcing. The
                                     supervisory activities to assess outsourcing is inconsistently applied across the banks and

Assessment of Principle 26           C

Comments                             The regulations pertaining to internal control and audit are generally comprehensive. There
                                     is a strong focus on internal controls within the Regulations which is reflected in the extent
                                     of offsite analysis and data submitted by the bank to the FSS. The onsite examination also
                                     has a strong focus on the effectiveness of Internal Audit.

                                     Area for comment. For bank FHC’s, the onsite assessment of internal audit focuses
                                     principally on the bank operations. While the bank might account for the majority of total
                                     assets, potential internal control issues might exist that could create contagion risks. FHC’s
                                     by their nature are complex and engage in a multitude of business lines with potential for

                                      provided with a sufficient amount of detail regarding Internal Audit’s assessment of the
                                      non-bank, including other regulated entities to identify potential thematic issues, but also

Principle 27                          Financial reporting and external audit. The supervisor determines that banks and banking
                                      groups maintain adequate and reliable records, prepare financial statements in accordance
                                      with accounting policies and practices that are widely accepted internationally and annually
                                      publish information that fairly reflects their financial condition and performance and bears
                                      an independent external auditor’s opinion. The supervisor also determines that banks and
                                      parent companies of banking groups have adequate governance and oversight of the

Essential Criteria

EC1                                   The supervisor63 holds the bank’s Board and management responsible for ensuring that
                                      financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting policies and practices that
                                      are widely accepted internationally and that these are supported by recordkeeping systems
                                      in order to produce adequate and reliable data.

Description and findings regarding Article 32 of the Regulations requires banks to prepare their financial statements according
EC1                                to IFRS. The Article states that “Every financial institution shall comply with accounting
                                   standards referred to as Korean IFRS as determined by IFRS of the IASB and pursuant to
                                   Article 13(1) of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies (AEASC).” Article 13(1) states
                                   that the FSC shall determine the accounting practices for companies in accordance with
                                   IASB. The definition of financial institutions is sufficiently broad to encompass all deposit
                                   taking institutions.

                                      As per Article 7.3 of the Enforcement Decree of the AEASC, the Korea Accounting Standards
                                      Board (KASB) has been delegated responsibility for establishing accounting standards which
                                      are then endorsed by the FSC and in 2011, Korea adopted the translated version of IFRS for
                                      stock listed corporations and financial institutions set by IASB. In order for the standards to
                                      be fully effective, KASB re-established them as K-IRFS and were then endorsed by the FSC.

                                      While all banks are required to prepare their financial statements in accordance with KIFRS,
                                      there are two exceptions: KEXIM and Suhyup Bank. Both banks remain using Korea GAAP.
                                      KEXIM plans to implement IFRS from fiscal year 2013 and Suhyup Bank from 2014. Both
                                      banks are specialized banks which are government owned. The reason for the exception to
                                      the accounting rules for these two banks was not confirmed. Both banks are within the top
                                      10 banks in Korea. No gap analysis has been performed to identify the main differences
                                      between the financial statements for these two banks. In terms of the accounting treatment
                                      for loan losses, both apply either the minimum accumulation rate of allowance or expected
                                      loss, whichever is the largest.

          In this Essential Criterion, the supervisor is not necessarily limited to the banking supervisor. The responsibility for
        ensuring that financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting policies and practices may also be
        vested with securities and market supervisors.

                    Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

                    Article 447 of the Commercial Act provide for full Board responsibility of the financial
                    reports.

                    Article 43–2 of the Banking Act establishes the power for reporting to the FSS. The article
                    states that banks are required to report to the FSS stating the details of its performance. The
                    report is required to be signed by a representative person in charge or his agent. The Act
                    does not however require the financial statements to be prepared and approved by an
                    independent officer of the bank such as a CFO. This necessary separation of preparation and
                    approval of financial statements from the head of business and those of financial control is
                    seen as a material weakness for integrity of financial data.

                    According to Article 2–2 of AEASC a representative bank’s senior management is
                    responsible to run internal controls on financial reporting, including identification,
                    measurement, classification, recording, reporting, error control, internal verification, and
                    record keeping of accounting information.

                    According to AEASC a stock company ( defined as a company that is limited by shares)
                    which meets the following criteria is required to have its financial statements audited by an
                    external auditor:

                        A stock company with total assets equal to or greater than KRW 10 billion as of the
                         end of the preceding fiscal year;

                        A listed company and a stock company which intends to be listed in the relevant
                         business year or the following business year; a stock company with total assets and
                         total liabilities each equal to or greater than 7 billion won as of the end of the
                         preceding fiscal year; and

                         A stock company with total assets equal to or greater than 7 billion won and with 300
                          employees or more as of the end of the preceding fiscal year.
                    Article 2.2 of AEASC, paragraphs 3–5 establishes the need for an individual to be
                    accountable for the reporting of financial statements and a dedicated director of the Board.
                    However, the Article does not specify that the officer of the company hold an independent
                    role separate from business management. Nor does the director need to be an outside
                    director (independent non executive).

                    The Act of Capital Markets and Financial Investment Services Article 159—requires a CEO
                    and CFO that report financial statements will both sign, this Act does not necessarily cover
                    all deposit taking institutions, but will capture all the domestic banks and those listed on the
                    stock exchange.

                    Reporting of financial information (Business Reports) submitted to the FSS on a quarterly
                    basis are not required to be produced by an independent officer of the bank and are not
                    required to be audited. To validate the Business Reports, the FSS performs analysis to
                    determine outliers etc.

                    Under the Commerce Act, banks are required to submit to its auditors and external auditors
                    the financial statements approved by the Board. General meeting of the shareholders grants
                    the final approval of the financial statements based on the result of the audit.

EC2                                  The supervisor holds the bank’s Board and management responsible for ensuring that the
                                     financial statements issued annually to the public bear an independent external auditor’s
                                     opinion as a result of an audit conducted in accordance with internationally accepted
                                     auditing practices and standards.

Description and findings regarding The Act on External Audit of Stock Companies requires banks to ensure that the financial
EC2                                statements issued annually bear external auditor’s opinion. Publicly listed banks or banks
                                   with outstanding stock and/or bond issues offered and sold to more than a certain number
                                   of investors are required to publicly disclose their quarterly and semi-annual financial
                                   statements bearing the opinion of external auditors pursuant to the Financial Investment
                                   Services and Capital Markets Act.

                                     Currently, external audits are conducted in accordance with the International Standards on
                                     Auditing (2005). However, starting from financial year 2014, Korea will implement use of
                                     Clarified ISA (2012).

EC3                                  The supervisor determines that banks use valuation practices consistent with accounting
                                     standards widely accepted internationally. The supervisor also determines that the
                                     framework, structure and processes for fair value estimation are subject to independent
                                     verification and validation, and that banks document any significant differences between the
                                     valuations used for financial reporting purposes and for regulatory purposes.

Description and findings regarding The FSS establishes the standards on fair value estimation and foreign currency translation
EC3                                within the range allowed under the IFRS. In principle, securities portfolios are classified and
                                   valued according to IAS 39 or IFRS: trading, available for sale, and held to maturity.
                                   Securities classified as trading and available for sale are subject to fair valuation principles
                                   and securities classified as held to maturity are evaluated based on their amortized cost.
                                   Transfer of classified securities is supervised through both offsite and onsite analysis
                                   (Annexes 4 and 5, Detailed Regulations).

                                     Banks are required to adhere to the standards and have their fair value estimations audited
                                     by external auditors (Article 32, Regulations). Annex 3 of the Detailed Regulations provides a
                                     list of deductions to be excluded in the calculation of BIS capital ratio. Banks are required to
                                     include this in the Business Report submitted to the FSS.

EC4                                  Laws or regulations set, or the supervisor has the power to establish the scope of external
                                     audits of banks and the standards to be followed in performing such audits. These require
                                     the use of a risk and materiality based approach in planning and performing the external
                                     audit.

Description and findings regarding Under Article 5 of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies, companies that meet the
EC4                                definitions and thresholds within the Act are subject to external audits which follow auditing
                                   standards that are based on the ISA. However there is no specific reference in the banking
                                   regulations per se that requires banks to have an external auditor appointed to prepare
                                   financial statements. The larger systemic banks in Korea meet the definitions and thresholds
                                   within the AEASC based on total assets and listing status.

                                     The exception are specialized banks or state owned banks which are not subject to the
                                     AEASC.



                                                                                                                       167

                                     Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

                                    The bank regulations do not provide the FSS the power to establish the scope of external
                                    audits of banks and non-banks or the standards of such audits.

                                    Under the ISA, auditing approaches are based on the risks and importance of audit planning
                                    and implementation. (Starting from financial year 2014, Clarified ISA will apply.) The Korean
                                    auditing standards are set by the Korean Institute of Certified Public Accountants (KICPA)
                                    subject to approval by the FSC.

EC5                                 Supervisory guidelines or local auditing standards determine that audits cover areas such as
                                    the loan portfolio, loan loss provisions, non-performing assets, asset valuations, trading and
                                    other securities activities, derivatives, asset securitizations, consolidation of and other
                                    involvement with off-balance sheet vehicles and the adequacy of internal controls over
                                    financial reporting.

Description and findings re EC5     Article 2–3 of the Act on External Audit of Stock Holding Companies requires the bank to
                                    have its internal controls on financial reporting reviewed by external auditors. The audit
                                    report must include auditor’s opinion on the result of the review of the internal controls on
                                    financial reporting.

                                    In terms of the financial statements, as per the AEASC, a bank is required to adhere to the
                                    KIFRS, and to cover in its external audits areas such as loan portfolio, loan loss provisions,
                                    non-performing assets, asset valuations, trading and other securities activities, derivatives,
                                    asset securitizations, consolidation of off-balance sheet items. (Articles 2–3, and 5, Act on
                                    External Audit of Stock Companies; Article 32, Regulations).

                                    The AEASC does not prescribe what work the external auditor needs to perform to confirm
                                    the calculation of risk-weighted assets or the eligibility of capital instruments in the
                                    calculation of regulatory capital as disclosed in the annual report. The external auditor will
                                    provide an audit opinion of the reasonableness of the capital base in accordance with KIFRS,
                                    but not in relation to compliance with the banking Act and Regulations. Because the AEASC
                                    is a standard for stock companies generally and not a bank specific standard, it is
                                    questionable whether the AEASC is sufficiently bespoke to sufficiently capture the capital
                                    adequacy calculation.

EC6                                 The supervisor has the power to reject and rescind the appointment of an external auditor
                                    who is deemed to have inadequate expertise or independence, or is not subject to or does
                                    not adhere to established professional standards.

Description and findings regarding In the event of a disciplinary action against an external auditor, including license revocation
EC6                                and business suspension, prevents the bank’s external auditor from conducting audits, the
                                   bank must appoint another auditor within two months and report the change to the FSS (as
                                   per Article 4 of the AEASC).

                                    However, the regulations do not provide the FSS or FSC the power to reject or rescind the
                                    appointment of an auditor. No examples where the supervisor has acted to rescind or reject
                                    an EA. Where evidence of malfeasance or breach of duty has been identified, the FSS has
                                    exercised its powers. Examples include mid 2000 where one commercial bank was found to
                                    be in violation and ordered to change auditor.

                                    A particular weakness of the existing framework is that there is no additional hurdle for
                                    auditors to be appointed a bank auditor. The Korean Institute of CPAs (KICPA) is responsible
                                    for licensing, monitoring and disciplinary actions of its membership. The process for
                                    certification as an auditor involves two examinations followed by two years of practice and
                                    at least 100 hours of training per year in those two years followed by another exam. Within
                                    the training offered, there is no specific banking-related modules, but mainly IFRS.

EC7                                 The supervisor determines that banks rotate their external auditors (either the firm or
                                    individuals within the firm) from time to time.

Description and findings re EC7     An auditor who is an accounting firm must not have the same partner perform the audit of
                                    a company for six or more consecutive business years (four or more consecutive business
                                    years in case of stock-listed companies). In case of stock-listed companies, the partner of an
                                    audit firm who has performed the audit of a company for three consecutive business years
                                    is prohibited from performing the audit of the company for the next three business years
                                    (Article 3, Act on External Audit of Stock Companies).

                                    If CPAs from the same accounting firm as the auditor who is an accounting firm has
                                    participated in the audit of a listed company as auditing assistants for three consecutive
                                    years, the auditor must replace more than two thirds of assistances in the next business
                                    year.

EC8                                 The supervisor meets periodically with external audit firms to discuss issues of common
                                    interest relating to bank operations.

Description and findings regarding Pursuant to Article 48 of the Banking Act, the FSS can request the external auditor to submit
EC8                                information, including data on soundness of a bank, obtained in the course of auditing the
                                   bank. Further, under Article 15 of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies, the FSS
                                   may assess whether an audit has been performed fairly and request the auditors to submit
                                   data, state opinions or make reports.

                                    However, the FSS will not meet with the external auditor as part of the full scope
                                    examination or partial. The FSS requests the working papers every time they perform the full
                                    scope examination. In the case of FHCs, the selection of working papers is driven by the
                                    materiality of subsidiary as opposed to risk profile. In practice, only significant subsidiaries
                                    (measured by total assets) are focused upon.

                                    To enhance audit quality, the FSS oversees the auditing systems of auditors by conducting
                                    inspections on a regular basis for accounting firms that (i) audit one percent or more of all
                                    listed companies, (ii) audit any listed companies with assets of KRW 1 trillion or more, (iii)
                                    employ 30 or more CPAs, or (iv) require an inspection in the SFC/FSS judgment. For all other
                                    firms that do not meet the above thresholds, the responsibilities for performing inspection
                                    of external audit firms audit systems is delegated to the KICPA.

                                    The onsite examinations performed by the FSS consist of two parts: inspection of the quality
                                    control system and a review of audit engagements. The inspection of quality control
                                    systems will consider the adequacy of the audit firms ‘organizational arrangements such as
                                    leadership, ethical requirements of staff, human resources etc.

EC9                                 The supervisor requires the external auditor, directly or through the bank, to report to the
                                    supervisor matters of material significance, for example failure to comply with the licensing
                                    criteria or breaches of banking or other laws, significant deficiencies and control weaknesses
                                    in the bank’s financial reporting process or other matters that they believe are likely to be of
                                    material significance to the functions of the supervisor. Laws or regulations provide that
                                    auditors who make any such reports in good faith cannot be held liable for breach of a duty
                                    of confidentiality.

Description and findings regarding Pursuant to Article 48 of the Banking Act, the FSS can request the external auditor to submit
EC9                                information, including data on soundness of the bank, obtained in the course of auditing
                                   the bank. While the Banking Act permits the supervisor access to results of the external
                                   auditor, the EA is not required to inform the FSS if it identifies matters of material
                                   significance to the FSS.

                                    Under Article 15 of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies, the FSS may assess
                                    whether an audit have been performed fairly and request the auditors to submit data, state
                                    opinions or make reports. The regulations do not, however provide for the protection of the
                                    auditor.

Additional Criteria

AC1                                 The supervisor has the power to access external auditors’ working papers, where necessary.

Description and findings regarding Pursuant to Article 48 of the Banking Act, the FSS can request the external auditor to submit

Assessment of Principle 27          LC

Comments                            Key factors driving the rating:

                                        The regulations do not permit the FSS the power to establish the scope of external
                                         audits and while the supervisor will review the working papers of the external auditor
                                         in performing its onsite examination, there were no examples in practice where the FSS
                                         had influenced the scope of an external audit;

                                        The Banking Act and Regulations do not require an auditor to be appointed to a
                                         deposit-taking institution. Alternatively, the Act of External Audit for Stock Companies
                                         applies a threshold for an auditor to be approved which will typically capture the
                                         domestic banks due to their size. In the case where an auditor does not need to audit
                                         the financial statements of a deposit taking institution, the integrity and reliability of
                                         the accounts is weakened;

                                        If the supervisor considers a specific risk type of line of business to be higher risk, there
                                         is not the provision within the regulations to commission the EA to look at this issue as
                                         part of the external audit;

                                        The Act of EA does not contain specific reference to audits that need to be risk and
                                         materiality based; and

                                          The FSS does not have the power to reject and rescind the appointment of an external
                                           auditor who is deemed to have inadequate expertise or independence, or is not
                                           subject to or does not adhere to established professional standards. EC6 Instead, the
                                           removal of external auditors is left to the audit profession. There have been no
                                           incidences where the FSS or FSC has taken action in this regard to dismiss an auditor.

                                     Other comments: The FSS will not typically meet with the external auditor as part of the
                                     supervision process. The supervisory will meet on an exception basis only. Use of external
                                     auditor in reviewing subsidiaries. Currently not risk based, could better leverage their risk
                                     assessment supervisory tools to identify particular risk areas within the FHCs for the EA to
                                     assess.

Principle 28                         Disclosure and transparency. The supervisor determines that banks and banking groups
                                     regularly publish information on a consolidated and, where appropriate, solo basis that is
                                     easily accessible and fairly reflects their financial condition, performance, risk exposures, risk
                                     management strategies and corporate governance policies and processes.

Essential Criteria

EC1                                  Laws, regulations or the supervisor require periodic public disclosures64 of information by
                                     banks on a consolidated and, where appropriate, solo basis that adequately reflect the
                                     bank’s true financial condition and performance, and adhere to standards promoting
                                     comparability, relevance, reliability and timeliness of the information disclosed.

Description and findings regarding Article 32 of the Banking Act requires banks to prepare their financial statements according
EC1                                to IFRS under which banks have public disclosure obligations. Under the Uniform Disclosure
                                   Standards for Financial Businesses set by the Korea Federation of Banks, banks are required
                                   to disclose information required by Pillar 3 of Basel II standards. The annual Pillar 3
                                   disclosures are required to be disclosed on the Korean Federation of Banks website and
                                   typically are not made as part of the Annual Reports of the larger systemic banks or made
                                   available on their websites. The Pillar 3 disclosures follow standardized templates across the
                                   various financial and qualitative areas. Article 43–3 in the banking Act states that a Bank
                                   shall disclose matters prescribed by Presidential Decree that are necessary for the protection
                                   of depositors and investors to the general public as determined by the FSC. Article 24
                                   (Public Disclosure of Management) sets out the matters that should be included in the
                                   public disclosures:

                                     (1)   Matters concerning financial affairs, and profits and losses;

                                     (2)   Matters concerning fund raising and operation; and

                                     (3)   Details of sanctions.

                                     The Article states that the FSC can determine detailed standards concerning matters that
                                     need to be disclosed.

        64
          For the purposes of this Essential Criterion, the disclosure requirement may be found in applicable accounting,
        stock exchange listing, or other similar rules, instead of or in addition to directives issued by the supervisor.

                                     Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions

                                    Article 41 of the Regulations on Supervision prescribe the requirements for banks’
                                    disclosures. Banks are required to publicly release their financial statements within three
                                    months of its end of financial year and two months for quarterly financial reporting. Banks’
                                    financial statements shall be published in accord with the Uniform Management Publication
                                    Standards of Financial Business determined by the Chairman of the Korea Federation of
                                    Banks (Article 41, paragraph 2). Accounts are prepared on a six monthly basis and annual
                                    audited by an external auditor.

                                    There are no requirements within the regulations for banks to disclose information on a solo
                                    basis even when they are significant banks within a banking group. There are a number of
                                    FHCs with significant/material bank subsidiaries within the group structure. Where a bank is
                                    a subsidiary of a listed company or listed itself, the disclosure rules are governed by the
                                    Korea Exchange Disclosure Regulations, which do not require accounts for material
                                    subsidiaries of a bank to disclose financial statements. The regulations are not sufficiently
                                    comprehensive to require public disclosure of accounts on a solo basis and does not specify
                                    the circumstances where this would be appropriate. The regulations do not refer to
                                    principles of transparency and comparability, relevance and reliability.

                                    The FSS has not issued stipulations for Pillar 3 disclosure statements. This responsibility has
                                    been delegated to the Federation of Korean Banks. Requirements for Regulations that
                                    govern Pillar 3 disclosure are not well developed for the qualitative aspect of disclosures
                                    and for internal model user’s level of detail insufficient.

                                    The FSS reviews the public data but the supervisory framework does not integrate the Pillar
                                    3 data into the onsite or offsite surveillance.

EC2                                 The supervisor determines that the required disclosures include both qualitative and
                                    quantitative information on a bank’s financial performance, financial position, risk
                                    management strategies and practices, risk exposures, aggregate exposures to related
                                    parties, transactions with related parties, accounting policies, and basic business,
                                    management, governance and remuneration. The scope and content of information
                                    provided and the level of disaggregation and detail is commensurate with the risk profile
                                    and systemic importance of the bank.

Description and findings regarding Under the Uniform Disclosure Standards for Financial Businesses, the required disclosures
EC2                                include information on bank’s organizational structure (organizational chart, number of
                                   branches and ATMs), employees and management, subsidiaries (both on consolidated and
                                   non-consolidated bases), capital, large shareholders, overall shareholding structure, profit,

                                   statements, and earnings by division (Article 41, Regulations).

                                    Specific weakness is the requirements with regard to compensation which is not disclosed in

                                    Listed banks are required to disclose information on corporate governance in the report on

                                    report on operations. On the basis of the principle of proportionality, the level of detail of
                                    the disclosures is commensurate with the organizational complexity of the banks and the

EC4                                 The supervisor or another government agency effectively reviews and enforces compliance
                                    with disclosure standards.

Description and findings regarding Non-compliant banks can be subject to disciplinary actions including fines as per (Articles
EC4                                43–3, and 53, Banking Act; Article 8, Regulation on Examination and Sanctions against
                                   Financial Institutions). Managerial Disclosure Article 43.3 of the Banking Act requires certain
                                   financial information to be disclosed at the Federation of Korean Banks. But not on websites
                                   or in annual reports.

                                    The FSS on-site examination does not place a heavy reliance on assessing compliance with
                                    disclosure standards. The onsite examination will assess the reliability of systems to produce
                                    financial information with a strong focus on internal controls. In performing offsite analysis,
                                    there was not an emphasis on the analysis of Pillar 3 disclosures to complement and
                                    compare against data submitted directly to the FSS through the quarterly Business reports.

EC5                                 The supervisor or other relevant bodies regularly publishes information on the banking
                                    system in aggregate to facilitate public understanding of the banking system and the
                                    exercise of market discipline. Such information includes aggregate data on balance sheet
                                    indicators and statistical parameters that reflect the principal aspects of banks’ operations
                                    (balance sheet structure, capital ratios, income earning capacity, and risk profiles).

Description and findings regarding The FSS provides information on banks both on an individual and aggregate base on its
EC5                                website under the Financial Statistics section. Information available includes financial
                                   statements, funding, lending, profitability, asset soundness, capital adequacy, liquidity, types
                                   of loans receivables, and productivity.

Additional Criteria

AC1                                 The disclosure requirements imposed promote disclosure of information that will help in
                                    understanding a bank’s risk exposures during a financial reporting period, for example on
                                    average exposures or turnover during the reporting period.

Comments                              Main drivers of this rating include:

                                           No requirement for FHC’s with large banking subsidiaries to be disclosed. The
                                            regulations governing Pillar 3 disclosures are not sufficiently comprehensive to require
                                            public disclosure of accounts on a solo basis and does not specify the circumstances
                                            where this would be appropriate;

                                           Oversight of compensation arrangements for key executives not fully embedded within
                                            the supervisory framework; and

                                           Pillar 3 reports not well embedded into supervisory processes.

                                      There is room for the publicly available financial data to be used in the supervisory process.
                                      The FSS reviews the public data but the supervisory framework is not complete or
                                      comprehensive as to how to use this data and integrate into the CAMEL-R approach. FSS
                                      does not use consistently the public disclosed data to analyze against prudential reporting
                                      or perform reconciliations to identify key differences.

Principle 29                          Abuse of financial services. The supervisor determines that banks have adequate policies
                                      and processes, including strict customer due diligence (CDD) rules to promote high ethical
                                      and professional standards in the financial sector and prevent the bank from being used,
                                      intentionally or unintentionally, for criminal activities.65

Essential Criteria

EC1                                   Laws or regulations establish the duties, responsibilities and powers of the supervisor
                                      related to the supervision of banks’ internal controls and enforcement of the relevant laws
                                      and regulations regarding criminal activities.

Description and findings regarding Korea’s anti-money laundering (AML) legislation comprises the Financial Transaction
EC1                                Reports Act (FTRA) and the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA). According to Articles 3 and 11 of
                                   FTRA, Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KoFIU) is Korea’s AML authority. The KoFIU, which is
                                   part of the Financial Services Commission (FSC), is the lead agency in Korea for AML/CFT
                                   matters.

                                      While KoFIU is responsible for AML/CFT supervision, it may delegate responsibility for
                                      supervision to the FSS. In practice, the FIU has delegated responsibility to conduct the
                                      onsite examination of banks compliance with AML/CFT legislation to the Financial
                                      Supervisory Service (FSS). In practice, the FIU and FSS share the responsibility for
                                      supervision: FIU predominantly offsite supervision and FSS onsite examination of banks.



        65
           The Committee is aware that, in some jurisdictions, other authorities, such as a financial intelligence unit (FIU),
        rather than a banking supervisor, may have primary responsibility for assessing compliance with laws and regulations
        regarding criminal activities in banks, such as fraud, money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Thus, in the
        context of this Principle, “the supervisor” might refer to such other authorities, in particular in Essential Criteria 7, 8
             10
        and . In such jurisdictions, the banking supervisor cooperates with such authorities to achieve adherence with the
        criteria mentioned in this Principle.

                                    The FIU will receive regular reporting by the banks at a quarterly frequency such as
                                    Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) and Counter Terrorist Reports (CTRs). The FIU will also
                                    receive exception reports from the banks in the instance of financial irregularities. Based
                                    upon the reported data, the FIU will establish the direction and often influence the scope of
                                    the onsite examinations conducted by the FSS and the FIU developed the examination
                                    manual used by the FSS to conduct onsite examinations. However, the FIU does not have a
                                    well developed risk-based methodology to identify higher risk banks for enhanced
                                    supervision. In practice, the banks to be selected for onsite examination will be determined
                                    by the FSS as part of their supervisory cycle. In the event the FIU detects specific
                                    irregularities through bank reporting, it has the power to suggest and, if needed, instruct
                                    the FSS to examine a specific bank. The FIU is however, in the process of exploring a risk-
                                    based methodology for implementation in the near-term after the appropriate due
                                    diligence is completed.

                                    The FSS performs onsite examinations based on a two year frequency for full scope onsite
                                    examinations and partial examinations performed annually, but on a thematic basis. In
                                    establishing its onsite supervision plan, the FSS will liaise with the FIU and will adjust the
                                    scope of its supervision depending upon the policy direction set by the FIU.

                                    Banks are required to appoint an executive within the bank as a compliance officer
                                    responsible for AML/CFT as per Article 5 FTRA and Enforcement Decree.
                                    South Korea is a member of both the Financial Action Task Force (FATF; the AML/CFT
                                    standard setter), and of the Asia/Pacific Money Laundering Group (APG; the FATF-style
                                    regional body for Asia).

                                    South Korea was last assessed against the AML/CFT standard in November 2008 by a joint
                                    team of the FATF and the APG, and the mutual evaluation report was adopted in 2009.
                                    South Korea is tentatively scheduled to undergo its next full assessment in 2016.

                                    Since the last mutual evaluation report in 2009, Korea has made progress in addressing the
                                    main deficiencies identified, in particular by taking legislative and regulatory measures, and
                                    improving the implementation of the AML/CFT framework.

                                    The sanctions regime, nevertheless continues to raise some concerns because (i) the primary
                                    targets are not the financial institutions, but rather their employees and officials; and (ii)
                                    sanctions applied are mostly non-pecuniary sanctions. Pursuant to the action plan
                                    established after the adoption of the assessment report, Korea was to abolish the threshold
                                    for the reporting of suspicious transactions and to explicitly require financial institutions to
                                    file reports on attempted transactions, but, in 2012, Korea was behind schedule on both
                                    actions.

EC2                                 The supervisor determines that banks have adequate policies and processes that promote
                                    high ethical and professional standards and prevent the bank from being used, intentionally
                                    or unintentionally, for criminal activities. This includes the prevention and detection of
                                    criminal activity, and reporting of such suspected activities to the appropriate authorities.

          Consistent with international standards, banks are to report suspicious activities involving cases of potential money
        laundering and the financing of terrorism to the relevant national centre, established either as an independent
        governmental authority or within an existing authority or authorities that serves as an FIU.

Description and findings regarding As per Article 7 and 11 of the FTR Act, where necessary, KoFIU can share suspicious
EC4                                transaction report (STR) with the FSC and vice versa (which is internal within the FSC). The
                                   FSS reports information on suspicious banking activities to KoFIU and other law
                                   enforcement authorities, including the government prosecution authority.

                                    Korea continues to maintain a reporting threshold for suspicious transactions of 10m Won.
                                    A Bill has been put to the national assembly to repeal the threshold and is anticipated to
                                    abolish this. In reality 8–10 percent are below the 10m KW threshold.

EC5                                 The supervisor determines that banks establish CDD policies and processes that are well
                                    documented and communicated to all relevant staff. The supervisor also determines that
                                    such policies and processes are integrated into the bank’s overall risk management and
                                    there are appropriate steps to identify, assess, monitor, manage and mitigate risks of money
                                    laundering and the financing of terrorism with respect to customers, countries and regions,
                                    as well as to products, services, transactions and delivery channels on an ongoing basis. The
                                    CDD management program, on a group-wide basis, has as its essential elements:

                                    (a)   A customer acceptance policy that identifies business relationships that the bank will
                                          not accept based on identified risks;

                                    (b)   A customer identification, verification and due diligence program on an ongoing basis;
                                          this encompasses verification of beneficial ownership, understanding the purpose and
                                          nature of the business relationship, and risk-based reviews to ensure that records are
                                          updated and relevant;

                                    (c)   Policies and processes to monitor and recognize unusual or potentially suspicious
                                          transactions;
                                    (d)   Enhanced due diligence on high-risk accounts (e.g. escalation to the bank’s senior
                                          management level of decisions on entering into business relationships with these
                                          accounts or maintaining such relationships when an existing relationship becomes
                                          high-risk);

                                    (e)   Enhanced due diligence on politically exposed persons (including, among other things,
                                          escalation to the bank’s senior management level of decisions on entering into
                                          business relationships with these persons); and

                                    (f)   Clear rules on what records must be kept on CDD and individual transactions and their
                                          retention period. Such records have at least a five year retention period.

Description and findings            When assessing the compliance of banks with AML requirements, bank supervisors verify
regarding EC5                       whether the banks maintain appropriate policy and processes for CDD, record retention,
                                    and staff training. Bank supervisors also evaluate whether risk-based AML systems are in
                                    effect and whether the bank’s CDD programs appropriately incorporate recommendations
                                    put forth by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the inter-governmental organization.

EC6                                 The supervisor determines that banks have in addition to normal due diligence, specific
                                    policies and processes regarding correspondent banking. Such policies and processes
                                    include:

                                    (a)   Gathering sufficient information about their respondent banks to understand fully the
                                          nature of their business and customer base, and how they are supervised; and

                                    (b)   Not establishing or continuing correspondent relationships with those that do not
                                          have adequate controls against criminal activities or that are not effectively supervised
                                          by the relevant authorities, or with those banks that are considered to be shell banks.

Description and findings regarding Under the anti-money laundering laws and regulations, specifically Articles 58 & 59 of the
EC6                                Regulation on Anti-Money Laundering and Prohibition of Financing for Offenses of Public
                                   Intimidation, banks must ensure that their correspondent banks abide by AML systems and
                                   take the necessary precautions. The AML precautions include: (i) information collection and
                                   verification on the correspondent bank’s place of business, business activities, and
                                   governance; and (ii) the reputation and supervision quality of the correspondent bank’s
                                   home country, the AML regime, and CDD.

EC7                                 The supervisor determines that banks have sufficient controls and systems to prevent,
                                    identify and report potential abuses of financial services, including money laundering and
                                    the financing of terrorism.

Description and findings regarding As provided for under the AML and anti-terror financing regime, banks must maintain
EC7                                effective controls and systems against potential misuse of the financial system. Bank
                                   supervisors monitor and assess the controls and system during bank examinations.

EC8                                 The supervisor has adequate powers to take action against a bank that does not comply
                                    with its obligations related to relevant laws and regulations regarding criminal activities.

Description and findings regarding KoFIU has the authority to take actions against the breach of the AML legislation by
EC8                                financial institutions. Articles 11, 14, and 17, Financial Transaction Reports Act). The FSS is
                                   responsible for the supervision and regulation of all banks within Korea with no exemptions.
                                   The FIU has delegated responsibility for the examination of banks to the FSS. In terms of
                                   sanctions, the authority for sanctions against institutions lies with the FIU but is based on a
                                   FSS recommendation. This change had been implemented in March 2012 and took effect
                                   2013. When it comes to light disciplinary action FSS can act—sanctions against executives
                                   authority relies with FSS-FSC is in charge of examinations and sanctions and if in the course
                                   of offenses where fines imposed this will be decided by FIU.

Description and findings regarding The board, the senior management, and the reporting persons must have clear role and
EC10                               responsibility for the bank’s AML management system. In particular, the person responsible
                                   for reporting of AML matters must regularly evaluate the bank’s overall AML system and
                                   report the findings to the management. During on-site examination, bank supervisors
                                   periodically assess the soundness and effectiveness of the bank’s AML system and scrutinize
                                   transactions that warrant further inquiry for regulatory compliance.

                                    The reference in the regulations is as follows: Article 81, Regulation on Anti-Money
                                    Laundering and Prohibition of Financing for Offences of Public Intimidation.

Assessment of Principle 29          LC

Comments                                Factors driving the rating: Not a fully risk-based methodology for supervising banks
                                         (although the FIU is exploring a methodology); and

                                        Scope to expand oversight across the entire population of deposit taking institutions.
                                         At present attention has been focused on the domestic banks of which practices for
                                         AML are improving. FIU will transition its focus to strengthening practices in securities
                                         and insurance sectors and finally smaller non-banks where risk profile is comparatively
                                         higher but asset size is lower.

                                institutions.




   B. Authorities’ Response to the Assessment

   23.     The Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service of Korea
   (FSC/FSS) would first like to thank the IMF, the World Bank, and the FSAP mission team for
   their assessment work. The FSC/FSS fully expects to utilize the assessment outcome as an
   opportunity to further improve and strengthen Korea’s banking regulation and supervision. In fact,
   the FSC/FSS has already started on some of the mission team’s recommendations and plans to work
   on the remaining recommendations under an appropriate timetable. The FSC/FSS also reiterates the
   admonition the mission team has made in its report that this assessment is not appropriate for
   comparison with either previous assessments or other countries’ assessments.

   24.     From the outset, the FSC/FSS welcomed the BCP assessment as an opportunity to take
   a fresh look at the effectiveness of Korea’s banking regulation and supervision regimes and
   identify areas in need of improvement. It was for this reason that the FSC/FSS agreed to BCP
   assessment on the basis of both the Essential Criteria (EC) and the Additional Criteria (AC) under the
   revised core principles (CPs) even though the new criteria would subject Korea’s banking regime to
   far greater scrutiny than in the past.

   25.      The FSC/FSS disagrees with many of the CP ratings in the final assessment report with
   the judgment that the ratings do not adequately reflect the overall strength or effectiveness
   of Korea’s banking regulation and supervision. One case in point is the well-established practice
   of bank supervisors issuing supervisory guidance—such as guidelines on integrated risk
   management, stress test, and performance-based pay—that the banks promptly incorporate into
   their internal policy and carry out for full compliance. Supervisory guidance has long proven an
   effective and expeditious means of banking supervision in Korea, but the mission team’s assessment


   186
                                                                                   REPUBLIC OF KOREA



appears to suggest that supervisory guidance is not sufficient simply because it is an aberration
from written rules and regulations. The FSC/FSS therefore provides additional arguments for the
following CPs in order to bring greater balance to the mission team’s assessment.

Independence, accountability, resourcing and legal protection for supervisors (CP2)

26.     The FSC/FSS does not agree with the assessment of Principle 2 (Independence,
Accountability, Resourcing and Legal Protection for Supervisors) for the following reasons.
The mission team recommends that the FSC/FSS reconsider the representation of the Ministry of
Strategy and Finance (finance ministry) and the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry in the
composition of the FSC commissioners because of the potential for conflict of interest. Article 11 of
the Act on the Establishment of the Financial Services Commission, however, directly addresses this
matter by expressly providing for the recusal of FSC commissioners (voluntarily or involuntarily) from
any proceedings, deliberations, and resolutions that may pose a conflict of interest.

27.      Another recommendation in respect of independence and accountability is to change
law in order to give regulators and supervisors immunity from litigation for actions taken in
the performance of their duties. While this is a laudable proposition, the overwhelming constraint
for this matter is that Korea’s constitution does not provide for any selective immunity for the
FSC/FSS. More importantly, FSC/FSS regulators and supervisors are liable for damage under the
State Compensation Act only in the event of a violation of law resulting from an intentional
wrongdoing or negligence. Therefore, for all practical purposes, there is virtually no chance of
individual regulator or supervisor being held liable for good-faith actions taken in the course of
performing their official duties. In short, Korea’s regulators and supervisors already perform their
duties with virtual immunity from litigations that can threaten their independence or accountability.

Licensing criteria (CP5)

28.     It is recommended that the criteria for a banking license include the consent of the
home supervisor, internal controls related to the detection and prevention of criminal
activities, and the oversight of proposed outsourced functions. The FSC/FSS notes that the laws
and regulations currently in effect already enable bank supervisors to closely examine and assess the
above-mentioned criteria items when reviewing banking license applications.

Transfer of significant ownership (CP6)

29.     The assessment report suggests that a shareholder with less than 10 percent of share
ownership should be required to seek approval for the transfer of significant ownership or
controlling interest and that a shareholder with less than 4 percent should be classified as a
large shareholder if the shareholder exercises “de facto” control of a bank. The FSC/FSS closely
monitors shareholder status and ownership structure through the banks' shareholder reports and
onsite examinations. The FSC/FSS also monitors shareholders who exercise “de facto” control on an
ongoing basis.




                                                                                                    187
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



Major acquisitions (CP7)

30.     It has been suggested that prior approval should be required for a major subsidiary
acquisition and that provisions specifically designed to prevent exposure to undue risk from a
new acquisition or investment should be included in the banking regulation. The FSC/FSS
already requires a bank to obtain approval when it seeks to hold more than 20 percent of a
company or take over a subsidiary that the bank effectively controls. In addition, bank supervisors
continuously monitor whether a new acquisition or investment hinders the safety and soundness of
the bank.

Supervisory approach (CP 8)

31.      The mission team makes the observation that the existence of multiple points of
responsibility among various teams at the FSS that take charge of particular sub-segments of
banking supervision and operate autonomously tends to limit the ability of the FSS to fully
grasp the overall risk profile of individual banks and banking groups. The reality, however, is
that the Off-Site Surveillance Team at the Bank Examination Department effectively coordinates such
information and functions as the central repository of information and the central point of contact
for individual banks and financial holding companies.

32.     The assessment report also points to the seeming over-reliance of the FSC/FSS on
comprehensive biennial full-scope examination and recommends expanded risk-based partial
examinations and qualitative assessments where supervisory judgment is critical. The FSC/FSS
stresses that qualitative assessment takes place not merely as part of a biennial full-scope
examination, but also on an ad hoc basis as part of a partial examination performed to address
vulnerabilities and risk factors as they are identified. In addition, a considerable amount of
assessment criteria for CAMEL-R, the Management and Risk components in particular, is dedicated
to qualitative aspects that incorporate the examiners’ supervisory judgment. Nevertheless, the
FSC/FSS will act on the mission team’s recommendation in order to further strengthen qualitative
assessment with more in-depth risk analysis and partial examinations.

33.     In addition, the assessment report notes in EC1 that CAMEL-R is linked to the PCA
framework but has not yet been triggered for banks. This is factually incorrect: Korea’s bank
supervisors issued PCAs to four banks upon CAMELS assessments conducted between April and
November 1998 following the Asian financial crisis.

Supervisory techniques and tools (CP 9)

34.     Under the current system, the FSC/FSS conducts ad hoc partial examination when the
off-site surveillance identifies weaknesses and vulnerabilities to risks. In addition, the FSC/FSS
has been working on plans to bolster partial examination in order to more effectively address risk
vulnerabilities of the banks.

Supervisory reporting (CP 10)

35.    Under the Financial Holding Company Act, non-financial subsidiaries of a financial
holding company file quarterly reports on their financial conditions and business activities.
The FSC/FSS also has the authority to compel them to submit data or comply with interview
requests regarding their business affairs or properties.

36.     Regarding the use of external experts in bank examination, there are guidelines in
place to help assess the quality of work performed by external experts and prevent conflict of
interest. Currently, external experts are required to comply only with their contractual obligations
on suitability assessment and reporting mainly because their participation very much remains
limited (1.8 percent or 15 of the 811 examinations conducted as of the end of November 2013). The
FSC/FSS, however, expects to come up with more formally established rules and regulations on the
use of external experts in anticipation of growing demand for them.

Corrective and sanctioning powers of supervisors (CP 11)

37.     The FSC/FSS undertook a number of changes to the examination procedures in
January this year. As a result, the FSC/FSS now sends examination findings to the bank within five
months for a full-scope examination and within four months for a partial examination. Findings
unrelated to sanctions on the bank or its employees—such as CAMEL-R ratings—can be notified
separately before the final exam report is issued. Going forward, the FSC/FSS will continue to work
on improving post-examination notification and supervision.

Consolidated supervision (CP 12)

38.     The risk management assessment criteria for financial holding companies currently
consist of ten qualitative components including group-wide risk strategy and profiles. (The
qualitative components relate to, among others, whether there is sufficient understanding of the
management on group-wide risk profile or strategies to manage capital at risk, whether the group
maintains a risk management framework commensurate with its business strategies, and whether
the management of the subsidiaries was consulted before group-wide business strategies were set.)
The plan going forward is to continue to work on improving the qualitative components as needed.

39.     The FSC/FSS maintains a centralized information management system for information
produced by non-bank departments. Under the system, departments charged with examination
and supervision of bank holding companies share and access business reports from the FSS
Integrated Financial Analysis System. Information on material changes taking place at each
individual financial institution is accessed from the FSS Information Management System.

Corporate governance (CP 14)

40.    The assessment report recommends the integration of the Model Guidelines on Sound
Compensation Principles into the supervisory regulations. The FSC/FSS notes that the proposed
Act on Governance of Financial Institutions, which encompasses most of the sound compensation


                                                                                                189
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



principles in the model guidelines, was submitted to the National Assembly on June 18 and is being
deliberated at the National Assembly. The assessment report also refers to the absence of regulation
on conflict of interest. The FSC/FSS notes that the Banking Act explicitly sets forth provisions
designed to prevent conflict of interest between the board of directors of a bank and other
stakeholders and between a bank and its customers.

Risk management process (CP 15)

41.     Currently, banks are required by law to incorporate the results of risk assessment and
stress testing to their capital planning in accordance with the Model Guidelines on Stress
Testing. The FSC/FSS regularly assesses the banks’ compliance with stress testing and plans to
formally adopt the guidelines into the regulation.

42.    With regards to the recommendation for independent external verification of
compliance with the regulations, the FSC/FSS notes that banks are required to conduct
internal audit of risk management. The adequacy of internal audit of risk management also comes
under regulatory scrutiny under the CAMEL-R assessment.

43.    The assessment report recommends regulations for mandatory reporting of the bank’s
risk management unit to the chief risk officer (CRO) and the composition of the bank’s risk
committee. The proposed Act on Governance of Financial Institutions, which is making its way
through the National Assembly, expressly provides for risk committee and its composition.

Capital adequacy (CP 16)

44.     The FSC/FSS does not agree with the assessment of Principle 16 (capital adequacy) for
the following reasons:

     First, the FSC/FSS has faithfully and consistently complied with Basel standards, including capital
      standards, definition of capital compositions, and the regulatory ratios. This partly explains why
      domestic banks were able to maintain more than sufficient levels of capital throughout the
      global financial crisis. It also explains why the common equity tier 1 capital of Korean banks is
      expected to rise under Basel III unlike that of many large banks in the developed countries.

     Second, with regard to Pillar II, the FSC/FSS has carried out well-tailored capital supervision. The
      rigorous off-site surveillance of the 18 domestic banks enables bank supervisors to take
      immediate follow-up supervision action (and disciplinary action if warranted). For example, the
      stress tests the FSC/FSS conducted during the financial crisis period were tailored to the risk
      profile of each individual bank, and banks with the capital ratio below 10 percent under stress
      scenario were directed to raise capital.

     Third, the FSC/FSS does not agree to the finding that bank supervisors did not verify in advance
      changes to estimates and parameters that had been used in the internal ratings-based models
      because such changes were in practice subject to advance approval from bank supervisors. The



190
                                                                                    REPUBLIC OF KOREA



    FSC/FSS will take appropriate follow-up actions where more clearly established rules will
    minimize the likelihood of such misunderstanding.

45.      In short, the FSC/FSS feels strongly that the materially non-compliant finding is based
on an inaccurate assessment that fails to take into account the full breadth and scope of
Korea’s capital regulation regime in terms of enforcement and compliance, or the high quality
of bank capital. It appears that the materially non-compliant finding is more or less driven by minor
deficiencies in the explicitness of regulations on ICCAP.

Problem Assets, Provisions, and Reserve (CP 18)

46.    The FSC/FSS does not agree with the assessment of Principle 18 (problem assets,
provisions, and reserve) for the following reasons:

   Since the introduction of the IFRS in 2011, domestic banks have been setting aside loan loss
    provisions as provided for under the IFRS. The FSC/FSS ensures high loss-absorbing capacity by
    directing the banks to perform credit assessment of individual borrowers at risk of default when
    performing provision calculations. Where the level of provisioning required under the IFRS falls
    below the level of estimated loss, the difference must be made up and set aside as additional
    provisions. (At the end of September of this year, domestic banks’ loan loss provisions were
    KRW10.4 trillion more than the IFRS-based provisions of KRW21.2 trillion).

   Bank supervisors use the SBL ratio or the ratio of loans classified as substandard or below as a
    measure of soundness and for reporting purposes. The SBL ratio is more conservative than the
    more common NPL ratio because it incorporates the borrowers’ debt-servicing ability. (At the
    end of September, domestic banks’ SBL ratio was 1.79 percent and the NPL ratio 1.23 percent).

   A loan under debtor-creditor workout is also subject to stringent loan classification
    requirements. It must be classified as an SBL at the time of the workout and can be reclassified
    to a higher loan classification category only after the borrower has met the rescheduled
    payment obligations for a considerable period of time and can demonstrate the capacity to fully
    service the loan (principal and interest) under the forward-looking criteria. Similarly, the
    reclassification of an NPL into a performing loan may be made only after the borrower’s debt-
    servicing capacity has significantly improved. The FSC/FSS wishes to note that rule changes are
    currently in the works to provide specific regulations on NPL reclassification.

   For the fair value of collateral supporting an SBL, Korea’s banking regulation provides specific
    and prudent rules on estimating the recovery amount net of any incidental expenses. The
    standard practice for the banks is to perform conservative collateral valuation on the basis of
    market price and appraisal value with additional pricing information from the collateral’s cash
    convertibility (liquidity) and bids and offers in court auctions.

47.     The FSC/FSS acknowledges some discrepancy between banks and nonbanks on the
criteria to be met for a default—e.g., 90 days past due for banks and 180 days past due for



                                                                                                   191
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



nonbanks—as noted by the mission team. It must be stressed, however, that both banks and
nonbanks must adhere to the same set of classification and provisioning standards on a
consolidated basis, and the FSC/FSS has been fine-tuning the supervision rules to encourage
convergence on default criteria for both banks and nonbanks. (Default for mutual savings banks will
be changed to 120 days beginning July 2014; for credit cooperatives and unions, it has already been
changed to 120 days in July 2013 and will become 90 days—as is the case for banks—in July 2014).

Concentration risk and large exposure limits (CP19)

48.     It is difficult to agree to the overall thrust of CP 19 assessment. Because of domestic
banks’ heavy business concentration at home, bank supervisors take the due care in order to ensure
domestic banks effectively manage concentration risk stemming from specific borrowers, industries,
and other identifiable concentration categories. While the rules and regulations on concentration
risk and large credit exposures may fall short of highly detailed provisions, such risks are effectively
managed and controlled in practice because large credit extensions are carefully scrutinized and
decided through deliberations by the bank’s loan review committee and risk committee with the
participation of a member of the board of directors of the bank. In addition, bank supervisors
periodically inspect the banks' management of concentration risk through on-site examinations and
monthly or quarterly reports and examine the adequacy of internal controls for concentration risk.

49.     The mission team makes the observation that bank supervisors make use of the term
“same borrower” (a borrower together with any party specially connected with or related to
the borrower) as the term is defined under the Fair Trade Act. The FSC/FSS notes that this is
essentially an insignificant matter of formality and that bank supervisors employ strict prudential
standards on bank credit extensions not only to the borrower, but also to any related persons that
effectively share the risk of default with the borrower.

50.      It should also be noted that bank regulators at the Basel Committee have not yet come
up with the final rules and regulation on concentrated risk or large credit exposures. The
FSC/FSS is looking to set more concrete rules and regulations in line with what the Basel Committee
sets forth.

Transactions with related parties (CP20)

51.      The FSC/FSS carries out strong and effective supervision of related-party transactions.
This is also a matter yet to be firmly dealt with by the Basel Committee. When it does, the FSC/FSS
expects to follow up with additional measures to further reinforce the regulatory regime on related-
party transactions.

Market risk (CP22)

52.     Under the existing banking regulation, 17 of the 18 domestic banks are already subject
to strict capital charges for market risks, and the FSC/FSS disagrees with the assessment that
current exclusions are excessive, especially because it deviates from assessments given to



192
                                                                                  REPUBLIC OF KOREA



countries that exercise similar capital charges. The FSC/FSS also wishes to stress that Korea’s
banking regulations clearly provide for mark-to-market valuation of the banks’ trading positions,
domestic banks have faithfully adhered to the regulations, and bank supervisors will continue to
take steps to improve the valuation of traded market risks and ensure strong capital regimes for
them.

Liquidity risk (CP24)

53.      Korea`s liquidity regulations provide for won liquidity ratio (≧ 100 percent) and
foreign currency liquidity ratio (≧ 85 percent) to ensure effective liquidity risk management.
In July 2012, the FSC/FSS set loan-to-deposit ratio requirement in order to reduce wholesale and
market funding and preempt liquid risk.

54.     The FSC/FSS is looking to introduce the LCR regime beginning in 2015 as set by the
Basel Committee. Since the Basel Committee proposed new liquidity rules near the end of 2010,
Korea’s bank supervisors have been working on the implementation of the new liquidity regime with
quarterly review of domestic banks’ LCR calculation and other preparatory measures. Korea’s bank
supervisors believe that it is premature for the assessment team to point to shortcomings on the
basis of detailed LCR provisions well before the new LCR regime is completed.

55.      For liquidity stress tests, bank supervisors encourage the banks to design stress
scenarios with their own individually tailored risk variables and assess their effectiveness. The
FSC/FSS welcomes the proposal from the mission team to further improve the utilization of liquidity
stress tests with more specific regulations.

Operational risk (CP25)

56.     Regulatory issues pertaining to the authorization of the board of directors on
operational risk management, reporting of operational incidents, the verification of the
suitability of internal models, and disaster recovery have already been faithfully incorporated
in the regulation. IT-related issues have also been specifically integrated into the regulation. The
plan going forward is to review some of the details in the Model Guidelines on Integrated Risk
Management for new regulation.

Financial reporting and external audit (CP27)

57.     The mission team asserts that the bank supervisors’ onsite and offsite supervision does
not incorporate results from external audit. To this, the FSC/FSS responds that, under Article 48
of the Banking Act, bank supervisors may direct the external auditor to provide external audit
information. In addition, the Examination Manual and RM Manual, which provide details on carrying
out a bank examination, states that bank examiners may cooperate or consult with the external
auditor at any time and obtain audit results during the examination.

58.     The Act on External Audit of Stock Companies subjects listed companies, companies to
be listed, and companies with assets in excess of certain thresholds to independent external


                                                                                                193
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



audit. This requirement extends to most deposit-taking institutions. In addition, deposit-taking
institutions not subject to external audit under the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies are
subject to external audit under sector-specific regulations.

Disclosure and transparency (CP28)

59.    Domestic banks have been faithfully complying with regulatory disclosure
requirements, and the disclosure items encompass most of those covered under Pillar 3. The
FSC/FSS does not use Pillar 3 as a separate disclosure regime; disclosures are instead made through
the Korea Federation of Banks’ Uniform Disclosure Standards for Financial Businesses. It is therefore
erroneous to assume that Pillar 3 is not in effect in Korea.

60.     For regulation on compensation arrangements, the FSC/FSS has issued model
compensation guidelines in January 2010 as supervisory guidance. As a way to encourage
compliance, the FSC/FSS regularly collects implementation data and incorporate compliance
performance in the supervisory ratings. In November 2013, bank supervisors conducted an extensive
review of the status of compensation arrangement and issued supervisory guidance on areas in
need of improvement.
