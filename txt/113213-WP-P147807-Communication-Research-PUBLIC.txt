Executive Summary




1. Executive Summary
India is the world’s third largest consumer of energy.1 It is widely acknowledged that the role of energy efficiency
(EE) in reducing India’s carbon dioxide emissions and improving energy security is critical. Achieving the
overarching goal of increasing EE in South Asia would be enabled by a well-planned, professionally executed
public communication strategy and outreach program with clear audience segmentation. As the first step towards
implementing a strategic communication program, the World Bank commissioned an analysis of EE-related
communications in India targeted towards various stakeholders and energy consumers.

This communication analysis, including mapping of key stakeholders in the Indian EE communications
landscape, is part of the World Bank’s implemented program titled ‘Scaling up the Demand-Side Energy
Efficiency Business Line in South Asia’, and will inform a communications strategy that aims to increase
awareness and foster an enabling policy and business environment for EE in India.

The study aims to understand the attitudes of the policymakers and nodal agencies, EE implementers, and
consumers (industries and general public from various energy consuming sectors) about EE, and gauge the
various stakeholders’ informational needs and preferred channels of information on EE issues. In order to
influence more energy efficient behaviors in India, there is a need to examine what has worked in motivating new
behaviors, and what has not worked and why. The research also aims to map various categories of stakeholders
in the EE landscape in India, which have an impact on identifying, developing, designing, and implementing EE
improvement activities in all major energy consuming sectors, namely, Industry, Transport, Agriculture,
Commercial, and Residential.

The World Bank and PwC India developed a methodology that holistically covers the following elements:

         An in-depth review of the major EE communication campaigns in India over the last five years.

         Sharing of experiences (and also communication needs and gaps) by managers of major EE programs.

         Direct feedback about the consumers’ perception of EE-related activities in India through a field survey
          covering the commercial, domestic (residential), and agricultural sectors.

The target groups for this study are identified below:

    1.   Policymakers and nodal agencies for EE implementation: Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), Petroleum
         Conservation Research Association (PCRA), and Niti Aayog.

    2. EE program implementers: Development agencies, media agencies, and enablers, such as industry
       associations, banks, and financial institutions (FIs), and energy service companies (ESCOs).

    3. Consumers: End users from major energy-consuming sectors.

EE communication is still at an evolving stage in India with only a handful (listed below) of dedicated campaigns
aimed at creating consumer awareness, outreach, and behavior change impact for end users.

    1.   PCRA’s educational campaign on fuel saving for transport, indus try, residential, commercial, and
         agricultural consumers.

    2. Energy Efficiency Services Limited’s (EESL’s) communication campaign, ILedTheWay, for the Domestic
       Efficient Lighting Program (DELP).

    3. BEE’s Information, Education and Communication (IEC) campaigns, including the National Energy
       Conservation Awards (NECA) and the Standards and Labeling (S&L) program.

Yearbook 2015, Grenoble, France, https://yearbook.enerdata.net).

Executive Summary




    4. NDTV’s Mission Energy, a campaign on EE launched during February–June 2014, focused on innovation
       in EE at the industrial, commercial, and household level.

In addition, an innovative communication initiative —the Utility CEO Forum on demand-side management
(DSM)—is being implemented for effective one-to-one communication among electricity distribution licensees
(utilities), regulatory bodies, and nodal agencies for sharing knowledge and experience on design, development,
and delivery of megawatt-scale DSM programs. Chapter 3 presents an in-depth analysis of major EE
communication programs in India.

On the communication campaign front, the communication content (such as creatives, messages, and activities)
is available in the public domain. It is observed that all IEC campaigns on EE have effectively used the digital
space and out-of-home (OOH) events. Campaigns that have been particularly effective are listed below:

        Crowdsourcing of “motivators” (taglines for EE campaigns) by PCRA through the Digital India2 platform,
         www.mygov.in.

        Real-time dashboard for statewide distribution of light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs under DELP by
         EESL.

        Various tools and energy-saving calculators (based on the S&L program) by BEE.

The PCRA and BEE have also undertaken significant efforts at improving consumer education and behavior
change communication (BCC), acknowledging the influence that children (school students) have within their
families for driving home the messages about improved consumer habits for EE.

Program managers and media agencies involved in these campaigns believe that a two-tier communication
strategy (national profiling with a focus on regional consumer needs) is most effective in increasing end-user
awareness. This is particularly demonstrated by the strong correlation observed for local IEC campaigns and the
huge uptake of LED bulbs under the ILedTheWay campaign. Another successful example where this strategy was
employed is the PCRA’s painting and essay competition s for school students, wherein the number of participating
students shot up to more than half a million in 2015 –16, by involving the local state and district-level institutional
machinery. This was a huge improvement in comparison with a similar program organized in a centralized
manner in 2014–15, in which approximately 23,000 students participated.

The implementation level details of major EE communication programs are mostly available with the program
managers of the respective organizations and their media partners. PwC conducted interviews with the key
implementers of the campaigns (including nodal bodies and some of their media agencies, banks and financial
institutions, and development agencies) to understand their background context, opinions on EE communication
needs, existing partnerships and platforms for communication, success stories, and lessons learned. The scope of
interviews also included particular organizations where communication is undertaken as a specific component of
larger programs with a few elements, such as newsletters, audiovisual documentaries, and cluster-level
campaigns.

A survey covering 40 end users (consumers) from residential, commercial, and agricultural sectors was also
conducted for gauging the consumer perception on EE and policy direction on EE; different barriers and
motivators towards EE choices, recall value of existing campaigns, and media preferences. Thirty-six out of the
40 respondents mentioned the adoption of the following EE measures and behavioral practices after hearing
about EE communication.

         Use of LED lights.

         Use of star-rated products.

         Switching off idle lights and other equipment.

citizens electronically by improving online infrastructure and by increasing Internet connectivity or by making the country
digitally empowered in the field of technology.

Executive Summary




         Driving vehicles at moderate speed.

The recall value of the communication on EE appliances by a few private players and BEE, and an educational
campaign on fuel saving by PCRA is observed to be higher than others. Chapter 4 presents a detailed analysis of
these stakeholder interviews and consumer research surveys.

The stakeholder interviews and the consumer survey indicated that EE program managers at implementing
agencies often face a dearth of support with respect to effective communication of their activities with the
stakeholders. On the other hand, general consumers do not have avenues for providing upward feedback on their
informational needs and preferences.

Common pointers for all stakeholder groups:

    1.   The significance of EE and that of spreading awareness on EE is acknowledged uniformly
         across institutional stakeholders, as well as end users. There is a need for continuous recall on
         the significance of EE to create top-of-mind awareness and to position EE as one of the prime factors
         during decision making.

    2. The EE policy in India is acknowledged to be moving in the right direction uniformly by
       institutional stakeholders. A majority of consumers also indicated an acceptance of policies
       and programs on EE. EE policies are at an advantageous position for expansion to cross-ministerial
       applications in view of widespread public acceptance.

    3. Monitoring and impact assessment of EE communication campaigns: Monitoring, evaluation
       and dedicated impact assessment of communications is viewed as insufficient for almost all major EE
       communication programs in India. Of all the major EE communication programs by PCRA, BEE, EESL,
       and NDTV, we have information about only PCRA’s campaigns engaging professional services for
       measuring the outcomes as per their well-defined methodology for impact assessment. Complete details
       on the results of this impact assessment are not available in the public domain. However, PCRA does
       quantify and publish the overall outcome through its educational campaign in terms of fuel saving and
       the corresponding monetary benefits in the economy, as illustrated next.


   An impact assessment study conducted for the year 2013–14 demonstrated that mass
   awareness campaigns resulted in estimated fuel savings of 567,375 MT of petrol,
   1,873,083 MT of diesel and 948,383 MT of LPG. These savings will reduce carbon dioxide
   emissions into the atmosphere by approximately 9.10 million MT.

A detailed analysis based on stakeholder interviews and the corresponding communication needs assessment is
provided in Chapter 5. It is clearly evident from the analysis of communication needs that communication on
increasing consumer awareness and institutional awareness on EE needs to follow a different strategy as
compared to communication for a product or service.

The overall analysis results in seven key recommendations to be considered while formulating a dedicated EE
communication strategy (and also for strengthening existing ones):

         1.   Develop a comprehensive communication strategy and identify champion of EE communication.

         2. Improve effectiveness of messaging on EE behavioral change.

         3. Conduct research on consumer behavior to understand the audience’s attitudes, preferences, and
            awareness levels.

         4. Build capacity of technical speakers and decision makers.

2. About This Study
The World Bank is currently implementing the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP)–
funded analytical and advisory activity, Scaling up the Demand-Side Energy Efficiency Business Line in South
Asia, with focus on Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. The development objective of the program is to take
stock of the lessons learned in EE, deepen the understanding of the demand-side EE landscape in South Asian
countries, and develop a comprehensive diagnostic-based set of delivery models, implementation solutions, and
practical entry points for scaling up investment in demand-side EE and DSM in the region.

The program develops a set of possible delivery models and country-specific roadmaps and identifies and
provides recommendations for pursuing specific opportunities. The programmatic approach also addresses the
countries’ common needs while also pursuing country -specific strategies and opportunities identified through
detailed research. The program takes stock of the lessons learned, and a systematic assessment and analysis of
demand-side EE improvement investment opportunities—in both electric power and thermal energy domains —
across key end-use sectors (industry, buildings, agriculture, municipal and domestic sectors).

As part of the overall approach to programmatic communications, it is acknowledged that two distinct audience
groups must be targeted in order to implement a successful communications strategy to scale up EE:

    1.   The public (or general energy consumers), whose lack of awareness about EE issues and consumer
         behaviors plays a major role in the potential uptake of EE solutions.

    2. EE decision makers in the government (central, state, and municipal levels) and corporate sector,
       including large end users, such as industries and financial institutions.

In this context, the World Bank considers it important to take a strategic view of communicating effectively about
the program’s work and learning more about how communications interventi ons can help drive energy-efficient
consumer choices, government policies, and their implementation and businesses.

With this background, it is acknowledged that achieving the overarching goal of increasing EE in South Asia
would be supported by a well-planned, professionally executed public communication and outreach program with
clear audience segmentation. As the first step towards implementing such strategic communication and outreach
program, the World Bank commissioned a communication needs assessment study in India for various
stakeholders and energy consumers. The communication needs assessment, along with the mapping of key
stakeholders in the Indian EE landscape, will inform a communications strategy that increases awareness and
fosters an enabling policy and business environment for EE in India.



Objectives
The overall objective of the assignment, Communication Research on EE in India: Communication
Needs Assessment and Stakeholder Mapping, is to understand the attitudes of the general public and
decision makers about EE, as well as to gauge the various stakeholders’ informational needs and preferred
channels of information on EE issues. The assignment also aims to map various categories of stakeholders in the
EE landscape that have an impact on identifying, developing, designing, and implementing EE improvement
activities in all major energy-consuming sectors in India.

The overall objective of the assignment is to be achieved through defining specific objectives, as listed below:

    1.   Identify key stakeholders in the EE landscape in India and map them according to their respective role
         in driving the EE campaign. The stakeholders include key audiences at the national, state, and urban or
         rural level.
    2. Conduct an in-depth analysis of major EE communication campaigns in India during the last five years.
       The analysis will involve the following:

              a.   Reviewing and analyzing previous national or state-level EE campaigns for their effectiveness
                   and audience segmentation.
              b. Understanding the informational needs, capacities, partnerships, platforms, and activities of EE
                 market stakeholders, including government, businesses, financiers, and consumer groups.
              c.   Identifying success stories and lessons learned in previously implemented communication
                   strategies for EE.
    3. Conduct interviews with key stakeholders and the general public for research on existing opinions on EE,
       informational needs, and motivators and barriers towards adoption of EE and the preferred
       communication channels.



Methodology and Stakeholder Mapping
EE communication is still at an evolving stage in India with only a handful of dedicated campaigns aimed at
creating awareness, outreach, and
behavior change impact. This is also
proportionate to the small number of
organizations that have rolled out these
campaigns, mostly as part of their
                                                                         Policymakers
policy mandate. On the communication
campaign front, the communication
content (such as creatives, messages,
and activities) is available in the public
domain.            However,            the
implementation-level        details    are
mostly     available     with    program
managers        of     the      respective
organizations      and     their    media
partners. At the same time, EE
program managers (Implementers)
often face a dearth of support with
respect to effective communication of
their activities with stakeholders. On
the other hand, general consumers do
not have avenues for providing upward
feedback on their informational needs
and preferences. Looking at this
context, PwC and the World Bank developed the         Figure 1: Stakeholder Mapping of EE Communications
following methodology for achieving the
assignment’s objectives. Figure 1Error! Not a valid bookmark self-reference. shows the approach adopted
in mapping of stakeholders on EE communication.



Methodology
The methodology for the communication needs assessment is divided into three specific activities, each of which
provides inputs for successive ones, thereby evolving into a research-based communication needs assessment
and stakeholder mapping for EE communication in India. These specific activities are listed and briefly described
below:

    1.   Desk research: Developing a bird’s-eye view of the EE communication landscape in India, leading to
         identification of the following:

About This Study




              a.   Major EE programs having dedicated communication channels for stakeholders.

              b. Platforms and existing partnerships for knowledge exchange on EE among various players.

              c.   Preliminary stakeholder mapping and segregation.

    2. Stakeholder mapping and primary research: Gaining in-depth insights into the implementation
       of EE communication campaigns (strategic context and needs; opinions and objectives; barriers and
       institutional mechanisms; monitoring, evaluation, and impact assessment; informational needs; and
       stakeholder groups on the upstream and downstream side of programmatic activities) from program
       managers, as well as consumers or end users of energy. This involves the following tasks:

              a.   Segregation of stakeholders on the basis of their respective roles in the EE landscape—
                   policymakers and nodal agencies, implementers and consumers.

              b. Understanding the profile of such audience groups in terms of demographic details; perception
                 of the roles of government, consumers, and private players; existing and residual knowledge on
                 EE; barriers, and motivators for behavior change; and perceptions on the benefits of EE.

              c.   Opinion research with key stakeholders and organizations across the spectrum of energy-
                   consuming sectors in India and having the experience of running EE communication campaigns
                   (or related activities) across audience groups. The activity also reinforces findings from desk
                   research.

    3. Communication needs assessment: Comprehensive communication research, including analysis of
       the responses received from institutional stakeholders and the general public, and conducting
       communication needs assessment based on the observations and findings from desk research and
       interviews.

Stakeholders in the EE landscape in India are classified into three distinct categories (see Figure 2) based on their
respective role in the EE activities, as well as potential EE communication campaigns. PwC identified key entities
from each of these categories for conducting primary research based on the following:

    1.   Exposure to EE communication campaigns.
    2. Influence on EE and its related communication campaigns.
    3. Representation in energy consumption (overall as a sector: Industry, Agriculture, and Commercial, for
       example).

3. An In-Depth Analysis of Major EE
   Communication Programs in India
This chapter presents a detailed review and analysis of the major EE communication programs in India developed
and implemented by various policy bodies and implementing agencies. The programs are identified and analyzed
based on various parameters, such as the importance of the campaign to the national EE agenda, coverage of
sectors, and communication footprint—both in terms of target audiences covered and communication media
employed.

The following dedicated campaigns aimed at bringing consumer awareness, outreach, and behavior change
impact for end users are analyzed:

    1.   PCRA’s educational campaign on fuel saving for transport, industry, residential, commercial , and
         agricultural consumers.

    2. EESL’s communication campaign ILedTheWay for DELP.

    3. BEE’s IEC campaigns, including campaigns for NECA and the S&L program.

    4. NDTV’s Mission Energy, a campaign on EE launched during February–June 2014, focusing on
       innovation in EE at the industrial, commercial and household level.

A summary of the campaigns is presented in Table 2 to facilitate a quick comparison of these major EE
communication programs in India across various aspects like sectors covered, target audience, use of digital space
and mass media, and impacts assessment.

Campaigns Oriented towards EE Communication among
Policymakers and Implementers
While most EE communication programs are oriented towards the consumer or end user, policymakers and
implementers are also key stakeholders in shaping and executing the EE agenda of the country. It is therefore
important to address the communication and information needs of these key stakeholder groups.

The needs of EE communication campaigns targeted towards the upstream stakeholder groups (policymakers
and implementers of EE programs) are entirely different compared to campaigns targeting consumers or end
users of energy. Communication and information needs of this stakeholder group revolve around the potential
and impact of EE programs; fresh ideas and avenues for EE implementation in the country; sector-level barriers
and opportunities in EE; and innovative EE implementation, financing, and risk mitigation mechanisms. Being
institutional stakeholders, this stakeholder group best lends itself to focused communication media, such as
subject- or area-specific discussion forums and platforms.

The Utility CEO Forum on DSM is one of the innovative initiatives catering to the information and
communication needs of policymakers and implementers in the electricity supply industry. The objective is to
bring together key stakeholders to stimulate fresh ideas, identify critical challenges, replicate best practices, and
create an enabling policy environment for scaling up utility-driven DSM programs in the country.

Table 3 lists some of the key features characterizing this initiative. These will provide pointers for effective forums
or platforms for EE communication among policymakers and implementers.

Educational Campaign by PCRA
PCRA undertook an IEC campaign with the objective of
creating awareness among the masses about the
importance, methods, and benefits of conserving
petroleum products and emission reduction.

As part of the campaign, PCRA deployed several media
for mass communication. These included electronic,
print, and OOH media—TV, radio, electronic displays,
press at the national and state level; printed literature
for specific target groups, outdoor publicity through
hoardings, bus panels, kiosks, balloons, and banners.
The focus of all the messages included a call to action
with      easy-to-implement         and       practical
conservation tips for the industrial, transport,
agriculture, and domestic sectors (Figure 3 captures        Figure 3: Highlights from IEC Awareness Campaign
some visuals from advertisements for the different sectors)
For effective communication to the target groups in semi-
urban and rural areas, the messages were developed in regional languages. Field interactive programs, such as
seminars, technical meets, consumer meets, workshops, clinics, van publicity, exhibitions, and Kisan melas
(farmer meets), were organized for dissemination of conservation messages and demonstration of conservation
techniques. Figure 4 attempts to provide the visual feel, through glimpses from advertisements on fuel
conservation from PRCA’s website.

The information mentioned in Table 4 shows that PCRA’s campaign covered all the major energy -consuming
sectors and provided easy-to-understand messages with a call to action for the target audiences. For instance,
energy-saving tips for households, drivers of passenger vehicles, and owners of industrial enterprises were
disseminated to educate them on the benefits of conducting energy audits at their respective facilities.

Key Details of PCRA’s IEC Campaign
PCRA’s IEC campaign for awareness on fuel savings and related issues has successfully used several elements
that make it stand out as one of the most comprehensive educational campaign on EE. One of the ground rules
adhered to while developing communication campaigns is the simultaneous targeting of multiple motivating
factors (such as health, money, conservation, and environment) to break the monotony and enhance the appeal
of communication messages. Important details of PCRA’s campaign with an overall annual budget to the tune of
INR 200–300 million are presented below.

School-Level Intervention for BCC
PCRA undertook a highly successful communication activity involving large-scale mobilization of school
students. During 2014–15, PCRA organized a painting competition for school students wherein approximately
23,000 students participated.

The next year, 2015–16, PCRA scaled up the intervention by joining hands with the district-level Department of
Education, Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan (education program) to organize painting and essay competitions for more than
half a million students in 23 languages (for essay writing) and 24 events across India. The credibility of the entries
was certified at the school principal’s level.

The important takeaway from the program was that it helped in driving home the message of EE not only among
children, but also indirectly among their parents and elders (who help the child prepare for the competition).

PCRA intends to further scale up the target for the subsequent year by using the Digital India3 platform to reach
out to 10 million students.

Digital Space
To reach out to audiences who have access to the Internet and smartphones, PCRA has launched two Android-
based mobile applications (see Figure 5 and Figure 6):

    1. PCRA—Fuel Saving Tips
    2. Drive Smart and Save Fuel

In addition, an Android mobile game for simulation of best driving practices is underway to train drivers.
Other examples of utilizing the digital space for community involvement and mobilization are mentioned below:
    1.   Engaging audience on social media: Regular updates on the Facebook page (with over 110,000
         subscribers) and quizzes and prizes for audience.
    2. Crowdsourcing of messages and thematic communication elements through the two-way communication
       platform (http://mygov.in), recently launched by the Government of India.



OOH Communication
Other than traditional OOH media (for example, hoardings, banners, and mobile vans), PCRA also undertakes
the following activities:

        Communication activities as part of regularly conducted Raahgiri (street) events.

        Live demonstration of particulate matter (measurements) at busy crossings and fuel stations to educate
         vehicle drivers; PCRA claims to have reached out to 4.8 million users through 45,000 fuel stations.

        Participation in large exhibitions such as the IITF, employing outreach methods such as:
              o    Provision of games, puzzles, paintings, and selfies for audience engagement.
              o    Roping in professional event organizers for games like word hunt.
              o    Slow cycling competitions to promote avoidance of cars and vehicles for short-distance
                   commuting.



Mass Media Communication
Mass media–based communication is also deployed extensively by PCRA subsequent to defining objectives,
conducting communication research, and development of creatives.

The campaign is carried out on TV, radio, and other communication channels during the months of January–
March. PCRA is also targeting to increase the span of communication activities, eventually taking it up around
the year. As of today, PCRA considers a shelf life of three years for various creatives. Promotional material is
revised and updated or newly created every three years. However, this revision frequency is often too low—and
this is a limitation.

Impact Assessment
PCRA also undertakes impact assessment of various mass media campaigns through dedicated agencies
shortlisted through the quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) mechanism. The current agency for impact
assessment is GfK Mode Pvt. Ltd., India. The results of the impact assessment are translated in terms of estimated
or extrapolated savings in fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emission reductions across various fuel-
consuming sectors. Following is an example of such an impact assessment:

           An impact assessment study conducted for the year 2013–14 demonstrated that mass awareness
           campaigns resulted in estimated fuel savings of 567,375 MT of petrol, 1,873,083 MT of diesel, and

4   1 Crore = 10 million or 100 lakhs.

         948,383 MT of LPG. These savings will reduce carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere by
         approximately 9.10 million MT.5
The impact assessment studies are believed to be influencing next year’s campaign inputs, as well as resources.
The methodology for impact assessment of the campaigns covers the following:

        Qualitative analysis of the increase in the awareness level, post campaign.
        Effectiveness of the creatives.
        Effectiveness of the media.
        Reach to the target groups.
        Overall impact of the campaign.
        Suggestions (if any) for corrective measures for the future.
        Quantitative analysis of the tangible gains or savings accrued on account of the increase in awareness
         and attitudinal change on account of the educational campaign, in terms of money and fuel saved.

A post-campaign survey is conducted annually (detailed results are not available in the public domain) to measure
the shift in behavior, the attitude of the end users of petroleum products, and the efficacy of the campaign. It is
worth mentioning here that PCRA seems to be the only agency in the EE communication landscape in India to
consistently run post-campaign evaluations.



ILedTheWay: A Campaign by EESL
EESL has launched two flagship programs, namely, the Domestic Efficient Lighting Program (DELP) and the
Streetlight National Program (SLNP) at the national level for distribution of LED lights for domestic use and
municipal streetlights respectively. EESL launched a dedicated communication campaign to create awareness
and meet the IEC objective for the DELP scheme under the title ILedTheWay.

The ILedTheWay campaign has witnessed a very positive reception by the target audience, an indication of which
is reflected in the phenomenal uptake of LED bulbs from its various city-level distribution programs. As can be
seen from the snapshots of the National Ujala Dashboard6 (updated April 11, 2016, 4:28 p.m.), more than 93
million LED bulbs have been procured by target users and 31 million users have pledged their support for the
campaign.



Appointment of Media Consultant
Edelman, media consultant to EESL, is advising and supporting public relations and marketing activities,
including brand building, digital and social media, and experiential activations to amplify key messages and
deliver mission success across programs. The #ILEDTHEWAY campaign on mass media and social media,
supplemented with posters, radio spots, and newspaper advertisements, advertised the benefits of LEDs. The
campaign has been successful, as indicated by the huge uptake of LEDs (Figure 7) and success of the DELP
program in line with the expectations (Figure 8).
Figure 7, Figure 8, and Figure 9 also provide visuals on some of the digital and other media creatives and
messaging for the DELP scheme.

Two-Tier Communication Campaign
EESL and Edelman have implemented a two-tier communication strategy for rolling out communication at the
national and regional or local level.

EESL rolled out the DELP scheme at the city level by setting up distribution counters. At the same time, EESL
hired local agencies for each city. These local agencies were responsible for the following:

    1.   LED distribution, storage, inventory management of LED bulbs and database preparation.

    2. Dedicated media awareness campaigns for distribution.

These local agencies organized city and statewide awareness and outreach activities in order to inform the
domestic consumers of the details of the scheme. Work was carried out according to the tenders floated for
individual cities. Distribution companies (DISCOMs) were also roped in to facilitate different aspects of the city-
level communication campaign.



A Typical Local IEC Campaign
M/s. Span Communication and M/s. PAMM Marketing & Advertising were appointed to carry out the
distribution and awareness activities using various media tools like print, radio, local announcements, outdoor
media, and DTD campaigns in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg region (Maharashtra, India). The distribution and
awareness agency worked in close coordination to ensure that the awareness initiatives gain ground and the reach

Impact Assessment
An interesting phenomenon observed while monitoring some of the IEC campaigns was the strong correlation
between the IEC campaign frequency and rate of uptake of LED bulbs. This is important evidence that establishes
a positive impact of the campaigns on end consumers. Whenever there were instances where a campaign had to
be suspended for various reasons, there was a corresponding and marked dip in the offtake of LED bulbs.

 Educational and BCC Campaign by BEE
BEE is the apex body under the Ministry of Power, Government of India, to provide leadership and policy
direction to national energy conservation and efficiency efforts and programs. The mission of BEE is to assist in
developing policies and strategies with a thrust on self-regulation and market principles, within the overall
framework of the Energy Conservation Act, 2001, with the primary objective of reducing energy intensity of the
Indian economy. Through BEE, the government has initiated a number of EE initiatives in the areas of household
lighting, commercial buildings, S&L of appliances, DSM in agriculture and municipalities, small and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs), and large industries, including the initiation of the process for development of energy
consumption norms for industrial subsectors and capacity building of state-designated agencies.

One of the primary objectives of BEE is to create awareness and disseminate information on EE and promote the
use of energy-efficient processes, equipment, devices, and systems. Over the years, BEE has employed various
communication-related initiatives to achieve this objective.

Behavior Change Communication for Students
As part of its promotional activities, the Ministry of Power launched a web portal called Energy Savers
(www.energysavers.co.in—see Figure 16 for some snapshots), which provides tools to help children assess and
improve energy usage in their schools and homes. The idea behind this is to employ the catch-them-young
strategy and to influence the energy-consuming behavior of the children to make them ambassadors of energy
conservation. The website is mainly focused on students with links for school registration, past interaction
sessions, posters, comics, booklets, and handbooks. The content featured on the site is child-friendly.

National Energy Conservation Awards
The annually held National Energy Conservation Awards (NECA) ceremony recognizes innovation and
achievements in energy conservation in various categories, including industries, buildings, railways, state-
designated agencies, manufacturers of BEE star-labeled appliances, electricity DISCOMs, and the municipal
sector. The awards are also a recognition of demonstrated commitment of individuals and entities from major
energy-consuming sectors and subsectors towards improvement in EE. Figure 17 shows posters and print media
advertising the NECA ceremony.




Figure 17: National Energy Conservation Awards




   The participating units of NECA 2015 have collectively invested INR 238.4 billion in energy conservation
   measures and have achieved annual monetary savings of INR 292.8 billion, implying a short payback
   period of only 11 months. The participating units have also saved 2,598 million kWh of electrical energy,
   which is equivalent to the energy generated from a 423 MW thermal power station.

Test Results of Star-Labeled Equipment
This portal provides information on appliances and equipment that failed to meet the energy consumption
standards declared on their label. The website mentions the name of the manufacturer, its model number, and
deviation of the energy consumed from the standards mentioned on the label.

Knowledge Exchange Platform
The knowledge exchange platform is a collaborative initiative of BEE and the Institute for Industrial Productivity
to promote and share best practices and energy-efficient technologies among large-scale industries. The website
(www.knowledgeplatform.in) has sector-wise discussion forums and blogs in which various stakeholders can
interact and discuss issues. The platform also organizes industry site visits, workshops, and seminars to
encourage the exchange of ideas on energy-efficient technologies and best practices. Presentations on best
practices and energy conservation efforts by different industry units are also available on the website.

Mass Media
Mass media used for communication during awareness campaigns include TV advertisements, radio spots,
newspaper advertisements, and advertisements in BEE newsletters (BEE Line). The mass media campaign is
specially launched at the time of the launch of the label and standards for specific appliances.

Newspaper Advertisements
Advertisements were published in highly circulated regional newspapers to ensure adequate reach (such as
Anand Bazar Patrika in West Bengal and Rajasthan Patrika). Snapshots of some newspaper advertisements are
shown in Figure 20.

Radio Spots
The S&L program in India was branded with the message Bachat ke sitare (meaning stars of savings) and
extensively communicated to the general public via FM radio channels. The 15-minute radio program titled
“Bachat ke Sitare, dost hamare” (title of the Hindi version) was aired in 20 languages. It is a story-based program
that includes some songs and radio spots in between. The program incorporated various mechanisms for
responses and feedback from audiences, such as quizzes with prizes to win and a dedicated email for the
participants’ responses (sitara@beenet.in) based on which its popularity was judged.

OOH and Other Media
The use of OOH and other media includes the following:

   Installation of LED TVs in various railway stations, such as Chennai, Old Delhi, Nizamuddin, and
    Ahmedabad. This medium is also employed in Ahmedabad-Mumbai Shatabdi Express and a few other
    Shatabdi trains.

   Print advertisements promoting star-labeled LED bulbs on 35 lakh Air India boarding passes per month.

   Mugs imprinted with the BEE star label, along with pen stands and rulers inscribed with EE messages for
    students, are regularly distributed at various exhibitions and events wherein BEE participates.

   Short Message Service (SMS) campaigns are regularly held through the Directorate of Advertising and Visual
    Publicity (DAVP) route. BEE recently sent 9 crore SMSs to announce the extension date of their national
    painting competition.

NDTV: Mission Energy Campaign
NDTV, an Indian commercial broadcasting television network, along with Grundfos Pumps, launched the
Mission Energy Campaign during February–June 2014. The campaign, It’s all about ME, aimed at highlighting
the power of an individual in making a change towards EE. The campaign was supported by the Confederation of
Indian Industry (CII) as the knowledge partner, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) as the content
partner and SSEF, along with Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy (AEEE), as EE partners. The campaign
website is www.sites.ndtv.com/missionenergy (See Figure 21).

Figure 21: Mission Energy Campaign




This was perhaps the first, one-of-its-kind televised mass multimedia campaign organized by a television network
that focused on energy conservation for consumers at the national level. The elements of the campaigns are
discussed next.

Mission Energy Challenge: TV Show
The Mission Energy Challenge was a month-long contest (May–June 2014) organized as part of the campaign
where homeowners, educational institutions, manufacturing facilities, and commercial establishment
participated, showcasing the EE measures adopted in residential, commercial, and industrial applications.

Among the entries received, a total of 111 contestants were shortlisted for the Energy Challenge and the
composition was as follows:

        Residential contestants: 56.

        Manufacturing units: 33.

        Education institutions: 9.

        Commercial buildings: 13.
One winner and three runners-up were announced for each category and were given special prizes and
certificates.

Case study videos were made for various participants —depicting the story and experiences before and after the
adoption of the EE measures. The videos presented a brief interview with the concerned individuals on the
problems they were facing, and how they came up with the solution. They also discuss their plans to scale up or
implement the same in other areas. These videos proved to be a great medium in not only recognizing the
participants for their efforts, but also presented an example for the viewer, thereby encouraging implementation
of such initiatives.

Over 25 videos demonstrating the successful applications of EE and renewable energy, conservation measures in
day-to-day life, smart innovations, and the initiatives employed by the local people to cater to their specific energy
demands are showcased on the website www.sites.ndtv.com/missionenergy/videos and some stills from the
videos are shown in Figure 22.

Summary of the Forum’s Quarterly Meetings
Themes for the quarterly round tables are chosen in consultation with the participants to discuss the most critical
challenges. The focus is on advancing solutions driven dialogue among stakeholders. The meetings also include
presentations that highlight case studies, success stories, and emerging technologies to create awareness about
DSM opportunities and markets, as well as successful implementation models. Pointers for further action are
developed from the outcomes of the meetings and these are then followed up with the stakeholders.

Selection of appropriate themes while ensuring the buy-in of participants, solutions driven dialogue, and regular
follow-up with stakeholders on the outcomes are the factors that enable the Forum to facilitate outputs and
influence progressive DSM action in states. Table 7 summarizes the chosen themes as well as outputs from these
quarterly meetings.

Impact and Feedback: The Forum’s Achievements
During 2013–14, the forum’s activities and subsequent outputs had reached out to many stakeholders across the
country. During the year, several organizations ensured participation in all its quarterly meetings. As a result, the
forum gained substantial significance as an exclusive platform for exchange of knowledge about avenues, such as
opportunities in DSM and successful implementation models.

Relationship Building
In 2014–15, one of the most significant achievements was getting EESL on board as the co-promoter of the forum.
EESL was established as a public sector undertaking to boost the services infrastructure related to EE and DSM
in India. Perceived as a public sector ESCO, EESL aims to lead the EE investment-related actions and create self-
sustaining EE markets in India. Given its vast implementation experience across various states and sectors, EESL
brings together its success stories and delivery models, thereby enabling participants to learn and examine critical
information related to DSM.

Feedback Assessment
Apart from relationship building, under the directions of the chairperson, the forum sought feedback and
suggestions from the participants in order to assess the performance of its ongoing activities and thereby chalk
out a direction for the future. The feedback was received from nine utilities and four regulatory commissions
during the last quarter of 2014.

A majority of the participants agreed that their association with the forum till date has been “very good” and they
have been able to derive the benefits illustrated in Figure 29 from their association.

A majority of the participants also agreed that the forum has progressively voiced the necessity of DSM measures
within the Indian electricity sector. They believed that the forum has been constructive as a platform in bringing
like-minded individuals on board in order to initiate grassroots-level changes in DSM markets.

A number of participant states (viz., Bihar, Delhi, Haryana, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh) notified DSM
regulations in 2014–15. In this regard, the participants acknowledged that the forum has been a catalyst or a
facilitator in achieving the outcomes as outlined in Figure 30.

Sustenance of a Communication Platform: The Forum’s Way
Forward
A majority of participants suggested that the forum needs to invest time in the future to build the capacity of its
stakeholders at the regional level (see Figure 31). It is noteworthy to share that the feedback has been
incorporated in the program design. As part of the new program design, state-level meetings consisting of utility
representatives and other relevant stakeholders (who were not part of the earlier program meant for utilities only)
have been initiated. These stakeholders include financial institutions and consumer groups, as well as students
pursuing courses in engineering or economics, who can affect the understanding about DSM across
demographics.

Apart from this, participants also suggested that the forum should invest time in the following areas:

        Creating awareness about DSM among mass consumers

        Sensitization of utilities

        Sharing the experiences of successfully implemented DSM projects

        Providing policy and regulatory insights

        Influencing cross-industry functioning, by roping in more representatives from industries and
         institutions

Participants also suggested several themes to be taken up in the future meetings. Table 8 presents some of the
suggested themes for upcoming quarterly meetings.

4. Analysis of Stakeholder Interviews
  and Consumer Research
This chapter presents a detailed analysis of stakeholder interviews and consumer research activities carried out
under this study.

Institutional Stakeholders
For this communication needs assessment study, institutional stakeholders are considered a distinct target
segment of respondents, apart from the consumers or general public. Institutional stakeholders comprise of
policymakers and influencers, nodal agencies for policy implementation, development agencies (largely bi- and
multilateral organizations), industry associations, and businesses (banks, financial institutions, and ESCOs). A
detailed mapping of institutional stakeholders is already presented as part of the methodology for this
assignment. This section presents a detailed analysis of primary research conversations conducted with each of
these institutional stakeholders for various aspects of their respective communication programs, target audience
(both upstream and downstream), existing communication channels, and existing needs and barriers.

Policymakers and Nodal Agencies
The BEE and PCRA are two major nodal agencies responsible for the implementation of energy or fuel-saving
programs in India. The BEE is the nodal agency under the Ministry of Power, and is responsible for policy
formulation and implementation of EE activities, as well as encompassing activities under the NMEEE. It
intervenes for EE agenda in all major energy-consuming sectors within the economy. The PCRA, the nodal agency
for Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, has been implementing educational and BCC campaigns on energy
and fuel savings. The IEC campaigns initiated by these nodal agencies on energy and fuel saving have covered
key programmatic activities from major energy-consuming sectors:

        Industry: Perform, achieve, and trade (PAT) scheme for large-scale designated consumers and a
         national program for SMEs.
        Transport: Fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, capacity building, and awareness of drivers.
        Agriculture: Demand side management in agriculture.
        Commercial and residential: DSM programs for buildings and S&L program for appliances,
         household energy saving in cooking, residences, and so forth.

The key highlights based on our research and interaction with program managers from key nodal agencies for EE
policy and implementation are summarized in Table 9.

 Opinion on EE Communication

            Effectiveness of           Respondents acknowledged that IEC campaigns on EE programs involving
            communication               significant exposure to the common public are important for making informed
                                        consumer decisions while purchasing energy-consuming equipment.
                                       It is equally important that informative and educational campaigns for raising
                                        consumer awareness are launched at regular intervals. Major EE programs
                                        with exposure to general consumer awareness earmarked almost 50% of the
                                        overall program budget for the purpose of conducting communication
                                        campaigns.
                                       Conveying the right message through creatives is crucial for effective
                                        communication with the target audience. For this purpose, development of

                                        high-quality and effective creatives or messages assumes center
                                        stage in the communication campaign for EE in general.
                                       Years of collective experience of the agencies rolling out and implementing
                                        educational campaigns for energy and fuel savings have revealed that
                                        innovation and creativity contribute the most towards effective
                                        outreach and will help in conveying the message to the target audience.
                                       Educational campaigns on fuel saving have gradually shifted focus to
                                        community involvement and behavior change aspects. This includes a host of
                                        OOH measures, thematic competitions for school students, efforts towards
                                        including energy-saving in the school curriculum, training activities for
                                        drivers, and on-site demonstrations of fuel saving by adopting better practices.
           Communication               On the importance of a scientific and planned approach: Communication
                research                research must be conducted thoroughly for each distinct objective, and proper
                                        segregation and matchmaking of the communication footprint and media
                                        vehicles must be developed beforehand, including the slots for creative
                                        insertions in print and electronic media.
                                       On what are the best motivators for people to connect with EE: There can be
                                        a variety of factors that motivate people to conserve and use energy
                                        efficiently. These factors could range from monetary benefits related to
                                        conservation, reduced pollution in pollution-prone areas, such as rural
                                        households using firewood for cooking, and the aspiration for a clean
                                        environment.
              Sourcing and             PCRA revises or newly develops its promotional material every three
             administrative             years. However, the frequency of revision is felt to be too low and may need
                procedures              to be increased.
                                       Quality parameters should be given significant weightage while
                                        sourcing resources for the communication campaign development and roll-
                                        out, including development of messages and creatives.
                                        Communication experts should be made available to program
                                            managers to help in developing effective messages—which are not
                                            verbose and backed by adequate background communication research.
                                       Techno-commercial organizations need to recognize and treat communication
                                        as an independent area of specialization. They need to sensitize and orient
                                        their administrative procedures on communication and publicity campaigns
                                        (such as approving creative material for circulation) accordingly. For example:
                                                o One of the agencies roped in an eminent expert on strategic
                                                     marketing and communications as an advisor on their board—an
                                                     independent expert who is best positioned to provide a fair and
                                                     frank opinion on the effectiveness of creatives and campaigns.
    Communication channels
                Mass media            Nodal agencies have extensively utilized mass media for disseminating generic
                    —print,            IEC messages on EE, as well as sector-specific messaging. A few examples are
              radio, and TV            as follows:
                                               o Industry: promoting energy audits.
                                               o Transport: promoting best driving practices and clean fuel usage.
                                               o Residential: promoting energy-efficient cooking practices and
                                                   energy waste reduction.
                                      Media space is sourced through the DAVP9 route. The DAVP policy on print
                                       media is to include 50% of big, 35% of medium, and 15% of small print media.


9DAVP is a nodal agency that caters to the paid publicity requirements (multimedia advertising and publicity campaigns) of
various ministries and departments of the Government of India, public sector undertakings, and government societies.

                                      Messages are conveyed in Hindi, as well as other vernacular languages,
                                       through print (such as newspapers and magazines), radio spots, TVCs, and
                                       content integration.
                                      The agencies show an inclination towards increasing the frequency of
                                       messaging.
                                      Apart from educational campaigns for behavior change, nodal agencies also
                                       promote various clean and fuel efficient products, such as EE gas stoves and
                                       star-labeled mono-set water pumps, through mainly print, as well as various
                                       other forms of mass media.
               Out-of-home            The OOH medium is also used extensively by nodal agencies. OOH media
                    (OOH)              buying is carried out as part of the overall media plan of an educational
                                       campaign. This includes identification of important points-of-purchase, for
                                       example, bus shelters, railway or metro stations, and trains, as well
                                       as designated locations across various cities.
                                      Every month, 35 lakh airline boarding passes carry print advertisements
                                       promoting star-labeled LED bulbs.
                                      Various promotional materials (such as mugs, pen stands,
                                       stationery) with generic EE messages are distributed in exhibitions and

                                      PCRA organizes an exhibition stall at the IITF (with footfall clocking in
                                       millions) and launches several activities for garnering the engagement of the
                                       audience, such as interactive screens, promotional gifts, and prizes.
               Digital space          Generic messages on EE are published on high-traffic sites, such as
                                       Yahoo and Rediff.com.
                                      Mobile applications and games on BEE’s star labeling program, and
                                       PCRA’s fuel-saving tips and smart-driving tips to save fuel have been
                                       launched.
                                      The smartphone platform has been particularly effective in
                                       reaching out to the rural masses. While the reach of other mass media,
                                       such as TV and the Web, are limited, almost every individual in the rural
                                       landscape owns a mobile phone and is connected to the Internet through their
                                       smartphones.
                                      The agencies also maintain a presence on social media, such as Facebook,
                                       and stay connected to target audiences through regular announcements,
                                       organizing quizzes, and the like.
                                      PCRA has attempted to utilize the platform of Digital India (mygov.in)
                                       for crowdsourcing creative messages for its educational campaign.
                                      SMS campaigns are regularly held for outreach and dissemination.
                  Celebrity           Both, BEE and PCRA have roped in several celebrities from the
              endorsements             sports and film fraternity, with an objective to effectively convey EE
                                       messages.
                Community             The agencies have gradually shifted their focus on educational and BCC
                mobilization           campaigns through community mobilization activities.
                                      Painting competitions on energy conservation (conducted by BEE) and
                                       painting and essay competitions (conducted by PCRA) are the front
                                       running campaigns for involvement and mobilization of students.
                                      The objective is to introduce and inculcate the habit of energy
                                       conservation at a young age. Children are the best agents of change,
                                       and the painting competition serves to equip them with information and
                                       knowledge on energy conservation and engage their interest on this important
                                       subject.

                                      A significant share of IEC campaign’s focus is towards sc hool
                                       students in the form of painting and essay competitions. The number of
                                       participants has risen from 25,000 during earlier attempts to more than
                                       500,000 at present, and is targeted at 10 million in the immediate future.
                                       PCRA involves the existing administrative network within the education
                                       system to implement activities on a relatively large scale.
                                      PCRA has participated in Rahgiri events (community street event) and
                                       organized Nukkad Nataks (roadshows or street plays) as part of the
                                       awareness-raising campaigns for fuel efficiency and best driving practices.
                                      Events reinforcing the concept of driving at a speed of 45–55 kmph
                                       for best fuel efficiency are organized at such venues.
                                      PCRA added a hands-on or touch-and-feel element in the educational
                                       campaign for drivers to leverage the credibility and convincing power
                                       associated with such elements. They measured particulate matter
                                       emissions and demonstrated the difference between suspended particulate
                                       matter levels at traffic signals with vehicle ignition in the ON and OFF
                                       position.
 Impact assessment of                 Impact assessment, in terms of reach, is measured by DAVP for print

 campaign                             For the rest of the communication channels, and to assess the effectiveness of
                                       its communication, PCRA undertakes regular consumer research (on
                                       the behavioral aspect of consumers and their media switching pattern) and
                                       periodic impact assessments through professional service
                                       providers. The feedback from the impact assessment activity is said to be
                                       incorporated in the subsequent cycles of the educational campaign.
                                      Apart from the above practice by PCRA, most other agencies undertake
                                       impact assessments of communication campaigns as part of the overall
                                       program evaluation only. There are no formal and consistent channels
                                       for measuring the impact of communication campaigns in terms of
                                       the effectiveness of messages, reach of media vehicles, and feedback from the
                                       target audience. There has been no separate activity dedicated for assessing
                                       the impact of specific paid media campaigns.
                                      As an indicative measure of the target audience’s involvement in the
                                       communication campaign, the popularity is judged based on the
                                       quantum of responses and feedback from the audience .
                                      Many campaigns have incorporated various mechanisms for feedback,
                                       such as quizzes with prizes to win and a dedicated email for participant
                                       responses (such as sitara@beenet.in).

Businesses—Banks, Financial Institutions, and ESCOs
Our methodology of the communication needs assessment also includes involving the institutional stakeholders
from various businesses that enable the implementation of EE initiatives. These institutions play an important
role in facilitating implementation of sector-level (municipal functions, agriculture, public building, lighting, and
industry) EE programs, either directly or indirectly, through various mechanisms, such as performance contracts
(and linked grants), and ESCOs. , EESL and SIDBI have been instrumental in initiating and implementing
communication activities on EE in their respective domains.

EESL
EESL is a joint venture between the National Thermal Power Corporation Limited, PFC, Rural Electrification
Corporation, and POWERGRID to facilitate implementation of EE projects. The key objectives of EESL are
implementation of EE projects for demand-side measures (including municipal functions, agriculture, public
building, and lighting), and to partner with private ESCOs and other companies in order to promote EE projects.
Presently, EESL is proactively implementing EE streetlighting projects across several municipal corporations
along with its flagship program, DELP for the residential sector. The program has a dedicated component package
to inform, educate, and communicate with the target audience on program schematics, benefits realization and
myth busting, with a call to action, for replacement of existing lights with efficient LED bulbs. Under this
component, EESL has launched a pan-India campaign titled ILedTheWay, under its DELP program, for
promotion and distribution of LED bulbs for domestic users as a demand-side measure to reduce domestic
lighting load.

SIDBI
SIDBI is the apex body for the promotion and development of MSMEs in India. SIDBI also serves as a
development-oriented financing institution for MSMEs, with dedicated schemes for the financing of EE
equipment and technologies. It has also been instrumental in implementing several projects and studies for EE
manufacturing at MSMEs, including the GEF-World Bank project Financing Energy Efficiency at MSMEs. SIDBI
is also implementing the JICA-SIDBI MSME Energy Saving Project, a unique list-based EE financing scheme for
MSMEs.

The key highlights from our research and interaction with program managers at EESL and SIDBI are summarized
in Table 10.

 Opinion on EE                         EE is a relatively new concept and is not yet widely popular among
 communication                          the people, especially at a mass scale. Lack of adequate awareness and
                                        information among consumers is among the critical barriers to
            Effectiveness of            widespread implementation of EE projects.
            communication              In the context of industrial EE projects, communication is required to create
                                        a differentiation between efficiency improvement because of equipment,
                                        process, or practice-level intervention and general behavioral aspects of
                                        energy saving.
                                       DISCOMs and municipal corporations at various district and city
                                        levels have proved effective, since they are better known to the masses
                                        and enjoy more credibility. Leveraging on this advantage has yielded good
                                        results for implementers of EE communications programs, such as EESL.
                                       The monetary benefits from energy savings are a clear winner among
                                        the motivators, whereas the lack of awareness and capacity are the critical
                                        barriers.
                                       Reduction in operating cost is the biggest motivator for adoption of
                                        EE measures among MSMEs, while high initial cost for technological
                                        intervention is one of the largely perceived barriers , especially in the
                                        case of competing requirement of capital for business or capacity expansion.

Analysis of Stakeholder Interviews and Consumer Research




                                      EE communications must entail a coordinated approach among all
                                       stakeholders within the MSME ecosystem, such as entrepreneurs, vendors,
                                       technical or financial consultants and banks.
          Key observations            DELP is one of the largest EE projects targeting the residential sector in India.
                                       In the absence of any given precedent, there were no set standards for a
                                       nationwide roll-out of the IEC campaign for DELP. Therefore, the
                                       implementation experience of the DELP communication campaign was a steep
                                       learning curve.
                                      There is a lack of geographic or state-specific guidelines on OOH that
                                       can be followed, such as details on the adequate size, number, and locations of
                                       the hoardings within a city or an area.
                                      It will be interesting to conduct an in-depth analysis of barriers and
                                       motivators to EE perceived across different strata of consumers,
                                       such as the urban, rural, and economic strata (rich vs. poor). This
                                       will also be beneficial for formulating effective messages in future
                                       communication campaigns.
                                      There is a paucity of dedicated resources among stakeholders in the MSME
                                       ecosystem for developing and implementing a dedicated IEC campaign on EE.
                                      One-to-one communication, such as through workshops, conferences, and
                                       industry meets, has been the most effective communication channel in the
                                       case of industry stakeholders.
                                      SIDBI has organized vendor meets-cum-exhibitions in various energy-
                                       intensive MSME clusters. These events provided the requisite platform
                                       for one-to-one interaction among entrepreneurs and vendors and
                                       provided a major boost to implementation of EE technologies by
                                       ensuring a touch-and-feel demo of the desired products. A significant
                                       potential exists for similar such events across several energy-intensive MSME
                                       clusters.
 Communication channels
               Mass media–            At the outset, EESL employed multiple mass media options for their
                print, radio           campaigns promoting LED bulbs. These options included the electronic media
                        and            (TV and radio), digital media (Internet, website, and social media), outdoor
                 television;           media (billboards or hoardings, mobile vans, bike brigades with loud speakers,
                       OOH             street plays, and bus back panels), and the print media (newspaper
                                       advertisements, focused press releases showcasing various milestones).
                                      However, later on EESL chose to go ahead with mobile vans as the
                                       most effective outdoor medium from among various options
                                       implemented before, including bike brigades with loudspeakers, street plays,
                                       and bus back panels.
               Digital space          EESL has developed and hosted a website (www.iledtheway.in)
                                       displaying all the information regarding the DELP scheme , tweets,
                                       videos developed, and facts about the benefits of LED bulbs over incandescent
                                       ones and a national DELP dashboard (www.delp.in) displaying real-
                                       time figures of bulbs distributed all over the country and within different
                                       states. This is particularly targeted at the audiences in the digital space, as well
                                       as at policymakers.
 Impact assessment of                 On impact assessment, structured and formal studies to assess the impact of
 the communication                     paid mass media campaigns were not evident. However, EESL has
 campaign                              experienced a strong and positive correlation between their IEC
                                       campaign and the uptake of LED bulbs at the city or district level.
                                      In terms of effectiveness, the OOH publicity on mobile vans seems to work

Media Agencies in EE Communications
Media agencies are one of the most important links in the overall IEC campaign, since their expertise plays an
important role in the development of the overall campaign, as well as capacity building on both the upstream (EE
program managers and institutions) and downstream (target audience and implementers) side. Our team
approached media agencies involved in several successful IEC campaigns on EE to understand their perspectives
on interaction and experience with program managers working on the EE theme, and the issues, barriers,
learning, and achievements encountered during the course of developing or implementing the communication
campaign on EE. Following are the highlights (see Table 11) of our interaction with two media agencies:

                  Edelman India: Currently working for EESL to develop and implement a 360 degree
                   communication strategy on EESL’s programs in DELP, agriculture DSM, and ESCO financing
                   mechanisms. The agency previously worked with BEE for communication on EE.

                  Comfed Productions: Experience in communication and outreach programs on EE and clean
                   energy for the World Bank, JICA, British High Commission, and other development agencies
                   and public sector undertakings.



Table 11: Highlights from Interaction with Media Agencies
 Opinion on EE                         It is crucial to have a close integration of program managers with the
 communication                          communications team. This is critical to the success of the
                                        communication campaign since it contributes significantly to a clear
                                        segmentation of the target audience, development of effective messages,
                                        seamless roll-out of the campaign, and fruitful incorporation of feedback from
                                        the field.
                                       Edelman mentioned that their team members are permanently stationed at
                                        the program manager’s (EESL) site for bringing in such close integration and
                                        quick turnaround times.
                                       Another important success factor for effective development of the IEC
                                        campaign is clear and unambiguous briefing (of the expectations,
                                        vision, and boundaries) by the program managers to the
                                        communications team.
                                        A series of service providers in the EE supply chain—from dealers
                                            or sellers to electricians or installers —have been inadvertently
                                            excluded from the footprint of existing communication campaigns. These
                                            stakeholders must be included within the ambit of the EE
                                            communication strategy for substantiating word-of-mouth
                                            publicity and adding credibility to the communication.
                                        The program manager must be able to deploy one agency on a turnkey
                                            basis—responsible for creatives, media (procurement),
                                            planning, and execution, as well as impact assessment. Provision
                                            of an agency on a turnkey basis will go a long way towards streamlining
                                            coordination activities and eliminating various inefficient junctions.
                                       Communication agencies highlighted the need for educating the
                                        communication-related service providers on the issues of EE.
                                        Conducting one-hour sessions for top media professionals can be an
                                        effective strategy in this context.

Analysis of Stakeholder Interviews and Consumer Research




                                      As a cost-effective measure, advocacy of a cause, such as EE, needs to be
                                       targeted to the implementers and the media, as well as the general public (that
                                       is, end user community), since advocacy may optimize the media-
                                       buying cost substantially.
          Key observations            There is a vital need to assess consumer behavior, as well as to
                                       understand the reasons behind certain habits of consumers vis-à-
                                       vis adoption of EE equipment or practices. A research on these aspects
                                       will be an enlightening study apart from the other known rationale that
                                       consumers merely think about monetary savings.
                                      The campaign on EE needs to be conducted at two levels: national
                                       and regional. Considering a typical campaign on LED lighting:
                                       o The national campaign can focus on the concept of LED, benefits, and an
                                            introduction about relevant agencies, such as BEE and EESL.
                                                o The regional campaign can focus on the details of the scheme—for
                                                   example, how and where the bulbs can be purchased.
                                      Lack of close coordination between the technical and
                                       communication teams at all levels is one of the key barriers facing the
                                       EE communications agenda in the country:
                                       o Presently requests for proposals (RfPs), for projects involving an EE
                                            communication component are usually designed by teams consisting
                                            mostly of subject matter specialists who do not understand the finer
                                            nuances of the communications domain.
                                       o Media specialists need to be involved at the RfP development
                                            stages itself.
                                      Communication involving the pan-India campaign on EE needs to be
                                       endorsed by a politically neutral entity or person.
 Communication                        All communication channels are essentially required in a proper
 channels                              mix based on the individual needs of the campaign, the objectives,
                                       and budget.
                                      For projects with a wide geographic footprint, both national as well as
                                       local communication channels must be deployed.
 Impact assessment of                 Impact assessment of EE communication campaigns is not prioritized
 the communication                     by program managers currently.
 campaign                             The impact is estimated by analyzing parameters such as the trend of
                                       sales, number of calls on the helpline number, and the number of
                                       followers and questions asked on Twitter, all of which imply
                                       involvement of the target audience with the campaign.

Industry Associations
Industry associations are a conducive forum for deliberation and addressing any industry-related issues that
require collective focus and efforts for positive transformation. In the context of communication needs
assessment on EE, we have covered the following three industry associations: FICCI, Northern India Textile
Research Association, (NITRA), and IamSMEofIndia.

FICCI
FICCI is one of the apex industry bodies in India, with memberships comprising industry, industrial bodies,
service sector companies, and related stakeholders, through which the organization reaches out to more than
250,000 entities on issues of efficiency, global competitiveness, consensus building by engagement with
policymakers and civil society. Industry members of FICCI include corporates from several energy-intensive
sectors, such as Iron and Steel, Power, Cement, Agriculture, and Food Processing.

Northern India Textile Research Association
Northern India Textile Research Association (NITRA) is an association for the textile industry, covering the entire
value chain of processes—including spinning, weaving or knitting, processing, and garments. NITRA provides a
range of research and professional services to its members, including services for EE improvement. Strong
membership of textile companies, along with hands-on experience in various techno-commercial issues faced by
the industry, positions NITRA as one of the insightful entities for textile sector research.

IamSMEofIndia
IamSMEofIndia is one of the most dynamic industry associations in the MSME segment. The association provides
an impressive array of services to MSMEs, such as credit facilitation, technology transfer, IT solutions, e-
commerce, mobile apps development, skill development, EE, lean manufacturing, facilitating participation in
international exhibitions and training, and sharing best practices. It has also provided services as Cluster
Coordination Consultant in the Faridabad industrial cluster as part of the GEF-World Bank project Financing
Energy Efficiency in MSMEs.

Thus, this selection of industry associations covers cross-sector and sector-specific, as well as MSME-focused,
associations to holistically cover the entire spectrum.

Key highlights of our interaction with these industry associations are shown in Table 12.



Table 12: Highlights from Interactions with Industry Associations
 Opinion on EE                        FICCI provides platforms for business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-
 communication                         government (B2G) communications for industry representations or feedback;
                                       sector roadmaps; policy consultation; and advocacy.
                                      FICCI also organizes communication avenues, such as national
                                       workshops and conferences, which facilitate focused one-to-one
                                       communication among various interrelated stakeholder groups, of
                                       which energy-efficient technologies are a usual feature.
                                      IamSMEofIndia has been engaged in a host of activities for communication
                                       and mutual information exchange among MSMEs on EE initiatives.
                                      The majority of technology-oriented discussions on IamSMEofIndia’s
                                       platform cover EE as a subject in their agenda.
                                      Credibility of communication on EE interventions increases when it is
                                       routed through vendor-neutral channels, such as industry
                                       associations.
                                      The MSME sector consists of a large number of relatively small industries,
                                       wherein the culture of information sharing is not yet prevalent . When

                                       it comes to sharing data on EE, such industries are often reluctant to share the
                                       information to gain maximum benefit in a competitive landscape.
                                      Bigger groups do share information selectively at forums perceived
                                       as appropriate.
                                      The concept of EE, though financially attractive for MSMEs, typically
                                       does not elicit adequate interest among the target audience, since
                                       these industries usually operate with limited resources and are engrossed in
                                       typical day-to-day operational challenges and market challenges .
                       Key            Presence or participation of policymakers and/or high-level executive
               observations            officers is a motivator for industry members, especially the decision
                                       makers, to participate in various avenues for communication on industry-
                                       related issues.
                                      A dedicated team catering to communications is required to
                                       consistently maintain communication on EE activities.
                                      The management’s focus and commitment is essential for
                                       maintaining communication channels. These can also be useful as an
                                       effective marketing tool for the activities of an industry association.
                                      It is necessary to develop programs for MSMEs for increased awareness on
                                       EE-related issues. At the same time, the program organizers must
                                       essentially factor in such elements that make these events
                                       interesting.
                                      At majority of the events on EE, the speakers do not possess adequate
                                       communication skills to create a motivational (call to action)
                                       environment.
                                      In the context of MSMEs, it is important to take the local industry on board
                                       while designing activities for local consumption.
 Communication                        Focused and short documentaries, digital media, and platforms,
 channels                              such as sector-specific conferences or workshops, are considered the
                                       most effective medium of interaction with the industry and relevant
                                       stakeholders.
                                      Technology-related communication needs to be targeted at vertical
                                       heads and/or the senior management level for building up the case for
                                       EE, which generally moves upstream to the board or CxO level after due
                                       diligence and endorsement by vertical heads.
                                      Communication is often routed with help of a database of personnel from the
                                       industry at different levels within the respective organizational structure.
                                      In order to reach the appropriate strata of stakeholders within
                                       textile industries, NITRA has its own database, as well as access to
                                       the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry database.
                                      The Confederation of Indian Textile Industry database is stratified
                                       into management level contacts, department heads at industries
                                       (such as spinning and yarn processing), supervisors, and engineers, so
                                       that it is usually feasible to reach out to the desired strata of contacts within
                                       the textile industry, especially up to the head-of-department level.
                                      On channels to achieve a deeper reach to industries across different

                                       industry, there are two sources of information:
                                       o Forum, as well as data available with trade associations
                                            (downstream), such as those for the Bhilwara and Banswara regions.
                                       o NITRA has a network of power loom testing centers across
                                            different textile clusters and industrial areas. Staff at these centers
                                            provide routine support to industries and transfer queries to the
                                            headquarters in a situation where they are not able to resolve the queries.

                                      NITRA does not resort to mass media buying for areas of core activity,
                                       including EE services. Mass media campaigns are focused on the promotion
                                       of NITRA’s educational and skill development activities.
                                      One-to-one communication through workshops, industry meets
                                       and exhibitions is considered the most effective communication channel.
                                      Within MSMEs, word-of-mouth publicity is often the most credible
                                       communication channel. There have been instances of participation in EE
                                       improvement activities on the basis of such information sharing.
                                      SMS campaigns have proved to be a successful communication channel with
                                       MSMEs.
                      Digital         IamSMEofIndia makes excellent use of the digital platform, including
                       space           Facebook, with regular posts covering useful information for
                                       MSMEs and daily updates on various activities of the association.
                                      The association also sends regular e-direct mailers to member
                                       industries, thereby sharing useful information on the associations’ activities,
                                       beneficial schemes for industries, and updates on representations to
                                       government bodies.
                                      NITRA has dedicated Facebook and LinkedIn pages. An agency was
                                       hired for a one-year Internet campaign. Of late, there have been no
                                       regular postings on the activities in the EE space. Possibilities include
                                       updating information on energy audits and studies conducted, and
                                       savings achieved through implementation.
 Impact assessment of                 There is no sustained and formal mechanism for assessing the
 the communication                     impact of communication activities and/or seeking feedback from the target
 campaign                              audience.
                                      Industry associations regularly organize conferences for various industrial
                                       sectors on areas such as new and emerging technologies and EE best practices,
                                       wherein industry members get a platform to communicate with technology
                                       suppliers, subject-matter experts, and policymakers or executive members. It
                                       is claimed that sustained participation in these conferences year after
                                       year, wherein participants, in many cases, pay a fee to attend, is a
                                       successful demonstration of a highly effective communication
                                       platform.

Development Agencies
Development agencies provide support to development-oriented activities as part of the multi- or bilateral
cooperation. During our research on communication needs assessment, we approached several key development
agencies that are actively supporting programs on EE improvement in various sectors of the economy, as listed
below:

        United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).

        Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation (SSEF).

        Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

        Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ).

All of above-mentioned agencies are active in the EE space in India, and we approached them to identify and
learn about their existing communication channels and experiences thereof. Our interaction with these
development agencies is summarized in Table 13.Table 13: Highlights from Interactions with Development
Agencies

 Opinion on EE                        Communication activities for development agencies, on the upstream
 communication                         side, include policy-level communication with the central and state
                                       governments and respective departments. On the downstream side,
                                       development agencies need to communicate with their field functionaries
                                       and end beneficiaries of their funding support.
                                      Each and every element within a communication creative has a
                                       profound influence on the overall message that is conveyed and its
                                       effectiveness. It is important to thoroughly pre-test key
                                       communication messages before deployment.
                                      The concept of EE is more of a cross-sectoral approach rather than
                                       limited to power, oil and gas, and renewable energy. Several ministries can
                                       potentially impact EE in their respective area of work such as railways,
                                       road transport, and urban or rural development.
          Key observations            A top-down approach to create a forum of representatives from each of
                                       such relevant ministries, supervised by a competent authority, must
                                       be formed, which will meet at regular intervals, to provide avenues
                                       for information exchange and communication on idea- to execution-level
                                       details on EE.
                                      The importance of communication and the skillsets required for effective
                                       communication needs to be a part of the curriculum at educational
                                       institutions, especially those imparting professional education.
                                      Likewise, the importance of EE needs to be a part of education at
                                       various levels.
                                      Content and messages both have to be customized to reach the
                                       target audience and to achieve the objective of communication.
                                       Communication for general awareness is different from product specific
                                       awareness and call to action.
                                      Highlighting the benefits is important for effective communication.
                                       Benefits need to be well-researched in order to map the value
                                       perception of the target audience.
                                      One of the key barriers to effective communication in the clean energy
                                       space is the availability of communication personnel (or effective

                                       messages and present them effectively.
 Communication                        There is no media buying, and involvement with mass media is
 channels                              limited to inviting the press and sharing information on the
                                       programs supported and the development agenda.
                                      Development agencies, such as the World Bank, SSEF, British High
                                       Commission, and GIZ, have supported different initiatives on effective
                                       communications in the EE and clean energy space in India.
                                      Messages highlighting the costs and benefits of EE interventions are
                                       considered most effective, and aspects such as “call to action” and “community
                                       involvement” are the other themes mentioned, around which effective
                                       messaging can occur.

Analysis of Stakeholder Interviews and Consumer Research




          Energy Consumers (General Public)
          Energy consumer subgroups were selected for face-to-face interviews from different energy consuming sectors, namely, the following:

               Commercial (users of commercial buildings such as malls, shopping complexes and shops–sample size: 17 users)

               Residential (residents from urban and semi-urban households—sample size: 20 residents)

               Rural and agriculture (farmers – sample size: 3 farmers)
          A substantial number of these consumers were also owners or drivers of passenger vehicles, which also brings in the coverage of the transport sector to a certain
          extent. Energy consumers from the industrial sector have already been covered as part of industry bodies and associations. Consumers were selected at random and
          were asked to respond to a questionnaire. A detailed analysis of the responses (see Table 14) is provided for energy consumers from various subgroups mentioned
          above.

5. Communication Needs Assessment
   and Recommendations
This chapter presents deeper insights towards identification of communication needs and opportunities of
various groups and subgroups of the target audience based on the qualitative and quantitative responses
discussed in the previous chapter. Specific insights from the analysis of responses have been identified and
presented with relevant communication opportunities in Table 15: Communication Needs Assessment.

Communication needs assessment and recommendations




                                                       It is strongly recommended to ensure credibility of
                                                        communication. One of the most compelling and effective means
                                                        of achieving this is to ensure independence of communication
                                                        from biases related to vendors, suppliers, or territories.

                                                        Credibility plays an important role when it comes to conveying a
                                                        message effectively with the industrial sector.
 Credibility of communication
                                                        Given its fair share of technological failures and inappropriate
                                                        procurement choices, the industry finely scrutinizes incoming
                                                        messages for any hidden interests and linkages.

                                                        Word-of-mouth publicity plays an important role in making or
                                                        breaking an intervention in the industrial sector.

                                                       Industry leaders who have worked on EE messaging have often
                                                        highlighted the need to remove repetitiveness from
                                                        communication and to make it interesting for consumers.

                                                        The concept of EE, in spite of being an attractive proposition for
                                                        the industry, often gets omitted as a dry and technical subject

                                                        structure.

                                                        One of the ways to achieve this is to organize challenges or
                                                        quizzes with respect to assessing the existing knowledge levels
                                                        on EE, and clubbing EE with motivational lectures on
                                                        individuals’ aspirations.

                                                       Conveying messages among industrial stakeholders is required
                                                        at a number of hierarchical levels across the industrial spectrum.
                                                        At the same time, the message conveyed will be impactful only
                                                        when the right set of messages reaches the relevant strata within
                                                        organizations.
                                                       This being case, it is important for industrial bodies or
                                                        associations to develop and maintain a database of

                                                        the identification of relevant roles and responsibilities.
                                                       Establishing dedicated communication teams at key industry
                                                        bodies and apex sector-specific associations will also provide
                                                        avenues for regular communication in an effective messaging

                                                       Among mass media options, TV, radio, newspapers, mobile
                                                        messages, and the Internet have been identified as the most
                                                        frequented and trusted sources of information for decision
                                                        making.
                                                       Innovation and creativity, together with community
                                                        mobilization, can most effectively convey the educational
                                                        message and integrate the same with user’s lifestyle.


                                                       Use of innovation and creativity can help to identify highly
                                                        effective (communication-wise and cost-wise as well) points-of-

                                                       For example, PCRA planted IEC creatives for the rural audience
                                                        in between the hold-tunes of Kisan call centers (farmers’
                                                        helplines).
                                                       Similarly, PCRA roped in district and school-level
                                                        administration and state education boards for scaling up school
                                                        students’ outreach programs. This resulted in reaching out to
                                                        more than half a million students in comparison with 25,000 in
                                                        the previous year.

                                                       EESL roped in public relations offices of DISCOMS and
                                                        municipal corporations in the city-level campaign, thus
                                                        leveraging the familiarity and trust enjoyed by these
                                                        organizations among the end consumers.
                                                       Engaging stakeholders and building up their respective capacity
                                                        by making them voluntarily participate in EE implementation,
                                                        for example, crowdsourcing of communication messages,
                                                        adoption of villages by petroleum companies for conveying
                                                        conservation messages, and inclusion of para-teachers or
                                                        paramedics, for outreach activities.


                                                            One of the lessons from EESL’s IEC campaign is to develop
                                                             politically neutral messages—that is, endorsement of EE

                                                             but not from the political establishment (government).
                                                             Involvement of politically oriented individuals has resulted
 Credibility                                                 in impeding the communication roll-out in areas with

                                                       Touch and feel communication, which includes live
                                                        demonstrations, work best in conveying messages related to the
                                                        transformation from existing to a better or a more energy-

                                                       Highlighting the benefits is critical to effective communication.
                                                        Benefits need to be well researched to map the value perception
                                                        of the target audience.
 Benefits mapping                                       For example, the ease of ignition, fuel efficiency, and suitability
                                                        for cooking smaller meals were the important benefits that were
                                                        highlighted while communicating on efficient low-smoke
                                                        cooking stoves and were well-received by the end users.

                                                       In order to be effective, communication campaigns need to target
