CHAPTER 1




Background
The introduction of REDD+ in participating countries is likely to have a significant
impact on the dynamics of conflicts over forest resources, and on land, oil,
gas, minerals and other valuable resources in forested areas. The purpose of
this Guidance Note is to help countries strengthen their capacity for grievance
resolution in order to respond to contentious issues, complaints and disputes.

    What is a Grievance Redress
    Mechanism and what is its purpose?
    Definition: For purposes of this guidance note, GRMs                                       Purpose: GRMs act as recourse for situations in
    are defined as organizational systems and resources                                        which, despite proactive stakeholder engagement,
    established by national government agencies (or, as                                        some stakeholders have a concern about a project
    appropriate, by regional or municipal agencies) to                                         or program’s potential impacts on them. Not all

    these systems and procedures may be called                                                 or policies are normally referred to organizational

                                                                                               collaborative problem solving.
    GRMs are intended to be accessible, collaborative,
    expeditious, and effective in resolving concerns through                                   REDD+ countries are expected to establish or

    GRMs are intended to complement, not replace, formal                                       effective recourse for these stakeholders, it is essential
    legal channels for managing grievances (e.g., the                                          to design and implement the GRM in close consultation
    court system, organizational audit mechanisms, etc.).                                      with them.
    Stakeholders always have the option to use other,
    more formal alternatives, including legal remedies. It                                     International partners that are directly involved
    is important to emphasize that national GRMs are not                                       in REDD+ implementation should also be closely
    intended to replace the judiciary or other forms of legal                                  involved in GRM design and implementation. It may be
    recourse. The existence of a GRM should not prevent                                        appropriate, and in some cases necessary, for those

     GRMs may also offer adjudication or arbitration (meaning a judgment rendered by a neutral party to resolve a dispute). In GRMs, adjudication/arbitration is an option that

     the participating stakeholders may choose, rather than a process to which they must submit.

    CHAPTER 3



    What principles should guide
    the design of a GRM?
    Several guiding principles should drive the design of GRMs. GRMs designed according to these
    principles are more likely to provide effective resolution of stakeholder grievances.3


    a. 	Legitimate: enabling trust from the stakeholder                                              build confidence in its effectiveness and meet any
        groups for whose use they are intended, and                                                  public interest at stake. Providing transparency about
        being accountable for the fair conduct of grievance                                          the mechanism’s performance to wider stakeholders,
        processes. Accountability for ensuring that the parties                                      through statistics, case studies or more detailed
        to a grievance process cannot interfere with its fair                                        information about the handling of certain cases, can
        conduct is typically one important factor in building                                        be important to demonstrate its legitimacy and retain
        stakeholder trust.                                                                           broad trust. At the same time, confidentiality of the
                                                                                                     dialogue between parties and of individuals’ identities
    b. 	Accessible: being known to all stakeholder groups for                                        should be provided where necessary.
        whose use they are intended, and providing adequate
        assistance for those who may face particular barriers                                    f. 	Rights compatible: these processes are generally
        to access. Barriers to access may include a lack of                                          more successful when all parties agree that
        awareness of the mechanism, language, literacy, costs,                                       outcomes are consistent with applicable national
        physical location and fears of reprisal.                                                     and internationally recognized rights. Grievances are

    c. 	 Predictable: providing a clear and known procedure                                          not initially raise human rights or other rights concerns.
         with an indicative timeframe for each stage, and                                            Regardless, where outcomes have implications for
         clarity on the types of process and outcome available                                       rights, care should be taken that they are consistent
         and means of monitoring implementation. In order for                                        with applicable nationally and internationally
         a mechanism to be trusted and used, it should provide                                       recognized standards and that they do not restrict
         public information about the procedure it offers.                                           access to other redress mechanisms.

     Though developed initially as a guide for businesses with potential operational impacts on the rights of affected communities and other stakeholders, these Guiding Principles, and
     particularly the guidance on grievance mechanisms as a key component of remedy, are rapidly gaining global support among multilateral agencies as a basis for developing and
     refining their organizational grievance mechanisms. Likewise, though the Principles are not officially addressed to government agencies or NGOs, they provide a strong foundation
     for Governments in reviewing, developing and refining their GRMs.

     If a collaborative approach is possible, then GRM staff
     is usually responsible for overseeing it.5 GRM staff may
     directly facilitate the stakeholders’ work on the issues,
     contract with a consultant facilitator, or use traditional
     and local consultation and dispute resolution procedures
     and leaders/facilitators.

     If the engagement process produces agreement on
     actions to resolve the complaint, then the GRM staff
     is responsible for overseeing implementation of those
     actions. In a multi-stakeholder context, several actors
     may be involved in the solution. It is important for GRM
     staff and the stakeholders to monitor implementation
     jointly, and to “come back to the table” when needed to
     deal with challenges during implementation.

     6. Review the response if unsuccessful
     As noted above, in some cases it may not be possible to
     reach agreement with the complainant on the proposed
     response. In a multi-stakeholder dispute, an assessment
     process may lead to the conclusion that a collaborative
     approach is not feasible. When a collaborative approach
     is used, good faith efforts may not succeed in resolving
     key issues. In any of these situations, the GRM staff
                                                                                                   If the grievance has not been resolved, GRM staff
     should review the situation with the complainant, and
                                                                                                   should document steps taken, communication with

     The final step is to close out the grievance. If the response
     has been successful, the GRM staff should document the                                        Accurate case documentation using an electronic

GRM Evaluation Tool
Note to User: This is a checklist of questions that can be used to help evaluate an existing grievance redress mechanism.
The questions should be used to guide a discussion with the goal of identifying areas that are working well and areas that
need improvement.

                                                     Questions to Consider
                                                           Design Stage

    Why did you include a Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) in your project?
    Where/how did you locate the GRM?
    How did you determine it would be effective?
    Was the GRM designed with participation from the communities it is intended to serve?

                                                       Implementation Stage
    1. Organizational Commitment                   Do the project’s management and staff recognize and value the GRM
                                                   process as a means of improving public administration and enhancing
                                                   accountability and transparency?

                                                   Is grievance redress integrated into the project’s core activities?
                                                   Is grievance redress integrated into staff job descriptions and
                                                   responsibilities?
                                                   Is it appropriately resourced and monitored?

    2. Principles:
    2.1 Legitimacy                                 Does the GRM operate independently of interested parties?
                                                   Is the GRM widely-perceived as independent?

    2.2 Accessibility                              Is the GRM accessible to all stakeholders, irrespective of their
                                                   remoteness, language, education or income level?
                                                   Are procedures to file grievances and seek action easily understood by
                                                   project beneficiaries?
                                                   Can grievances be filed anonymously?
                                                   Are there a range of contact options?
                                                   Is the GRM appropriately advertised and communicated to project-
                                                   affected people?

    2.3 Predictability                             Is the GRM responsive to the needs of all complainants?
                                                   Does the GRM offer a clear procedure with time frames for each stage
                                                   and clarity on the types of results it can (and cannot) deliver?

    2.4 Fairness                                   Are grievances treated confidentially, assessed impartially, and handled
                                                   transparently?

    2.5 Rights Compatibility                       Are the GRM’s outcomes consistent with applicable national and
                                                   international standards?
                                                   Does it restrict access to other redress mechanisms?




                                                                                                                              19

        4.2 Sorting and processing               Do multiple uptake channels exist?

        4.3 Acknowledgement and follow-up        Are complaints acknowledged in writing?
                                                 Does the acknowledgement outline the GRM process, provide contact
                                                 details and indicate how long it is likely to take to resolve the grievance?
                                                 Are there clear timetables that are publicly available?

            action                               standards?
                                                 Are investigators neutral or do they have a stake in the outcome?
                                                 Is action taken on every grievance?

        4.5 Monitoring and Evaluation            Is there a process to track grievances and assess progress being made to
