Infrastructure Service Delivery
This component funds the reconstruction of infrastructure and services by providing resources to improve
local service delivery in a transparent and predictable manner within the context of a sound inter-govern-
mental fiscal framework. It provides predictable and transparent capital grants to the LAs through the coun-
try’s budget system in accordance with the GOSL’s guidelines for participatory planning. The use of country
systems to deliver aid is an integral part of the global aid effectiveness agenda. These grants cover infrastruc-
ture and services such as rural roads, drains, culverts and bridges, community buildings, markets and fairs,
waste disposal, rural water supply, parks, recreation facilities and libraries, nursery schools, playgrounds, and
dispensaries. The funds can also be used to improve local government utility services.

Institutionalizing Accountabilities
This component ensures that LAs undertake public expenditures and deliver local services in a transparent
and accountable manner. It strengthens upward and downward accountability systems at the local level.
Activities under this component include improving accountabilities by instituting sub committees, standing
committees and advisory committees to enable participation and oversight by stakeholders. It also includes
an education and communication campaign to disseminate project information to various stakeholders.
Preparation of participatory LA Development Plans that prioritize community development needs are an-
other feature.

Building Capacities
This component strengthens the service delivery systems and capacities of LAs to deliver services. It also
strengthens the monitoring capacities of provincial and national level institutions. It supports improvements
in systems and processes related to planning, budgeting, financial management, revenue management
and procurement at the LA level. It strengthens the audit of funds by improving the efficiency, timeliness and
follow up of the internal and external audits of LAs. The funds under this component support the training of
elected representatives and staff of LAs on financial management, procurement and project management.

Better and more effective technical support to LAs provided by the district local government staff is also
funded. Another important feature is the development of a long-term capacity building strategy for LAs
including the Organizational Development Unit (ODU) of local government departments. The project covers
all the Local Authorities in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka. The 79 LAs include 66 Pradeshiya
Sabhas, out of which 28 are located in the 5 districts of the Northern Province and 38 in the 3 districts of the
Eastern Province. In addition, it covers 9 Urban Councils – 5 in the North and 4 in the East and 4 Municipal
Councils namely Jaffna, Kalmunai, and the newly created Akkaraipattu and Batticaloa. NELSIP will result
in an increase in the quantity and quality of public goods delivered and maintained by Local Authorities.
Improved infrastructure connectivity will enable post-conflict communities in the north-east to benefit from
enhanced access to social services and economic opportunities. The capacity of Local Authorities to deliver
services will also be strengthened. Through these steps the project will help reduce poverty in the project
implementation areas.
