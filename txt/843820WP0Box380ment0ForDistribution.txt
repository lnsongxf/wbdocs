1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington, DC 20433




This report was developed by the Financial and Private Sector Development (FPD)
Network – Investment Climate Global Practice Private Participation in Infrastructure and
Social Sector Service Line, and the World Bank Institute (WBI). It presents practical
advice to Task Team Leaders/Project Leaders/Transaction Leaders in the World Bank
Group on how to implement a framework for managing ﬁscal commitments from Public-
Private Partnerships (PPPs) and draws on speciﬁc regional operational experience and
on WBI’s wider thematic engagement with different partners worldwide.

The note explains the kind of ﬁscal commitments that can arise from PPP projects
and why governments may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to assess and manage them. It provides
guidance on how to: consistently identify and assess ﬁscal commitments during project
preparation and implementation; incorporate these into the project approval process—
including budgeting appropriately; and strengthen the monitoring and reporting of
ﬁscal commitments over the lifetime of the project. The note further highlights the key
components of an institutional framework including the roles, responsibilities, and
processes for managing these ﬁscal obligations.
